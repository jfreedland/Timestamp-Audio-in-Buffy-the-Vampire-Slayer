2
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:34,042
- Mom?
- Buffy.

3
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:39,756
- Sorry.
- No, no. Don't worry about it.

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,302
I guess I just got used
to all the quiet while you were gone.

5
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:47,430
But it's no problem. Look.

6
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:52,185
It's Nigerian. We got a very exciting
shipment in at the galley.

7
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:56,523
I thought I'd hang a few pieces in here.
It cheers up the room.

8
00:00:57,107 --> 00:01:00,610
It's angry at the room, Mom.
It wants the room to suffer.

9
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:04,239
You have no appreciation of primitive art.

10
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,701
You going out?

11
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:13,331
Well, if it's OK.

12
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:20,130
- I'd like to find Willow and Xander.
- Will you be slaying?

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,757
Only if they give me lip.

14
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:25,635
Can I make you a sandwich before you go?
You must be starving.

15
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:30,640
I was until that four-course snack
you served me after dinner.

16
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,727
Well, then... You know, why don't I drive you?

17
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:37,105
- You know, I mean, they could be anywhere.
- Mom...

18
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:40,275
- If you don't want me to go,just say so.
- No, no.

19
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:45,196
I just wanna put this whole thing
behind us, get back to normal.

20
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,116
You go. Have a good time.

21
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:50,869
OK.

22
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:37,290
Didn't anyone warn you
about playing with pointy sticks?

23
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:40,251
It's all fun and games
until somebody loses an eye.

24
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,546
You shouldn't sneak up on people like that.

25
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,634
Jeez, Buff.

26
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:59,187
- Nighthawk! Everything OK?
- Nighthawk?

27
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:28,299
Hey, Buffy.

28
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:42,063
Hey, guys.

29
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,253
You know, maybe it's too late.
Maybe we should just come back tomorrow.

30
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:52,133
What if he's mad?

31
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:56,012
Mad? Because you ran away and abandoned
your post, your friends and your mom

32
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:59,474
and made him lay awake
every night worrying about ya?

33
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,060
Maybe we should wait out here.

34
00:05:19,244 --> 00:05:21,871
Check it out. The Watcher's
back on the clock.

35
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:27,335
Just when you were thinking career change,
maybe becoming a looker or a seer.

36
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:29,379
Thank you, Xander.

37
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:33,591
Welcome home, Buffy.

38
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,055
I got in a few hours ago,
but I wanted to go see my mom first.

39
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:41,766
Yes. Yes, of course. How did you find her?

40
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,978
Well, I pretty much remembered the address.

41
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,023
I mean...

42
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:50,567
How are things between you?

43
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,194
Excuse me.

44
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,156
So you're not wanted for murder any more.

45
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,366
Good. That was such a drag.

46
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,872
- Where were you? Did you go to Belgium?
- Why would I go to Belgium?

47
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:07,667
I think the relevant question
is why wouldn't ya?

48
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:09,878
Belgium.

49
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,841
- What's up with you, Xander?
- You know, same old, same old.

50
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:17,302
- Hardly.
- OK, I lied. A whole lot is new.

51
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:23,099
- Well, that's good, isn't it? New is good.
- Absolutely. Except for the obvious.

52
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:26,269
Yeah, cos you weren't in hell.

53
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:28,938
Cordelia went on a luxury vacation.

54
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:31,858
- I feel for you.
- Here we are then.

55
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,903
Chow's up.

56
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,531
So were you, like, living in a box, or what?

57
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,950
Well, it's a long story.

58
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:45,413
So skip the heart-warming stuff about
kindly old people and get right to the dirt.

59
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:51,336
Perhaps Buffy could use a little time to adjust
before we grill her on her summer activities.

60
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:54,089
- What he said.
- Fair enough.

61
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:57,384
Leave the slaying to us while you settle in.
We got you covered.

62
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:02,430
I noticed. You guys seem down with the
slayage. With your walkies and everything.

63
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:06,893
Yeah, but the outfits suck.
This whole Rambo thing is so over.

64
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:10,438
I'm thinking more sporty, like Hilfiger maybe.

65
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,733
Still, we were getting good.
We dusted nine out of ten.

66
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,235
- Six out of ten.
- Six out of ten.

67
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,779
Whatever, we were kicking undead booty.

68
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:21,658
Thank you for the offer, but I think
I wanna get back to my normal routine.

69
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,953
You know, school, slaying. Kids' stuff.

70
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:29,749
In fact, I'm jonesing for a little brainless fun.
What are you doing tomorrow?

71
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,586
I would, but I'm kinda tied up.

72
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,506
You wish.

73
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:39,217
- Will?
- Tomorrow, I...

74
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:42,387
Come on. Friends don't let
friends browse alone.

75
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:46,808
OK. I had some schoolwork,
but I can change my plans.

76
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:51,896
As for school, Buffy, you know you'll have
to talk to Principal Snyder before...

77
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:55,775
On it. Mom is making
an appointment with His Ugliness.

78
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,862
I know she can break him.

79
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:01,698
Absolutely not. Under no circumstances.

80
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:06,036
But you can't keep her out of school.
You don't have the right.

81
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:10,540
I have not only the right, but also
a nearly physical sensation of pleasure

82
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,544
at the thought of keeping her
out of school. I'd say I'm tingly.

83
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:17,380
Buffy was cleared of all those charges.

84
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:22,469
Yes. And while she may live up to the
not-a-murderer requirement for enrolment,

85
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:27,098
she is a troublemaker, destructive to school
property and the occasional student.

86
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:30,769
And her grade-point average is enough to...

87
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:34,898
I'm sorry. Another tingle moment.

88
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:38,068
How can you be so cavalier
about a young girl's entire future?

89
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:43,615
I'm quite sure that a girl with the talents
and abilities of Buffy will land on her feet.

90
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:47,452
In fact, I noticed as I came in this morning

91
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:50,246
that Hot Dog on a Stick is hiring.

92
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,375
You will look so cute in that hat.

93
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,502
Let's go, Mom.

94
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:02,509
This isn't over. If I have to,
I'll go all the way to the Mayor.

95
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:06,930
Wouldn't that be interesting?

96
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,563
Don't worry about school, honey.

97
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:19,067
If we can't get you back into Sunnydale,
maybe we can swing private school.

98
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:22,529
Private school?
You mean, like, jackets and kilts?

99
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,865
- You want me to get field-hockey knees?
- It's not that bad.

100
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,203
What about home schooling? It's not just
for scary religious people any more.

101
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,790
We'll work something out. OK?

102
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,419
Say hi to Willow?

103
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:21,254
My word. You must be Buffy.

104
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,632
Look at you. Aren't you a picture?

105
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:29,095
- Thank you.
- I'm Pat. From your mom's book club.

106
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,890
- I'm sure she mentioned me.
- Actually...

107
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:35,560
I sort of took it upon myself
to look after her while you were,

108
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:38,563
you know, off and away
or what have you, and...

109
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:43,985
Well, between your situation and reading
Deep End of the Ocean, she was...

110
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,614
she was just a wreck. You can imagine.

111
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:52,118
Anyway, I'm off. We're making
empanadas in my Spanish class tonight.

112
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,580
You go be with your mom.
You two need to rebond.

113
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,589
Pat wishes us quality time.

114
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,175
- I met her in a...
- Book club.

115
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,762
- Got it.
- Before I forget, Willow just called.

116
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:14,599
- Where was she?
- She got held up.

117
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,976
But she said she tried to call.

118
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:20,480
- Was there a message?
- No.

119
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,485
But I had a thought.

120
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,823
What if I invited Willow and Mr Giles and
everybody over for dinner tomorrow night?

121
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:33,201
Don't you think that would be nice?

122
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:37,414
Since I sort of already did,
I was hoping for ayes.

123
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,003
- That'll be fun.
- Great.

124
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,216
Do me a favour?
Run down and get the company plates.

125
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:52,220
Mom... Willow and everybody
aren't company-plate people.

126
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,182
- They're normal-plate people.
- We never have guests for dinner.

127
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:58,727
Indulge your mother?

128
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:39,142
Next time, I get to pick
the mother-daughter bonding activity.

129
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,276
- Do you wanna say something?
- Like what?

130
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,071
Thanks for stopping by and dying?

131
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:56,076
How about: goodbye, stray cat
who lost its way. We hope you find it.

132
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,743
- I thought they'd be here.
- They are.

133
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,329
They're waiting for you.

134
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:08,375
Am I dreaming?

135
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,752
I'm probably the wrong person to ask.

136
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:14,589
You'd better go.

137
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm afraid.

138
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,845
You should be.

139
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:44,035
I've been on the phone with
the superintendent of schools.

140
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,790
At least he seems more reasonable than that
nasty little, horrid, bigoted rodent-man.

141
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,958
Mom.

142
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,586
Anyway, I'm going in
to speak with him this afternoon.

143
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:57,507
As for private schools,
Miss Porter's accepts late admissions.

144
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:02,470
- I wrote the information down for you.
- A girls' school?

145
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:07,559
So now it's jackets, kilts and no boys?
Care to throw in a little foot-binding?

146
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,065
Buffy, you made some bad choices. You just
might have to live with some consequences.

147
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,655
Nothing's settled yet.

148
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:25,118
I just wish you didn't have to be so secretive.

149
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:28,913
It's not your fault you have a special
circumstance. They should make allowances.

150
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:33,376
Mom, I'm a slayer. It's not like
I need to ride a little bus to school.

151
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,256
Couldn't you just tell a few people, like
Principal Snyder and maybe the police?

152
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,678
I mean, I would think they would be
happy to have a superhero.

153
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:48,475
Is that the right term?
It's not offensive, is it?

154
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:57,650
Welcome to the Hellmouth Petting Zoo.

155
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:06,117
My God, what a stench.

156
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:11,539
You know, I wanted Forest Pine
or April Fresh, but Mom wanted Dead Cat.

157
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,000
Well...

158
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:20,799
I'll get it back to the library,
see if we can determine its exact origin.

159
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:28,556
It's striking and... Nigerian.

160
00:17:29,057 --> 00:17:33,061
Yes. I have this wonderful dealer
who specialises in ancient artefacts...

161
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:37,816
I love art talk as much as the next very dull
person, but we have work to do, Giles.

162
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:41,778
- Research mode.
- Shouldn't you stay with your mother?

163
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,281
- You must have...
- Please, no. It's fine. She can go with you.

164
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,159
Actually, she can't.

165
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:52,580
You're not allowed on school property.

166
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:54,666
I'm sorry.

167
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:59,963
I'll call as soon as I know something.

168
00:18:00,964 --> 00:18:03,925
- We'll see you tonight.
- Tonight, then.

169
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:13,101
It looks dead. It smells dead.

170
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:18,440
Yet it's movin' around. That's interesting.

171
00:18:19,107 --> 00:18:22,402
Nice pet, Giles.
Don't you like anything regular?

172
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:25,113
Golf, USA today, or anything?

173
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:30,785
I'm tying to find out how and why it rose
from the grave. I'm not about to take it home.

174
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,873
Well, I like it. I think
you should call it Patches.

175
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:40,170
What about Buffy's dinner tonight?
I told her mom we'd help out. Bring stuff.

176
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,839
I'm the dip.

177
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,926
You gotta admire the purity of it.

178
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,304
What? Onion dip.

179
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:52,766
Stirring, not cooking. It's what I bring.

180
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:57,562
We should figure out what kinda deal this is.
I mean, is it a gathering, a shindig,

181
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:00,774
- or a hootenanny?
- What's the difference?

182
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:04,402
Well, a gathering is brie,
mellow song stylings,

183
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:09,491
shindig, dip, less mellow song stylings,
perhaps a large amount of malt beverage,

184
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:13,995
and hootenanny, well, it's chock-full
of hoot, just a little bit of nanny.

185
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:17,707
- Well, I hate brie.
- I know. It smells like Giles's cat.

186
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,378
- It's not my...
- And what'll we talk about at a gathering?

187
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,089
"Did you meet any nice pimps
on your travels?" and

188
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,676
"Thanks for ruining our lives
for the past three months."

189
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:30,095
- Xander.
- You know what I mean.

190
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:34,641
She doesn't wanna talk about it, we don't,
so why don't we just shut up and dance?

191
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:39,354
Well, Buffy said she did wanna loosen up,
you know, have some kid time.

192
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,524
Aren't you rehearsing tonight?
Why not play at the party?

193
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:47,028
- I think I could supply some Dingo action.
- I'm not sure that a...

194
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:49,781
- shindig...
- Hootenanny.

195
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:52,951
Hootenanny is really the order of the day.

196
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:57,205
Maybe something a little more intimate.
Buffy has just got home.

197
00:19:57,956 --> 00:20:00,834
I'm sure she's still feeling a little disoriented.

198
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:05,463
All the more reason to make her feel
welcome. A big party says "Welcome, Buffy".

199
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,883
OK, so one vote from the old guy
for a smelly cheese night

200
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:11,678
and how many votes for actual fun?

201
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:16,474
All right, all right. Have it your way.

202
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,853
I'm just glad to have her home.

203
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:22,063
Now things can get back to normal.

204
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:51,343
There you are. Not thinking about
any more flights of fancy, I hope.

205
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:56,848
Joyce said there was room for one more,
so I said forget facial night and let's party.

206
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:59,517
I bet you like empanadas.

207
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,941
Do you wanna see my mom? Mom!

208
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,446
Pat. Good.

209
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:13,490
- Buffy, I hope you don't mind.
- Hi.

210
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,035
Great.

211
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:20,163
Hey, Buffy. Where do you want
the band to set up?

212
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,707
The band?

213
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,692
- Hey.
- Hey.

214
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,279
- This is large.
- You like?

215
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,449
Yeah. It's great.

216
00:21:57,742 --> 00:22:00,495
I was just sort of hoping it would be... us.

217
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,331
Sorry. What?

218
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:09,587
This is amazing but I was sort of hoping
we could just hang together - the gang.

219
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:49,461
Is everything OK?

220
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:54,883
You you seem to be avoiding me,
in the one-on-one sense.

221
00:22:55,925 --> 00:23:00,347
What? This isn't avoiding.
See? Here you are, here I am.

222
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:03,391
- So we're cool?
- Way.

223
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:07,437
That's why, with the party,
cos we're all glad you're back.

224
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,733
- OK.
- OK. Good.

225
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,238
Hey, Buff. What are you doing?

226
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:01,866
I was just taking a break
from all this wacky fun.

227
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:06,329
Some kind of party, huh? I guess a lot
of people are glad to have you back.

228
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:10,166
It seems like people
I didn't even know missed me.

229
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:15,213
- Did Giles say he was gonna be late?
- He was Library Man last time I saw him.

230
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:19,050
He'll be here. He wants to celebrate
your homecoming. We all do.

231
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,928
It's great to have the Buffster back.

232
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:24,889
- Isn't it?
- Totally.

233
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:29,519
Except you were kinda turning me on
with that whole Boy Slayer look.

234
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,897
- Was I now?
- You bet, Nighthawk.

235
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,199
Well, I'll just be... Yeah.

236
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:52,250
Breathe.

237
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:56,004
Breathe.

238
00:24:57,297 --> 00:25:01,718
All right, look, these burns are too extensive.
It's 1:43. Let's call it.

239
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,644
Oh, my God!

240
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:23,656
- What's the deal with this party anyway?
- This party?

241
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:27,494
Heard it was for some chick
that just got outta rehab.

242
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:48,306
Now, how are you holding up, Joyce? Really.

243
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:51,768
Really? I'm...

244
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:56,731
I don't know. While Buffy was gone,
all I could think about was getting her home.

245
00:25:57,357 --> 00:26:01,986
I just knew that if I could put my arms around
her and tell her I loved her, it would be OK.

246
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:05,198
- But?
- Having Buffy home,

247
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:10,453
I thought it was gonna make it all better
but, in some ways, it's almost worse.

248
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,603
Oh, Lord.

249
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:58,520
Party Villa, can I rock you?

250
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:03,775
I need to speak with Buffy. Immediately. I
have information that is extremely important.

251
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:09,531
Yeah. Fiesta foul. You gotta do a shot.

252
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:13,243
I need to speak to Buffy. Now!

253
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:15,412
Bunny?

254
00:28:16,705 --> 00:28:19,207
- That guy's gotta do a shot.
- Buffy!

255
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:21,251
Hey. I need to talk to a Buddy.

256
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:24,796
Is there a Buddy here?

257
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,759
Sorry. He's not here.
You got the wrong house, Mr Belvedere.

258
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:33,013
Hello? Hello.

259
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:55,452
You're leaving again?

260
00:28:56,745 --> 00:28:59,789
You just stopped by for your lint brush
and now you're ready to go?

261
00:28:59,873 --> 00:29:03,376
- It's not like anyone'll mind.
- No. Have a great time.

262
00:29:04,252 --> 00:29:07,547
- And don't forget to not write.
- Why are you attacking me?

263
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:12,093
- I'm tying.
- And it looks so much like giving up.

264
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:14,971
- I'm just trying to make things easier.
- For who?

265
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:18,975
- You guys were doing fine without me.
- We were doing the best we could.

266
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:21,436
It's not like we had a lot of choice.

267
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,899
Sorry that I had to leave, but you
don't know what I was going through.

268
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:29,986
- Well, I'd like to.
- You wouldn't understand.

269
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,783
Well, maybe I don't need to understand.

270
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:37,994
Maybe I just need you to talk to me.

271
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:40,872
How could I when you were avoiding me?

272
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:42,999
This isn't easy, Buffy.

273
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:47,504
I know you're going through stuff,
but so am I.

274
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:52,717
- I know you were worried about me but...
- No. I don't just mean that.

275
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:56,012
I mean, my life.

276
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:59,057
You know? I'm having all sorts of...

277
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:04,312
I'm dating. I am having
serious dating with a werewolf,

278
00:30:04,938 --> 00:30:08,692
and I'm studying witchcraft
and killing vampires,

279
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:11,569
and I didn't have anyone to talk to

280
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:15,365
about all this scary life stuff.

281
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:20,286
And you were my best friend.

282
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:28,128
Unbelievable. "Do you like my mask?"

283
00:30:28,837 --> 00:30:31,214
"Isn't it pretty? It raises the dead."

284
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,883
Americans.

285
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:37,887
Jesus!

286
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:43,184
My God.

287
00:30:43,852 --> 00:30:45,687
Are you all right?

288
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:48,189
Are you hurt?

289
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:53,403
God.

290
00:31:00,118 --> 00:31:02,370
You have no idea how much I missed you.

291
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,248
Everyone.

292
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:09,252
- I wanted to call every day.
- That doesn't matter, Buffy.

293
00:31:09,502 --> 00:31:13,089
- It doesn't make it OK that you didn't.
- What is this?

294
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:16,968
Is this some sort of a joke?

295
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:20,597
- Mom, please, could you just...
- No, I can't just.

296
00:31:20,764 --> 00:31:23,683
- Buffy, what is this?
- She was running away again.

297
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:26,353
No, I wasn't.

298
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:31,358
- I'm not sure.
- You better get sure and explain yourself.

299
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:34,527
If you think you can take off
anytime you feel li...

300
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:36,363
Stop it. Please.

301
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:40,533
I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing.

302
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,335
Don't you leave this house, young lady.
You know what? That's it.

303
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,214
- You and I are gonna have a talk.
- Mom, please...

304
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:57,801
You know what? I don't care.
I don't care what your friends think,

305
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:01,680
or you, for that matter, because you
put me through the wringer. I mean it.

306
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:06,017
And I've had schnapps.
Do you have any idea what it's been like?

307
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:10,563
- Mom, this isn't the t...
- You can't imagine months of not knowing.

308
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:16,111
Not knowing whether you're lying dead
in a ditch somewhere or living it up.

309
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,115
But you told me.
You're the one who said I should go.

310
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:23,410
You said if I leave, don't come back.
You found out who I really was

311
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:25,787
and you couldn't deal. Remember?

312
00:32:26,454 --> 00:32:28,540
Buffy, you didn't give me time.

313
00:32:28,957 --> 00:32:31,084
You dumped it on me
and expected me to get it.

314
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:34,504
Well, guess what? Mom's not perfect,
OK? I handled it badly.

315
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:37,674
But that doesn't give you the right
to punish me by running away.

316
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:41,469
- I didn't do this to punish you.
- Well, you did.

317
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:44,848
- You didn't see what you put her through.
- Great. Thanks.

318
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:48,893
Anybody else wanna weigh in here?
How about you by the dip?

319
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:51,646
No, thanks. I'm good.

320
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:57,110
Maybe you don't wanna hear it, Buffy, but
taking off was incredibly selfish and stupid.

321
00:32:57,736 --> 00:33:01,322
OK. I screwed up. I know this.
But you have no idea!

322
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:06,036
You have no idea what happened
to me or what I was feeling.

323
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:10,040
- Did you even try talking to anybody?
- There was nothing anybody could do. OK?

324
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:14,627
- I just had to deal with this on my own.
- Yeah, see how well that one worked out.

325
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:17,839
You can't just buy stuff.
It'll come back up to get ya.

326
00:33:40,028 --> 00:33:42,238
Good show, Giles.

327
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:58,505
Like riding a bloody bicycle.

328
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:09,516
As if I could've gone to you. Your feelings
about Angel and I were perfectly clear.

329
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:12,727
Look. I'm sorry that your honey was a demon,

330
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:15,939
but most girls don't hop
a Greyhound over boy troubles.

331
00:34:16,314 --> 00:34:20,193
Time out, Xander. Put yourself
in Buffy's shoes for just a minute. OK?

332
00:34:20,694 --> 00:34:25,573
I'm Buffy, freak of nature, right?
Naturally I pick a freak for a boyfriend,

333
00:34:26,324 --> 00:34:28,827
and then he turns into
Mr Killing Spree, which is...

334
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:33,331
- Cordy. Get outta my shoes.
- I'm just trying to help, Buffy.

335
00:34:34,457 --> 00:34:36,918
- Buffy, you never...
- Willow, please.

336
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:41,756
- I can't take this from you, too.
- Let her finish. You at least owe her that.

337
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:45,844
God, Xander. Could you at least stick
to annoying me on your own behalf?

338
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:50,015
Fine. You stop acting like an idiot,
I'll stop annoying you.

339
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,603
You wanna talk acting
like an idiot? Nighthawk?

340
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:58,148
OK. I'm gonna step in now.
Being Referee Guy.

341
00:34:58,857 --> 00:35:01,651
No, let 'em go, Oz.
Talking about it isn't helping.

342
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:04,112
We might as well try some violence.

343
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,200
I was being sarcastic.

344
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:22,088
- Xander, kitchen.
- Got your back.

345
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,064
- Are these vampires?
- I don't think so.

346
00:35:39,522 --> 00:35:41,358
Buffy, heads up!

347
00:35:43,902 --> 00:35:46,029
No, not vampires.

348
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:03,672
Man, this sucker wobbles,
but he won't fall down.

349
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:06,925
- We gotta get 'em back outside.
- On three.

350
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,052
One... two... three.

351
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:17,352
OK. We're gonna have to barricade this door.
We need some help out here!

352
00:36:17,686 --> 00:36:19,771
I got him. Go help Buffy.

353
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:35,787
Pat! Careful.

354
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:39,541
Hurry.

355
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:51,428
Go!

356
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:00,353
She's... Oh, God! Pat!

357
00:37:00,854 --> 00:37:02,689
She's dead.

358
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:12,741
- What do we do if they get in?
- I kind of think we die.

359
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:23,918
I don't hear anything. Should we check?

360
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:26,713
Let's go for it.

361
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:36,890
- Here.
- Thanks.

362
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:44,481
- It's me.
- How do we know you're not Zombie Giles?

363
00:37:44,522 --> 00:37:47,275
- Cordelia, do stop being tiresome.
- It's him.

364
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:51,780
I think the Dead Man's Party's
moved upstairs.

365
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:56,034
That makes sense. It's the mask
in Joyce's bedroom they're after.

366
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,453
Mask?

367
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:04,417
The mask holds the power of
a zombie demon, called Ovu Moboni.

368
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:07,170
Evil Eye.

369
00:38:07,671 --> 00:38:11,675
- I don't think we can get past them.
- Well, what happens if they get the mask?

370
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,178
If one of them puts it on,
they become the demon incarnate.

371
00:38:15,804 --> 00:38:17,722
Worse than a zombie.

372
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:20,141
Yes, worse.

373
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:35,365
Oh, God! We thought you were...

374
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:49,963
Generally speaking, when scary things
get scared, not good.

375
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,259
I live. You die.

376
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:06,438
Willow, don't look.

377
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:25,040
Out back!

378
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:28,168
Not looking. Not looking!

379
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:41,765
Tell Buffy, Moboni's power lies in his eyes.

380
00:39:44,642 --> 00:39:46,603
She has to go for the eyes to defeat him!

381
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:54,527
Buffy!

382
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:58,406
Hey, Pat!

383
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:03,370
Made you look.

384
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:16,758
Never mind.

385
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:24,641
Honey!

386
00:40:25,934 --> 00:40:28,311
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

387
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:32,816
So, is this a typical day at the office?

388
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:36,319
No. This was nothing.

389
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:46,162
Nice moves.

390
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:48,415
You, too.

391
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,975
- Do we have an appointment?
- I'd like to have a word with you.

392
00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:12,772
If that word is Buffy, then I have
two words for you: "good" and "riddance".

393
00:41:13,314 --> 00:41:16,151
Now, if you don't mind,
I have an appointment with the Mayor.

394
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:20,864
- You can't keep her out of this school.
- I think you'll find I can.

395
00:41:21,448 --> 00:41:24,909
- You had no grounds for expelling her.
- I have grounds, precedent

396
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:27,370
and a tingly kind of feeling.

397
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:30,749
Buffy Summers is a minor,
and is entitled to a public education.

398
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:34,794
Your personal dislike of the girl
does not legally entitle you to...

399
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:37,797
Why don't you take it up
with the city council?

400
00:41:38,965 --> 00:41:41,885
I thought I'd start with
the state supreme court.

401
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:45,555
You're powerful in local circles,

402
00:41:45,847 --> 00:41:49,726
but I believe I can make life very difficult
for you, professionally speaking.

403
00:41:50,852 --> 00:41:53,313
And Buffy will be allowed back in.

404
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:56,066
Sorry. I'm not convinced.

405
00:41:59,611 --> 00:42:01,988
Would you like me to convince you?

406
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,247
I mean, I'm not a full-fledged witch.
That takes years.

407
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:16,461
I just did a couple of pagan blessings and...
a teeny glamour to hide a zit.

408
00:42:17,504 --> 00:42:19,881
- Does it scare you?
- It has.

409
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:24,761
I tried to communicate with the spirit world,
and I so wasn't ready for that.

410
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:28,515
It's like being pulled apart inside.

411
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:32,602
Plus I blew the power
for our whole block. Big scare.

412
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:37,273
- I wish I could've been there with you.
- Me, too. I really freaked out.

413
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:40,819
- I am sorry.
- It's OK.

414
00:42:41,277 --> 00:42:44,447
I understand you having to bail.
I can forgive that.

415
00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:50,286
I have to make allowances for what you're
going through and be a grown-up about it.

416
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:55,083
You're really enjoying this moral
superiority thing, aren't you?

417
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:59,087
- It's like a drug.
- Fine. OK. I'm the bad.

418
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,840
I can take my lumps... for a while.

419
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:05,260
All right. I'll stop giving you a hard time.

420
00:43:05,677 --> 00:43:07,846
- Runaway.
- Will.

421
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:10,098
I'm sorry. Quitter.

422
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:13,935
- Whiner.
- Bailer.

423
00:43:14,436 --> 00:43:16,271
- Harpy.
- Delinquent.

424
00:43:16,312 --> 00:43:18,732
- Tramp.
- Bad seed.

425
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:21,735
- Witch.
- Freak.
