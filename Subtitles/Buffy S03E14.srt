1
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:05,903
So, what, you're
telling me never?

2
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:08,205
Faith, really,
now is not the time.

3
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:10,336
I'm curious. Never ever?

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:14,948
Come on, really.

5
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:18,282
All this time,
and not even once?

6
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:20,254
How many times
do I have to say it?

7
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:22,984
I have never...
done it...

8
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:25,253
with Xander!

9
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:26,760
He's just a friend.

10
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:32,696
So? What are friends for?

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,565
I mean, I'm sorry,
it's just,

12
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:36,832
all this sweating-nightly,
side-by-side action,

13
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:39,932
and you never put in
for a little after-hours... [Grunts]

14
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,408
Thanks for the poetry.

15
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:43,877
And, no. I love Xander.

16
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:46,540
I just don't...
love Xander.

17
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:49,015
Besides, I think it ruins
friendships to do that stuff.

18
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,016
You think too much.

19
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:53,282
Hey... there's one more.

20
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:54,947
How do you know?

21
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:56,685
I think too much.

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,289
OK. Count of 3...

23
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:04,798
1...

24
00:01:07,202 --> 00:01:08,134
3.

25

26
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:35,190
Nicely diverted, B.

27
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:37,630
Diverted? That was me
fighting for my life,

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,962
Miss Attention Span.

29
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:41,798
This isn't a Tupperware party.
It's a little hard to plan.

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,805
The count of 3 isn't a plan.
It's Sesame Street.

31
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:46,841
Hey, they're toast
and we're here,

32
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,501
so it couldn't have
been too bad, right?

33
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:50,340
Who were those guys,
anyways?

34
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:51,845
I don't know.

35
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:53,245
They didn't seem local.

36
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:54,942
Look, why don't
we grab the weapons.

37
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:55,949
Maybe Giles...

38
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:01,221
Mr. Trick:
Check these out.

39
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,384
[Giggling]

40
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,655
I just love
The Family Circus.

41
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,892
That P.J., he's getting
to be quite a handful.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,725
Well...

43
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:16,293
I haven't seen
anything like this in, uh,

44
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:18,306
well, a good long while.

45
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:21,707
Where is the owner
of these fine implements?

46
00:02:21,777 --> 00:02:23,574
The common term
is "slain."

47
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,704
But I've been seeing
this breed around.

48
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:27,806
Are we expecting
any trouble?

49
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:28,975
Do you like Family Circus?

50
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:30,746
I like Marmaduke.

51
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,548
Oh! Eww!

52
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:34,555
He's always on the furniture.
Unsanitary.

53
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:37,820
Nobody can tell Marmaduke what to do.
That's my kinda dog.

54
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:40,327
I like to read Cathy.

55
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:45,859
So, uh, what about
these swords?

56
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:47,993
What should we do
about that?

57
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,367
Well, let's just
keep an eye out.

58
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:51,167
We've got the dedication
coming up in a few days.

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,765
We certainly can't have anything
interfering with that.

60
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:58,506
Well, maybe we should
postpone the...

61
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,605
the... the dedication.

62
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:04,243
I believe the honorable mayor
hates that idea.

63
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:09,617
The dedication...

64
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:13,388
is the final step
before my ascension.

65
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:17,091
I have waited longer
than you can imagine for this.

66
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:21,535
After the hundred days,
I'll be on a higher plane.

67
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:25,505
And I'll have
no more need for...

68
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:29,840
Well, let's just say
I won't be concerned...

69
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:31,345
with the little things.

70
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,779
Mr. Trick,
watch these people.

71
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:37,716
Anything you
find out about them,

72
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:41,119
well, let's just see that
that information reaches the slayers.

73
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,317
Who knows? With any luck,
they'll kill each other.

74
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:44,689
Then everyone's a winner.

75
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:47,557
Everyone, of course...

76
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:48,891
meaning me.

77
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,808
- Willow, what are these?
- They're early admission packets.

78
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,905
Harvard...

79
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:54,041
Yale...

80
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:56,382
Wesleyan...

81
00:04:56,453 --> 00:05:00,287
some German polytechnical
institute whose name I, uh,

82
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:01,790
I can't pronounce.

83
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,520
Is anyone else
intimidated?

84
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,186
Because I'm just expecting
thin slips of paper

85
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,856
with the words "No way"
written in crayon.

86
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,957
They're typing
those now.

87
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:11,626
I'm so overwhelmed.

88
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:14,694
I... I got in!
To actual colleges!

89
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,933
A-And they're wooing me!

90
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:18,201
They're pitching woo!

91
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:19,833
The wooing stage
is always fun.

92
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,071
Ahh. But it's weird.

93
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:26,446
Rejection I can handle 'cause
of the years of training, but this...

94
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:27,950
I feel your pain, Wil.

95
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:30,213
Like right now, I'm torn between
the fast-growing fields

96
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,517
of appliance repair
and motel management.

97
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,492
Of course, I'm still waiting to hear
back from the Corndog Emporium, so...

98
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,494
Well,
I think it's great.

99
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:39,529
Early admission.

100
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:41,497
Now there's nothing
standing between you

101
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:42,827
and a brilliant
future.

102
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,300
Well, if I may suggest,
graduate.

103
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:48,702
Getting left back,
it's not the thrill ride you'd expect.

104
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:51,832
That's so cute.
Planning life as a loser?

105
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,036
Most people just
turn out that way,

106
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:55,908
but you're really
taking charge.

107
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,312
The comedy stylings of
Miss Cordelia Chase, everyone.

108
00:05:58,382 --> 00:06:00,816
Who, incidentally, won't be
needing a higher education

109
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:04,048
when she markets her own
very successful line of hooker wear.

110
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:07,056
Well, Xander,
I could dress more like you,

111
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:09,649
but, oh,
my father has a job.

112
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,053
I'm not gonna waste
the perfect comeback on you now.

113
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,621
But don't think
I don't have it.

114
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,190
Oh, yes,
its time will come!

115
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:20,703
So, life beyond
high school.

116
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:23,171
Anyone, please...

117
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,537
chime in.

118
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:25,802
I hear it's nice.

119
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:27,707
And a place
I'll never go

120
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:29,939
if I don't pass Mrs. Taggart's
chemistry test tomorrow.

121
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,504
Oh, I can help.

122
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:34,881
Chemistry's easy. It's a lot like
witchcraft, only less newt.

123
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:37,853
So what do you say... study jam?
My house? Tonight?

124
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:38,854
I'm there.

125
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:39,855
[Bell Rings]

126
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:42,358
Oh. I have to go
see Giles,

127
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:44,894
report on last night's
patrol.

128
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:47,123
Oh, yeah. He said he wanted
to talk to you.

129
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,188
What about? Is he OK?

130
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,530
He's looked better.

131
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:52,863
Of course,
training procedures

132
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,269
have been updated quite a bit
since your day.

133
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,899
Much greater emphasis
on field work.

134
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:58,907
Really?

135
00:06:58,976 --> 00:06:59,908
Oh, yes.

136
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:04,277
Not all books
and theory nowadays.

137
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:07,613
I have, in fact,
faced 2 vampires myself.

138
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:10,017
Under controlled circumstances,
of course.

139
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,521
No danger of finding
those here.

140
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:13,556
Vampires?

141
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:16,491
Controlled circumstances.
Hello, Buffy.

142
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:18,652
Well...

143
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:22,728
hello.

144
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,133
New watcher?

145
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:26,567
New watcher.

146
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,605
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

147
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,538
It's very nice
to meet you.

148
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,647
Is he evil?

149
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:38,977
Evil?

150
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,074
The last one
was evil.

151
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:44,120
Oh, yes. Gwendolyn Post.
We all heard.

152
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:47,453
No. Mr. Giles has checked
my credentials rather thoroughly

153
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:48,684
and phoned the Council,

154
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,626
but I'm glad to see
you're on the ball as well.

155
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:55,096
A good slayer
is a cautious slayer.

156
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,201
Is he evil?

157
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,429
Not in the strictest sense
of the...

158
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,165
Well, I'm glad
that's cleared up.

159
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:06,676
And as I'm sure none of us is anxious
to waste any time on pleasantries,

160
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:10,407
why don't you tell me everything
about last night's patrol.

161
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:12,210
Vampires.

162
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,977
Yes?

163
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,313
Killed 'em.

164
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,820
Anything else
you can tell me?

165
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:22,821
Uh... one of them had swords.

166
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:25,123
I don't think he was
with the other two.

167
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:26,457
Swords?

168
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,592
Swords.

169
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:34,335
One long, one short?

170
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:35,997
Mmm. Both pointy.

171
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:38,166
With, like,
jewels and things.

172
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:39,174
Sounds familiar.

173
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:40,175
It should.

174
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,040
El Eliminati.

175
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:49,552
15th-century duelist cult,
deadly in their day.

176
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,349
Their numbers dwindled
in later centuries

177
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:53,481
due to an increase
in anti-vampire activity

178
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:56,185
and a lot of
pointless dueling.

179
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,888
They eventually became the acolytes
of a demon called Balthazar,

180
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:01,226
who brought them
to the new world,

181
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:02,526
specifically here.

182
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,726
You seem to know
a lot about them.

183
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:07,066
I didn't get this job
because of my looks.

184
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:09,731
I really, really
believe that.

185
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:13,504
I've researched this town's
history extensively.

186
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:16,045
So why have we not
seen them before this?

187
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:19,549
They were driven out
a hundred years ago.

188
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:21,049
Happily, Balthazar
was killed.

189
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:22,949
I don't know by whom.

190
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,749
And they're back 'cause...

191
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:28,019
Balthazar had an amulet
purported to give him strength.

192
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:32,552
When he was killed, it was taken
by a wealthy landowner named...

193
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:33,789
I don't want to bore you
with the details.

194
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,956
A little bit late.

195
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,660
Named Gleaves.
It was buried with him,

196
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,759
and I believe the few
remaining Eliminati

197
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:41,395
are probably
looking for it.

198
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:43,235
For sentimental value.

199
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:45,969
And you don't think that
this amulet poses any threat?

200
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,670
Oh, no, not at all.

201
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:50,178
Nonetheless, we may as well
keep it from them.

202
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,306
Buffy, you will go to
the Gleaves family crypt tonight

203
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,610
and fetch the amulet.

204
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:54,946
I will?

205
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:58,317
Are you not used
to being given orders?

206
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:02,654
Whenever Giles sends me on a mission,
he always says "Please."

207
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:06,127
And afterwards
I get a cookie.

208
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:10,155
I don't feel we're getting off
on quite the right foot.

209
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,826
Ah.

210
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,767
This is perhaps Faith.

211
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:16,734
New watcher?

212
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:17,933
- New watcher.
- New watcher.

213
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:20,272
Screw that.

214
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,976
Now, why didn't
I just say that?

215
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:25,378
Eh, Buffy, would you...

216
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:28,577
I'll see if
I can get her back.

217
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:32,247
Don't say anything incredibly
interesting while I'm gone.

218
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:40,162
They'll get used to me.

219
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:46,700
Buffy: Faith, wait.

220
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,898
Look, I know this new guy's
a dork, but...

221
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:52,134
Well, I have nothing to follow that.
He's pretty much just a dork.

222
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,837
You're actually gonna
take orders from him?

223
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:57,107
That's the job.
What else can we do?

224
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,341
Whatever we want.

225
00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,848
We're slayers, girlfriend,
the chosen two.

226
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,283
Why should we let him
take all the fun out of it?

227
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:03,649
Oh, that would be tragic,

228
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,587
taking the fun out of slaying,
stabbing, beheading.

229
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:08,625
Oh, like you
don't dig it.

230
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:09,624
I don't.

231
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:11,627
You're a liar.
I've seen you.

232
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:14,425
Tell me staking a vamp
doesn't get you a little bit juiced.

233
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:15,829
Come on, say it.

234
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,457
[Laughs]

235
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:18,967
You can't fool me.

236
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:20,867
The look in your eyes
right after a kill.

237
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:22,235
You just get
hungry for more.

238
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,637
You're way off base.

239
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:26,437
Tell me that if you don't get in
a good slaying,

240
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,207
after a while, you just start
itching for some vamp to show up

241
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,009
so you can give him
a good... [Grunts]

242
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:34,073
Again with the grunting.

243
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,914
You realize I'm not
comfortable with this.

244
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,613
Hey, slaying's what
we were built for.

245
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:38,882
If you're not
enjoying it,

246
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:40,389
you're doing
something wrong.

247
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:42,482
What about the assignment?

248
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,926
Tell you what, you do the homework,
and I'll copy yours.

249
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,851
Buffy: Strike one.
No amulet there.

250
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:38,165
Game over.

251
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,475
Oh!

252
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:26,877
Faith!

253
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:28,540
What are you doing,
hiding in there?

254
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,413
Looking for the amulet.

255
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:33,113
Wasn't counting on the special
guest stars... 6 against one.

256
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,654
Hence the hiding.

257
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:37,657
Yeah. Well, it's 6 against 2 now,
so come on.

258
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,460
Wait! Stop! Think.

259
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,764
No, no, no!

260
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,269
It's a manhole...

261
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:53,739
tight space, no escape, 6 against 2...
not unlike 3 against one.

262
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:55,002
And there might be more,
so come on.

263
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:57,374
You're just gonna go down there.
That's your plan.

264
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,776
Who said I had a plan?

265
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:01,246
I don't know how many's down there,
but I want to find out.

266
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:02,748
And I'll know
when I land,

267
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,478
and if you don't come in after me,
I might die.

268
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:22,193
These are all the diaries, then,
yours included.

269
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,636
That's everything.
Knock yourself out.

270
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:25,637
Please?

271
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,501
Oh, yes. Here's
your first entry.

272
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,740
"Slayer is willful
and insolent."

273
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,978
That would be our girl,
wouldn't it?

274
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:39,519
Well, you have
to get to know her.

275
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,612
"Her abuse of
the English language

276
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:44,749
is such that I understand only
every other sentence."

277
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:47,454
Oh, this is going to make
fascinating reading.

278
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:50,861
She should be back by now.

279
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,194
Not to fret.

280
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,293
My mission scenario
has her back in one minute.

281
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,133
Shouldn't be
any trouble.

282
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:02,174
We're surrounded!

283
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:03,642
You noticed that too?!

284
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:47,719
Let's settle this
honorably.

285
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,824
Well, then,
let's just settle it.

286
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:01,460
Buffy!

287
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,197
You son of a bitch!

288
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,614
I hate it
when they drown me.

289
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,055
B! Gotta go!

290
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,226
We came for the amulet.

291
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:41,108
Tell me you don't
get off on this.

292
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:42,870
It didn't suck.

293
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:48,081
Wesley: Well...

294
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,741
looks authentic enough.

295
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:55,652
Of course, there are tests to be made
before actual verification.

296
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,588
How about verifying that
your "nearly extinct" cult

297
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:59,353
was out in magnum force
last night?

298
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:02,294
Faith and I got into
a serious party situation.

299
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:03,295
Are you all right?

300
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:05,298
I had to lather,
rinse, and repeat

301
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:08,460
about 5 million times
to get the sewer out of my hair,

302
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,470
but otherwise,
I'm of the good.

303
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:11,971
Thank you for asking.

304
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,939
Perhaps there were a few more
than we'd anticipated,

305
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:15,703
but I'd expect you to be
ready for anything.

306
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:18,244
Remember the 3 key words
for any slayer:

307
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:19,438
Preparation...

308
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:20,741
preparation...

309
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:22,715
preparation.

310
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:24,614
That's one word 3 times.

311
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,022
I have a chem. Test.

312
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,615
So sad that I'm actually
happy about that.

313
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,626
Giles, we need to talk.

314
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,787
Buffy...

315
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:39,026
I must ask you to remember
that I am your watcher.

316
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,830
From now on, anything
you have to say about slaying

317
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,132
you will say to me.

318
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:47,003
The only thing
you need discuss with Mr. Giles

319
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:48,564
is overdue book fees.

320
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:50,133
Understood?

321
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,072
- We'll talk.
- Of course.

322
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,710
You're not helping.

323
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,480
I know.

324
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,612
I feel just sick
about it.

325
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,559
Buffy: It was intense.

326
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,461
It was like I just let go
and became this force.

327
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:11,896
I just didn't care anymore.

328
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,695
Yeah, I know
what that's like.

329
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:17,397
I don't think you can!
It's kind of a slayer thing.

330
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,598
I don't even think
I'm explaining it well.

331
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:21,107
You're explaining it
a lot, though.

332
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:24,167
All right. You have one period
to fill out your test booklets.

333
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:26,110
Periodic charts
are located on the back.

334
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,707
You're on the honor system,
so remember, no talking.

335
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,111
You see, the thing was,

336
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,881
Faith knew I didn't even
want to go down there...

337
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:36,184
Mrs. Taggart: Ahem!

338
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:37,451
Ms. Summers?

339
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:41,855
You have one hour.

340
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:45,356
OK, so the best part...

341
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:49,164
Buffy. Test?
You know. Remember?

342
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:51,568
The thing you didn't
come over to study for?

343
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,470
Right.

344
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,473
Got it.

345
00:18:56,944 --> 00:18:59,538
Sorry. OK, so we're down there,
in the sewers,

346
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:01,012
and Faith got 3 of them
on her at once...

347
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:02,106
Hey. Whoa.

348
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,980
Can we resume Buffy's
"Ode to Faith" later,

349
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:06,986
like when I'm not actively
multiple-choicing?

350
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:11,184
How come your eye twitches
every time I say Faith's name?

351
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:12,782
What?

352
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,225
No, it doesn't.

353
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:16,228
Faith.

354
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:19,198
Cut it out!

355
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:20,358
We got a test
to take, OK?

356
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:21,594
And I'm highly
caffeinated,

357
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,398
and I'm trying
to concentrate.

358
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:26,031
Some of us actually
care about school, you know.

359
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,242
[Knock Knock]

360
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:36,613
[Opening Window]

361
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:37,981
Hey, girlfriend.

362
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:38,984
Bad time?

363
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:51,626
No, sh-she can't!

364
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:56,859
Y-You can't! Can you?

365
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,442
What's up?

366
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:04,500
Vampires.

367
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,773
Uh, Faith, unless
there's a total eclipse

368
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:08,246
in the next 5 minutes,
it's daylight.

369
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:09,373
Good for us,
bad for them.

370
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,747
Found a nest.

371
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:11,873
Has potential.

372
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,073
Faith: Rise and shine,
people.

373
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,642
It's your wake-up call.

374
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,526
- Hey!
- Oof.

375
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,692
You're not leaving,
are you?

376
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:14,633
I saw you making friends.

377
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:15,635
Them?

378
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,760
Boys. I like you.

379
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,524
What's the matter?

380
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:27,498
You're not afraid of
little me, are ya?

381
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,397
We better sit down.
Come on.

382
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:33,929
I can sense this is
a business trip.

383
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:36,501
What's the what?

384
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:38,099
Balthazar.

385
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:39,109
Dead demon.

386
00:21:39,178 --> 00:21:41,703
Not as dead as you think.

387
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:46,912
Word on the street puts him
in the packing warehouse on Devereau.

388
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:48,180
He's looking for...

389
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:50,381
His amulet. It's supposed
to restore his strength.

390
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:52,890
From what I'm hearing, that's not
something we'd like to see happen.

391
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,949
No problem.
We got the amulet.

392
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:57,291
I know. I spoke to Giles,
but he said you gave it...

393
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:58,796
Ah. There you are.

394
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:00,695
Ah. Speak of the really
annoying person.

395
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:03,701
You're certainly giving me
a run for my money.

396
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,862
I think we ought
to establish

397
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,407
that if you're going
to go out slaying,

398
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:11,568
you leave me a number
where I can contact you.

399
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:13,578
Where is the amulet?

400
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:15,679
Who are you?

401
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,579
A friend.
Do you have it?

402
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,743
It's somewhere safe.

403
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:23,587
How did you know?

404
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:25,089
It pooches your jacket.

405
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:27,216
Now, hang on a minute...

406
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:29,158
Walking around with this thing
is like wearing a target.

407
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:31,696
You're gonna put it somewhere safe
that's actually safe?

408
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:33,789
Yeah. I'll do it now.

409
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,265
I'll do some recon
on Balthazar.

410
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,699
If I may...

411
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:38,202
Balthazar is dead.

412
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,033
Am I the only one
that remembers that?

413
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:41,367
Be careful.

414
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,668
You know me.

415
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:44,174
I mean it.

416
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:49,475
What's going on?

417
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:54,679
Call me!

418
00:22:56,522 --> 00:23:00,515
Let me tell you what I see.

419
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:05,325
I see fear...

420
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:08,298
and remorse...

421
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:11,700
and the pitiful
look of faces

422
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,864
that cry out for mercy.

423
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,874
But what I don't see

424
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:19,775
is what I want to see,

425
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:23,906
and that's my amulet!

426
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:27,419
Lord Balthazar,
we found it, we had it,

427
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:28,418
but the slayers...

428
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:30,352
Already I'm bored.

429
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:42,566
Vincent...

430
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:44,625
come here.

431
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:47,137
[Wheezing]

432
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:48,366
Closer.

433
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,436
Closer.

434
00:23:57,483 --> 00:24:01,886
Let me tell you...
what I want to see.

435
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:13,889
Buffy: OK, we got 10,
maybe 12 bad guys

436
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:17,732
and one big demon in desperate need
of a Stairmaster.

437
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:21,295
I say we take 'em all,
hard and fast and now.

438
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,864
We need a little more
firepower than none.

439
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,068
We should head back
to the library.

440
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:27,169
Well, I guess Jacuzzi boy
isn't going anywhere.

441
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:29,874
I just... wish we had...

442
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:30,937
Ah.

443
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:33,075
That is too good.

444
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:43,652
Ah. Score.

445
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,065
Think they're insured?

446
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:53,161
Strangely,
not my priority.

447
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:55,263
When are ya gonna
get this, B?

448
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,173
Life for a slayer
is very simple... want...

449
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:01,201
take,

450
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,577
have.

451
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:06,944
Want...

452
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,513
take...

453
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:11,749
have.

454

I'm gettin' it.

455
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,365
Freeze!

456
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:33,241
Drop the weapons and get
down on the ground! Now!

457
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:41,949
I said drop the weapons,
or I fire.

458
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,262
Now spread 'em.

459
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:53,889
You wish.

460
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:58,468
Hands in the air where
I can see 'em... slow!

461
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,933
Good. Now cuff'em.

462
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,910
I like him.

463
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:13,247
He's butch.

464
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,953
That's some artillery
you two were puttin' together.

465
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:20,787
You with one of them
girl gangs?

466
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:22,986
Yeah. We're the Slayers.

467
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:28,856
You want to get out here?

468
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:38,374
We can't save
the world in jail.

469
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,130
Got it. Got it.

470
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:00,130
Ow!

471
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:02,531
We should call an ambulance.

472
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,468
5 people already have,
the racket we made, and they're fine.

473
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:10,204
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

474
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:11,674
Come on!

476
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:32,825
Admit it.

477
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:35,196
Some days don't you
want to just wake up

478
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,201
and say to hell
with the diet?

479
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:38,964
Want to make waffles?

Big Saturday brunch?

481
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,334
No, thanks. I'm not
really that hungry.

[Sighs]

483
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:48,002
So what did you
and Faith do last night?

484
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:48,832
So what did you
and Faith do last night?

485
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:50,165
Nothing.

486
00:27:50,238 --> 00:27:52,934
Uh... nothing
really important.

487
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:58,037
Don't worry. I'm not gonna meddle
in your slaying.

488
00:27:58,113 --> 00:28:00,013
Just as long
as you're careful.

489
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:01,207
I am.

490
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:07,377
Sure about
those waffles?

491
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:10,884
Yeah.

492
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,189
But if you want them,
I can help you make them.

493
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:17,823
No. They only don't have calories
if I make them for you.

494
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:19,389
Mom logic.

495
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,901
You, uh,
done with the paper?

496
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,301
Yeah.

497
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:26,636
Let's see what's
happening in Sunnydale.

498
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,173
There we go.
Thanks a lot, fellas.

499
00:28:31,246 --> 00:28:32,679
Thanks a heap.

500
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:34,715
Hey, have fun on
that camping trip, now.

501
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:38,218
Don't forget to roast
a wiener for me.

503
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:42,019
Here we go.

504
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,024
All right,
you can come out now.

505

Backbone of America,
those little guys.

506
00:28:48,997 --> 00:28:52,057
Seeing the hope and courage
on their bright little faces,

507
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,624
I swear I could just...
I could just eat 'em up.

508
00:28:54,702 --> 00:28:55,634
[Chuckles]

509
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:58,001
So, any news
about the Eliminati?

510
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:01,701
[Snarling]

511
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:04,006
In the name of
Lord Balthazar, die!

512
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:07,772
[Coughing]

513
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:08,781
Thank you, Mr. Trick.

514
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,715
That was very thoughtful
of you.

515
00:29:10,785 --> 00:29:14,221
Why do they always
gotta be using swords?

516
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,381
It's called an Uzi, ya chump.

517
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:16,946
Could have saved your ass
right about now.

518
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:19,255
You know, it's curious
how he could have gotten

519
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:21,557
all the way
into my liquor cabinet.

520
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:24,962
Allan, don't we have
security working in this building?

521
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,796
Sir, I...

522
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,301
I had no idea. I... I...

523
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:30,303
There's no need
to swoon, Allan.

524
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:32,965
But try to keep things
secure.

525
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,736
Lock him up.

526
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:37,334
He wake up, he's just gonna
try and kill you again.

527
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:40,779
Yes. Yes, I expect he will.

00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,815
Balthazar:
Vincent made a noble effort.

529
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:49,983
Man to man,
as befits a true warrior.

[Wheezing]

531
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,126
He had courage...

532
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:56,993
he had honor...

533
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:02,933
and I have jack
to show for it!

534
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,400
It has been a hundred years

535
00:30:08,476 --> 00:30:12,037
since my enemy crippled me.

536
00:30:12,113 --> 00:30:17,847
Now ultimate power
is within his grasp.

537
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,322
And I shall not let it be!

538
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,381
Forget about honor!

539
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:26,518
Forget about everything

540
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:29,927
but getting my amulet!

541
00:30:29,998 --> 00:30:32,125
Bring the watchers to me!

542
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,135
Find the slayers
and kill them!

543
00:30:35,203 --> 00:30:36,636
Kill everything
that gets in your way!

544
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:39,537
Go!

545
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:42,337
Go!

546
00:30:42,477 --> 00:30:43,341
Buffy: Mmm.

547
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:45,345
Willow: You like it?

548
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:47,278
It smells good.
What is it?

549
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:51,011
Just a little something we witches
like to call a protection spell.

550
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:53,645
Good deal, protection.

551
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:55,120
I'm surprised, though,

552
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:56,178
'cause usually
spell stuff s more...

553
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:59,090
Stinky. Yeah. That's why
I added lavender.

554
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,424
Give me time,
and I may be the first wicca

555
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:04,329
to do all my conjuring
in pine fresh scent.

556
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,991
So what's the plan?

557
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:09,127
For tonight's slayage.
We're going, aren't we?

558
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,068
Yeah.

559
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:13,130
Great.

560
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:15,971
But... there's a but.

561
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:19,844
And that's but you
shouldn't come... tonight.

562
00:31:19,914 --> 00:31:21,347
Is that cool?

563
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:23,616
Well, sure.

564
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:25,152
Makes sense.

565
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:28,814
You know... you'll be facing big,
hairy danger.

566
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,415
Uh, b-biggest
and very hairy.

567
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:33,926
You'll be
risking your life.

568
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:34,927
Right.

569
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:36,361
And why risk yours?

570
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:38,922
'Cause I'm your friend?

571
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,527
I know, Wil. That's exactly
why I don't want you going.

572
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:44,537
It's... It's too dangerous.

573
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:47,301
But I-I've done
this sort of thing before,

574
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:50,435
like, a million times,
and I can totally handle myself.

575
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:53,810
Besides,
minty fresh protection.

576
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:54,870
So?

577

[Knock On Door]

578
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:57,950
Ready? Time to motor.

579
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,509
Hey, Willow.

580
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:01,680
Hi.

581
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:04,384
Uh, I really should...

582
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:06,427
but we'll hang out
later, right?

583
00:32:06,494 --> 00:32:07,927
Yeah. You go ahead.

584
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:09,963
I'll just get my stuff.

585

[Door Closes]

586
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,472
Stupid.

587
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:24,677
You're quiet tonight.

588
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:27,044
I just want
to get this done.

589
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:29,106
Yeah. I'm dying
to test out the longbow.

590
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:31,014
I think it might be
my new thing.

591
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:33,053
I can't believe you went back
for that stuff.

592
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:34,349
Hey, how do you feel
about getting some ribs?

593
00:32:34,422 --> 00:32:35,446
You know,
after we're done.

594
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:41,061
I didn't say you had
emotional problems.

595
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:44,098
I said you had an emotional problem.
It's quite different.

596
00:32:44,165 --> 00:32:47,601
My attachment to the slayer
is not a problem.

597
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:48,600
In point of fact...

598
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,466
The way you've handled
this assignment

599
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:52,836
is something of an embarrassment
to the Council.

600
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:54,807
If you want to criticize
my methods, fine.

601
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:56,503
But you can keep your
snide remarks to yourself.

602
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:58,909
And while you're at it,
don't criticize my methods.

603
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,508
The fact is, you're
no longer qualified to act as watcher.

604
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:05,142
It's not your fault.

605
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:08,154
You've done well.

606
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:12,283
It's simply time for somebody else
to take the field.

607
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,828
Now's a good time
to start.

00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,100
Screw it.

00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,314
I think we've got
more comin'!

611
00:33:34,382 --> 00:33:35,713
We're never gonna
make it to the warehouse.

612
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:37,808
If they keep coming one
at a time, we got a shot.

613
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,288
Faith, no!

614
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,574
Don't move.

615
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,974
I didn't... I didn't know.

616
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:04,977
I didn't know.

617
00:34:05,046 --> 00:34:07,480
We need to call 911, now!

618
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,482
Don't move. It's OK.

to stop the...

Come on, we gotta go!

Buffy, I've been
looking for you.

Your hand.

It's OK.

627
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:20,707
I've just been
at the warehouse.

628
00:35:20,776 --> 00:35:23,040
I was waiting for you.

629
00:35:23,112 --> 00:35:24,306
They got Giles.

Oh, God.

Oh, God!

00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:11,320
It doesn't seem
too promising, does it?

637
00:36:11,393 --> 00:36:13,759
Stay calm, Mr. Giles.
We have to stay calm.

638
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:16,627
Well, thank God you're here.
I was planning to panic.

Aaahh.

your demon.

to get snippy.

You know what I want.

those hard-to-reach areas,

This is hardly
the time for games!

Why not? They're going
to torture us to death anyway.

You're not wrong about that.

Now, hold on. We can deal
with this rationally.

about what we're gonna do.

714
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,892
There's nothing
to talk about.

715
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:43,435
I was doing my job.

716
00:42:45,705 --> 00:42:48,697
Being a slayer's not the same
as being a killer.

717
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,879
Faith, please don't
shut me out here.

718
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:56,245
Look, sooner or later,
we're both gonna have to deal.

719
00:42:56,316 --> 00:42:57,248
Wrong.

720
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:58,944
We can help each other.

721
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:01,044
I don't need it.

722
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:03,919
Yeah? Who's wrong now?

723
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,790
Faith, you can shut off
all the emotions that you want.

724
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:10,955
But eventually, they're
gonna find a body.

725
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:14,398
OK, this is the last time
we're gonna have this conversation,

726
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,061
and we're not even having it now,
you understand me?

727
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:18,069
There is no body.

728
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:20,538
I took it, weighted it,
and dumped it.

729
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:22,939
The body doesn't exist.

730
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,533
Getting rid
of the evidence

731
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:27,171
doesn't make
the problem go away.

732
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:28,646
It does for me.

733
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:30,740
Faith, you don't get it.

734
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,944
You killed a man.

735
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:36,580
No, you don't get it.

736
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,317
I don't care.

737
