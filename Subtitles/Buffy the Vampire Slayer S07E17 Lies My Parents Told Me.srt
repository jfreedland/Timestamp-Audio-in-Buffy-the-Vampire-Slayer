Why didn't your chip go off?

3
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:05,870
We were at the lnitiative...

4
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:09,744
- There was a choice.
- Right. Either repair the chip, or remove it.

5
00:00:09,836 --> 00:00:12,270
- You removed the chip?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:15,428
Spike has a soul now. That's what's
gonna stop him from hurting people.

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:19,350
- Buffy...
- He can be a good man, Giles. l feel it.

8
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,752
How do you know about slayers?

9
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:25,430
My mother was one.
She was killed when l was four.

10
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:28,508
- Something got her? A demon...?
- A vampire.

11
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,713
- How do you two know each other?
- He works with me.

12
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:34,071
You know, in the struggle against evil.

13
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:35,191
He's a vampire.

14
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:38,906
- Nice coat. Where'd you get it?
- New York.

Mama!

27
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:12,069
You did a good job, baby boy.
You stayed down just like mama told you.

28
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:16,832
- Can we go home now?
- Uh-uh. lt's not safe there any more.

00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:21,546
How about l take you to Crowley's house?
You can play with those spooky doodads.

30
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:24,070
No, l wanna stay with you.

31
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:28,147
Yeah, l know you do, baby.

32
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:30,796
But remember, Robin honey,
what we talked about.

33
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:33,629
Always gotta work the mission.

34
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:35,987
Look at me.

35
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:40,149
You know l love you, but l got ajob to do.

36
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:43,429
The mission is what matters. Right?

37
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:48,349
That's my boy. Come on.

38
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:59,105
Robin?

39
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,107
Spike!

40
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,627
Little tip, mate.

41
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:49,306
Stake's your friend.

42
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,432
Don't be afraid to use it.

43
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:54,073
What?

44
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:05,231
Just waiting for my moment.

<i>(bell rings)</i>

46
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,470
Situation still normal.

47
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:14,628
Or as normal as this school ever sees.

48
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:17,028
So it appears.

49
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,074
No fires, no one's head's going kablooey,

50
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:25,105
and the swing choir and marching band are
back to their normal, seething resentment.

51
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:28,586
Yeah, it's been pretty quiet
since you shut down that seal.

52
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:32,908
- You just may have stopped this thing, Buffy.
- No, it can't be that easy.

53
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:34,588
You call that easy?

54
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:38,828
Any apocalypse l avert without dying,
those are the easy ones.

55
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:42,873
You know, you're something else,
Ms Summers.

56
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:47,746
l've been watching you
when we're out patrolling, and you're...

57
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:49,906
You remind me of my, um...

58
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,589
- Your mother?
- Yeah.

59
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:56,144
What l remember of her, anyway.

60
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:58,511
Gotta say, not a line every girl likes to hear,

61
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:01,713
but in this case compliment taken.

62
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,708
Maybe you're right.
Maybe everything is fine.

63
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,913
Everything's terrible. Total catastrophe.

64
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:10,829
- Giles, what's wrong?
- Have you seen the new library?

65
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,749
There's nothing but computers.
Not a book to be seen.

66
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:17,226
l don't know where to begin, Buffy.
Who do we speak to?

67
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,466
That would be me. Hi.

68
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:24,550
- l'm Robin Wood.
- Oh, sorry. Rupert Giles. Sorry.

69
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:28,549
Buffy tells me you're something
of a freelance demon-fighter.

70
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:30,627
Oh, yes.

71
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:33,831
l'm relieved.

72
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,067
We're running dangerously low on allies.

73
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:39,795
So we didn't stop it, then?

74
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:45,746
No, the seers at the coven are certain
the First is continuing to gather its forces.

75
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:49,228
l'm afraid war is inevitable.

76
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:54,431
- So we should go before the school board.
- What?

77
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:58,111
Well, l can have my backup library
sent from home in the meantime.

78
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:00,187
- lt's not much, but...
- Giles.

79
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:06,033
Knowledge comes from crafted bindings
and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeros.

80
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:09,347
- Did you bring back any potentials?
- No.

81
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:13,554
Actually, my trip was about
something else. lt's regarding Spike.

82
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:15,513
Spike? What about him?

83
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:19,908
l told you my concerns when you recklessly
chose to remove the chip from his head.

84
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:22,908
- Wait, sorry. Chip?
- lt's a long story.

85
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:26,068
The military put a chip in his head
so he couldn't hurt anyone.

86
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:27,145
The abridged version.

87
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:30,353
But he wouldn't hurt anyone any more
because he has a soul now.

88
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:32,745
- Unless the First triggers him.
- The chip?

89
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:38,991
No, the trigger's a posthypnotic thing.
The First put it in his head. lt... made him...

90
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:42,386
- He was killing again.
- So he has a trigger, a soul and a chip?

91
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:44,990
- Not any more.
- lt was killing him, Giles.

92
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:47,590
- The trigger?
- The chip. The trigger's not active.

93
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,588
Because the military gave him a soul?

94
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:53,795
Sorry.

95
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:57,471
We don't know that the trigger is inactive.

96
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:01,028
What l brought back may help us to disarm it,

97
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:05,632
and to ascertain exactly what it is
that causes Spike's behaviour.

98
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:09,311
lt was that song, Giles.
lt was that song that Spike was singing.

99
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:12,513
He has no memory of it.
ls there part of it that you remember?

100
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:18,068
lt didn't have a catchy hook, like "l'm coming
up, so you better get this party started."

101
00:08:18,156 --> 00:08:23,549
Boring, old, and English.
Just like yo... ul... Brynner.

102
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,592
Yul Brynner.

103
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:29,428
A British Yul Brynner.

104
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:35,105
This thing you brought to keep Spike
from killing again. How's it work?

105
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,747
lt will require a bit of magic.

106
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:40,465
We couldn't have
put these chains back up a week ago.

107
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:43,275
No, we gotta work on Spike now of all times.

108
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,347
What?

109
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:48,467
Nothin'.

110
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,589
What are you doing here?
You came to see the show?

111
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:57,270
- l thought you might need support.
- Uh-huh.

112
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:59,665
Let's get this over with.
What are you gonna do?

113
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,429
Some hypno-beam? A disarming spell?

114
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:06,429
Not exactly. The First has brainwashed you.

115
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:11,351
There's something in your subconscious
that it's using to provoke a violent reaction.

116
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:13,427
So...

117
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,750
we have to put this in your brain.

118
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,588
Bugger that!

119
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:24,831
The prokaryote stone will move within your
mind to reveal the root of the trigger's power.

120
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,431
lt can unleash ideas, images, memories.

121
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:32,634
Hopefully, once you understand
what it is that's... setting you off,

122
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,866
you can break its hold on you.

123
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:37,993
Hopefully? So it might not work?

124
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:41,625
The stone's just a catalyst for the process.
The rest is up to Spike.

125
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:44,753
And how do you get
that hunk of rubble into my cranium?

126
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:47,396
- Willow?
- OK.

127
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:51,355
l just hope my pronunciation
is in the ballpark.

00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:06,435
Get these sodding things off me. l'm fine.

172
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:09,030
Shouldn't you take a little time? Calm down?

173
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,630
l am calm.

174
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:16,232
This stone of yours is out, right?
Did its job, so l'm de-triggered, right?

175
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:19,672
Spike, what do you remember
about the song?

176
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:25,231
Oh, yeah, the song.
lt's called "Early One Morning". Old folk ditty.

177
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:27,784
- What's it mean to you?
- Mean?

178
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:31,152
Nothing. lt's just... my mum.

179
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:35,914
lt was her favourite. She used to
sing it to me... when l was a baby.

180
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:40,510
- And?
- No "and". That's it.

181
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:45,315
Shouldn't you check on Dawnie?
l clocked the niblet pretty fierce.

182
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:47,705
She'll be OK. She's tough.

183
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:48,672
Ow!

184
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:50,667
- Sorry.
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

185
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,305
- lt doesn't look like anything's broken.
- Did you use a magic x-ray?

186
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:57,035
That's just what people usually say.

187
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,346
So Spike's trigger's been active all this time.

188
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:04,714
How can Buffy take this for granted?
He lives in our house, we train with him.

189
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,514
Don't waste your time.

190
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:10,555
Spike's got a "Get Out of Jail Free" card
that doesn't apply to the rest of us.

191
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:14,470
He could slaughter a hundred frat boys and...

192
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:19,829
Forgiveness makes us human.
Blah-dee-blah-blah-blah.

193
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:23,586
Willow, call for you from LA.
Somebody named Fred.

194
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:26,554
The guy sounds kind of effeminate.

195
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,385
Spike, listen to me.
What is it about your mother?

196
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:34,593
l don't know. l got along fine with her.
She was a nice lady.

197
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:38,749
- There has to be more than that.
- Well, there bloody well isn't!

198
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,354
- What are you doing?
- l'm going to unchain him.

199
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:45,906
This is pointless, Giles.
He doesn't know anything.

200
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:50,467
- Your prophylactic stone didn't work.
- He's not cooperating. This takes time.

201
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:55,346
He's blocking what's in his consciousness.
And while he does, he's endangering us all.

202
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:59,429
- So the trigger's still working?
- Much as ever.

203
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:14,875
Ooh! Such a pretty house
you have, sweet Willy.

204
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:19,425
Smells of daffodils... and viscera.

205
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:22,665
Don't get too attached, now.

206
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,747
Won't be here for long, love.

207
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:32,390
Well then...
shall we give it a proper goodbye?

208
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,830
You're a saucy one, aren't you?

209
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:56,034
Dru... we'll bring this world to its knees.

210
00:16:56,116 --> 00:17:00,951
lt's ripe and ready, my darling.
Waiting for us to devour its fruit.

211
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:06,633
We'll ravage this city together, my pet.
Lay waste to all of Europe.

212
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:11,707
The three of us will teach those snobs
and elitists with their falderal just what...

213
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:14,071
- Three?
- You, me and Mother.

214
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:20,391
We'll open up their veins and bathe in their
blood as they scream our names across...

215
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:24,469
- What?
- You... wanna bring your mum with us?

216
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:27,955
Well, yeah.

217
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:30,507
You'll like her.

218
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:33,587
To eat, you mean?

219
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:38,752
- William?
- Uh... Mother.

220
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:43,512
Where have you been?
l've been beside myself for days.

221
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,588
You needn't have worried, Mother.

222
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:49,827
You'll never have to worry
about anything again.

223
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,384
Something has happened.

224
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:58,071
- l've changed.
- l don't... Who's this woman?

225
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:02,468
- l'm the other that gave birth to your son.
- l beg your pardon?

226
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:04,547
lt's true, Mother.

227
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:09,750
Drusilla... she...

228
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,911
She has made me what l am.

229
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:18,750
l am no longer bound to this mortal coil.

230
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:22,112
l have become a creature of the night.

231
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:24,391
A vampire.

232
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:26,228
Are you drunk?

233
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:30,187
A little bit.

234
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:33,791
Think of it.

235
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:36,026
No more sickness.

236
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,710
No more dying.

237
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:41,264
You'll never age another day.

238
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:45,711
- Let me do this for you.
- What are you talking about?

239
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:50,392
- And why are you acting so strangely?
- lt's all right, Mother.

240
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:54,147
lt's only me.

241
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:04,473
We'll be together... forever.

242
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,795
William...

243
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:13,471
lt only hurts... for a moment.

244
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,147
<i>(Willow)</i> Buffy?

245
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:25,511
l just got a phone call. l'm gonna have to
take off for a while. Maybe a day or two?

246
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:28,588
- What's wrong?
- Nothing you need to worry about.

247
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:33,067
l'll give you the full scoop later.
Maybe l'll even bring back some good news?

248
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:35,274
Could use a little of that.

249
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:39,747
OK. l guess now is as good a time
as we're likely to see for a while.

250
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:42,304
- Just hurry back.
- Will do.

251
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,425
Think about what you're doing.

252
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,507
l have.

253
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,987
- Buffy...
- Don't.

254
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:05,267
Mr Giles.

255
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:08,987
You got a moment?

256
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:14,231
- What's on your mind?
- The same thing that's on yours.

257
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:16,591
We got ourselves a problem.

258
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:20,912
- Spike.
- Yeah. lf that trigger's still working,

259
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:25,626
then the First must be waiting
forjust the right time to use it against us.

260
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:29,629
lt does seem doubtful the First simply
forgot it had such a powerful weapon.

261
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:35,586
A while back, it slipped up.
lt told Andrew it wasn't time yet for Spike.

262
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:42,309
So, whatever the First's ultimate plan is,
Spike must play an integral part in that.

263
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,669
Something needs to be done.

264
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:49,871
Buffy would never allow it.

265
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:53,949
Buffy would listen to her watcher,
wouldn't she?

266
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:58,109
l don't think you have much of an idea
of the watcher-slayer dynamic.

267
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:01,108
- Actually, l was raised by a watcher.
- You what?

268
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:06,714
Bernard Crowley. Took me in
when l was a young kid, trained me.

269
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:09,230
Crowley.

270
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:11,147
l remember the name.

271
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:16,310
New York-based watcher.
Resigned shortly after his slayer was...

272
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:23,791
You're Nikki Wood's son.

273
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,429
Yes.

274
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,952
Spike killed your mother.

275
00:21:32,516 --> 00:21:34,313
Yes.

276
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:41,146
Does Buffy know this?

277
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:43,909
She knows my mother was a slayer.

278
00:21:44,556 --> 00:21:47,195
She... doesn't know about Spike.

279
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:51,949
And this has nothing to do
with personal vengeance?

280
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:54,550
Does it matter?

281
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:57,548
He's an instrument of evil.

282
00:21:57,636 --> 00:22:00,708
He's gonna be our undoing
in this fight, Buffy's undoing,

283
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:03,754
and she will never, <i>never</i> see it coming.

284
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:07,511
Now, l'm talking about
what needs to be done.

285
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,390
For the greater good, Giles.

286
00:22:13,436 --> 00:22:15,631
And you know l'm right.

287
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:28,586
What exactly do you propose?

288
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,906
l just need you
to keep Buffy away for a few hours.

289
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:40,875
l don't know, Giles. ls this really
a primo time for a training session?

290
00:22:40,956 --> 00:22:43,186
l'm still your teacher, Buffy.

291
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:48,145
As adept as you are as a slayer,
there are always new things to learn.

292
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:53,515
Now more than ever it's crucial
to maintain focus on your calling.

293
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:56,986
ln case you haven't noticed,
our plates are kinda full right now.

294
00:22:57,076 --> 00:23:02,309
Plus, l'm not sure how l feel about leaving
Spike at Robin's house to watch over him.

295
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:07,993
For what it's worth, everyone at your house
seemed quite relieved at the arrangement.

296
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:11,034
Buffy...

297
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:15,951
While l'm not technically
your watcher any more,

298
00:23:16,036 --> 00:23:18,755
the fact that your life is such chaos

299
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:23,466
only underscores the importance
of the lessons l can impart to you.

300
00:23:23,556 --> 00:23:26,150
Fine. lmpart away.

301
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:29,626
We're on the verge of war.
lt's time you looked at the big picture.

302
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:32,708
Hello! All l do is look at the big picture.

303
00:23:32,796 --> 00:23:36,345
The other day, l gave an inspirational speech
to the telephone man.

304
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:40,395
lt takes more than
rousing speeches to lead, Buffy.

305
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:46,108
lf you're gonna be a general, you need to
make difficult decisions regardless of cost.

306
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:48,756
Have you seen me with those girls?

307
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:54,035
The way l've treated my friends
and my family and Andrew?

308
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:57,028
Believe me. l know
how to make hard decisions.

309
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:59,391
That's what we're here to find out.

310
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:03,947
While we work on the basics.

311
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:08,193
You live in a garage?

312
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:12,554
This is just a workroom.
Kind of my... sanctuary.

313
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:16,154
A little place to unwind, eh?

314
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:22,994
A hard day's principalling got you down, you
need a place to cut loose, let your hair down.

315
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:25,067
So to speak.

316
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:38,513
- What the bloody hell is this?
- l told you. lt's my... sanctuary.

317
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:43,272
lt's the Hellmouth, Spike.
You can never be too careful.

318
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:48,350
Just... stay away from the walls,
you'll be all right.

319
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:51,672
lt's a bit much, isn't it?

320
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:56,547
<i>(typing)</i>

321
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,433
What's your story, Wood?

322
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,673
No story, really.

323
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:07,385
Just... trying to do what's right.

324
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:11,067
Make a difference.

325
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:16,466
How about you?
What kind of man are you, Spike?

326
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:20,390
Sorry. Not much for self-reflection.

327
00:25:20,796 --> 00:25:22,787
Yeah, makes sense.

328
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:32,709
See, you strike me as the kinda guy
who just careens through life.

329
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:40,111
Completely oblivious of the damage
he's doing to everyone around him.

330
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:41,675
That right?

331
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:43,906
l know more about you
than you think, Spike.

332
00:25:43,996 --> 00:25:47,909
l've been searching for you
for a very, very long time.

333
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:54,629
Ever since you killed my mother.

334
00:25:55,836 --> 00:26:00,352
- l've killed a lot of people's mothers.
- Yeah.

335
00:26:00,956 --> 00:26:03,151
You'd remember mine.

336
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:08,067
She was a slayer.

337
00:26:09,076 --> 00:26:11,271
So that's it, isn't it?

338
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:15,430
Brought me here to kill me?

339
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:21,028
No. l don't wanna kill you, Spike.

340
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:26,587
l wanna kill the monster
who took my mother away from me.

341
00:26:31,116 --> 00:26:35,746
<i># Early one morning</i>

346
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:50,829
There he is.

347
00:27:08,516 --> 00:27:10,393
Mother?

348
00:27:10,476 --> 00:27:13,673
<i>(music box plays "Early One Morning")</i>

349
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:19,748
Hello, William.

350
00:27:20,236 --> 00:27:24,115
- Look at you.
- Mm, yes. All better.

351
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,236
- You're glowing!
- Am l?

352
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:33,347
Well, l suppose l have you to thank for that.
How ever will l repay you?

353
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:36,075
Seeing you like this is payment enough.

354
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:39,865
Oh, William. You're so...

355
00:27:41,156 --> 00:27:43,147
tender.

356
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:47,512
This is as it should be, Mother.
You and l together.

357
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:52,351
- All of London laid out before us.
- Ah, yes. Us.

358
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:58,511
First we'll feast. Then the night is yours.
Theatre, perhaps. Dancing?

359
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:01,872
- Tell me. What's your pleasure?
- Pleasure?

360
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:05,551
To take my leave of you, of course.

361
00:28:06,636 --> 00:28:10,424
"The lark hath spake
from 'twixt its wee beak."

362
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:15,872
You honestly thought l could bear
an eternity listening to that twaddle?

363
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:20,185
That's right, dog. Fight back!

364
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:25,426
l feel extraordinary.

365
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:28,792
lt's as though l've been given new eyes.

366
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:31,751
l see everything.

367
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:36,070
Understand... everything.

368
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:40,586
- Mother...
- l hate to be cruel.

369
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:44,874
No, l don't. l used to hate to be cruel in life.

370
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,947
Now l find it rather freeing.

371
00:28:47,556 --> 00:28:52,186
Nothing less will pry your greedy little
fingers off my apron strings, will it?

372
00:28:52,276 --> 00:28:53,550
Stop, please.

373
00:28:53,636 --> 00:28:58,107
Ever since the day you first
slithered from me like a parasite.

374
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:03,946
- What are you s...?
- Had l known better,

375
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:07,426
l could have spared myself
a lifetime of tedium and just...

376
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:12,348
..dashed your brains out when l first saw you.

377
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:15,384
<i>(growls)</i>

378
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:25,226
God! l prayed you'd find
a woman to release me,

379
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:27,876
but you scarcely showed an interest.

380
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:31,949
Who could compare
to your doddering housebound mum?

381
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:36,109
A captive audience for your witless prattle.

382
00:29:38,316 --> 00:29:42,628
Whatever l was, that's not who l am any more.

383
00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:44,069
Darling...

384
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:47,985
lt's who you'll always be.

385
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:51,671
A limp, sentimental fool.

386
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:00,547
Hurts, don't it?

387
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:03,795
This what it felt like

388
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:06,390
when you beat the life out of her?

389
00:30:06,476 --> 00:30:08,467
Toyed with her?

390
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,751
When you snapped her neck?

391
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:17,754
- Don't kill him yet.
- What? Why not?

392
00:30:17,836 --> 00:30:20,828
Because l'm asking you not to.

393
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:25,194
Would you let this vampire live
if it would save the world?

394
00:30:25,276 --> 00:30:28,234
Sure. Seems like a nice enough guy.

395
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:30,113
- Thanks.
- No problem.

396
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,585
- My name's Richard.
- Hi, Rich.

397
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:42,713
We talked about this. l wouldn't sacrifice
Dawn to stop Glory destroying the world.

398
00:30:42,796 --> 00:30:46,311
Yes, but things are different now.
After what you've been through.

399
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:49,194
Faced with the same choice now...

400
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:54,546
- you'd let her die.
- lf l had to.

401
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:57,548
To save the world. Yes.

402
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:06,794
- Can l kill this guy yet?
- No.

403
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:12,035
So you really do understand
the difficult decisions you'll have to make?

404
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:14,584
That any one of us is expendable in this war?

405
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:16,587
Have you heard my speeches?

406
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:20,908
That we cannot allow any threat that
would jeopardise our chances of winning?

407
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,987
Yes, l get it.

408
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:25,715
And yet there is Spike.

409
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:32,632
An animal like you
never cared for anyone but yourself.

410
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:35,427
No one else mattered.

411
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:41,711
Just... all about the hunt.

412
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:50,067
Yeah.

413
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:04,671
You wanna run, don't you?
Scamper off and cry to your new little trollop.

414
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:10,911
Do you think you'll be able to love her?
To touch her without feeling me?

415
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,432
All you've ever wanted was to be back inside.

416
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:20,705
You finally got your wish, didn't you?
Sank your teeth into me. An eternal kiss.

417
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:22,991
No. l only wanted to make you well.

418
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:25,226
You wanted your hands on me.

419
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:28,194
Perhaps you'd like a chance
to finish what you started?

420
00:32:28,276 --> 00:32:30,187
l loved you. l did.

421
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:33,268
- Not like this.
- Just like this.

422
00:32:33,356 --> 00:32:35,916
This is what you've always wanted.

423
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,191
Who's my dark little prince?

424
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:40,187
No!

425
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:42,631
Get out.

426
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:45,666
Get out!

427
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:54,909
There, there, precious.

428
00:32:54,996 --> 00:32:57,829
lt will only hurt for a moment.

429
00:32:59,036 --> 00:33:00,992
l'm sorry.

430
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:02,191
What?

431
00:33:03,436 --> 00:33:04,994
l'm sorry.

432
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:29,425
Sorry? You think sorry's
gonna make everything right?

433
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:31,427
l wasn't talking to you.

434
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:39,592
l don't give a piss about your mum.
She was a slayer. l was a vampire.

435
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:44,828
- That's the way the game is played.
- Game?

436
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:55,593
- She knew what she was signing up for.
- l didn't sign up for it.

437
00:33:55,676 --> 00:34:00,033
That's the rub, isn't it? You didn't
sign up for it and somehow it's my fault.

438
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:02,152
You took my childhood.

439
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:04,670
You took her away.

440
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,191
She was all l had. She was my world.

441
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:12,074
And you weren't hers.
Doesn't that piss you off?

442
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:14,795
Shut up. You didn't know her.

443
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:20,867
l know slayers.

444
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:28,264
No matter how many people
they've got around them, they fight alone.

445
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:30,347
Life of the Chosen One.

446
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:34,232
The rest of us be damned.
Your mother was no different.

447
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:37,865
No. She loved me.

448
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:42,586
But not enough to quit, though, was it?

449
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:45,748
Not enough to walk away... for you.

450
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:51,791
l'll tell you a story about a mother and son.

451
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:56,474
See, like you, l loved my mother.

452
00:34:57,636 --> 00:35:00,708
So much so l turned her into a vampire.

453
00:35:02,756 --> 00:35:05,065
So we could be together forever.

454
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:09,745
She said some nasty bits to me
after l did that.

455
00:35:09,836 --> 00:35:13,112
Been weighing on me for quite some time.

456
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:19,708
But you helped me figure something out.

457
00:35:19,796 --> 00:35:23,709
You see, unlike you,
l had a mother who loved me back.

458
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:29,675
When l sired her, l set loose a demon,
and it tore into me.

459
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:33,912
But it was the demon talking, not her.

460
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,431
l realise that now.

461
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:43,906
My mother loved me... with all her heart.

462
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:47,507
l was her world.

463
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:54,272
<i># Early one morning</i>
<i>just as the sun was rising</i>

464
00:35:54,356 --> 00:35:56,108
<i># l heard a young maid sing...</i>

465
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:59,745
That's a nice little song you got there.

466
00:36:02,596 --> 00:36:05,508
Thanks, doc. You cured me after all.

467
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:09,307
l got my own free will now.

468
00:36:09,396 --> 00:36:13,184
l'm not under the First's
or anyone else's influences now.

469
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:17,795
l just wanted you to know that...

470
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,549
before l kill you.

471
00:36:28,036 --> 00:36:30,675
Spike's a liability, Buffy.

472
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:33,954
He refuses to see it, and so do you.

473
00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:40,753
Angel left here because he realised
how harmful your relationship with him was.

474
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:43,714
Spike, on the other hand,
lacks such self-awareness.

475
00:36:43,796 --> 00:36:47,584
Spike is here because l want him here.
We need him.

476
00:36:47,676 --> 00:36:50,827
- l'm in the fight of my life.
- Really?

477
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:52,669
Not you, Richard.

478
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:56,066
You want Spike here even after
what he's done to you in the past?

479
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:59,148
lt's different now. He has a soul.

480
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:03,514
And the First is exploiting that
to his advantage.

481
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,585
Oh, my God.

482
00:37:06,836 --> 00:37:10,465
You're stalling me. You're keeping me away...

483
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:16,188
lt's time to stop playing the role
of general, and to start being one.

484
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,275
This is the way wars are won.

485
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:30,347
Spike?

486
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:33,227
What happened?

487
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:43,188
- Oh, my God.
- l gave him a pass.

488
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:47,269
Let him live, on account
of the fact l killed his mother.

489
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:50,029
But that's all he gets.

490
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:54,189
He even so much as
looks at me funny again, l'll kill him.

491
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:27,313
l lost my mom a couple of years ago.

492
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:32,271
l came home
and l found her dead on the couch.

493
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:34,834
l'm sorry.

494
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:41,107
l understand what you tried to do,
but she's dead.

495
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:42,868
Because he murdered her.

496
00:38:42,956 --> 00:38:46,869
l'm preparing for a war, and you want revenge
on a man that no longer exists.

497
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:51,871
Buffy, don't delude yourself.
That man still exists.

498
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:55,187
Spike is the strongest warrior we have.

499
00:38:55,276 --> 00:38:59,554
We are gonna need him
if we're gonna come out of this thing alive.

500
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:02,867
lf you try anything again, he'll kill you.

501
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:08,069
More importantly, l'll let him.

502
00:39:11,276 --> 00:39:13,506
l have a mission.

503
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:17,066
To win this war. To save the world.

504
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:20,989
l don't have time for vendettas.

505
00:39:23,516 --> 00:39:26,314
