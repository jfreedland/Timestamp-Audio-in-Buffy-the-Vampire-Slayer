1
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:06,604
Hey, Mom.

2
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:16,041
Still a couple of guys gettin' it right.

3
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:20,847
Hey, flower-gettin' lady,

4
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:23,731
want me to pick Dawn up from school?

5
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:25,802
Mom?

6
00:00:27,013 --> 00:00:29,402
What are you doin'?

7
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,130
Mom?

8
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:39,050
Mom?

9
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,928
Mommy?

11
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,928
- I think we're about ready for pie.
- Then I'll be ready for barf.

12
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,526
- Xander!
- Gross!

13
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:45,606
No, no. Barf from the eating.
Cos all was good, and too much goodness...

14
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:48,810
- I'm taking it as a compliment.
- Everything was delicious.

15
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:52,203
- Yes. I'm going to barf, too.
- Everyone's so sweet.

16
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:58,246
- Will, you in the vomit club, too?
- I had too much nog.

17
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:02,048
Oh, baby, want me to rub your tummy?
She likes it when I...

18
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,283
stop explaining things.

19
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,762
My nog tastes funny.
I think I got one with rum.

20
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:08,172
That's bad.

21
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,371
Yeah. Now Santa's gonna pass you right by,
naughty booze hound.

22
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:16,890
Santa always passes me by. Something puts
him off. Could be the big honkin' menorah.

23
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:19,885
- Did you write him a letter?
- What'd you ask for?

24
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,522
Guys, hello? Puberty?
Sorta figured out the whole no-Santa thing.

25
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,482
- That's a myth.
- Yeah.

26
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:30,043
No, I mean, it's a myth that it's a myth.
There is a Santa Claus.

27
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,921
The advantage of having
a 1,000-year-old girlfriend. Inside scoop.

28
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:37,210
- There's a Santa Claus?
- Mm-hm. Been around since the 1500s.

29
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:39,329
He wasn't always called Santa,

30
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:43,850
but Christmas night, flying reindeer,
coming down the chimney... all true.

31
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,525
All true?

32
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:49,129
Well, he doesn't traditionally
bring presents so much as...

33
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:51,609
disembowel children, but otherwise...

34
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,366
The reindeer part was nice.

35
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:59,002
Damn it! I hate this oven. It burnt.

36
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:02,210
No, it's just blackened.
You know, it's Cajun pie.

37
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:05,171
- Shall I open another?
- Oh, do you think we dare?

38
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:09,724
As long as you two stay away from
the band candy, I'm cool with anything.

39
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:13,604
You are a demon child.

40
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,572
- I live to torment you. Is that so wrong?
- A daughter's duty, I suppose.

41
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:19,962
Look, all we have to do is just cut off...

42
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:25,092
Mom? Mom?

43
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:28,483
Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom?

44
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,370
MOM?!

45
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:47,407
- 911 emergency.
- Hello?

46
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,768
It's my mom. She's not breathing.

47
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:53,129
- Is she conscious?
- No. I can't... She's not breathing.

48
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,602
I need you to give me your address.

49
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,811
- I'm gonna send an ambulance over.
- 1630 Revello.

50
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:02,851
It... it's a house. Revello, near Hadley.

51
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,050
I'm sending a unit right away.
Are you alone in the house?

52
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,886
- Yes.
- Did you see what happened? Did she fall?

53
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:12,852
No, no. I came home, and she...
What should I do?

54
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:15,401
Do you know how to administer CPR?

55
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:18,565
- No. I don't remember.
- OK. It's very simple.

56
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:20,962
You wanna tilt your mother's head back.

57
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:25,046
Cover her mouth with yours,
and breathe into her mouth.

58
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,727
I know this. I know this. God!

59
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,922
I can do this. I can do this.

60
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,524
I... Are you there? I broke something.

61
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,010
- Hello?
- It cracked.

62
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:01,049
- Is she breathing?
- No.

63
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:05,365
Paramedics should be there soon. You might
have cracked a rib. It's not important.

64
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:07,250
She's cold.

65
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:11,126
- The body is cold?
- No, my mom!

66
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:13,773
Should I make her warm?

67
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:18,802
No. If she's not responding to CPR, the best
thing is to wait for the paramedics, OK?

68
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:21,885
- When will they be here?
- They're very nearby.

69
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:44,162
I have to make a call.

70
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:05,608
- Hello?
- Giles. You have to come.

71
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:07,285
Buffy?

72
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,762
She's at the house.

73
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,524
She's in here.

74
00:06:57,413 --> 00:07:00,564
- I'm getting no pulse.
- Let's lay her out.

75
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:09,605
- How long's she been like this?
- I found her. A few minutes.

76
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,362
- Was she conscious?
- No.

77
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:13,647
- I'm baggin' her.
- What?

78
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,009
We'll intubate. Try to get her
to breathe. This your mother?

79
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:20,449
- Yes.
- She have any serious health problems?

80
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,525
No. I mean, there was a tumour.

81
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:29,367
A brain tumour. But she had an operation,
and she's fine now. She... she's been fine.

82
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:44,123
We got her! My God, we got her!
We never brought one back this late.

83
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,169
- Buffy?
- I'm here.

84
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:51,650
It's a miracle.
That's what it is - a beautiful miracle.

85
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:54,725
- Good as new.
- Buffy, thank God you found me in time...

86
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:12,161
She's cold, man.

87
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,321
Call it.

88
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:31,964
- I'm sorry.
- What do we do now?

89
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,046
I'm sorry, but I have to tell you
that your mother's dead.

90
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:42,244
She died a good while before you found
her. There's nothing you could have done.

91
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:48,963
I guess it was an aneurysm or clotting.

92
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:54,411
Some complication from surgery.
She probably felt...

93
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,768
very little pain.

94
00:08:56,853 --> 00:09:02,530
I'm gonna call it in. The coroner's office will
take her in and determine the cause of death.

95
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:05,730
Dispatch 7, we have a 206.
What's your status?

96
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:10,204
- We're moving.
- Location is Beaumont and 9th. Go now.

97
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:13,603
- We gotta fly.
- I'll call this now.

98
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:16,048
The coroner's office may take a while.

99
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:20,923
In the meanwhile, you should sit, have a
glass of water. Try not to disturb the body.

100
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,844
Do you need anything?
Is there someone you can call?

101
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,810
Someone's coming.

102
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:29,884
Let's go.

103
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,766
- I'm very sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:49,284
Good luck.

105
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:35,204
Buffy! What is it? Is it Glory?

106
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:40,692
I'm waiting. The... the coroner's coming.

107
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:43,333
- What?
- I have to tell Dawn.

108
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:47,729
She's at school. I'll go there.

109
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:50,168
I'm not sure...

110
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:52,892
No. No. Don't. No, it's too late.

111
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,771
- Joyce?
- They're coming for her. No, no. We're...

112
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:58,321
- Joyce!
- We're not supposed to move the body!

113
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:30,242
Oh, God.

114
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,085
I can't believe it.

115
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:34,289
It's not that bad.

116
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:38,491
- How can you say it's not that bad?
- I just don't think it's that big a deal.

117
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:43,402
Kevin Berman called me
a freak in front of everybody.

118
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:45,961
No, that's no big deal.

119
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,401
He didn't say you were a freak.

120
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:52,011
Forget it.

121
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:57,531
He just said you were... freaky. Which,
you know, freaky can be... sort of cool.

122
00:12:57,613 --> 00:12:59,922
Yeah. Real cool.

123
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,243
I'm a suicidal headcase.

124
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,848
It was Kirstie. She told people
you were into cutting yourself and...

125
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:11,929
That's such a lie! I got cut, by accident.
One time. Now Kevin thinks I'm a...

126
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:15,005
That was when you were
wigging out about your family.

127
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:19,086
And, of course, Kirstie's
gotta turn everything into a story.

128
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:22,526
She was telling people
that you were adopted.

129
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:25,207
What a primo bee-yatch.

130
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:29,764
I swear, if I could make her head explode
using only the power of my mind,

131
00:13:29,853 --> 00:13:32,651
that's what I'd be doing right about now.

132
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:37,409
Great. Now I look like a wet rat.

133
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:41,452
You can't go out looking all cry-face.
That'll give Kirstie more ammo.

134
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,322
You know, my big sister could
really beat the crap out of her.

135
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,802
I mean, really really.

136
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:55,132
What do you think? Can I show my face?

137
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:58,808
You're good to go.
We're gonna be late anyway.

138
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:06,011
Kirstie alert.

139
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:08,891
- Hey, Dawn.
- Hey.

140
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,966
- How you doing? You OK?
- Good. Thanks for asking.

141
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,850
Bee-yatch.

142
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:26,484
OK. Remember,
we're not drawing the object.

143
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:31,567
We're drawing
the negative space around the object.

144
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:34,081
Hey.

145
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,323
Oh. Hey, Kevin.

146
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:39,849
Give me a sense
of the spaces around.

147
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:42,649
The space in-between.

148
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:45,247
What's goin' on?

149
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,406
Um, negative space.

150
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:52,170
Yeah. What's that all about?

151
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,402
That's pretty good.

152
00:14:58,573 --> 00:14:59,926
Thanks.

153
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:08,927
I heard you had a freak-out and cut yourself.

154
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:11,482
Uh, no. Not even.

155
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:15,202
- It was a whole... It was so not...
- I've felt like that before.

156
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:20,566
Things get so crazed, you know?
You just feel like you wanna do something...

157
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,211
extreme.

158
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:24,252
Yeah.

159
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,972
I just... I had a lot of intense stuff going on.

160
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,163
A lot of people don't understand that. Pain.

161
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,212
Yeah.

162
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,771
Then Kirstie blabs it everywhere, cos she's...

163
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:42,689
It's like she thinks "I'm so hot, everybody
should just bow down before me."

164
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:45,162
And I'm like "Whatever."

165
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:49,932
She's so superficial.
Everything's about clothes, or who likes who.

166
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:53,528
And there's just way
more important stuff going on.

167
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:56,127
There's a lot of crucial...

168
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:58,010
you know, stuff.

169
00:15:58,293 --> 00:15:59,806
Yeah.

170
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:04,284
This one time in History, she had
this book called Annals of History.

171
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:07,729
She didn't know how to say "annals",
so she kept saying...

172
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,008
Dawn.

173
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,286
I have to talk to you.

174
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:23,164
Um... What?

175
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:28,245
Can it wait? I'm in the middle of class.

176
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,325
I know. Please, come with me.

177
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,601
I thought Mom was picking me up.

178
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,683
What's going on? Something's going on.

179
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:54,163
- Let's go outside.
- No. Tell me what's going on.

180
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:57,404
It's... bad... news.

181
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:01,087
Well, what is it? What happened?

182
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,725
- It's bad. Please, can we...
- Where's Mom?

183
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:12,611
Mom had an accident.

184
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:14,285
Or, um...

185
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:17,843
something went wrong, from the tumour.

186
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:22,805
Is she OK? Is she...

187
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:25,566
But she's OK? But...

188
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,564
It's serious, but...

189
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:29,530
Dawn...

190
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:52,129
I think they're here.

191
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:04,361
Do you wanna come up?

192
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,324
You're double-parked.

193
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:12,009
Let 'em give me a ticket.

194
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:17,084
What do you think?
The purple, right? Cos... cos it's sombre?

195
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:21,173
No. No, it's too depressing.

196
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:24,131
It's like I'm a funeral... guy.

197
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:27,691
Well, this is... this is cheerier.

198
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:31,925
Maybe I wanna be cheery,
like... like everything is normal?

199
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:35,012
No, that's rude. That's... that's disrespectful.

200
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:37,323
La-la-la! I don't care!

201
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:41,211
If I had that blue one...

202
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:45,332
Joyce really liked the blue one.
She told me one time.

203
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:47,165
You sure it's not in your room?

204
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,562
I... I can look again.

205
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:51,166
No, no.

206
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:54,370
I should... I should wear the purple.

207
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:57,092
The purple. I think the purple.

208
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,812
It's just that it's so...

209
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:03,249
I don't know.
It doesn't mean something bad?

210
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,972
I think it's, um... royal.

211
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:09,090
Purple means... royalty.

212
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:12,850
Well, I can't see Buffy
at the morgue and be all royal!

213
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:16,482
"Oh, I'm the king of everything.
I'm better than you!"

214
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:20,725
I have to be supportive.
Buffy needs me to be supportive. I mean...

215
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:27,126
God, why do all my shirts
have stupid things on them?

216
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,807
Why can't I just dress like a grown-up?

217
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:33,453
Can't I be a grown-up?

218
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,001
- Sh.
- Tara.

219
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:38,891
- Sh, darling.
- I can't do this.

220
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,007
We can do this.

221
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:54,130
OK. We can be there for Buffy.

222
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:58,163
And Dawn. Little Dawn.

223
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,089
We can be strong.

224
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:06,848
- Strong like an Amazon?
- Strong like an Amazon, right.

225
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,242
But I wish I had the blue.

226
00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:19,209
So, what do we do?

227
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:22,524
I'm not sure. Willow talked to Giles.

228
00:21:31,653 --> 00:21:34,451
Xander, what will we do?

229
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,001
What will we be expected to do?

230
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:50,445
Hey.

231
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:01,771
How you doing?

232
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:05,692
I know the feeling.

233
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,172
I'm afraid I'm gonna start to cry again.

234
00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:13,607
Xander cried at the apartment.

235
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:15,206
It was weird.

236
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,603
It's a... It's a thing we do.

237
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,444
What's going to happen?

238
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:37,205
Well, I...

239
00:22:37,293 --> 00:22:40,603
I guess we're gonna...
meet them at the morgue.

240
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,327
That's where they were taking her.

241
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:49,443
Um, Giles said that he was gonna go
with Joyce, and Buffy was gonna go to...

242
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,766
the school to tell Dawn.

243
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:56,088
God!

244
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:58,767
- Do you know how to get...
- Yeah.

245
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:01,321
It's at the hospital. It's a wing.

246
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:04,845
We do morgue time in the Scooby gang.

247
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:09,290
I have to change.

248
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:16,488
- What else did Giles say?
- Not a lot.

249
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:19,804
Are they sure this was... natural?
I mean, Glory.

250
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:22,327
Giles was pretty sure that it wasn't her.

251
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:25,211
But she said she was
gonna come after Buffy's family.

252
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:28,683
- I don't...
- I mean, she could have done it, and...

253
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:31,685
- covered her tracks.
- Why would she?

254
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:34,412
She'd want us to know.

255
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:40,087
I'll tell you what it is.
It's the frickin' doctors.

256
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:45,008
They just let her out. Clean bill of health. Dig
a hole in your skull - here's a Band-Aid. Next!

257
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:46,162
Xander...

258
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:49,165
They should have checked her.
They should have had her in.

259
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:52,484
We don't have enough monsters?
The doctors gotta help 'em out?

260
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:54,370
I don't think it was...

261
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:58,888
Itjust happened.

262
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,929
Things don't happen!

263
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:04,652
I mean... They don't just happen.

264
00:24:06,373 --> 00:24:08,284
Somebody...

265
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:12,329
I mean, somebody's got...

266
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:14,449
OK.

267
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:18,162
Let's go. Come on, you and me.

268
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:20,330
Come on.

269
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:34,883
You know I can't take you.

270
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,646
Damn straight.

271
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:41,841
- Are we gonna see the body?
- What?

272
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:47,612
Are we gonna be in the room
with the dead body?

273
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,727
I don't know.

274
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:52,292
No.

275
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:55,326
But I guess we should take over patrolling.

276
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:57,131
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

277
00:24:57,213 --> 00:25:00,011
- For however long.
- You know it.

278
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,522
I can't wear this.

279
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:08,013
I really should have the other.

280
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:11,084
Joyce liked it so.

281
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:15,491
Do you think you could have
left it in the laundry room?

282
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:17,052
Maybe.

283
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,966
I'll go check. I'll just be one minute.

284
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:22,044
We're cool.

285
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:28,886
- Are they gonna cut the body open?
- Oh, my God!

286
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:33,569
Would you just stop talking?
Just shut your mouth. Please.

287
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:36,167
- What am I doing?
- How can you act like that?

288
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:40,405
Am I supposed to be changing my clothes
a lot? Is that the helpful thing to do?

289
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:42,006
- Guys...
- You behave...

290
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:46,006
- Nobody will tell me.
- Because it's not OK to ask these things!

291
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:49,130
But I don't understand!

292
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:53,491
I don't understand how this all happens,
how we go through this.

293
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:57,202
I mean, I knew her, and then she's...
There's just a body.

294
00:25:57,293 --> 00:26:02,287
And I don't understand why she just can't
get back in it and not be dead any more.

295
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:05,683
It's stupid. It's mortal and stupid.

296
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:10,642
And Xander's crying and not talking. And
I was having fruit punch. And I thought...

297
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:14,089
"Well, Joyce will never have
any more fruit punch ever,

298
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:18,325
and she'll never have eggs,
or yawn or brush her hair, not ever."

299
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:21,723
And no one will explain to me why.

300
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:41,611
We don't know...

301
00:26:41,693 --> 00:26:44,446
how it works.

302
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,124
Or why.

303
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:23,090
Sorry. Sorry.

304
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:25,323
Some... pent-up...

305
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,131
Xander?

306
00:27:29,453 --> 00:27:33,924
- Where did your hand go?
- As I said, some frustration, and now, uh...

307
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,412
- I appear to be stuck.
- My God.

308
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:41,047
Is your hand OK?

309
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:45,092
Pretty much. I'm really sorry.

310
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:48,849
You could have hit an electrical... thing!

311
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:52,172
And once again with the sorry.

312
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,721
Did it make you feel better?

313
00:27:54,813 --> 00:27:58,123
- For a second there.
- A whole second?

314
00:27:58,213 --> 00:28:02,525
- In my defence, some crappy wallmanship.
- Yeah. You can hear everything next door.

315
00:28:04,253 --> 00:28:07,768
- Who did the dry wall in this place?
- I always forget to ask.

316
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:11,368
- Did I miss something?
- Xander decided that he blames the wall.

317
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:14,126
- Can you turn your wrist?
- Hold on.

318
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,643
It's OK.

319
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,489
It hurts.

320
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,801
Here, wash it off.

321
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:36,362
- Band-Aids?
- Underneath.

322
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:40,402
I couldn't find it.

323
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:43,644
It doesn't matter. We should get there.

324
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:45,526
Yes.

325
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:48,642
I wanna be there for Buffy.

326
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:53,409
You're right.
The Avengers gotta get with the assembling.

327
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:56,132
We'll go. We'll deal.

328
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:58,886
We'll help. That's what we do.

329
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,964
We help Buffy.

330
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:04,882
How are we going to help?

331
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:23,126
If there's anything we can do...

332
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:25,204
Glad you're here.

333
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:33,133
- Love you so much.
- I know.

334
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:35,681
They're not telling us anything.

335
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:46,490
Doctor?

336
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:04,121
- OK, I've examined your mother's body.
- Can we see her?

337
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,610
Dawn, not now.

338
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:10,242
The on-site report seems
more or less accurate.

339
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,484
Your mother did have
what looks like an aneurysm.

340
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:17,691
A sudden haemorrhaging from
a ruptured arterial vessel near the...

341
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:21,686
- Where the tumour was removed.
- Shouldn't we have known about that?

342
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:23,331
That... was a danger?

343
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:28,485
Sometimes these things are detectable,
and sometimes they're not.

344
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:32,885
Joyce was aware of the possibility
of a rupture, and the effects.

345
00:31:32,973 --> 00:31:37,649
She didn't even get on the phone,
so clearly this was very sudden.

346
00:31:38,493 --> 00:31:43,772
She may have felt a little nausea,
and probably passed out as it happened.

347
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:48,924
I doubt there was much pain,
and even if someone had been by her side...

348
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:50,571
- My head.
- Mom?

349
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:55,451
..it's doubtful that this
could have been dealt with in time.

350
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:01,923
Thank you, Doctor.

351
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:06,325
Are you sure...
that there wasn't a lot of pain?

352
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:08,326
Absolutely.

353
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:11,769
I have to lie to make you feel better.

354
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:15,845
What, uh... What needs to be done now?

355
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:20,768
Well, there, uh... there'll be some forms,
and some decisions you'll need to make.

356
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:23,811
Buffy, why don't you let me
handle those as much as I can?

357
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:27,442
- Please.
- We will need you to sign release forms.

358
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:30,001
Yes. Thank you, Doctor.

359
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,561
I'll figure out which ones you need to see.

360
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,850
We'll be here.

361
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:40,970
What did the doctor say?

362
00:32:41,053 --> 00:32:45,205
Nothing. It's, you know,
it's what we thought, the tumour.

363
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:48,529
Why don't we sit down?

364
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:56,691
Giles says he's gonna go over the paperwork.

365
00:32:57,773 --> 00:33:01,243
Man, if there's one day they
should not give you homework.

366
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,324
Dawnie, do you wanna sit?

367
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:08,005
I don't think we're gonna
have to be here very long.

368
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:10,084
What about...

369
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:13,608
What about what?

370
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:16,161
Nothing. I have to pee.

371
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:19,802
- Do you want someone to go with you?
- No.

372
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:22,805
- I still remember how to pee.
- Do you know where it is?

373
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:24,690
Yeah.

374
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:30,045
I think maybe she's mad at me or something.

375
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:34,763
- Cos you were the one that told her?
- How'd she take it?

376
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:38,963
Meltdown.

377
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:41,647
She just wouldn't believe me.

378
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:44,964
I still don't think she does.

379
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:47,692
I wish that Joyce didn't die.

380
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:55,324
Because she was nice.
And now we all hurt.

381
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:00,003
Anya, ever the wordsmith.

382
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,563
Thank you.

383
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:10,526
Do you want anything?
Something to eat, or soda?

384
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:14,041
Honestly, I couldn't tell.

385
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:18,003
Well, I think you should
try to eat something.

386
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:20,561
Yeah, maybe Dawn could use a snack.

387
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:24,484
I'll find something.
Xander, do you have any money?

388
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:27,645
- We'll come with.
- We'll be right quick.

389
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:40,771
I'm sorry you have to go through all of this.

390
00:34:42,653 --> 00:34:45,121
You don't have to worry about me.

391
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,721
Everybody wants to help.

392
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,802
I don't even know if I'm... here.

393
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:58,641
I don't know what's going on.

394
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:02,724
Never done this.

395
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:06,850
That's just an amazingly dumb thing to say.

396
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:10,323
Obviously, I've never done this before.

397
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:17,244
I have.

398
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:21,205
My mother died when I was 17.

399
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:27,367
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

400
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:29,842
No, no. I didn't mean to...

401
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:33,651
I'm only telling you this because...

402
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:36,531
I know it's not my place, but...

403
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:40,406
There's things...

404
00:35:40,493 --> 00:35:43,087
thoughts and reactions I had that I couldn't...

405
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:49,407
understand or even try
to explain to anyone else.

406
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:54,932
Thoughts that made
me feel like I was losing it,

407
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:58,164
or like I was some kind of horrible person.

408
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,401
I know it's different for you...

409
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:08,329
because it's always different,
but if you ever need....

410
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:25,722
Was it sudden?

411
00:36:25,813 --> 00:36:28,725
- What?
- Your mother.

412
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:31,850
No.

413
00:36:33,813 --> 00:36:35,644
And yes.

414
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:39,768
It's always sudden.

415
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:56,331
We panicked.

416
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:57,966
Uh-huh.

417
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:02,126
- Have anything you want.
- The sandwiches are meat.

418
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,607
I'm just not hungry.

419
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:08,491
What about Dawnie?

420
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:11,565
- Is she still in the bathroom?
- I guess.

421
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:15,522
You guys wait here.

422
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,250
Dawn?

423
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:21,884
Is she cold?

424
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:26,164
It's not her.

425
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,721
It's not her.

426
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:32,804
She's gone.

427
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:37,804
Where'd she go?

428
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:26,202
