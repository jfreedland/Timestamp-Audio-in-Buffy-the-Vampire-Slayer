1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,221
In every generation, there is a Chosen One,

2
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:10,479
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness,

3
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:13,052
She is the Slayer,

4
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:24,555
- Come on, Mom. Please?
- I'm sorry, honey.

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,873
Don't you understand
how important this is?

6
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:30,407
It's an outfit.
An outfit that you may never buy.

7
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:34,399
- But... I looked good in it.
- You looked like a streetwalker.

8
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:36,863
But a thin streetwalker.

9
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:39,778
That's probably not gonna be
the winning argument, is it?

10
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:41,755
You're just too young to wear that.

11
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:44,153
Yeah, and I'm gonna be too young to wear it
until I'm too old to wear it.

12
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:45,945
That's the idea!

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,732
The stores are closing and I still need
to order the flyers for the opening.

14
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:54,386
OK. I'll go to the printers,
and then get our food.

15
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,938
You go to the tailor and pick up my outfit
from Everyday Woman.

16
00:00:57,973 --> 00:00:59,999
- "Everyday Woman"?
- Mm-hm. There's the receipt.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,297
Why didn't you
just go to Muumuus R Us?

18
00:01:02,332 --> 00:01:05,773
Do now. Make fun of your mother later.

19
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:17,261
Turn around, baby.
I've somethin' to show ya.

20
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:20,287
Wait a sec. This is my high score.

21
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:26,683
Well, ain't you just got
the prettiest little neck I ever did see?

22
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:31,317
Boy! You guys really never come up
with any new lines, do you?

23
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:35,554
Do you mind? We were talking here.

24
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,218
But you promised
you'd never cheat on me again, honey.

25
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:43,870
- Um... I'd better go.
- But I ain't done yet.

26
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:51,299
All right, sugar lips.

27
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:56,681
Giddy up.

28
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:03,869
Oh, you're a rough one,
ain't ya? I like that.

29
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:13,314
You must be that slayer
I've been hearin' so much about.

30
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,549
Lyle Gorch. Pleased to meet ya.

31
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:19,374
The pleasure's mine.

32
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,868
This ain't over.

33
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:31,200
Oh, sure. They say they'll call...

34
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,655
Oh, bliss. Mall food.

35
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,742
- Buffy?
- Mom?

36
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:48,048
- Where's my dress?
- Your dre...

37
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:52,523
- Oh... Oh, God.
- Let me guess.

38
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:55,275
- You were distracted by a boy.
- Technically.

39
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,797
- Buffy!
- Look, I can go get it right now.

40
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:02,843
They're closed.
I'll just have to fit it in tomorrow.

41
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,255
- Sorry.
- A little responsibility is all I ask.

42
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,594
Honestly, don't you ever think about
anything besides boys and clothes?

43
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:13,259
Saving the world from vampires?

44
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:18,627
I swear, sometimes I don't know
what goes on in your head.

45
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,395
<b>"Bad Eggs"</b>

46
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,111
- Xander?
- Shhh-sh-sh.

47
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:26,086
It's just that... I'm worried
we're gonna miss class.

48
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,955
You know what? This would work
a lot better for me if you didn't talk.

49
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,456
Well, it'd work a lot better for me
with the lights off.

50
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:46,796
Are you saying that you can't look at me
when we... do... whatever it is we do?

51
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:50,627
No, it's not that I can't.
It's just more... I don't want to.

52
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:53,494
That's great! That's just dandy.
We're repulsed by each other.

53
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:56,904
- We... we hide from our friends...
- Well, I should hope so. Please!

54
00:05:57,361 --> 00:06:00,719
All in all this is not what I'd call
a big self-esteem booster.

55
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,831
Tell me about it. Just look at you!
And those clothes.

56
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,678
Where did you get those shoes?

57
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:08,829
- OK. You know what? I don't need this.
- Ditto. Like a hole in the head.

58
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:21,559
S-E-X. Sex.

59
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:25,548
The sex drive
in the human animal is intense.

60
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,914
How many of us have lost
countless productive hours

61
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,054
plagued by unwanted
sexual thoughts and feelings?

62
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,970
- Yes.
- That was a rhetorical question,

63
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,785
- Mr. Harris, not a poll.
- Oh.

64
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,251
Of course, for teenagers
such as yourselves,

65
00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:42,588
these feelings are
even more overwhelming.

66
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:48,073
With all sorts of hormones surging through
your bodies, compelling you to action,

67
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,315
it's often difficult to remember

68
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:54,144
that there are negative consequences to...
having sex.

69
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:57,045
Would anyone care to
offer one such consequence?

70
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,062
Well, that depends.
Are you talking about sex

71
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:03,787
in the car, or out of the car?
Because I have a friend - not me -

72
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:08,041
that was in a Miata parked on top of
the hill and she kicked the gearshift...

73
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:11,249
Yeah, I was thinking of something
more commonplace, Ms Chase.

74
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:15,046
You wanna talk negative consequence?
What about the heartbreak of halitosis?

75
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:17,961
I mean, a girl may seem spiffy,
but if she ignores her flossing,

76
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:21,703
the bloom is definitely off the rose.

77
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:23,809
Like that compares to
kissing a guy who thinks

78
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,056
the Hoover technique is a big turn-on!

79
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:29,092
What about having to feign interest in
her vapid little chitchat

80
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:31,430
- just so you can get some touch?
- Now!

81
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:34,324
Another consequence
of sexual activity? Anyone?

82
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:36,237
Uh, else?

83
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:40,188
How about pregnancy?
That would be a major one, right?

84
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:42,494
Thank you, Ms Rosenberg.
Among teens,

85
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:47,405
unwanted pregnancy is the No.1
negative consequence of sexual activity.

86
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,860
So, as discussed last week,
I present you with...

87
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:54,464
your offspring.
You will split into parenting teams,

88
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:58,644
You and your partner will share equally
in the daily task of raising your egg.

89
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:03,108
Now, please choose a partner
and come pick up your children.

90
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:08,248
You wanna have a baby?

91
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:13,669
Hey. I know we just met,

92
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,133
but isn't that Xander Junior
you're holding?

93
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,137
Buffy! How come you weren't in class?

94
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,449
Vampire issues.
Did Mr. Whitmore notice I was tardy?

95
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:32,124
I think the word you're
searching for is "absent".

96
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,884
- Tardy people show.
- Right.

97
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,211
And yes, he did notice,
so he wanted me to give you this.

98
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:43,150
As far as punishments go,
this is fairly abstract.

99
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:45,950
No! It's your baby.

100
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,719
OK, I get it even less.

101
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:50,131
Well, you know, it's the
"sex leads to responsibility" thing,

102
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:51,726
which I, personally, don't get.

103
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,712
You gotta take care of the egg.
It's a baby.

104
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:56,129
You gotta keep it safe
and teach it Christian values.

105
00:08:56,164 --> 00:09:00,250
- My egg is Jewish.
- Then teach it that Dreidel song.

106
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:03,757
I can't do this.
I can't take care of things!

107
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:07,487
I killed my Giga Pet.
Literally. I sat on it and it broke.

108
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:10,453
You'll do fine.

109
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:13,992
Yeah. The only thing that stresses me is,
when do we tell them they're adopted?

110
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:18,040
I'll just lay that one off
on my partner. Who'd I get?

111
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:22,734
Well, there were an uneven number
of students, and you didn't show, so...

112
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,159
- I'm a single mother?
- No man of her own.

113
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:30,266
Do you know what this says about me?
That I'm doomed to lead my mother's life.

114
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:33,057
- How deeply scary is that?
- How about this?

115
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:35,663
It says nothing, it means nothing.

116
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:37,954
This whole egg experiment
is completely pointless.

117
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:40,201
Success! At last!

118
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:44,094
Your playmate is
a fellow of repute, it seems.

119
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:49,116
It's, erm, Lyle Gorch.
And that one's his brother, Tector.

120
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:51,379
They're from Abilene. They, uh,
they made their reputation by

121
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:54,824
massacring an entire
Mexican village in 1886.

122
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:59,539
- Friendly little demons.
- That was before they became vampires.

123
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:03,241
But, um... the good news is
that they're...

124
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:05,585
not amongst the great thinkers
of our time.

125
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,735
I doubt if they're up to much.
They're probably just

126
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,972
drawn here by
the Hellmouth's energy.

127
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:12,361
Enough said. I propose
Buffy slays them. All in favor?

128
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:13,938
- Aye.
- I don't think you should

129
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:18,858
underestimate them. I mean,
you may need to have some help if-if...

130
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:22,252
Why do you all have eggs?

131
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:26,364
Hey, maybe you can have
Angel help you find the Gorches.

132
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,097
Yes, yes, that's not a bad idea.
Strength in numbers.

133
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:32,856
All right. I see a lot of hunting
getting done in that scenario.

134
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:35,098
Please. Like Angel and I are just

135
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:38,245
helpless slaves to passion.
Grow up.

136
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:46,353
- We really...
- I know.

137
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:52,481
You know, this isn't hunting
in the classical sense. We should...

138
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:55,220
You're right.

139
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:00,132
- OK.
- OK.

140
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,183
- You see anything?
- No.

141
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:11,407
- OK... Enough hunting.
- Yeah.

142
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:26,642
- That the Slayer?
- Yep.

143
00:11:26,677 --> 00:11:30,080
- Ain't that Angelus with her?
- Yep.

144
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:32,463
Well, how come she ain't slayin'?

145
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:35,784
And how come
he's about to make me blush?

146
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,869
Well, I don't know, Tector. And how come

147
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,887
you're always askin' me
so many stupid questions?

148
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:44,554
So, you wanna take him,
or, uh... you want me to, Lyle?

149
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,747
I say we leave it.
Wait till she's alone.

150
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:52,076
Why? You scared?

151
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:56,367
No. I could whip 'em both
right now if I wanted to.

152
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:58,472
Then why don't ya?

153
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,985
'Cause I got me a plan.

154
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:04,375
I'm the one that does the thinkin',
remember?

155
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:10,178
Yeah. You do the thinkin', Lyle.
That is definitely your department.

156
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:15,749
So why don't you tell me again
why we can't kill 'em now?

157
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,729
OK, little egg dude. Let's see...

158
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:24,137
Feeding... Check.

159
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:27,028
Burping... Ugh. Check.

160
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:32,167
Diapers... Sort of. In theory, I guess.

161
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:34,407
OK.

162
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:42,303
Good night, Egbert.

163
00:13:55,729 --> 00:14:01,111
I'm tired of rat. How come
we can't stay in a nice place?

164
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:05,973
A motel or somethin'. Maybe, uh...
maybe one with an ice machine.

165
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:11,101
'Cause we got to keep a low profile till
we get this slayer business taken care of.

166
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:14,468
Well, how come Angelus is
gettin' all cuddly with her, Lyle?

167
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,822
I mean, does the man have no code?

168
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,714
Tector?

169
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,277
Are you gonna be pestering me
with these questions all damn day?

170
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:28,300
I just don't like it here. There ain't
a decent whore in the whole city limits.

171
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,876
So this is the thanks I get?

172
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,895
Well...

173
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:37,950
Don't I take care of ya?
Didn't I near raise you myself?

174
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:41,273
Hm? Burden that you were,
maybe I shoulda left you on that doorstep

175
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:44,759
- when Momma blew town.
- Don't say that, Lyle.

176
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:48,266
- Now I'm takin' care of this.
- You afraid of the girl?

177
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,915
I'm just playin' it safe.

178
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,135
We're just gonna follow her around
a little while, find our time.

179
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,096
- 'Cause this ain't over.
- I think you are afraid of the Slayer.

180
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,420
All right. I'm gonna beat you
like a redheaded stepchild.

181
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:04,146
Throw your ass out
in that sunlight. C'mon.

182
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:07,741
- You think you can?
- Giddy up, son.

183
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:22,904
Yippe-ki-yay, matey!

184
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:41,327
Oh... Oh, God.

185
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,912
At least eat something
if you're gonna drink that.

186
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,720
Not that hungry.

187
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,865
- How's the parenting going?
- Fine.

188
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,256
Are you sure your egg is secure in that?

189
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,622
Did I ask for back-seat mommying?

190
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:09,678
- Are we a little touchy this morning?
- No. I just feel all funky.

191
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:12,742
Hm... You don't have a fever.

192
00:16:12,777 --> 00:16:16,641
Oh, no, it's not that.
I just... I didn't sleep well.

193
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,808
What's the matter?
Your egg keep you up all night?

194
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:23,519
You're killing me. Parenting's a pain.

195
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:26,376
Wait till it starts dating.

196
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,985
Oh! Why are you three hanging about?

197
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:40,770
- Don't you have classes to go to?
- Teen Health got cancelled.

198
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:44,614
Mr. Whitmore is ab. He couldn't
find an egg-sitter or somethin'.

199
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:47,551
- Well, then. Can you give me a hand?
- No.

200
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:49,589
Sure.

201
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:53,445
How did the, um...
hunt go last night, Buffy?

202
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,972
No go.

203
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:59,718
Er... no, you didn't go,
or... or you were unsuccessful?

204
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,463
- No Gorches.
- Apparently Buffy has decided

205
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:05,297
the problem with the English language
is all those pesky words.

206
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:09,726
You... Angel... big... smoochies?

207
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,111
- Shut... up.
- It-it's true, Buffy.

208
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:15,392
You and Willow do seem a little sluggish.
Are you quite sure everything's alright?

209
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:19,578
- Maybe something we ate.
- Or perhaps it's the burden of parenthood.

210
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,519
Notice how seriously
you two have taken this egg thing.

211
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:25,709
While I, in turn, have, uh,
well, chosen a...

212
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,781
more balanced approach.

213
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,337
- Xander! Maybe you shouldn't...
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

214
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:33,964
You can't stress over every little thing.
A child picks up on that.

215
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,838
Which is a one-way ticket to Neurotic City.

216
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:43,116
It didn't break. How come it didn't break?

217
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:47,013
Which is another secret to
conscientious egg care.

218
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,144
Pot of scalding water and about 8 minutes.

219
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:51,741
- You boiled your young?
- Yeah! I know it sounds cruel,

220
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:53,959
but sometimes
you gotta be cruel to be kind.

221
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:57,193
I mean, you can bet that little Xander here
is thick-skinned now.

222
00:17:57,228 --> 00:17:59,968
Technically, that would be cheating, yes?

223
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:04,014
No. It's like a shortcut.
You know, when you run a race?

224
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:07,467
- That would also be cheating.
- You should be ashamed.

225
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:09,217
I suppose there is a sort of...

226
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:11,558
Machiavellian ingenuity
to your transgression.

227
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:13,467
I resent that!

228
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,933
Or possibly thank you.

229
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,279
Figures you three would all be
hanging in the dungeon

230
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,488
while something major's going on
at Sunnydale High.

231
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:24,155
And what would that be, Cordelia?
Barrette Appreciation Day?

232
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,158
- Mr. Whitmore didn't show today.
- That news is of the past.

233
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:30,518
He's missing.

234
00:18:30,553 --> 00:18:33,648
- Presumed dead.
- Presumed by whom?

235
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:35,556
Well, me.

236
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:38,815
I think we should give him a few hours
before we give up on him completely.

237
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,969
Well, I think we should look around.
Don't you, Xander?

238
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:43,932
- It can wait.
- Well, his body

239
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,161
could fall out of a closet somewhere.

240
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:49,751
So we should check some closets
to see if he's in... a closet?

241
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:53,875
You're right.
There could be a closet. Let's go.

242
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,096
You guys look for more clues.
We'll meet back here.

243
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:59,681
- We'll get right on it.
- Are they getting weirder?

244
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:02,224
Have you noticed the weirdness of them?

245
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:06,812
They're weird. Should I have guilt
about not looking for Mr. Whitmore?

246
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:10,539
I'd rather you conserve your strength
for hunting the Gorches.

247
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:13,900
I'll be fine by tonight.
Maybe I'll sweep the cemetery.

248
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:17,191
Well, be careful. If you're still
feeling a little sluggish...

249
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:19,015
No worries.

250
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,339
- And Angel's helping you, right?
- He does what he can.

251
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:35,297
As much as I hate to say this,
we should really go kill bad guys.

252
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:38,681
It's late. You should get home.

253
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:41,548
- What about the Gorches?
- I'll hunt.

254
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,780
Really? You'd do that?

255
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,162
Not like I have an early day tomorrow.

256
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:50,059
True. I still have to go home
and fill out my egg diary.

257
00:19:50,094 --> 00:19:52,133
- Your what?
- Oh, I told you that.

258
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:54,759
Faux parenting gig
we're doing at school.

259
00:19:54,764 --> 00:19:57,823
Like I'm really planning
to have kids anytime soon.

260
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:01,033
Maybe... someday in the future,
when I'm done having a life.

261
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,444
But... right now, kids would be
a little too much to deal with.

262
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,675
I wouldn't know.

263
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,182
I don't...

264
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:11,554
Well, you know, I, I can't.

265
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,824
Oh... That's OK. Um...

266
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:18,628
I... I figured there were all sorts
of things vampires can't do.

267
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:23,736
Like... work for the telephone company,
or volunteer for the Red Cross,

268
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:27,033
or... have little vampires.

269
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:29,714
So you don't think about the future?

270
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,708
- No.
- Never?

271
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,589
No.

272
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:37,536
You really don't care
what happens a year from now?

273
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,900
Five years from now?

274
00:20:39,935 --> 00:20:42,115
Angel, when I look
into the future, a-a...

275
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,580
all I see is you.

276
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:51,207
All I want is you.

277
00:20:52,438 --> 00:20:55,981
I know the feeling.

278
00:21:55,419 --> 00:22:00,689
Hello? Is anybody in here?

279
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:01,646
- Come on, pick up.
- Hello?

280
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:04,196
- Willow, are you OK?
- Why shouldn't I be?

281
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:07,900
- Your egg. Is it doing anything?
- Doing what?

282
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:10,783
Break it. Right now. I want you to
smash it with something heavy.

283
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:14,003
- Buffy, what...
- My egg. It went... went postal on me!

284
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:17,302
The thing hatched, and it, it sprung this
creepy-crawly thing, and it attacked me!

285
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:20,553
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine. But-but your egg...

286
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:24,119
Is totally normal.
I... I put it in the fridge.

287
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:26,400
Oh...

288
00:25:26,435 --> 00:25:30,403
Maybe it's a trap. Something
the Gorch brothers planted for you?

289
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:33,550
Maybe. Yeah. Uh...

290
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:37,363
I'm sorry. I shouldn't've
woken you. Go, go back to sleep.

291
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:40,597
- You sure?
- Yeah! Yeah, I'm, I'm better.

292
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:42,578
I'm, I'm fine.

293
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:45,343
OK. I'll see you tomorrow.

294
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:05,322
What's going on in here?

295
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:10,042
Buffy, who are you talking to at this...
Why are you dressed?

296
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,676
Where exactly do you think you are going
at this hour of the night?

297
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:15,761
- Nowhere.
- Who was that on the phone?

298
00:26:15,796 --> 00:26:19,442
Um... Willow.
She wasn't feeling well today,

299
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,037
so I was calling to make sure
she was feeling better.

300
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,060
You're gonna have to do
much better than that, young lady.

301
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:27,020
- I had a bad dream?
- Oh, no,

302
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:29,758
you're about to have a bad dream -
a dream that you're grounded

303
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,095
for the rest of your natural life.
Which means...

304
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,858
no after-school socializing,
no Bronze, no nothing.

305
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:38,221
Not until I say so. Do you understand?

306
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:40,925
- Yeah, but I think you...
- Now, school ends at 2:30 -

307
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,651
I want you to go to the library at 2:33,

308
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:47,614
and study until I pick you up there
at 5:30. Understood?

309
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:51,629
- Yeah.
- Good. Have a nice day.

310
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:10,582
- Nice bear. Listen, is your...
- Hey, I'll have you know

311
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:13,410
that my father brought this bear
back from Gstaad years ago.

312
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,842
Then all of a sudden these trendoids
everywhere started sporting them.

313
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,063
So I'm totally not wearing it.
Then I thought "Hey,"

314
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:21,245
"I'm the one who started this
nationwide craze. What am I ashamed of?"

315
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,456
OK, Soliloquy Girl.
I just wanted to ask about your egg.

316
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:27,887
- My egg?
- Yeah, your egg.

317
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:30,952
- The one Mr. Whitmore gave you.
- It's in my bear.

318
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,779
So... your egg isn't acting
odd or anything?

319
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:39,061
It isn't "acting" anything.
It's an egg, Buffy. It doesn't emote.

320
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:42,986
- Shanice! Is that your real hair?
- Yeah...

321
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:44,928
- Hey.
- Hi.

322
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:51,128
Mm. Cardboardy!

323
00:27:57,714 --> 00:28:01,066
Sorry, Junior, but a man's gotta eat.

324
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:08,508
So was there any more
hatchling activity last night?

325
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:12,702
No. You were probably right.
It was just a trap the vamps set for me.

326
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:16,168
And... everyone else's eggs
seem perfectly normal.

327
00:28:16,203 --> 00:28:18,678
Did you bring the thing
that attacked you?

328
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:22,604
Yeah. Giles wants to see it.
He's in full research mode.

329
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:24,874
OK. Well, bring it to the science lab,

330
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,308
and I'll get Giles and we'll analyze it.

331
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:31,197
Great. You know, I always say
that a day without an autopsy

332
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:33,484
is like a day without sunshine.

333
00:28:36,026 --> 00:28:38,073
Hey.

334
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:48,688
Can I just say... "gyugh!"

335
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,516
I see your "gyugh"
and raise you a "nyagh!"

336
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:54,965
- What is it?
- We don't know what it is, Cordelia.

337
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,258
That's why we're here. Capeesh?

338
00:28:57,293 --> 00:29:00,016
"Capeesh"? What are you -
world traveler now?

339
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:03,186
Hey, where's Giles?
I know he won't wanna miss this.

340
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:07,169
He said to get started.
He'll be by as soon as possible.

341
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:10,416
So, OK. Get started, Buffy.
Dissect it or something.

342
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:14,040
- Me? Why do I have to dissect it?
- Uh, because you're the Slayer.

343
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,458
And I slayed. My work here is done.

344
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,327
Oh, no! I almost ate one of these things.

345
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:20,792
I think I fulfilled my gross-out quota
for the decade.

346
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:24,127
- Guys!
- Do we even know what to look for?

347
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,457
I mean, how are we supposed
to figure out what this thing is?

348
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:29,124
Turn it over.
Maybe we missed its ID bracelet.

349
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,781
So, now I guess, uh, we know
what happened to Mr. Whitmore.

350
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:35,786
- He saw this and ran away?
- Try "best-case scenario".

351
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:38,673
It's possible that
Mr. Whitmore wasn't harmed.

352
00:29:38,714 --> 00:29:42,337
Maybe the offspring simply used him
to return to the mother bezoar.

353
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:44,508
Yeah. Maybe he... What?

354
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:47,273
- What's a bezo...
- Cordy! What...

355
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:11,034
Buffy?

356
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:20,374
- Hello?
- Hello.

357
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:23,297
Oh! Mr. Giles. Hi.

358
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:27,185
I was looking for Buffy.
She was supposed to wait for me here.

359
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,930
Well, sh-she hasn't been in.
I-I've been waiting to talk to her myself

360
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,807
about, uh, uh... h-history texts.

361
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:36,348
- That is just the last straw.
- I'm sure she didn't mean to, uh...

362
00:31:36,368 --> 00:31:39,953
She never means to, but somehow
she always manages to anyway.

363
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:43,194
- Do you have children, Mr. Giles?
- Um...

364
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:45,995
- Should I be whispering?
- No!

365
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,457
A-a-and, uh, no,
I, I haven't any children.

366
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:51,940
A-although, uh, sometimes I feel
as though I do, uh, working here...

367
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:57,150
They can be such a... Oh,
I don't want to say "burden", but, uh...

368
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,746
Actually, I kind of
do want to say "burden".

369
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:02,598
Feel free.

370
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:06,155
- Oh, they're just so irresponsible.
- Sometimes.

371
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:10,892
"Bristow's Demon Index"?.
"Hell's Offspring"?.

372
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:15,819
A hobby of mine. But having
nothing to do with Buffy in any way.

373
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:22,424
Um... you say Buffy told you
that she'd be here - all afternoon?

374
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:25,771
Well, yes. Is something wrong?

375
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:29,244
No. I'm sure it's nothing.

376
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:32,067
- What was that?
- Probably the janitor.

377
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:01,532
Hey! Xander. Hey!

378
00:33:02,092 --> 00:33:04,235
You all right?

379
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,614
Last time Cordy dragged me
in here, it was a lot nicer.

380
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:12,873
- What?
- Huh? Nothing. Uh...

381
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,504
Crazy talk. Head trauma.

382
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,483
Tell me about it.
I'm gonna have a big bump.

383
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:21,558
Uh, I'm gonna have a peninsula... here.

384
00:33:21,593 --> 00:33:25,725
What... What the hell's goin' on?
Cordy and Willow...?

385
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:29,068
Something to do with
the hatchlings, I'm sure of it.

386
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:31,901
What, are they possessed?

387
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:35,391
I don't know.
But they sure wanted us out of the way.

388
00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:39,419
Why not kill us? Why, uh...
why drag us in here?

389
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:42,739
Oh!

390
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:45,122
Bad now.

391
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:50,220
Thank you. Oh!

392
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:53,923
- Giles!
- Giles!

393
00:33:54,153 --> 00:33:55,899
He must be out somewhere.

394
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,749
Well, he picked a hell of a time
to get a life.

395
00:33:57,784 --> 00:34:00,247
- What do we do?
- We can't fight these things

396
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:03,626
- till we know something about 'em.
- Willow said something - a name.

397
00:34:03,661 --> 00:34:05,265
- What was it?
- A bozo!

398
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:08,975
- Not bozo.
- A bezoar!

399
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:13,097
That's it! OK. So now... we look it up?

400
00:34:13,457 --> 00:34:16,366
- In what?
- A book?

401
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,992
Giles said he was gonna
try to find something...

402
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:29,264
And I'd say he found something.

403
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,744
I'd say something found him.

404
00:35:28,683 --> 00:35:32,806
"Pre-prehistoric parasite. The mother
hibernates underground, laying eggs."

405
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,735
"The offspring then
attach themselves to a host,"

406
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:37,460
"taking control of their motor functions
through neural clamping.'

407
00:35:37,495 --> 00:35:40,883
"Neural clamping"?
That sounds skippable.

408
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:43,654
So, our people are taking orders
from the mamma bezoar.

409
00:35:43,728 --> 00:35:46,562
- Which begs the question...
- What does Momma want?

410
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:50,089
Somebody help me! Get this thing
off me! Get this thing off me!

411
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:52,713
Help!

412
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:54,763
Are you OK?

413
00:35:54,764 --> 00:35:57,801
I'm fine. I slipped.

414
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:03,092
- I think I hear Mommy calling...
- Uh-huh.

415
00:36:26,357 --> 00:36:30,456
- Do we really wanna go in there?
- We really don't.

416
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:41,093
Careful.

417
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:56,865
What are they diggin' up?

418
00:37:01,462 --> 00:37:03,608
Oh, boy.

419
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:07,958
We can't let them spread those eggs.

420
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,536
I'll handle it. Um, can you,
uh, hold down the fort?

421
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:15,580
I'm gonna need a weapon.
I'm gonna need a big weapon.

422
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:17,313
Yeah.

423
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:59,019
- I told you this weren't over.
- She's so cute, and little.

424
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:01,020
Think we can keep her?

425
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:03,761
Guys, this really isn't a great time.

426
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:06,282
Oh, it's gonna be.

427
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:12,757
Hey! That's my brother!

428
00:38:18,552 --> 00:38:21,345
What the hell is this?

429
00:38:22,214 --> 00:38:24,292
Mom?

430
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:26,886
Kill them.

431
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:42,014
What the hell is goin' on?

432
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:45,609
Long story.

433
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,957
Cordelia! I don't want to hurt you...
some of the time.

434
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,568
That's my bump!

435
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:38,682
Well, all right!

436
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:46,990
Well, lookee there!

437
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,142
Well, hello!

438
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,643
Tector!

439
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,681
Tector?

440
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:10,158
- This is all your fault.
- How?

441
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:15,768
All right. It's over.

442
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:32,356
Yes, yes, uh, i-i-it was a-a,
a gas leak, everyone.

443
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:36,627
But just, er... get some air...
and, er... a good night's rest, you know.

444
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:40,658
You'll be fine. These gas things...
do happen, actually.

445
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:42,649
- W-w-what was it really?
- Stick with the gas thing.

446
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,296
- I'll fill you in tomorrow.
- Right.

447
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,777
How you guys doin'?

448
00:41:49,013 --> 00:41:51,269
- Did I really hit you?
- You knocked me out.

449
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,318
- Did I hit you?
- Yes! Everyone hit me.

450
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:56,016
Good. Well, I don't mean
"good" because I hit you,

451
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:58,256
but I didn't want to be left out.

452
00:42:00,297 --> 00:42:03,111
- How is she?
- She's a bit confused, but...

453
00:42:03,112 --> 00:42:05,313
It's going around.

454
00:42:12,835 --> 00:42:14,810
- Are you OK?
- Buffy, I was worried.

455
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:17,663
you'd gotten caught in the building.
There, there was a gas leak.

456
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,255
Yeah, I just heard. I was in the gym.

457
00:42:20,357 --> 00:42:24,518
- I went looking for you in the library.
- Oh, well, I was on my way there when I...

458
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:27,647
I thought I made it pretty clear that
you weren't to leave the library

459
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:29,862
- till I came.
- The other side of that is

460
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:31,604
- there was a gas leak...
- I'm not really interested

461
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:33,521
in the other side right now.

462
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:36,550
Young lady, you have to learn
some responsibility, OK?

463
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:38,719
- Once and for all.
- I'm grounded?

464
00:42:38,754 --> 00:42:41,158
- You're already grounded!
- Oh, yeah.

465
00:42:41,193 --> 00:42:44,179
Until further notice,
you are confined to your room.

466
00:42:44,214 --> 00:42:48,654
You will not leave your room at any time
except to go to school or the bathroom.

467
00:42:48,689 --> 00:42:52,684
- Am I making myself clear?
- You're clear.

468
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:54,836
I... won't leave my room.

469
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:57,752
You're damn right, you won't.

470
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,665
- You sure you're not gonna get in trouble?
- Hey. I earned this.

471
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,411
'Sides, I'm not breaking any rules.

472
00:43:13,642 --> 00:43:16,025
Buffy? Are you going to bed?

473
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,196
In a minute!
