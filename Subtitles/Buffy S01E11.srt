GETTING A POUND OF ANTONIO'S FLESH.

HIS PLACE IN VENICE SOCIETY?

WELL, EVERYONE LOOKED DOWN ON HIM.
THAT IS SUCH A TWINKIE DEFENSE.

FROM HERE ON.

669
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,744
YOU CAN CURE HER?

670
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:35,081
WE CAN...
REHABILITATE HER.

671
00:41:35,148 --> 00:41:36,382
IN TIME,

672
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:40,519
SHE'LL LEARN TO BE A USEFUL
MEMBER OF SOCIETY AGAIN.

673
00:41:40,587 --> 00:41:42,521
VERY USEFUL.

674
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:45,224
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
THIS HAS HAPPENED, IS IT?

675
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,360
IT'S HAPPENED
AT OTHER SCHOOLS.

676
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:49,828
WE'RE NOT AT LIBERTY
TO DISCUSS THAT.

677
00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:52,265
IT WOULD BE BEST FOR YOU TO
FORGET THIS WHOLE INCIDENT.

678
00:41:52,332 --> 00:41:55,701
DO YOU KNOW THAT
YOU GUYS ARE VERY CREEPY?

679
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:57,820
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP.

680
00:41:57,888 --> 00:42:00,422
OH, AND, UH...

681
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,158
HAVE A NICE DAY.

682
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,714
CAN I GET UNTIED NOW?

683
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,205
THANKS.

684
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:22,644
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW TWISTED MARCIE GOT.

685
00:42:22,712 --> 00:42:25,080
BY THE WAY, HOW DID YOU GUYS
GET OUT OF THE BOILER ROOM?

686
00:42:25,148 --> 00:42:26,348
OH, WELL, WHEN THE GAS
WAS COMING DOWN...

687
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,550
JANITOR,
UM, FOUND US,

688
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:29,684
SHUT THE VALVE OFF.

689
00:42:29,752 --> 00:42:30,835
WE WERE REALLY LUCKY.

690
00:42:30,903 --> 00:42:31,920
I'LL SAY.

691
00:42:31,988 --> 00:42:33,254
HI.

692
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:36,524
HEY.

693
00:42:36,592 --> 00:42:39,478
LOOK, UM, I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SAY ANYTHING YESTERDAY,

694
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:40,979
WITH THE CORONATION
AND EVERYTHING,

695
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:45,150
BUT, UM, I GUESS I JUST
WANT TO SAY THANK YOU.

696
00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:46,885
ALL OF YOU.

697
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:50,055
THAT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE SHE
LOOKS LIKE CORDELIA.

698
00:42:50,123 --> 00:42:52,591
<i>YOU REALLY HELPED</i>
<i>ME OUT YESTERDAY,</i>

699
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:54,125
AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO,

700
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:55,661
SO THANK YOU.

701
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:57,228
IT'S OK.

702
00:42:57,296 --> 00:42:59,898
LISTEN, WE WERE GONNA GRAB LUNCH
IN A MINUTE, IF YOU WANTED TO...

703
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:04,520
WHOA. YOU'RE NOT HANGING
WITH THESE LOSERS, ARE YOU?

704
00:43:04,587 --> 00:43:07,322
ARE YOU KIDDING?

705
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:10,025
I WAS JUST
BEING CHARITABLE,

706
00:43:10,093 --> 00:43:12,661
HELPING THEM WITH
THEIR FASHION PROBLEMS.

707
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:16,631
YOU THINK I REALLY FELT LIKE
JOINING THAT SOCIAL LEPER COLONY?

708
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:18,099
<i>PUH-LEASE!</i>

709
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,568
BOY, WHERE'S
AN INVISIBLE GIRL

710
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:21,469
WHEN YOU REALLY
NEED ONE?

711
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:31,946
WE THINK YOU'LL
BE HAPPY HERE.

712
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:34,049
YOU SHOULD FIT
RIGHT IN.

713
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,022
WELCOME, MARCIE.

714
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:42,590

715
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:44,192
