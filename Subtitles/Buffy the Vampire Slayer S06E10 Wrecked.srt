1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,911
Previously:

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,275
It looks like I'm not as
toothless as you thought.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,550
- How?
- You came back wrong.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,117
Willow, you're using too much magic.
You want me to just keep my mouth shut?

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,389
That'd be a good start.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,478
- Forget.
- I know you used that spell on me.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,669
What is wrong with you?

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,157
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- Are you saying you're gonna leave me?

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,752
- Amy? How've you been?
- Rat. You?

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,359
- Dead.
- Oh.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,553
It's nice having another
magically inclined friend around.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,273
There's gotta be some place,
like, bigger than this.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,630
It's way too early to go home yet.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,789
- It's beautiful.
- Congratulations. Phase one is complete.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,559
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,112
Are you afraid I'm gonna...

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,074

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,435
What time is it?

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,999
Almost seven.
God, I just closed my eyes for a minute.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,679
And now there's cartoons.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,509
Plus a mother of all night-wedgies.

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,636
It's not tragic.
I'm sure as soon as I stand up...

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,788
No, Dawn. Why didn't anybody wake us up?

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,876
Where is everyone?

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,675
Willow didn't come home either.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,189
They were out all night.

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,432
- Where are they?
- I'm sure they're fine, Dawnie.

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,030
I'm sure they just... lost track of time.

29
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,159
When...

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,114
When did the building fall down?

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,790
I don't know.

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,799
Must have been sometime
between the first time and the...

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,396
Oh, my God.

34
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,432
- Shoe. Need my shoe.
- What's the hurry, love?

35
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,519
The hurry is I left Dawn all night.
And don't call me "love".

36
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,950
You didn't seem to take issue
with that last night.

37
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,551
- Or with any of the nasties we whispered.
- Can we not... talk?

38
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,275
I don't see why you have
to run off so quick.

39
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,630
- Thought we could...
- Not gonna happen.

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,070
Last night was the end of this freak show.

41
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,510
- Don't say that.
- What did you think was gonna happen?

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,510
What, we're gonna read the newspaper
together? Play footsie under the rubble?

43
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,670
Not exactly what I had in mind.

44
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,950
- Stop!
- Make me.

45
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,239
- No, no, I have to...
- Stay.

46
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,557
I'm stuck here. Sun's up.

47
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,876
I knew the only thing better
than killing a slayer would be...

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,632
What?! Is that what this is about?
Doing a slayer?

49
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,510
I wouldn't throw stones. You seem
to be quite the groupie yourself.

50
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,868
Shut up.

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,753
I'm just saying... vampires get you hot.

52
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,758
A vampire got me hot. One.

53
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,758
But he's gone. You're just...

54
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,077
You're just convenient.

55
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,114
So, what now?

56
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,931
You go back to treating me like dirt...

57
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:34,030
till the next time you get
an itch you can't scratch?

58
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,357
Well, forget it.

59
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,870
Last night changed things.
I'm done being your whipping boy.

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,835
- Nothing's changed. It was a mistake.
- Bollocks! It was a bloody revelation.

61
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,953
You can act as high and mighty
as you like...

62
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,871
but I know where you live now, Slayer.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,036
I've tasted it.

64
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,709
- Get a grip. Like you're God's gift.
- Hardly.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,151
Wouldn't be nearly as interesting, would it?

66
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,271
Let me go!

67
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,950
I may be dirt... but you're the one
who likes to roll in it, Slayer.

68
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,435
You never had it so good as me. Never.

69
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,348
- You're bent.
- Yeah, and it made you scream, didn't it?

70
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,993
I swear to God,

71
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,069
if you tell anyone about last night,
I will kill you.

72
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,671
Right.

73
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,111
You're gonna want these, too.

74
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,516
Pancakes?

75
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,036
Sure.

76
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,316
Should we call Xander? What if
they're all in a ditch somewhere?

77
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,830
Ditches are bad.
Mom always used to talk about the ditches.

78
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,269
Nobody's in a ditch. We'll call, but...

79
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,676
we'll give them some time
before we wake them up.

80
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,314
Funny shapes, or...?

81
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,348
It'll wear off in a day or...

82
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,077
- Hey.
- Hey. I just...

83
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,510
Buffy didn't come home
last night either, so...

84
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,635
Hey... this is Amy. Amy, Tara. Tara, Amy.

85
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,797
- How you doing?
- Fine. I...

86
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,471
- I'd better get going.
- Amy! Amy the rat?

87
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,831
- Sorry.
- No, that's fair. I was a rat.

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,069
When...?

89
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,298
Last night. It's nuts.
Everything's different.

90
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:37,796
I mean... the Bronze, for one thing.

91
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,674
Willow's a freaking amazing witch now.
I couldn't keep up with her last night.

92
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,199
- Amy.
- No, it's true!

93
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,155
I can do some transmogrify, but she is
messing with dimensions. It was awesome!

94
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,558
This blowhard dude? First she made
his mouth disappear. And then...

95
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,989
I'm talking too much. Sorry.

96
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,671
It's just been, you know, me and a bag
of pellets for the last few years, so...

97
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,756
No, it's fine.

98
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,589
It's just, um... I really need to go.

99
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,110
- Tara, you left some stuff upstairs...
- I'll get them later.

100
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,470
Tara!

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,356
Buffy! Where were you? Are you OK?

102
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,391
- I'm fine.
- You're not. You're all sore and limpy.

103
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
I'm not sore, I just...

104
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,510
I had a fight, you know, the...
all-nighter kind.

105
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,038
Figured. I knew that's why you didn't call.

106
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,357
So, what's the big bad?
Should we be worried?

107
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,831
No. I mean, I think you guys are safe.

108
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,629
- Tara was here?
- I guess she stayed over with Dawn.

109
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,716
You guess? Where were you?

110
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,031
We went out. We kinda lost track of time.

111
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,673
I never would have
if I knew you weren't coming home.

112
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,349
No, of course. I mean, you know...
It wasn't intentional.

113
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,760
And, you know, everyone's safe.

114
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,668
- You are, right? You're OK?
- Oh, yeah. I mean, um...

115
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,236
I think my pancakes are burning, but...

116
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,036
Tara was making them.

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,515
I've... I've gotta get some sleep.

118
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,317
Me too.

119
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,035
Yeah. I should go home.
Dad's expecting me.

120
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,436
- OK. I'll call you later.
- Yeah. Good.

121
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,357
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm sorry about everything.

122
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,995
It's OK. You should rest.

123
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,715
You're beat from monster-wrestling
all night.

124
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,229
Yeah. Right. Thanks.

125
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,157
I'm gonna crash, too. Night, Dawnie.

126
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,957
No problem. I'll just go
find some awake people.

127
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,915
All these demons are starting to look alike.

128
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,918
You got reptiles, reptiles with horns,

129
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,748
reptiles with gills.

130
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,159
And I'm still finding nothing of
the Steal a Diamond, Freeze a Guy variety.

131
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,989
An, would you hand me that one next to you?

132
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,796
Great. We're not even married yet
and already you've stopped listening to me.

133
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,833
- Anya!
- I'm sorry, but this is pointless!

134
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,874
We've been researching for ever and
we still don't know who robbed the museum.

135
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,115
What's up?

136
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,312
Anya has a theory.
She thinks Martha Stewart froze that guy.

137
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,954
Don't be ridiculous.
Martha Stewart isn't a demon.

138
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,072
- She's a witch.
- Please, she... Really?

139
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,830
Yes. Nobody could do that much decoupage
without calling on the powers of darkness.

140
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,155
Fascinating, but we have work to do.

141
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,512
I know I do. I can't decide whether
to put my bridesmaids in cocktail dresses,

142
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,820
or the traditional burlap with blood larva.

143
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:41,553
The traditional what?

144
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,832
I was a demon for a thousand years. I can't
turn my back on all the ways of my people.

145
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,030
Can I weigh in on this me wearing larva...

146
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,115
No.

147
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,915
At least I'm not asking you to perform
the rite of self-flagellation.

148
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,315
Guys, there's something out there.

149
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,595
There is. And as much as I hate to admit

150
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,317
that my bizarre bride-to-be has a point,
we're getting nowhere here, Buff.

151
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,876
Maybe it's time to hit the streets.
Get Spike on it.

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,636
No! No Spike. And no hit the streets.

153
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,151
We stay put, you know? Away from
distractions. We'll figure this out.

154
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,752
What about Willow? Can't she do something?

155
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,030
Maybe. But she's home sleeping.

156
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,276
Sleeping? She sick?

157
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,716
No, she was out late. With Amy.

158
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,676
And I'm bizarre. At least I didn't dump you
to hang out with an ex-rat.

159
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,076
No, it's not like that. She's just
helping Amy through a transition.

160
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,998
And making herself
a playmate to do magic with.

161
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,510
- Someone who won't monitor her like Tara.
- Willow's a grown-up.

162
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,632
Maybe she doesn't need to be monitored.

163
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,911
She's going through something,
but we're not her.

164
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,353
Maybe she has reasons for acting this way.
And so what if she crossed a line?

165
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,350
We all do stuff. Stupid stuff.
But then we learn, and we don't do it again.

166
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,320
So, you know,
who are we to be all judgy?

167
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,390
Not judgy, Buff. Just observy.

168
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,038
All we're saying is she's acting
different. She's not herself.

169
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,348
What do you wanna do?
It's gonna be hard to top last night.

170
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,678
I don't know if I can.
I felt awful today and I couldn't do magic.

171
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,032
Took me all day to get my powers back.
I think we should just take it easy.

172
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,515
- I have a better idea.
- What?

173
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,428
I know this guy,
and he knows spells that last for days.

174
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,233
And the burnout factor is, like, nothing.

175
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,113
- Really? He's a warlock?
- I guess.

176
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,869
I am not kidding you.
This guy will blow your mind.

177
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,076
He will take you to places
that you can't even imagine.

178
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,993
Is it dangerous?

179
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,396
Would that stop you?

180
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,831
- This is it.
- Where? You said the guy lived around here.

181
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,157
He does. You can't feel it?

182
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,236
What do you...?

183
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,233
- Here.
- It's hot.

184
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,676
Come on.

185
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,669
It's cool, isn't it? The place is cloaked.

186
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,550
Yeah.

187
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,956
Moves around a lot too.
Keeps Rack out of trouble.

188
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,308
Rack? Who's...?

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,116
Rack! Rack, it's my turn.

190
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,913
- No, you said I was up.
- I've been here for hours!

191
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,556
I believe these two are next.

192
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,075
Thanks, Rack, for taking us.

193
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,558
It's been a while. You'll never believe...

194
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,389
- You were a rat.
- How did you know?

195
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,593
I hope that taught you
not to mess with spells you can't handle.

196
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,678
You should leave that
in the hands of a professional.

197
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,919
This one's giving off vibes.

198
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,114
I don't mean to vibe at you,
if it's in a negative way.

199
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,598
No, no, I mean you have power, girl.
It's just coming off you in waves.

200
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,808
Not so much. I mean, I can do stuff but...

201
00:15:56,099 --> 00:16:00,277
I get tapped out quick, and I've used
practically every spell I know.

202
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,550
What do you want me to do about that?

203
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,235
I don't know. I thought...

204
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,668
- Amy said...
- "Amy said. "

205
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,470
Amy said I could help you.
But did Amy say how you could help me?

206
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,916
- No. I have some money, a bit...
- Not money.

207
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,068
Well, I could help you
with your computer. I'm really handy.

208
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,434
Just relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.

209
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,120
You gotta give a little to get a little,
right?

210
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,312
It's OK. It's over fast.

211
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,673
That's right.
I'm just gonna take a little tour.

212
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,353
You taste like strawberries.

213
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,951
- Or you could do it the hard way.
- Spatulas are for wimps.

214
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,072
I'm making peanut-butter
and banana quesadillas. You want?

215
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,398
No, thanks. I'm more in water mode.

216
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,112
You sure? It's my own brand-new invention.

217
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,552
I'm sure.
No, my tummy's feeling kinda rumbly.

218
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,160
Your loss. Very delicious.

219
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,473
Buffy called. She's going straight
from the Magic Box to do some patrolling.

220
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,797
- Oh. Did she need help?
- No, she was just calling to check in.

221
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,641
For the tenth time today.

222
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:06,516
I think she's feeling all Joan
Crawford cos of the other night.

223
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,313
Yeah. About that, I'm really sorry.

224
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,034
I shouldn't have assumed
Buffy would be here.

225
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,518
Right. Assume and make you
an ass out of me. Or something.

226
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,713
Anyway, please, it's cool. It's not like
I even needed Tara to stay over.

227
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,991
I'm so totally fine on my own.

228
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,588
But you are gonna be around tonight, right?

229
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,995
Right, totally!

230
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,033
We can do something if you want.
A movie, maybe?

231
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,790
Really? But I thought
you weren't feeling so good.

232
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,230
Well... nothing a little Dawnie time
won't fix.

233
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,874
If you bag the peanut butter,
I'll even buy you dinner.

234
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,959
Thank God!
Remind me never to invent that again.

235
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,915
Great, this'll be great. I'll grab
the paper and see what's playing.

236
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,652
I'll leave a note for Buffy
on the refrigerator.

237
00:21:57,748 --> 00:22:01,194
It's the first place she goes
after patrolling.

238
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,116
Hello?

239
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,996
Willow?

240
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,356
Dawn?

241
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,678
- What's going on?
- Busted.

242
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,518
Where's Willow?

243
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,871
She said... She said I could... wait!

244
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,992
- What is this?
- It's not what you think it is! It's sage!

245
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,076
That is what I think it is.

246
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,714
What's going on? Where's Willow and Dawn?

247
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,679
I saw her, but that was...

248
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,270
I like your coat.
When does the Slayer find time to shop?

249
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,233
So they didn't let you in?

250
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,351
Not that they know of.

251
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,790
- What else did you take?
- Nothing.

252
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,354
What else?!

253
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,189
Please! I need this stuff.
Willow wants me to have it. She understands.

254
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,869
Understands what? Breaking into
someone's house for kitchen spices?

255
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,150
No, I don't think so.

256
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,111
You should.

257
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,276
She's as bad as I am. Worse.

258
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,278
I bet she's at Rack's right now.

259
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,599
- Rack's?
- A place. He does spells. Heavy stuff.

260
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,474
- Willow's his new favourite.
- She's there? With Dawn?

261
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,741
Oh, don't shake me again, I'm gonna boot.

262
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,811
Then tell me where this place is
and I won't.

263
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,277
- It's downtown, but it moves.
- What do you mean, "it moves"?

264
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,676
It's downtown. I'm not sure
where it would be tonight exactly...

265
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,395
- Tell me how to find it.
- You just kinda have to feel it out...

266
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,159
Oh, God, I think I'm gonna...

267
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,228
So the burger was good? You liked it?

268
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,557
Are you kidding?
It was like a meat party in my mouth.

269
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,990
OK. Now I'm just a kid,
and even I know that came out wrong.

270
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,671
It was good.
But you should have had something.

271
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,429
I will. I'll eat.
I'm... saving myself for popcorn.

272
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,234
The other day, you had fun?

273
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,751
Mm... what other day? Give me
a Mon or a Fri here, something to work with.

274
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,632
- The other day with Tara.
- Yeah.

275
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,115
I mean, it was nice.

276
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,198
But it wasn't a laugh riot.
She's sad and everything.

277
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,150
- Did she say something?
- Not exactly.

278
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,195
I can just tell, by the way she was acting.

279
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,674
Are you sure you're OK? You look a little...

280
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,279
I'm fine.

281
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,837
And Tara's in her new place
and everything? She's all settled in?

282
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,599
We really didn't get into...

283
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,757
Is this right?
Is this the way to the movies?

284
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,350
Oh, yeah, I'm...
I just took you the long way around.

285
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,758
But we're almost there.
I just have to make one quick stop first.

286
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,156
What is this place? Why is it hidden?

287
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,316
I don't know. It's cool, isn't it?

288
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,432
You just hang here for a minute
and I'll be back.

289
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,233
You want me to conjure you
a magazine or something?

290
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,874
What about the movie? It starts at nine.

291
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,028
We'll make it. I'll just be a minute. And
it doesn't matter if we miss the trailers.

292
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,234
I like the trailers.

293
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,637
What do you think, strawberry?
Can you handle some more?

294
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,594
God, do you sleep through anything?
I was like yelling, and nothing.

295
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,397
I'm a bit knackered. Had a long night.

296
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,909
Someone should teach you
how to use candles in foreplay, love.

297
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,316
- Get dressed. Dawn's missing.
- Again?

298
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,398
Ever think about a LoJack for the girl?

299
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,237
- What's the story?
- She went out with Willow.

300
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,273
Willow? That's a sorry excuse to come by.
If you want the touch all you need to do...

301
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,439
Spike. Willow's into something.
Her and Dawn have been missing for hours.

302
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,994
- There's some guy named Rack.
- Rack?

303
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,033
- Yeah, he's some sort of...
- He deals in magic. Black stuff. Dangerous.

304
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,594
I've been all over
and I can't find his place.

305
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,269
He cloaks it. You can only feel it
if you're into the big bad. A vampire...

306
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,356
So let's go!

307
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,432
Oh, that's right. Hide your blushing eyes.

308
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,035
Hey, wait your turn.

309
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,396
Hey, Dawnie. It's movie time.

310
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,989
Do you know how long I've been here?

311
00:28:22,055 --> 00:28:25,389
It's too late for the movie.
And that guy smells...

312
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,473
- Are you OK?
- Fine. Let's get outta here.

313
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,998
So, what do you wanna do, cutie?

314
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,873
It's late. I just wanna go home.

315
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,310
No way! I said we were gonna have fun,
and we're gonna have fun.

316
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,719
I'm serious.
I think we should just get out of here.

317
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,116
"We should just get out of here. "

318
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,836
Come on, Dawnie, it's grown-up time. Do
you wanna play with the grown-ups or not?

319
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,871
Why are you acting this way?

320
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,436
Don't get all weird on me. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

321
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,351
- Anything?
- Not yet.

322
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,597
I might pick up on it if you stop
asking me every two seconds.

323
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,314
Spike, if you're dragging this out...

324
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,558
What, so I can linger near
your precious self? Get a grip.

325
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,035
Like you've never drawn things out before.

326
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,755
Maybe, but we've been through this,
haven't we? Things have changed.

327
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,112
Will you quit that? The only thing that's
different is that I'm disgusted with myself.

328
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,629
That's the power of your charms.

329
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,630
Last night... was the most perverse,
degrading experience of my life.

330
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,909
Yeah. Me too.

331
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,553
That might be how you get off,
but it's not my style.

332
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,912
No, it's your calling.
Gave me a run for my money, Slayer.

333
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,839
Now, I admit it.
You've had me by the short hairs.

334
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,952
I love you. You know it.

335
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,636
But I got my rocks back.
You felt something last night.

336
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,591
Not love.

337
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,157
Not yet. But I'm in your system now.
You're gonna crave me, like I crave blood.

338
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,115
The next time you come calling, if you don't
stop being a bitch, maybe I will bite you.

339
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,545
That's it! I want you out of my life.
Out of my work, out of my home...

340
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,118
Too late for that.
You invited me in already.

341
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,755
And as for your work, you need me.

342
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,269
- Like tonight.
- I'll find Dawn myself.

343
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,995
You really gonna put your little sis
in danger just to spite me?

344
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,559
Willow, I'm serious. I'm going home.

345
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,309
Then go! God, I thought we were gonna hang.

346
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,590
You're not coming with me?

347
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,918
I don't know.
Maybe I could just pop you back.

348
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,959
With magic?

349
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,189
- What's that?
- What? I didn't...

350
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,475
- I'm getting out of here.
- Aw, Dawnie, don't.

351
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,637
It was probably a cat
or something like that.

352
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,514
- It's OK. He's not real.
- Seems real. Very real.

353
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,676
- You summoned me, witch.
- I didn't.

354
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,078
Did. You raised hell with your magics.

355
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,474
Fresh!

356
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,433
- She has nothing to do with it. It was me.
- Yes.

357
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,079
He's coming! He's too fast.

358
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,760
Open. Get in.

359
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,831
Close.

360
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,912
Drive.

361
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,717
What are you doing?

362
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,956
Take that, scuzz.

363
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,476
Oh, God.

364
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,755
Dawn!

365
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,634
Nowyou're scared? Better late than never.

366
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,188
- Oh, no.
- Dawn...

367
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,514
What happened? Are you OK?

368
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,712
He was after Willow.
She made the car drive. Don't!

369
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,149
I need to see it. Let me see your arm.

370
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,076
Oh, God, there's blood.

371
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,909
- We need to get her to a doctor.
- Is she OK? Is she OK?

372
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,554
Back off, Will. I got her.

373
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,150
- No, Dawnie.
- I mean it. Stay away from her.

374
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,795
Dawnie, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. It was an accident!

375
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,229
I didn't see. I'm so, so sorry.

376
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,035
Dawnie! Dawnie, don't.

377
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,273
Dawnie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

378
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,834
I'm sorry.

379
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,676
I'm sorry.

380
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,473
Get up.

381
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,591
I screwed it up. Everything. Tara...

382
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,872
You know what? You did screw up.
You could have killed her! You almost did!

383
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,275
I know, I know.

384
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,750
I can't stop, Buffy! I tried and I can't.

385
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,236
- You can.
- I can't. I can't.

386
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,272
I ju... God, I need help.

387
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,836
Please! Please help me! Please.

388
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,196
Please.

389
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,956
- Is she OK?
- She's sleeping.

390
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,470
The ER doc gave her something for the pain.
It knocked her out.

391
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,830
But she's gonna be all right?

392
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,475
It's a fracture. It's gonna take some time.

393
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,357
God, I'm... sorry. I'm so...

394
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,278
I just don't understand. I don't understand
why you'd go to see somebody like Rack.

395
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,233
And I don't understand
why you'd drag Dawn into it.

396
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,076
I don't know.

397
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,792
The magic, I thought
I had it under control, and then...

398
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,273
I didn't.

399
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,518
Because of Tara?

400
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,389
No. It started before she left.

401
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,630
It's why she left.

402
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,116
It seemed like things were going so well.

403
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,752
It was.

404
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,237
But, I mean, if you could be...

405
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,670
the plain old Willow or super Willow,
who would you be?

406
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,351
I guess you don't actually have
an option on the whole super thing.

407
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,632
Will, there's nothing wrong with you.
You don't need magic to be special.

408
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,191
Don't I? I mean, Buffy, who was I?

409
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,834
Just... some girl.

410
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,193
- Tara didn't even know that girl.
- You are more than some girl.

411
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,551
And Tara wants you to stop. She loves you.

412
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:30,118
- We don't know that.
- I know that. I promise you.

413
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,559
I just...

414
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,796
It took me away from myself. I was...

415
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,273
free.

416
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,672
I get that. More than you...

417
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,234
But it's wrong.

418
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,318
People get hurt.

419
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,674
If something had happened to Dawn tonight...
Something worse...

420
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,632
- I know.
- No, I don't think you do.

421
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,310
I... I was out of my mind.

422
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,637
I did things I can't even...

423
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,594
It won't happen again, I promise.

424
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,790
No more spells. I'm finished.

425
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,790
Good. I think it's right, to give it up.

426
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,596
No matter how good it feels.

427
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,032
It's not worth it.
Not if it messes with the people I love.

428
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,399
The magic wasn't all great.

429
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,751
I won't miss the nosebleeds
and the headaches and stuff.

430
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,997
There you go.

431
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,835
Or keeping stinky yak cheese in my bra.

432
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,239
- Don't ask.
- Now I don't have to.

433
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,954
Cos it's over.

434
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,072
Exactly. It's over.
