1
00:00:00,914 --> 00:00:03,127
In every generation, there is a Chosen One,

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,161
She alone will stand against the vampires,

3
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:09,338
the demons and the forces of darkness.

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:12,218
She is the Slayer.

5
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,032
- Hi.
- Oh, that's what I was gonna say.

6
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:35,055
- What you lookin' at?
- This cheerleading trophy.

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,612
It's like its eyes follow you
wherever you go.

8
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:42,669
- I like it.
- So, did you like the movie last night?

9
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:46,827
I don't know. Today's movies are
kinda like... popcorn, you know?

10
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:49,131
You forget about 'em
as soon as they're done.

11
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,010
I do remember
I liked the popcorn, though.

12
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:53,904
Yeah, it was good.

13
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:57,940
And I had a really fun time with the rest.
I mean, the part with you.

14
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,447
Well, that's great.
My time was also... of the good.

15
00:01:01,656 --> 00:01:03,960
Mine too.

16
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:06,113
Well, then...

17
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,633
Oh, there! I have...

18
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,429
my friend, so I will... go to her.

19
00:01:14,806 --> 00:01:16,676
I'll see you, then...

20
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:19,189
Later.

21
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:21,026
Ohh...

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,222
Man! Oz!
I would love to get me some of that

23
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:28,582
Buffy and Willow action
if you know what I mean.

24
00:01:28,617 --> 00:01:32,503
That's great, Larry.
You've really mastered the single entendre.

25
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,681
- Hey!
- Oops.

26
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:41,023
Oh, thank you, Thighmaster!

27
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:46,519
So, Oz, man, what's up with that?

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,005
Dating a junior?
Oh, let me guess.

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,004
That little, innocent schoolgirl thing
is just, uh, just an act, right?

30
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:56,891
Yeah. Yeah, she's actually
an evil mastermind. It's fun.

31
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:59,186
I mean, she's gotta be puttin' out,
or what's the point?

32
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:01,725
What are you gonna do? Talk?

33
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,043
Come on, fess up. How far have you got?

34
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:08,725
Nowhere. I mean,
he said he was gonna wait

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,369
until I was ready, but I'm ready!

36
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:13,422
Honest, I'm good to go here.

37
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:16,006
I think it's nice
if he's not just being an animal.

38
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:18,478
It is nice. He's great!

39
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,433
We have a lot of fun.
But I want smoochies!

40
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,773
- Have you dropped any hints?
- I've dropped anvils.

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,438
Oh, he'll come around. What guy
could resist your wily Willow charms?

42
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:32,454
At last count, all of them,
maybe more.

43
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,586
None of them know a thing.
They all get an F in Willow.

44
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:40,643
But I want Oz to get an A.
And oh, one of those... gold stars.

45
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:43,690
- He will.
- Well, he'd better hurry.

46
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:48,086
I don't wanna be the only girl
in school without a real boyfriend.

47
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:52,869
Oh, I'm such an idiot! I'm sorry.

48
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:55,950
I shouldn't even be talking about...

49
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:59,081
- Do you want me to go away?
- I wish you wouldn't.

50
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:02,345
- How are you holding up, anyway?
- I'm holding.

51
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:05,443
I was going on two minutes there
without thinking about Angel.

52
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:07,734
- Well, there you go!
- But I would do a lot better

53
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,979
if you and Xander and I could do that
"sharing our misery" thing tonight.

54
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:13,157
Great. I'll give Xander a call.

55
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:17,655
What's his number? Oh, yeah,
1-800-I'm-Dating-A-Skanky-Ho.

56
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,719
- Meow!
- Really?

57
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:23,703
Thanks. I've never gotten
a "meow" before.

58
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,482
- Well deserved.
- Darn tootin'!

59
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:30,552
I'm just saying, Xander and Cordelia?
What does he see in her, anyway?

60
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:35,839
What could she possibly see in him?

61
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:38,832
Excuse me?! We didn't come here
to talk about Willow.

62
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:41,581
We came here to do things
I can never tell my father about,

63
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:43,842
because he still thinks
I'm a... good girl.

64
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:46,872
I just don't trust Oz with her.
I mean, he's a senior.

65
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:50,359
He's attractive.
OK, maybe not to me, but...

66
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,333
And he's in a band! And we know
what kind of element that attracts.

67
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:56,194
- I've dated lots of guys in bands.
- Thank you.

68
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:58,870
- Do you even wanna be here?
- I'm not running away.

69
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,802
Because when you're not babbling about
poor defenseless Willow, you are raving

70
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:07,046
- about the all-powerful Buffy
- I do not babble. I occasionally run on.

71
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,030
- Every now and then I yammer.
- Xander.

72
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,394
- Yeah?
- Look around.

73
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:14,751
We're in my daddy's car.
It's just the two of us.

74
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:18,082
There is a beautiful,
big full moon outside tonight.

75
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:22,035
It doesn't get more romantic than this.
So shut up!

76
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:31,482
<b>"Phases"</b>

77
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:36,809
- Did you hear that?
- What is it now?

78
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,393
- I thought I heard something.
- I-is Willow sending out some sort of

79
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:43,405
distress signal
that only you can hear?

80
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,321
OK, now I know I heard something!

81
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:55,009
All right, that's it! You know
your mind hasn't been here all night.

82
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:57,069
How about I just drop you off...

83
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,978
Get us outta here!

84
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:03,984
- I can't find the key!
- We should be movin'! Let's go!

85
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,637
Told ya I heard somethin'.

86
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:24,616
- And you're sure it was a werewolf?
- Well, let's see, um...

87
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:29,096
Six feet tall, claws, a big old snout
in the middle of his face, like a wolf.

88
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:31,879
Um, yeah,
I'm stickin' with my first guess.

89
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,943
- Seems wise.
- Oh, oh, and then

90
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,707
there was that thing
where it tried to bite us.

91
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:38,176
- It was so awful!
- I know.

92
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,658
Daddy just had this car detailed!

93
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:43,575
- So, what's the word?
- Well, it seems there were, uh,

94
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,512
a number of other attacks
by a "wild dog" around town.

95
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,927
Several animal carcasses
were found mutilated.

96
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:52,070
You mean like bunnies and stuff?
No, don't tell me.

97
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:54,204
Oh, don't worry.
I mean, they might not look it,

98
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,731
but bunnies can really
take care of themselves.

99
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,214
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:02,033
Yes, uh, um, fortunately,
no people were injured.

101
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:05,899
- That falls into "That's a Switch" column.
- Well, for now, but my guess is that this

102
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,234
werewolf will be back
at next month's full moon.

103
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:12,065
- What about tonight's full moon?
- Pardon?

104
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,114
Well, last night was
the night before the full moon,

105
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:17,790
traditionally known as...
the night before the full moon.

106
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,610
Meaning the accepted legend that...

107
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:22,045
werewolves only prowl during a full moon
might be erroneous.

108
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,158
- Or it could be a crock.
- Well, unless

109
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,572
the werewolf was using
last year's almanac.

110
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:28,268
Looks like Giles
has some schoolin' to do.

111
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,117
Yes, I must admit I, I am intrigued.

112
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,280
Werewolves. It's one of the classics.

113
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:36,329
I'm sure my books and I are
in for a fascinating afternoon.

114
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,295
He needs to get a pet.

115
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,805
Sunnydale is becoming
more dangerous all the time.

116
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,009
And full moon like tonight
tends to bring out the crazies.

117
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:49,689
But with some simple basics
of self-defence,

118
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:52,251
each of you can learn
how to protect yourself.

119
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:53,410
- Here's a suggestion -
- What you wanna do...

120
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:54,929
- move away from the Hellmouth.
- is gain advantage of the situation

121
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:56,607
as quickly as possible.

122
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,931
- Tag.
- Your attacker may have

123
00:07:57,932 --> 00:07:59,150
- the benefit of surprise.
- Would you look at that!

124
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:01,288
- He's all over her! Psst! Hey, buddy!
- But if you plot ahead, then you can

125
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,590
- This is a public forum here!
- turn that advantage to yourself.

126
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,394
I think you've splashed on just
a little too much Obsession for Dorks.

127
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:11,688
<i>(By being prepared, you have the power.)</i>
OK, everyone get into your assigned groups.

128
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:23,746
- What happened?
- Oh, last week some huge dog

129
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:26,365
jumped out of the bushes and bit me.

130
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,662
39 stitches.
They oughta shoot those strays.

131
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:33,427
I've been there, man. My cousin Jordy
just got his grown-up teeth in.

132
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,689
Does not like to be tickled.

133
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:45,873
Theresa! Be still, my shorts.

134
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:49,449
We're in the same group.
I may have to attack you.

135
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:53,035
No, actually, I think in our group
there are a few of us.

136
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,523
And I'm one of the few.

137
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,584
Don't forget, you're supposed to be
a meek little girlie girl,

138
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:04,317
like the rest of us.

139
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,237
Spoil my fun!

140
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:09,616
OK, everyone listen up.
I wanna show you

141
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,590
what to do should you
be attacked from behind.

142
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,166
In this situation, bend forward,

143
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:19,444
using your back and shoulders
to flip the assailant over to the ground.

144
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,334
Nuh!

145
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,757
- Nuh!
- Oh, Summers, you are turnin' me on!

146
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,896
And that works, too.

147
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:43,330
And, uh, while there's absolutely
no scientific explanation for

148
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:45,536
lunar effect on the human psyche, uh,

149
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:49,549
the phases of the moon do seem to exert
a great deal of psychological influence.

150
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,750
And th-the full moon is, is,
seems to bring out our darkest qualities.

151
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:55,984
And yet, ironically,
it led to the invention of the MoonPie.

152
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,492
Oh

153
00:09:58,686 --> 00:10:00,940
Yes, MoonPie!

154
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:09,015
You see,
the werewolf is such a potent, extreme

155
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:11,836
representation
of our inborn animalistic traits,

156
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:14,585
it emerges for three
full consecutive nights -

157
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,846
the full moon
and the two nights surrounding it.

158
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:21,545
- Quite the party animal.
- Quite, and it acts on pure instinct.

159
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,250
No conscience. Predatory and,
and aggressive.

160
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,274
- In other words, your typical male.
- On behalf of my gender - hey!

161
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:31,048
- Yes, let's not jump to any conclusions.
- I didn't jump.

162
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,505
I took a tiny step
and there conclusions were.

163
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,790
The point is that our wolfman
could also be a wolfwoman,

164
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,837
or anyone who was bitten
by a werewolf.

165
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,804
So, then I'm guessing your standard
silver bullets are in order here?

166
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:43,693
No, no bullets.

167
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:46,861
No matter who this werewolf is,
i-it's still a human being,

168
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:51,780
who may be completely unaware
of his or her condition.

169
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:54,887
So, tonight we bring him back alive.

170
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:11,326
- Anything yet?
- Yes, and you won't believe what I saw!

171
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,565
Brittany Podelle was making out
with Owen Stadeal,

172
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:16,565
but he goes with Bara Williams.
If she ever foun...

173
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:20,027
No, um, no, no sign of the werewolf.
How about you?

174
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,928
Uh, the same.

175
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,592
I thought we might, uh...

176
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:25,462
I thought we might
knock on a few windows, uh...

177
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:27,315
ask if anyone has seen anything yet.

178
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,374
Giles, no one's seen anything.

179
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:32,532
Oh. Yes. No.

180
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:35,551
Of-of-of course not, no.

181
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:37,834
Yes.

182
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:10,313
Gotcha!

183
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:19,860
- What the hell...?
- Giles! Giles!

184
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,241
Hey!

185
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,846
Whoa! Whoa.

186
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,595
Hands are good right about there.

187
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:28,396
Who are you? What are you doing?

188
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:30,491
The name's Cain.
I'm the one with the gun,

189
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:32,826
which means I'm the one
who gets to do the interviewing.

190
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:35,275
Ahem. Hey,
before we get all chummy here,

191
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:38,601
how about we do something
about me being in this net thing?

192
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:52,843
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

193
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,814
- I gotta say, I'm impressed.
- Excuse me?

194
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:58,646
Oh, it's good to get the fruit
while it's fresh.

195
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,724
You'd be wise to take that back.

196
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,312
Hey, what a man and a girl do
in Lovers' Lane at night is nobody's...

197
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:07,111
Oh, OK, hey, enough, Repulsive Brain!
It's not what you think.

198
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,158
We're... hunting werewolves.

199
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:15,677
OK, it's funny if you don't
believe in werewolves.

200
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:18,883
No, it's funny thinking about
you two catching one.

201
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:22,446
This guy looks like
he's auditioning to be a librarian and...

202
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:25,220
You, well... You're a girl.

203
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:28,524
- I assure you, she's quite capable.
- Uh-huh.

204
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:32,360
Let me ask you somethin', sweetheart.
Exactly how many of these animals

205
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,291
- have you taken out?
- As of today?

206
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:39,506
I tore a tooth from the mouth
of every werewolf that I killed.

207
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:42,905
This next one'll bring
the total to an even dozen.

208
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,137
- So, you're just gonna kill it?
- Well, see, that's the thing.

209
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,458
Their pelts fetch
a pretty penny in Sri Lanka,

210
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,791
and it's a little hard
to skin 'em when they're alive.

211
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:55,835
- You hunt werewolves for sport?
- No, no. I'm in it purely for the money.

212
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,433
It doesn't bother you that a werewolf is
a person 28 days out of the month?

213
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,982
That's why I only hunt 'em the other three.

214
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:08,479
I'd really love to stay and chat,
but I'm on a tight schedule.

215
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:12,686
Any idea where else the boys and girls
like to get together around here?

216
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:17,246
- You're looking for a party?
- No, but the werewolf is.

217
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,920
They're suckers for that whole
sexual heat thing.

218
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:22,029
Sense it miles away.

219
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:26,513
If this little doggy ain't here,
I guess he found another place.

220
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:29,244
Sorry. Wish I could help you.

221
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,736
But you don't know squat?
Gee, what a surprise!

222
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:39,563
- Where are we going?
- I think I know where to look.

223
00:14:39,598 --> 00:14:43,587
We just have to make it there
before "Mein Furrier".

224
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:11,600
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, I just, uh...

225
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:14,712
I thought I heard something...
behind me.

226
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,952
- No one there.
- Oh.

227
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,154
I guess I was wrong. I coulda sworn...

228
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:30,401
It's OK. It can get pretty scary
out here, all alone at night.

229
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,790
Yeah.

230
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:35,443
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

231
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:38,435
Don't you go to school with Buffy?

232
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,967
- Oh, you know Buffy?
- Yes, I do, very well.

233
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:45,748
Come on. I'll get you home.

234
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,235
<b><i>(# "Blind For Now" by Lotion)</i></b>
<i># And then sweep this town</i>

235
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,333
<i># into a Monster Truck of shame</i>

236
00:15:56,443 --> 00:16:02,730
<i># Carved out of soap and steel

00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:08,441

238
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,296
<i># You shake the squirrel out your tree...</i>

239
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:14,052
I mean, with Xander, it's always
"Buffy did this, Willow said that."

240
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:18,210
"Buffy, Buffy, Willow, Willow."
It's like I don't even exist!

241
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,180
- I sometimes feel like that.
- And then when I call him on it,

242
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,640
he acts confused.
Like I'm the one with a problem.

243
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:25,750
His "Do I smell something?" look.

244
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:30,081
All a part of his little guy games.
It's like he's there, then he's not there.

245
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:32,165
He wants it, but then
he doesn't want it.

246
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,023
He's so busy looking around
at everything he doesn't have,

247
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:37,325
doesn't even realise
what he does have.

248
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:40,390
Well, he should at least realize
that you have Oz.

249
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:42,253
Hm, I'm not sure I do.

250
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:45,376
Oz and I are in...
some sort of holding pattern.

251
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:49,019
Except... without the holding or...
anything else.

252
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:53,829
What's he waiting for? What's his problem?
Oh, that's right. He's a guy.

253
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:57,261
- Yeah, him and Xander. Guys!
- Who do they think they are?

254
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:59,354
Couple of guys.

255
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:13,089
- Looks as though your hunch was right.
- Who could resist Sunnydale's own

256
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,723
house of hormones?

257
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:21,046
- The werewolf, it's in there!
- Comin' through!

258
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:32,390
- You let it get away.
- I didn't let it do anything.

259
00:18:32,469 --> 00:18:35,746
- I had the chain around its neck.
- Chain?!

260
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,830
What were you gonna do?
Take it for a walk?

261
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:39,969
I was going to lock it up.

262
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:41,599
That's beautiful.

263
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,997
This is what happens
when a woman tries to do a man's job.

264
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:48,310
Now you look here, Mr... Cain.

265
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:50,083
This girl risked her life,

266
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:52,883
trying to capture a beast
that you haven't as yet been able to find.

267
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:57,876
Uh-huh. And Daddy's doing a great job
carrying her bag of Milk-Bones.

268
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:02,352
You know, sis,
if that thing out there harms anyone,

269
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:05,032
it's going to be
on your pretty little head.

270
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:09,093
- I hope you can live with that.
- I live with that every day.

271
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:12,494
First they tell me I can't
hunt an elephant for its ivory.

272
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:17,055
Now I've gotta deal with People for
the Ethical Treatment of Werewolves!

273
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:21,284
Pillock! Right, let's move out.

274
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:07,058
Giles? Giles!

275
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:12,118
I didn't see you there.
I thought something had happened.

276
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:14,266
Oh, no, I'm, I'm, uh...

277
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,793
I'm OK. I'm just, um, fine...

278
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,199
Er, just, uh, I'm, uh...

279
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:23,516
Er, any sign of the, uh, werewolf?

280
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,135
No. I'm guessing
you didn't see anything either,

281
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,443
from that vantage point
of having your eyes closed.

282
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,682
It's, uh, it's, it's, uh, gonna
be light soon, so we'd better...

283
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:34,566
- Wait!
- Police say that the incident was

284
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,155
apparently connected
to the animal mutilation

285
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,972
which occurred two nights ago.

286
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:41,402
The coroner's office
has identified the body

287
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:46,168
as that of Sunnydale High School
student Theresa Klussmeyer, age 17,

288
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,509
Buffy, we're gonna get this thing.

289
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,046
We have another whole night.

290
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,106
There's nothing more we can do now.
It's... nearly sunrise.

291
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,016
That werewolf won't be
a werewolf much longer.

292
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:58,201
Huh.

293
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:02,747
Aunt Maureen? Hey, it's me.

294
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:07,340
Uh, what? Oh, it's...
Actually, it's healin' OK.

295
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:11,835
That's pretty much the reason I called.
Um, I wanna ask you somethin'.

296
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:16,077
Is Jordy a werewolf?

297
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:18,504
Uh-huh.

298
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:22,590
And how long has that been goin' on?

299
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,247
Uh-huh.

300
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,977
What? No, no reason. Um...

301
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:31,586
Thanks. Yeah, love to Uncle Ken.

302
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,178
I can't believe
I let that thing get away!

303
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:55,987
Cain was right.
I shoulda killed it when I had the chance.

304
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:59,559
- Killed what?
- Uh, the... the werewolf.

305
00:22:59,594 --> 00:23:01,886
It-it-it was out last night.

306
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:05,972
Is everybody OK? Did anybody get...
bitten or, or scratched?

307
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:07,579
No, we're fine.

308
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:12,158
- Gladness.
- Yeah, but it got someone. Theresa.

309
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:15,146
Got, as in...?

310
00:23:17,015 --> 00:23:19,551
Oh, I'm sorry.

311
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:22,795
And I coulda stopped it.

312
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,849
Well, we... We have one more night.

313
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:28,286
- Another night?
- Oh, yeah.

314
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:31,542
Believe me, I'm gonna give
that wolfie somethin' to howl about.

315
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,796
But while we hang here doing nothing,

316
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:38,105
there's a human werewolf walking around
out there, probably making fun of us.

317
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,801
The way werewolves always do.

318
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,895
But there's really no way
to tell who it is.

319
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:45,056
Oh, sure there is. Giles knows stuff

320
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,353
and I'm practically
an expert on the subject.

321
00:23:47,388 --> 00:23:49,731
On account of once you were a hyena?

322
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:53,542
I know what it's like to...
crave the taste of freshly-killed meat.

323
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,991
To be taken over by
those uncontrollable urges.

324
00:23:57,026 --> 00:24:00,222
You said you didn't remember
anything about that.

325
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:05,758
I said I didn't remember
anything about that.

326
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:07,611
Look, the point is that
I have an affinity with this thing.

327
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,168
I can get inside of its head.

328
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:18,584
I'm a big bad wolf. I'm on the prowl.

329
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:23,663
I'm sniffin', I'm snarlin',
I'm a slobbering predator, I'm...

330
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:27,014
Wait a second!

331
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,437
It's right in front of us!

332
00:24:29,472 --> 00:24:32,668
It's obvious who I am!

333
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:34,438
I'm Larry!

334
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,176
The guy has practically got "Wolf Boy"
stamped on his forehead.

335
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:40,679
You got the dog bite,
you got the aggression,

336
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,898
not to mention excessive back hair.

337
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:45,392
And he was awfully gleeful
about tormenting Theresa.

338
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:48,949
- Still, that doesn't necessarily mean...
- I'm gonna talk to him.

339
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:53,055
- Gonna force a confession outta him.
- Good. Go.

340
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:57,516
Uh, in the meantime, we need to
cover our bases. Willow, um...

341
00:24:57,551 --> 00:25:01,618
check the student files,
see if anybody else... fits the profile.

342
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:04,386
- Buffy?
- Where are we going?

343
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:08,261
If none of that works,
I think I may have an alternative.

344
00:25:08,296 --> 00:25:11,108
Yeah, me and the werewolf
alone in a cage for three minutes.

345
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,109
That's all I ask.

346
00:25:14,524 --> 00:25:17,028
- Are you OK?
- What?

347
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:21,311
- You kind of knew Theresa.
- Oh, yeah, I, uh...

348
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:24,278
I'm tryin' not to think about it. It's...

349
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:26,845
- It's a lot.
- It is.

350
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,442
But we can do stuff to help.
Sometimes it feels good to help.

351
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:36,143
- Uh-huh.
- Well, like looking up stuff.

352
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,326
I'm gonna be doing that
most of the night. You could...

353
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:42,791
help me. Help together?

354
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:46,402
I can't. Um, uh... I'm busy.

355
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:49,797
Oh. So...

356
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:53,177
I... I gotta go.

357
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:20,149
Harris! Cheesh! Next time, wear a bell.

358
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:22,238
Why so jumpy, Larry?

359
00:26:22,273 --> 00:26:25,131
- Geeks make me nervous.
- Is that really it,

360
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,248
or is there something you're hiding?

361
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,261
I could hide my fist in your face.

362
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,968
I know your secret, big guy.
I know what you been doin' at night.

363
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:37,251
You know, Harris,
that nosey little nose of yours

364
00:26:37,252 --> 00:26:40,187
is gonna get you into trouble someday.

365
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:43,620
- Like today.
- Hurting me isn't gonna make this go away.

366
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:46,247
People are still gonna find out!

367
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:53,156
All right, what do you want?

368
00:26:53,157 --> 00:26:54,916
Hush money? Is that what you're after?

369
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:57,205
I don't want anything.
I just wanna help!

370
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:59,174
What, you think you have a cure?

371
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:01,416
No, it's just...

372
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:04,018
I know what you're goin' through,
because I've been there.

373
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:06,197
That's why I know
you should talk about it.

374
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:07,741
That's easy for you to say.

375
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:10,329
I mean, you're nobody.
I've got a reputation here.

376
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:13,053
Larry, please,
before someone else gets hurt!

377
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:17,694
Look, if this gets out...
it's over for me.

378
00:27:18,385 --> 00:27:23,039
I mean, forget about playin' football.
They'll run me out of this town.

379
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:29,034
I mean, come on! How are people gonna
look at me after they find out I'm gay?

380
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:35,923
Wow. I said it.

381
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:40,182
And it felt... OK.

382
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:43,608
I'm gay.

383
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,084
I... am gay!

384
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:51,486
- I heard you the first time.
- I can't believe it. It was almost easy.

385
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:54,420
I've never felt I could tell anyone.

386
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:59,089
And then you, you of all people,
you bring it out of me!

387
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:02,220
It probably woulda slipped out,
even if I wasn't here.

388
00:28:02,255 --> 00:28:05,580
No! No, because knowing
you went through the same thing

389
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:07,856
made it easier for me to admit.

390
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:10,987
- The same thing...
- It's ironic.

391
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,691
I mean, all those times
I beat the crap outta you...

392
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:17,517
It must've been because
I recognised something in you...

393
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:20,719
that I didn't wanna believe
about myself.

394
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:24,763
- Larry, no. I am not...
- Of course. Of course not.

395
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,523
Don't worry. I wouldn't do that to you.

396
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,143
Your secret's safe with me.

397
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:36,184
Oh, wow.

398
00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:49,740
So, what's the scuttlebutt? Anybody
besides Larry fit our werewolf profile?

399
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,486
There is one name
that keeps getting spit out.

400
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:56,031
Aggressive behaviour,
run-ins with authorities...

401
00:28:56,073 --> 00:29:00,904
- About a screenful of violent incidents.
- OK, most of those were not my fault.

402
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,487
Somebody else started 'em.
I was just standing up for myself.

403
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:06,092
They say it's a good idea
to count to ten when you're angry.

404
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:07,971
One. Two.

405
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,727
- Three.
- I'll keep looking!

406
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:13,606
I, um... noticed you were lookin' solo.

407
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:18,207
Yeah. Oz...
wanted to be someplace that was...

408
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:20,495
away... from me.

409
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,579
- I'm sorry.
- I can't figure him out.

410
00:29:24,614 --> 00:29:28,962
I mean, he's so hot and cold.
Or lukewarm and cold.

411
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:33,019
Welcome to the mystery that is men.
I think it goes something like...

412
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:36,741
They grow body hair, they lose all ability
to tell you what they really want.

413
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,990
That doesn't seem like a fair trade.

414
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:41,689
Well, if you wanna up
the speed quotient with Oz,

415
00:29:41,724 --> 00:29:43,864
maybe you need to do something daring.

416
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:46,981
Maybe you need to make the first move.

417
00:29:47,948 --> 00:29:49,987
That won't make me a slut?

418
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,838
I think your reputation
will remain intact.

419
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,879
It used to be so much easier
to tell if a boy liked you.

420
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:59,308
He'd punch you on the arm
and then run back to his friends.

421
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:02,977
- Those were the days.
- Hey.

422
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:05,796
I'll see you guys later.
Cordelia asked me to

423
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:07,980
look over her history homework
before class.

424
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:10,557
I think that means I might have to do it.

425
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:14,905
Wow, those two gals
are hanging out a lot together.

426
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,279
This'd be a good time to panic.

427
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:20,477
- So, how'd it go with Larry?
- What's that supposed to mean?

428
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,861
I think it's supposed to mean,
'So how'd it go with Larry'?

429
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,606
He's not the werewolf.
Can't we just leave it at that?

430
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:27,373
Must you continue to push and push?

431
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:29,502
- Sorry, I was just wondering.
- Well, he's not.

432
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:31,582
- OK.
- OK.

433
00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:35,965
But there goes our lead suspect,
which then puts us back at square boned.

434
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,601
You're not boned, you're Buffy.

435
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:42,151
Eradicator of evil, defender of, um...
things that need defending.

436
00:30:42,186 --> 00:30:44,609
Tell that to Theresa.
She could've used my defending

437
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,896
before she was ripped apart by that...

438
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,831
Werewolf.

439
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,858
Nowhere in any of the reports did it
say anything about her being mauled.

440
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,931
I mean, they were linked to the
animal attacks from the other night,

441
00:30:54,932 --> 00:30:58,098
- so we just assumed werewolf.
- What else should we have assumed?

442
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:03,653
- Vampire.
- So, that's good, right?

443
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:06,953
I mean, in the sense of
the werewolf didn't get her and...

444
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:11,982
No, there is no good here.

445
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:16,523
No good. Instead of not protecting
Theresa from the werewolf,

446
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:20,724
I was able to not protect her
from something just as bad.

447
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:25,113
She had a lot of friends.

448
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:30,196
Buffy, you can't blame yourself
for every death that happens in Sunnydale.

449
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:33,510
If it weren't for you people'd be lined up
five deep waitin' to get themselves buried.

450
00:31:33,545 --> 00:31:37,884
Willow would be Robbie the Robot's
love slave, I wouldn't have a head and...

451
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,887
Theresa's a vampire.

452
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,663
Angel sends his love.

453
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:11,572
Angel...

454
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:18,545
Are you OK?

455
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,561
This isn't happening.

456
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:27,812
- He's gonna keep coming after me.
- Don't let him get to you.

457
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,639
He's not the same guy you knew.

458
00:32:41,755 --> 00:32:44,900
Oh, no, my life's not too complicated.

459
00:34:02,076 --> 00:34:05,233
- Willow, what are you doing here?
- I had this whole thing worked out.

460
00:34:05,268 --> 00:34:08,314
And I had it written down, uh,
but then it didn't make any sense

461
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:11,220
- when I was reading it back.
- Willow, this is not a very good time.

462
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:13,188
I mean, what am I supposed to think?

463
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:17,531
First you buy me popcorn, and then
you're all glad that I didn't get bit.

464
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:21,814
And you put the tag back in my shirt.
But I guess none of that means anything,

465
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,685
because instead of
looking up names with me,

466
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,385
here you are, all alone in your house,
doing nothing, by yourself!

467
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,137
Willow, we'll talk about this tomorrow!

468
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:32,276
No, dammit!
We'll talk about this now!

469
00:34:32,595 --> 00:34:35,852
Buffy told me that sometimes what
a girl makes has to be the first move

470
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:37,831
and now that I'm saying this,
I'm starting to think

471
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:40,276
that the written version
sounded pretty good, but...

472
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:43,206
- You know what I mean.
- I know, I know. It's me. I'm-

473
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:45,810
I'm going through some... changes.

474
00:34:45,845 --> 00:34:48,164
Well, welcome to the world!

475
00:34:48,415 --> 00:34:51,574
Things happen!
Don't you think I'm going through a lot?

476
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:54,922
- Not like me.
- Oh, what? So now you're special?

477
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:57,408
You're Special Boy.

478
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:00,187
With... chains and stuff?

479
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:03,439
Why do you have... chains and stuff?

480
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:07,577
Willow, please!

481
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:10,056
Get outta here!

482
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:15,717
Oz?

483
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:18,173
Oz, what is it?

484
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:24,519
What's wrong?

485
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,446
There you are!

486
00:36:13,862 --> 00:36:18,835
Sorry I'm late. I had to do some
unscheduled slayage in the form of Theresa.

487
00:36:19,273 --> 00:36:21,298
- She's a vampire?
- Was.

488
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:23,981
Angel sent her to me.
A little token of his affection.

489
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,588
- Buffy, I'm so sorry.
- Not now, Giles.

490
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:30,080
We can all have ourselves a good cry
after we bag us a werewolf.

491
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:09,631
- All set. Let's go find this thing.
- One question...

492
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:12,859
- How exactly do we find this thing?
- It's Oz! It's Oz!

493
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:14,897
- Wha-what's Oz?
- The werewolf.

494
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,960
- Are you certain?
- Can't you just trust me on this?

495
00:37:16,995 --> 00:37:19,308
He, he said he was
going through all these changes,

496
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:22,316
then... he went through
all these... changes.

497
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:23,647
- Where is he now?
- In the woods.

498
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:25,927
- Let's go.
- Go where? You're not gonna kill Oz!

499
00:37:25,962 --> 00:37:28,570
Yeah, he's a werewolf,
but he doesn't mean to be!

500
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:30,184
Don't worry, Willow.
We're not going to hurt him.

501
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:32,652
We've put enough phenobarbital in this
to sink a small elephant.

502
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:35,536
It shoud be enough
for a large werewolf.

503
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,079
That's it. Let me see you.

504
00:37:49,114 --> 00:37:51,785
Come on, suppertime!

505
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:57,807
Good doggy!

506
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,967
Now play dead.

507
00:38:16,152 --> 00:38:17,732
Careful!

508
00:38:19,202 --> 00:38:20,947
Dammit!

509
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:44,688
I shot Oz!

510
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,708
You saved us.

511
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:54,373
No wonder this town's
overrun with monsters.

512
00:38:54,408 --> 00:38:58,580
- No one here's man enough to kill 'em!
- Oh, I wouldn't be too sure of that.

513
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:09,773
How about you let the door
hit you in the ass on the way outta town?

514
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:27,920
Is he gonna be OK?

515
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:33,850
He'll be a little sore in the morning,
but... he'll be Oz.

516
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,027
This is all so weird. I mean,

517
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:43,063
how are we supposed to act
when we see him?

518
00:39:43,098 --> 00:39:45,985
It's gotta be weird for him too,
now that we know so much.

519
00:39:46,194 --> 00:39:49,317
All I know is I'll never be able
to look at him the same again.

520
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:51,035
He's still a human being...

521
00:39:51,036 --> 00:39:53,893
- Most of the time.
- Who are we talking about?

522
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:57,976
- Oz. Who are you talking about?
- No one.

523
00:40:01,222 --> 00:40:02,750
Here, let me get those.

524
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:06,962
- Thanks.
- Hey, what was that?

525
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:11,296
Hey, Xander! Look, about what you did.

526
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:15,196
- I, I owe you.
- What did you do?

527
00:40:15,231 --> 00:40:19,004
It's really nothing
we should be talking about. Ever.

528
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,013
I know, I know. It's just, well...

529
00:40:22,048 --> 00:40:24,274
Thanks.

530
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:29,951
- That was weird.
- What?

531
00:40:29,986 --> 00:40:31,751
It's not OK for one guy
to like another guy,

532
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:34,264
just because he happened to be
in the locker room with him

533
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,998
when absolutely nothing happened?
And I thought I told you not to push!

534
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:39,303
All I meant is that
he didn't try to look up my skirt.

535
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:42,004
Oh, oh, yeah, that's...
that's the weirdness.

536
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,431
Weirdness abounds lately.
Maybe it's the moon.

537
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:47,578
- It does stuff to people.
- I've heard that.

538
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:50,743
It's certainly gonna put a strain
on Willow and Oz's relationship.

539
00:40:50,778 --> 00:40:54,653
What relationship? I mean, what life
could they possibly have together?

540
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:57,123
We're talking
obedience school, paper-training...

541
00:40:57,158 --> 00:40:59,308
Oz is always in the back,
burying their things

542
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:01,339
and that kind of breed
can turn on its owner.

543
00:41:01,374 --> 00:41:04,004
I don't know.
I kind of see Oz as the loyal type.

544
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:06,254
All I'm saying is she's not safe with him.
If it were up to me...

545
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,269
Xander.

546
00:41:08,892 --> 00:41:11,542
It's not up to you.

547
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:18,354
- Hey.
- Hey.

548
00:41:19,498 --> 00:41:22,226
Did you wanna go first?

549
00:41:22,629 --> 00:41:25,814
I spoke to Giles. He said I'll be OK.

550
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:28,567
I just have to lock myself up
around the full moon.

551
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:32,156
Only he used more words
than that. And a globe.

552
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:36,532
I'm sorry about how all this ended up,
with me shooting you an' all.

553
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:39,810
It's OK. I'm sorry I almost ate you.

554
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,800
It's OK.

555
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:46,044
- I kinda thought you would have told me.
- I didn't know what to say.

556
00:41:46,425 --> 00:41:51,030
It's not every day you find out you're...
a werewolf. That's fairly freaksome.

557
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:53,667
It may take a couple of days
getting used to.

558
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:56,706
Yeah, it's a complication.

559
00:41:57,496 --> 00:41:59,154
So...

560
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:04,540
Maybe it'd be best
if I just... sorta...

561
00:42:05,214 --> 00:42:07,119
What?

562
00:42:07,154 --> 00:42:10,679
Well, you know, like...
stayed out of your way for a while.

563
00:42:10,846 --> 00:42:12,727
I don't know.

564
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:16,127
I'm kind of OK
with you being in my way.

565
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,551
You mean, you'd still...?

566
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:23,790
Well, I like you.

567
00:42:23,996 --> 00:42:27,282
You're nice and you're funny.

568
00:42:27,317 --> 00:42:29,533
And you don't smoke.

569
00:42:29,568 --> 00:42:33,718
Yeah, OK, werewolf, but...
that's not all the time.

570
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:37,593
I mean, three days out of the month,

571
00:42:37,628 --> 00:42:40,701
I'm not much fun to be around, either.

572
00:42:40,904 --> 00:42:44,190
You are quite a human.

573
00:42:45,914 --> 00:42:49,833
So... I'd still if... you'd still.

574
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:52,250
I'd still. I'd very still.

575
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:54,188
OK.

576
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:57,141
- No biting, though.
- Agreed.

577
00:43:10,962 --> 00:43:13,688
A werewolf in love!

578
00:43:15,608 --> 00:43:21,445
