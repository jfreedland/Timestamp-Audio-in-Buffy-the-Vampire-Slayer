00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,991
Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,996
You are the Chosen One.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,959
You alone can stop them.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,399
- Who?
- The vampires.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,638
You see your power?

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,639
- Why can't you people just leave me alone?
- To each generation a slayer is born.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,752
You're the Slayer,
and we're, like, the Slayerettes.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,908
We were together from the beginning. We've
gone on patrols, and done demon research.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,477
We're talking about two very powerful
witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,113
Anya, you wanna marry me?

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,638
- Angel...
- I love you.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,632
So don't go.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,559
Home sweet home.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,877
That chip is deeply embedded
in your cerebral cortex.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,038
I can't bite anything.
I can't even hit people.

16
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:55,859
What?

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,036
Spike had a trip to the vet, and now
he doesn't chase the other puppies.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,159
I know you'll never love me.
I know that I'm a monster.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,759
But you treat me like a man.

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,872
"They had to be certain the Slayer
would protect it with her life,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,037
so they sent the Key to her
in the form of a sister. "

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,596
You were created to open the gates
that separate dimensions.

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,438
The little girl. The Key.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,109
Destroy it and the will
of the Beast will be broken.

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,832
Spike!

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,114
No!

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,753
- I have to jump.
- It'll kill you.

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,996
Look at what's happening.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,111
- Buffy, no!
- Dawnie, I have to.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,074
Advertise your product or brand here

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,113
You have to take care of each other.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,715
You have to be strong.

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,434
Be brave. Live.

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,155
For me.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,951
Come on. We're never gonna get anything
killed with you lot holdin' me back.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,913
I thought the big ones
were supposed to tire more easily.

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,077
- No, that's over-the-hill shopkeepers.
- I'm fine.

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,237
I just need to die for a minute.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,874
That powder you blew at him
made him rabbit off.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,074
It's sorbus root. It was supposed to confuse
him, but it just kinda made him peppy.

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,352
It's not supposed to mix with anything.
You think he's on prescription medication?

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,553
- Yeah. That must be it.
- I hope he doesn't operate heavy machinery.

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,316
- Yeah. We could all be in real...
- Guys, heads up.

44
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,069
The vampire's circling back
towards you. Six o'clock.

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,668
Try to drive him towards
the Van Elton crypt.

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,782
Van Elton.

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,456
Is that the one with the cute
little gargoyle?

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,309
Left! Make him go left!

49
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,350
Big, fast, and dumb.
Just the way I like 'em.

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,798
- The other units are engaged.
- Stop!

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,434
Great googly-moogly, Willow.
Quit doing that.

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,632
- I said I'd get a lay of the land.
- But not the lay of my brain.

53
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,513
It's intrusive. You could
knock first or something.

54
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,548
Xander.

55
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:07,155
I know, I don't have to talk to answer you.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,033
But I saw The Fury. That way
lies spooky carnival death.

57
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,358
Xander! Vampire! Other side of that tomb.
Get the jump on him. Go the other way.

58
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,755
Why didn't you say so?

59
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,711
Tara, down!

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,469
Spike!

61
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,518
Spike!

62
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,270
- What are you doing? Help him.
- I did.

63
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,272
You might have let me in on your plan
while he throttled me.

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,198
Poor Watcher. Did your life
pass before your eyes?

65
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,710
"Cup of tea, cup of tea,
almost got shagged, cup of tea"?

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,469
Guys, help Xander and Anya
over by the Anderson tomb.

67
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,229
Xander!

68
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,910
I got it!

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,356
That'll put marzipan
in your pie plate, bingo!

70
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,675
What's with the Dadaism, Red?

71
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,394
She says that pie thing
every time she stakes a vamp.

72
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,285
I don't know, I was trying
to program in some new puns...

73
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,390
and I ended up with word salad.

74
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,438
- I think it's funny.
- It's a glitch. I'll fix it.

75
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,554
We just can't have her messing up in front
of the wrong person, or the wrong thing.

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,559
We need the world and the underworld
to believe that Buffy is alive and well.

77
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,070
And I will therefore fix it.
I got her head back on, didn't I?

78
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,237
- And I got her off knock-knock jokes.
- Who's there?

79
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,273
- You know, if we want her to be exactly...
- She'll never be exactly.

80
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,412
I know.

81
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,154
The only really real Buffy is really Buffy.

82
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,679
And she's gone.

83
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,439
We-want-her-to-be-exactly-
she'll-never-be-exactly-I-know-

84
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,109
the-only-really-real-Buffy-is
really-Buffy-and-she's-gone who?

85
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,236
Where's my clog?

86
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,557
I think there's a clog-eating
monster under the bed.

87
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,639
It's really those lesser-known monsters
that make living in Sunnydale so hard.

88
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,389
I believe that that is a Dawn monster.
She borrowed them yesterday.

89
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,794
Dawnie?

90
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,716
Hey, you up?

91
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,669
You doin' OK?

92
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,590
Besides terror about today and
a general feeling of impending doom, swell.

93
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,553
Breakfast will make all things better.

94
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,114
Pancakes could go in bellies.

95
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,632
Dawnie?

96
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,320
Hey, you. Today's the big day, huh?

97
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,157
Kinda day that makes you wanna
return clogs, don't you think?

98
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,633
I don't have your clogs.

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,831
- Morning.
- Morning!

100
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,269
We could go over your programming again.

101
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,057
Again? You've done enough, sweetie.

102
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:50,997
She's either ready to face
this thing or she's not.

103
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,594
Here's some juice,
and pancakes are on the way.

104
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,598
- Funny shapes or rounds?
- Rounds are fine.

105
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,998
- What's up with the megawiches?
- I don't know if we're mega. Willow, maybe...

106
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,509
No. I mean, who's gonna eat all that?

107
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,872
Oh! Oops. She wanted to help, and I got
her started, but then I forgot to unstart.

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,958
House of chicks, relax.
I am a man, and I have a tool.

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,710
Tools. Lots of plural tools.
In my toolbox.

110
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,393
Sandwiches. Excellent.
Men like sandwiches.

111
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,715
Help yourself. Really.

112
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,593
So what brings you so early,
your machoness?

113
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,359
Brought that soldering wire
for Buffybot's tune-up.

114
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,399
You got funny shapes anyway. Sorry.

115
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,872
- I'll get it!
- No!

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,275
It could be my dad. He said he'd call today.

117
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,188
I'll just say hello.
He's my biological ancestor.

118
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,470
Hello? Hey, Anya.

119
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,196
Really? That's fantastic!
Anya found that thing, for tonight.

120
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,276
Yeah? Great.

121
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,879
And you're her sweet cookie-face.

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,594
I go by many names.

123
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,013
What's tonight?

124
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:06,759
Just a Scooby meeting. Spike'll be with you.

125
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,556
You know, Buffybot,

126
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,708
maybe you should let the machine - the other
machine - answer the phone from now on.

127
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,071
- Is my phone manner not correct?
- It's perfect. It's just...

128
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,715
Mr Summers might talk to you
and know something's wrong.

129
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,879
If he thought the real Buffy was gone,
he could take Dawn away.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,915
And I wanna stay here, with you
and Willow and Tara. Understand?

131
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,634
I do. I want you to stay here as well.

132
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,596
You're my sister.

133
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,391
So... excellent.

134
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,956
We're agreed. Sit your robo-self down
so we can get to work.

135
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,594
Need to fix up those fighting skills pronto.

136
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,234
We have bigger worries
than fighting skills today.

137
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,351
- Way bigger.
- I guess.

138
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,155
- Depends on how highly you prize punning.
- I'm serious, Xander.

139
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,829
Buffybot is about to face
her most dangerous challenge ever.

140
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,598
OK. So, we'll make a quick lap so people
can see you're here. Then we'll just...

141
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,473
What is this?

142
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,196
This is our city of the future.

143
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,676
I made the hover cars.
They're orange-juice cans. See?

144
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,951
They're very nice.
But I still don't understand.

145
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,517
We're reading Walden. This is
a kids' version of a utopian society.

146
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,632
There are no schools,
but a huge number of pizza parlours.

147
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,709
I don't think I know of a breed of humans
this small. Who's going to live here?

148
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,713
Oh, God, she's always like this.

149
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,518
Come on, wacky Buffy. See you, Mr Davis.

150
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,318
As you see, we provide
the best in progressive learning.

151
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,273
But we can't teach your children
unless you do.

152
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,393
As parents, we have a responsibility
to create the right attitude.

153
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,633
To teach your child what school can mean.

154
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,876
Ms Summers?

155
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,755
School is where you learn.

156
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,713
Exactly. Parents let kids focus on school

157
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,071
as a social experience
rather than a learning experience.

158
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,910
We want you to get your kids just as excited
about education as about the lunch hour.

159
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,600
I helped make lunch today.

160
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,800
Before school. Peanut butter and jelly.
I don't eat, but Dawn takes one every day.

161
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,153
Tell me about it. My kid's brown-bagging it
even though I paid for the lunch programme.

162
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,114
It's true. Something has to be done
about the quality of the food.

163
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,318
Anya, this register report for January
looks a bit off. Pull the files again.

164
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,356
Are you mad at me?

165
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,914
- Mad? No.
- Well, then why are you torturing me?

166
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,429
I punished people like this
when I was a demon.

167
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,869
I made them check spreadsheets for eternity.

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,676
Sorry if you resent my thoroughness, but I
won't be comfortable leaving until I know...

169
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,155
You're taking the Ramadan effigy?

170
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,352
It's not inventory,
it's my personal collection.

171
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,918
Aren't you Mr Dicey Semantics? You think
you can just take anything you want?

172
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,356
- Give it!
- No, you give it!

173
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,718
OK, when I'm marvelling
at the immaturity, be scared.

174
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,152
Anya, Giles is gonna leave the store to you
when he goes. What more do you want?

175
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,510
I am not leaving the store to anyone.

176
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,428
I'm going to England.
I'm not dead, I'm still a partner.

177
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,952
- Silent overseas partner.
- Who you should be very nice to.

178
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,595
Unless you want to end up
working at Video Hut.

179
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,155
What are you doin'?
What kind of gratitude is that?

180
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,794
I know. I know.

181
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,471
It's just, he keeps saying he's going,
and then he doesn't.

182
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,672
And I keep almost being in charge,
but then I'm not.

183
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,156
And maybe he shouldn't be going at all,
but we can't talk about that.

184
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,947
And it all just leaves me with
this stress and bossiness stored up,

185
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:53,213
and it just leaks out.

186
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,550
Just give it time, An.
This is hard for all of us.

187
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,992
- Just be patient.
- I was being patient, but it took too long.

188
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,670
I miss Buffy.

189
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,352
I do. But life shouldn't just stop
because she's gone.

190
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,260
I'm sick of waiting to take over here,

191
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:14,334
and I'm sick of waiting
to tell everyone about us.

192
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,850
We talked about this.

193
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:19,515
We can't announce our engagement
while things are so up in the air.

194
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,714
Why not? It's happy news.
Happy news in hard times is a good thing.

195
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,039
It is, but if things go as planned,
everything can be different.

196
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,475
- Let's just hold on.
- You've been saying that all summer.

197
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,149
Please, Anya. We'll know more
after we talk to Willow and Tara tonight.

198
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,239
Whatever. Just remember this whole
marriage thing was your stupid idea.

199
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,794
I didn't ask to be all crazy.

200
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,888
So my homeroom teacher,
Ms Lefcourt, was, like,

201
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:01,438
"Your sister is an example to us all. "

202
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,835
She wanted to make it National Buffy Day.

203
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,599
- Makes sense.
- It does?

204
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,707
She responded to Buffybot
because a robot is predictable.

205
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:11,999
It's boring. Perfect teacher's pet.

206
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,274
That's all schools are. Just factories,
spewing out mindless little automatons,

207
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,517
who go on to be very valuable and productive
members of society, and you should go.

208
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,597
Because Buffy would want you to.

209
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,676
Check. One mindless automaton coming up.

210
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,268
So what do you fancy, Bit?
A game of rummy?

211
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,551
Well, Willow and Tara
said they'd be back early.

212
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,114
You don't really have to hang.
I mean, if you're bored.

213
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,873
- I'm not, and yeah, I do.
- But I'm fine alone.

214
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,834
It's not like anyone's coming after me.
I'm not the Key.

215
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,350
Or, if I am, I don't open anything any more.

216
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,191
It's over. Remember?

217
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,877
I'm not leaving you here
by yourself, so forget it.

218
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,710
Well, I'm just saying...

219
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,309
No.

220
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,033
I'm not leaving you to get hurt.

221
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,116
Not again.

222
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,598
Now deal.

223
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,792
Don't be scared. I'm going to kill him.

224
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,149
- Slayer!
- You can run away now.

225
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,832
Not you.

226
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,274
You're a machine.

227
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,599
Thank you.

228
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,158
Stop!

229
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,910
Vampires, beware.

230
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,836
- The urn of Osiris.
- You really found it.

231
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,873
Yeah. It wasn't easy. I went through
every supplier the Magic Box has.

232
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,073
You used a Magic Box supplier?
What if Giles finds out?

233
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,585
He's too busy not leaving
to pay attention to me.

234
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,796
Besides, I ended up getting it on eBay.

235
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,115
You found the last urn of Osiris on eBay?

236
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,516
Yeah, from this desert gnome in Cairo.
He drove a hard bargain,

237
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,236
but I got him to throw in a limited edition
Backstreet Boys lunchbox for...

238
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,837
a friend.

239
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,349
You got your sombre on, Will.
Is the urn not up to spec?

240
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,435
It's the one.

241
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,518
- Which means it's time.
- It's time?

242
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,234
Like, time time?

243
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,510
With the timeliness?

244
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,634
- Are you sure?
- I am.

245
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,912
Mercury's in retrograde, and we have...
Do we have everything?

246
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,110
- Just about.
- But why the sudden rushy-rush?

247
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,356
Did the bot blow our cover at school?

248
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,755
No, she did great.
She impressed the teachers.

249
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,953
- And they still thought it was Buffy?
- Tomorrow night, we'll meet back here.

250
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,440
Whoa! Let's apply the brakes and check
the rear and side-view mirrors here.

251
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,678
This is deep stuff, Willow.
We're talking about raising the dead.

252
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,634
It's time we stopped talking.

253
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,116
Tomorrow night, we're bringing Buffy back.

254
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,313
Tomorrow?

255
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,551
I don't know.

256
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,717
Discovery Channel has monkeys.
And our tape machine's wonky.

257
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,274
Guys, I need you on board here.

258
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,630
It's just...

259
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,751
It feels wrong.

260
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,476
It is wrong. It's against all the laws
of nature, and practically impossible to do,

261
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,036
but it's what we agreed to.
If you guys are changing your minds...

262
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,232
Nobody's changing their minds. Period.

263
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,318
Excuse me? Who made you
the boss of the group?

264
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,874
- You did.
- You said Willow should be boss.

265
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,275
You said "Let's vote" and it was unanimous.

266
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,075
You made her a little plaque that said
"Boss of Us", you put sparkles on it...

267
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,509
Valid points, all.

268
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,198
But we...

269
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,550
I mean...

270
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,992
- We were just talking then.
- Xander, I can do this, I promise.

271
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,270
But not without you.

272
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,439
Should we maybe tell Giles
now that we're really ready?

273
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,915
It's not like he's going anywhere. Ever.

274
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,076
No. No one else can know.

275
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,513
Not Giles, not Spike, not Dawn.

276
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,636
They might not understand.

277
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,958
- What if something does go wrong?
- I'm telling you it won't.

278
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,354
Scenario.

279
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,153
We raise Buffy from the grave,
she tries to eat our brains.

280
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,192
Do we - A - congratulate ourselves
on a job well done...

281
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,790
- Xander, this isn't zombies.
- Zombies don't eat brains

282
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,072
unless instructed to by their zombie
masters. A lot of people get that wrong.

283
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,479
This isn't like Dawn bringing Mrs Summers
back, or anything we've dealt with before.

284
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,151
Buffy didn't die a natural death.
She was killed by mystical energy.

285
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,157
Which means we do have a shot.

286
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,840
It means more than that.

287
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,918
It means we don't know where she really is.

288
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,716
We saw her body, Will.

289
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,791
We buried it.

290
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,876
Her body, yeah.

291
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,598
But her soul, her essence...

292
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,390
That could be somewhere else. She could be
trapped in a hell dimension like Angel was,

293
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,997
suffering eternal torment just because
she saved us, and I'm not gonna let her...

294
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,395
I'm not gonna leave her there.

295
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,035
It's Buffy.

296
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,918
What time do we meet?

297
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,598
- Willow!
- What happened? Where's Dawn?

298
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,155
Upstairs in bed. But the bot seems to have
got into a scrape while she was on patrol.

299
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,430
I think my feet are broken.

300
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,301
Looks like a short
in the navigational system.

301
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:36,315
Can you get a flashlight?
It's in the kitchen.

302
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,204
She wanted to look for you...

303
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:40,991
but I figured there are enough
things that go bump in the night.

304
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,713
Good thinking.

305
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,833
But my homing device locates you when
I'm injured. I am programmed to go to you.

306
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,875
Right. I know. Still, I think just this once
it was a good idea to stay put.

307
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,510
Spike was right.

308
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,390
Sorry I questioned you, Spike.

309
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,559
You know I admire your brain
almost as much as your washboard abs.

310
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,474
- I told you to make her stop doing that.
- I did.

311
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,319
I mean, I thought I got
all that stuff out of the program.

312
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,273
Well, you've got her opened up. Fix it.

313
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,035
Sure. I have a lot of work here,
but I'll see what I can do.

314
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,072
Can you shine the flashlight right here?

315
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,553
Spike?

316
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,394
Did I say something wrong?

317
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,670
No. It's not your fault.

318
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,950
I think Spike stopped liking me.

319
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,875
That's not true. He thinks you're swell.

320
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,551
Then how come he never looks at me
any more? Even when he's talking to me.

321
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,833
He just gets cranky, the way vampires do.

322
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,395
Now, just relax.
I am gonna make you good as new.

323
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,756
I promise.

324
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,275
That was splendid. Now, try it again.

325
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,959
Only this time, remember your breathing.

326
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,510
That's good, but...

327
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,234
Think of the breath as chi.

328
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,476
Air as a life source.

329
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,591
I don't require oxygen to live.

330
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,439
Of course, strictly speaking, but...

331
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,120
Maybe you should stick
to the standard drill.

332
00:26:53,121 --> 00:26:55,680
You don't want her to blow another gasket.

333
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,439
I'm testing her responses after her injury.

334
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,439
I see no harm in imparting
a little Eastern philosophy.

335
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,793
Well, I just think that the concept of chi
might be a little hard for her to grasp.

336
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,109
You know, she's not the descendant
of a long line of mystical warriors.

337
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,791
- She's the descendant of a toaster oven.
- Well, I appreciate your input, Anya.

338
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,833
But I think Buffybot
has responded nicely to our sessions.

339
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,196
Well, you're the boss.

340
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,878
Still.

341
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,353
Would you like to test me again?

342
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,439
No, perhaps we should call it a day.
Your responses are fine.

343
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,432
Perhaps Anya's right. Perhaps I am
trying to teach you as if you were a...

344
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,754
Human?

345
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,669
- Yes.
- I like your teachings.

346
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,155
Every slayer needs her watcher.

347
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,832
I'm not so sure about that.

348
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,315
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

349
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,280
I just can't help but wonder if she
would have been better off without me.

350
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,231
Buffy.

351
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,511
I don't think that's true.
You were very helpful to her.

352
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,474
Right. Yes, I was a perfect watcher.

353
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,353
I did what any good watcher would do.

354
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,556
- Got my slayer killed in the line of duty.
- That wasn't your fault.

355
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,993
Of course not. That's how all
slayer-watcher relationships end, isn't it?

356
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,397
She's gone.

357
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,080
I did my job.

358
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,230
Then why are you still here?

359
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,869
So I got her cornered in this alley, see?

360
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,036
You got the Slayer cornered?

361
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,790
Yeah. I figured it's my duty.
She's a menace to our society.

362
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,630
So we fight, and I'm, like, boo-boo-boo!
And I got her on the ropes...

363
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,756
- You're lyin' to me.
- I swear on all that's unholy!

364
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,797
You haven't even heard
the best part. I cut her, right?

365
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,630
And she's... I don't know,
some kinda machine.

366
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,636
She's not human!

367
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,797
You're high.

368
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,311
I'm tellin' ya, it wasn't even the Slayer,
man. It was like a trick.

369
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,154
A robot.

370
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,880
- What's with the blood rat?
- Talk.

371
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,438
OK. So, I was over in Sunnydale, minding
my own beeswax, when I see the Slayer...

372
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,279
- The part about the robot.
- We fought, right?

373
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,358
And I was like all over her,
boo-boo-boo...

374
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,996
He says the Slayer's been replaced
by some kind of machine.

375
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,354
A robot, yeah! And I kicked her synthetic
ass. You should've seen the sparks...

376
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,515
You tellin' me
there's no slayer in Sunnydale?

377
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,155
That's what I'm sayin'. They got
some kinda decoy standin' in for her.

378
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,708
- Town is wide open.
- Nowhere like the Hellmouth for a party.

379
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,073
There's all kinds of bad in that place.

380
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,554
I guess with your muscle,
you could own it in no time.

381
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,992
Look, I know you guys don't usually
let vampires join the gang,

382
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,190
and I got the whole "sunlight issue".

383
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,632
But I was thinkin', you know, as thanks
for the 411, you could let me...

384
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,670
I'll think it over.

385
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,036
Let's ride!

386
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,918
Adonai, Helomi, Pine.

387
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,714
Adonai, Helomi, Pine.

388
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,958
The gods do command thee
from thy majesty.

389
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,710
O Mappa Laman,

390
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,274
Adonai, Helomi.

391
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,033
Come forward, blessed one.

392
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,355
Know your calling.

393
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,994
Come forward, blessed one.

394
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,315
Accept our humble gratitude
for your offering.

395
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,910
In death,

396
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,996
you give life.

397
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,234
May you find wings to the kingdom.

398
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,709
Hey. You're late.

399
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,634
I had to get that thing.

400
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,556
Giles isn't around,
you can dump the cryptic.

401
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,636
The last spell ingredient.

402
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,512
OK. Right.

403
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,995
What is vino de madre anyway?

404
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,994
"Wine of the mother".
Kind of black-market stuff.

405
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,398
You didn't tell me that. You shouldn't have
gone alone, it could have been dangerous.

406
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,556
Sorry. I didn't...

407
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,989
- I was careful.
- Well, it must be something pretty intense.

408
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,317
The black market's
all baby teeth and spooky fluids.

409
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,594
All I know is we have to have it to finish
the spell, so it's good stuff in my book.

410
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,029
How come you guys are here anyway?
I thought we weren't gonna meet till later.

411
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,675
We weren't. It just felt weird
hangin' out on our own.

412
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,394
It's better if we stay together.

413
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,715
You got butterflies, baby?

414
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,796
More like bats.

415
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,151
You wanna look at the money?
I find it always calms me.

416
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,071
That's OK, thanks.

417
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,796
Baby, tell those bats that everything
is gonna be all right. I promise.

418
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,708
- We couldn't be more prepared.
- I know, I just wish it was time.

419
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,593
I can't stand worrying about it any more.

420
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,954
Well, it's your lucky day, then.
I have something that will distract you.

421
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,630
What?

422
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,069
"I've gone. Not one for long goodbyes. "

423
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,555
"I thought it best to slip out quietly. "

424
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,274
"Love to you all. Giles. "

425
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,074
You really think
we'd let you get away with that?

426
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,355
I was trying to avoid a scene, really.

427
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,713
Like we'd make a scene.

428
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,354
Not you. Me.

429
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,355
We brought you some lovely
parting gifts. It's American.

430
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,679
Get it? Apple pie? To remind you of
all the good food you won't be eating.

431
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,515
And a monster.
Sort of a Sunnydale souvenir, we thought.

432
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,796
Thank you.

433
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,038
And I wanted to buy you
a can of Olde English "800".

434
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,875
Cos, you know, England, and you, and...
At the time it sounded really funny.

435
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,518
But the guy who lives in the box in front
of the store wouldn't buy it for us.

436
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,437
We got your presents at the gas station.

437
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,235
We were kind of in a hurry.

438
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,312
We made this in the car.
It's why the letters are all shaky.

439
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,155
This is impossible, really.

440
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,073
We just wanted you to know
that we'll miss you. We'll be OK.

441
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,277
We'll miss you, but we'll be OK.

442
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,558
I'll take really good care of your money.

443
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,076
Yes, I have no doubt.

444
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,957
Flight 3982, leaving for Los Angeles
and continuing to London.

445
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,548
- Rows 20 through 30...
- That's me.

446
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,319
Now? We just made it.

447
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,510
Just. Yes.

448
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,358
Well, look, if we're going to do this,
let's do it properly.

449
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,674
I'm just a phone call away.

450
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,155
If you need anything...

451
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,789
You must promise me.

452
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,189
I do. I promise.

453
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,914
Willow, I don't know where to start.

454
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,554
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

455
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,958
I'm trying to be stiff-upper-lippy.

456
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,036
Right, right.

457
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,350
Well, you should get goin'.

458
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,358
Don't you have a life or somethin'?

459
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,233
I suppose that's the question, really.

460
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,311
Just be careful. Please.

461
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,229
There he goes.

462
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,911
It's a good thing. My face was gettin' sore
from all that faux-smiling.

463
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,190
It was right, though, wasn't it?
Giving him the no-tears sendoff?

464
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,392
I mean, we don't want him
goin' off all worried about us.

465
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,876
He'd still be all worried,
just eight hours ahead.

466
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,798
What's he gonna do over there by himself?

467
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,879
He never talks about people from England.
What if he's lonely?

468
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,073
He won't be lonely.
He used to live there before, remember?

469
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,910
And I'm sure we'll talk to him
all the time, right? It's not like he's...

470
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,716
We'll call him tomorrow, how about that?
See how his flight was.

471
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,348
Can you believe the timing? He's leaving
right when we're ready to do the thing.

472
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,553
I know. I had hoped
we'd figure it out before he left.

473
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,116
Maybe we should have told him.
What if it works?

474
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,071
He'll come back.

475
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,237
- It'll be dark soon.
- Yeah.

476
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,636
We should get Dawn home.
I wanna go over everything again.

477
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,115
Nothing can go wrong tonight.

478
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,636
Everybody got their candles?

479
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,911
I'm trying. My lighter won't stay lit.

480
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,713
- Well, hurry, it has to...
- What time is it?

481
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,149
A minute till midnight.

482
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,953
Come on, Anya. Do you have it?

483
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,719
I got it, I got it. I got it.

484
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,115
OK. Start the circle. Now.

485
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,598
Osiris, keeper of the gate,

486
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,598
master of all fate, hear us.

487
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,274
Before time, and after.

488
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,868
Before knowing and nothing.

489
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,994
Accept our offering.

490
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,396
Know our prayer.

491
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,428
- Willow!
- No!

492
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,155
She told me she'd be tested.
This is what's supposed to happen.

493
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,432
Osiris, here lies the warrior of the people.

494
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,596
Let her cross over.

495
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,198
Willow!

496
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,028
- She needs help!
- Xander, she's strong!

497
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,790
She said not to stop, no matter what.
If we break the cycle now, it's over.

498
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,309
Oh, God, what is that noise?

499
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,513
Osiris, let her cross over!

500
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,513
- Willow!
- Willow?

501
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,835
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

502
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,113
It's a test. It's a test.

503
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,074
Willow...

504
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,629
- What's going on?
- Stay away from the window.

505
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,957
- What is it? What's happening?
- Just do as I say.

506
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,356
I'm gonna check the rest
of the house. Don't move!

507
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,720
That doesn't belong to you. Put it back.

508
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,798
Slayer, I've been hearin'
interesting things about you.

509
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,115
Yes. I am interesting.

510
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,029
- These your friends?
- They're my boys, yeah.

511
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,134
Good. Now tell them to get back
on their loud bicycles...

512
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,392
and go back where they came from.

513
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,954
Or what? You'll electrocute us?

514
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,396
Hold her.

515
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,156
You're nothing but a toy.

516
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,236
A pretty toy.

517
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,638
Wanna play?

518
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,279
I would, but you've injured me.
I have to return to Willow.

519
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,196
Get her!

520
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,356
Stop her!

521
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,116
Ride!

522
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,596
Osiris, release her!

523
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,393
Willow, I need service!

524
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,430
Willow!

525
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,473
No!

526
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,795
Willow!

527
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,116
Look what I found!

528
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,230
Take off! Go! Go!

529
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,919
Anya!

530
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,428
Willow.

531
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,635
Willow, are you OK?

532
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,670
Did it work?

533
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,355
I'm sorry.

534
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,991
Dangerously close... systems failure.

535
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,352
Must disengage from combat

536
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,428
so Willow can service me.

537
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,438
I'll service ya, girl toy!

538
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,791
Willow!

539
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,794
I'm pretty sure she's OK.

540
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,439
As OK as anyone who had snakes
coming out of their mouth.

541
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,792
- What the hell was that all about, Tara?
- Less talk, more running away.

542
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,675
The woods'll give us cover.
Their motorcycles can't follow us in here.

543
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,394
- Someone should tell them that.
- New plan.

544
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,870
Let's split up.

545
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,355
No, bad plan.

546
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,753
- I'll take her.
- No. I can carry her.

547
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,996
I'll keep her safe, Tara.

548
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,631
We should meet up somewhere.

549
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,797
The Magic Box. Whoever gets there first,
call Dawn and Spike.

550
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,879
The Buffybot?

551
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,920
We can't. It's lost.

552
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,632
Go!

553
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,514
Xander. Xander, where...? Where...?

554
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,551
Shush.

555
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,797
We're using our quiet voice, Will.

556
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,559
- Where's Tara?
- Off and running.

557
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,831
- Like we need to be. We gotta keep moving.
- Moving.

558
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,476
Right. Demons on bikes.

559
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,156
Yeah. We got trouble.
Right here in Hellmouth City.

560
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,630
- Our own robo-Buffy led them right to us.
- Buffy. The ritual. We have to go back.

561
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,231
- Will, I told you...
- No. We have to try again.

562
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,191
- We can't.
- We have to, Xander!

563
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,079
She's waiting.
She's counting on us, on me.

564
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,637
I can't leave her there any more.
I won't. We have to finish.

565
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,909
Will, the urn of cirrhosis...

566
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,996
- Osiris?
- Yeah.

567
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,513
It got kinda...

568
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,078
Broken.

569
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,077
It's broken.

570
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,316
I remember.

571
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,634
So we'll find another one. Better made.
Anya and I will jump back into the web...

572
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,716
There is no other one.

573
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,429
OK, then we'll fix this one.

574
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,597
A little tape. A dab of Krazy Glue.

575
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,199
No.

576
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,754
It's no use.

577
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,356
The urn's defiled.

578
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,436
It's gone.

579
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,238
Nothing.

580
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,310
It was all for nothing.

581
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,396
Buffy's gone.

582
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,516
She's really gone.

583
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,439
Over here. Stop your moanin'.

584
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,431
Was that really necessary?
A simple "psst"...

585
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,799
- I'm just sayin' it's rank.
- Get off it, Klyed.

586
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,630
Razor and the others head back to town,
leave us to hunt strays...

587
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,355
You got a bug up your crack,
you take it up with Razor.

588
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,758
Until then you do as he says,
and shut your hole,

589
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,235
before I rip you a new one.

590
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,395
Screw this. Let's get outta here.

591
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,670
Let's go hit some stores.

592
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,391
Doesn't sound
like they found Willow and Xander.

593
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,199
Did he say stores? Hitting stores?
Does that mean looting?

594
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,556
I think the woods let out over this way.

595
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,355
We should keep off the streets,
take alleys if we can.

596
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,231
They can't loot the magic shop.

597
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,669
Not now. I just got it.

598
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,438
Let's go.

599
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,279
You don't think they'll cause
a lot of damage, do you?

600
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,835
Couple of stakes, holy water, one cross...

601
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,272
Brilliant.

602
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,479
Here!

603
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,673
You want me to bloody thump you?
I told you, stay away from the window.

604
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,837
- Who are they?
- Hellions. Real pirates.

605
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:55,233
They raid towns. Use 'em up, burn them
down. It's usually backwaters, any place...

606
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,159
- Any place they think is vulnerable.
- They know the Slayer's gone.

607
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,356
We can't stay here.

608
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,631
- I'm not goin' out there!
- Got no choice. Can't protect you here.

609
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,597
We can lock the doors, turn out the lights.

610
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,958
And hide under the bed? It's not my style.

611
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,709
But we need to wait for the others,
and Buffy...

612
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,874
.. bot. You know, the Buffybot.

613
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,436
- We have to wait to see if the others...
- Look!

614
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,313
Dawn, I get that you're scared.

615
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,158
But I'm your sitter, so mind me.

616
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,951
I'm not gonna let any of those buggers
lay so much as a warty digit on you.

617
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,638
Right?

618
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,474
- Right.
- Right, then.

619
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,354
We can't wait around to see if
the others'll pop in. We're on our own.

620
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,232
No one's coming to our rescue.

621
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,556
Willow! Xander!

622
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,913
- They're not here.
- Thank God.

623
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,396
No, I mean, my store hasn't been looted.

624
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,112
Yet.

625
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,438
- Xander.
- They're all right.

626
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,754
- Where are they? Why aren't they here?
- I don't know.

627
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,953
They could be hurt. Xander could be lying
somewhere, bleeding, calling my name.

628
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,435
- Anya.
- Like that. Oh, God!

629
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,920
What if they're really hurt?
What if they're dead?

630
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,508
- They're not.
- How do you know?

631
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,794
Because he's with Willow.
And if something happened, I'd know.

632
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,271
And so would you.

633
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,315
- You think?
- I'm sure of it.

634
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,156
They're fine.

635
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,190
They're both fine.

636
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,595
Maybe they got lost in the woods.

637
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,996
The woods?
Are we going back to the woods?

638
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:40,750
- I hate the woods. All those woodsy trees.
- No, it's OK. Lost is good.

639
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,031
Willow and I always know
how to find each other.

640
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,430
With yoga?

641
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,512
Aradia, hear my words.

642
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,475
This is really startin' to grate my cheese.
These woods aren't that big.

643
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,310
Now, I know we've been goin' straight
because I've been following the North Star.

644
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,796
Xander, that's not the North Star.

645
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,558
It's an airplane.

646
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,116
Nah, that's not an airplane.
That's definitely...

647
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,435
a blimp. But I can see how one
would make that airplane mistake.

648
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,791
I can't walk any more. I need to rest.

649
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,151
- It can't be much further.
- You said that an hour ago.

650
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,795
I just... That spell took a lot outta me.

651
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,754
As, for example, snakes?
How come you didn't tell us how much...

652
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,836
No. Not now.

653
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,919
- What were we into back there, Will?
- It doesn't matter anyway.

654
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,510
- Do not get all avoidy on me.
- I'm not avoidy, I just...

655
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,108
We have bigger problems. Demons.

656
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,358
Demons. There's somethin'
you don't see every day.

657
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,758
- Unless you're us.
- Yeah, and now we're lost, so can we...

658
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,553
- What's that?
- See? Avoidy.

659
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,834
Over there, that light.

660
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,477
That one moving towards us?
Incredibly fast?

661
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,469
Hello?

662
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,673
"Hello"? We're being hunted, and you're
hello-ing a strange fast-moving light?

663
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,475
It could be anything.
It's a motorcycle headlight.

664
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,716
No. Too small.

665
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,152
- Stay behind me.
- I don't...

666
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,589
Stay down. I'll take care of this.

667
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,639
- Xander, it's...
- A bug!

668
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,076
A big fiery bug thing!

669
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,156
- Xander...
- Get off!

670
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:47,197
Do fireflies bite?
No, they probably burn, don't they?

671
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,470
Xander, it's not a bug.

672
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,358
It's Tara. Come on.

673
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,993
And how long have you known
that your girlfriend's Tinkerbell?

674
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,276
What are you doing?

675
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,316
Get away from there.

676
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,711
Do you hear me?

677
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,913
I said get off my property!

678
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,951
Leave us alone.

679
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,150
Get outta here!

680
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,156
Get back.

681
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,478
It looks like they're just wrecking stuff.
No thought other than just destructorama.

682
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,669
What?

683
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,796
Nothing. Just looked like fun.

684
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,236
I'm just sayin'.

685
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,109
It's just, with this kinda frolicking
goin' on all around town,

686
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,913
we're not gonna get very far without...

687
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,836
Let's fly, pigeon.

688
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,799
Already been looted. Sorry.

689
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,390
Try the appliance store down the block,
they've got great toasters.

690
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,272
Anya!

691
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,879
Xander?

692
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,789
- I knew you weren't dead.
- Well, then, why was I so worried?

693
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,876
- Are you...?
- Not yet.

694
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,275
But I will be.

695
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,715
- Where's Dawn and Spike?
- We called the house...

696
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:36,312
Maybe they're on their way here. This place
is NORAD when we're at DEFCON 1.

697
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,908
- I so need male friends.
- We have to go out and look for them.

698
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,077
There's this guy at work
I kinda hit it off with. Tito.

699
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,794
He seems like a good...

700
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,671
You were talking about
Dawn and Spike, of course.

701
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,553
Question. You want us to go back out there?

702
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,712
Well, yeah.
Unless somebody's got a better idea.

703
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,956
Well, it's just...

704
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,796
we're minus a Buffybot.

705
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,992
And Spike is missing in action
somewhere with Dawn.

706
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:14,592
And Giles flew away, and, well,
you're looking a little magicked out.

707
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,109
An, honey, we're nearing your point, right?

708
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,391
It's just, how are we
supposed to fight these guys?

709
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,193
I mean, we can take a vampire or two, sure,

710
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,630
but there's a whole cavalcade
of demons out there, and...

711
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,514
I think this... You know, it takes...

712
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,990
I mean... We need...

713
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,712
- Buffy.
- Buffy.

714
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,398
Buffy...

715
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,476
is not coming back.

716
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,356
We failed.

717
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,956
So we're it, gang.

718
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,631
Xander, grab the weapons.
We're gonna look for Dawn and Spike.

719
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,232
We should go. They're just getting
more and more worked up.

720
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,191
They can't keep it up forever.

721
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,108
Maybe they'll party themselves out,
tire of this place and move on.

722
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,152
Say hello to your new home, boys.

723
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,752
This here is a momentous occasion,
the beginning of a new era.

724
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,598
No question, the open back roads
and highways have been good to us.

725
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,111
But we've got ourselves a juicy
little burg here, just ripe for the pickin'.

726
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,198
And I ain't in no hurry to leave it.
Are you?

727
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,909
So, I figure, what better way to kick off
our semi-settling-down

728
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,600
than with a little christening?

729
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,276
A symbolic act commemorating
the new order around here,

730
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:12,829
ridding ourselves of any
not-so-pleasant reminders of the old.

731
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,616
All in one quick,

732
01:04:18,636 --> 01:04:22,850
really, really violent fell swoop.

733
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,950
Gentlemen, start your engines.

734
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,670
Bye-bye, Slayer!

735
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,269
No!

736
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,116
Another one for the fire, boys.

737
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,669
Tear it up.

738
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,550
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

739
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,916
We don't know if the spell
would've worked, even if the demons...

740
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,476
- It would've worked.
- Well, maybe...

741
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,598
What?

742
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,631
Maybe it wasn't supposed to.

743
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,799
I mean, those demons showing up
at the exact wrong time...

744
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,071
Maybe we really were in over our heads,

745
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,192
invoking forces that we have no right to.

746
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,757
Maybe the fates sent down
all that destruction on us to stop us.

747
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,553
You mean maybe it was my fault.

748
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,276
No. No.

749
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,310
- I'm not saying we announce it this second.
- Anya.

750
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,908
I think it would please them
to know we're engaged.

751
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,589
And I think Willow in particular
could use a real morale-booster.

752
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,597
Can we talk about this later?

753
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,110
But all the excuses for not telling
everyone we're engaged are gone.

754
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,913
Aside from hell bikers,
there's nothing in our way.

755
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,430
- This is it. No more surprises.
- Watch it.

756
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,150
It's the Buffybot.

757
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:37,553
Peachy. No doubt to lead
the wild bunch right to us again.

758
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,629
Will, next time it's damaged, couldn't ya
programme it to find RadioShack?

759
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,155
Buffy?

760
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,437
- Buffy!
- Buffy!

761
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,549
Buffy!

762
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,916
Where is she?

763
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,193
Buffy?

764
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,996
Buffy, are you...?

765
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,072
It's Willow.

766
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,555
Can you hear me?

767
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,353
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing!

768
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,836
She in shock.

769
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:25,154
- Her hands are bleeding. Her fingers.
- She's filthy.

770
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,035
- Oh, no.
- What?

771
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,434
No.

772
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,310
How could we...? So stupid!

773
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,793
Xander!

774
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,475
Our spell.

775
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,672
Our resurrection spell
worked like a magic charm.

776
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,837
We brought you back to life, Buffy.

777
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,110
Right where we left her.

778
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,036
Oh, God.

779
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,475
In her coffin.

780
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,309
She had to dig out of her own grave.

781
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,352
Buffy?

782
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,156
Buffy, it's Xander.

783
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,116
We're sorry.

784
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,430
We didn't know.

785
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,436
Buffy!

786
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,314
You aren't reaching her.
She's too traumatised.

787
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,635
Hey, Buffy.

788
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:29,548
Here's some news that might perk you up.
Xander and I have an announcement.

789
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:33,036
- Anya!
- What? I'm just trying to help.

790
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:40,672
Buffy, it's gonna be all right.

791
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,115
We brought you back.

792
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,196
You're home now.

793
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,191
Yeah. That's it.

794
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,192
You're home.

795
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,118
Yeah. Welcome home, Slayer.

796
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,353
Alive and kickin' after all!

797
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,914
Well, alive, anyway.

798
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,995
Not lookin' too good, though.

799
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,998
I don't see you winning any beauty contests.
Unless "Miss My-Face-Fell-Off" gets goin'.

800
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,115
Big axe you got there.

801
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,312
The better to cut you down to size, Grandma.

802
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,910
- So you got a witch in the mix.
- More than one.

803
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,237
I happen to be
a very powerful man-witch myself.

804
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,828
Or male...

805
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,030
Is it a warlock?

806
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,438
Warlock.

807
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,872
Plus, we have a slayer here, who might
actually be looking to eat some brains,

808
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,629
so I think a little quiet moseying,
no hard feelings,

809
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,435
and I'm sure your demon horde
won't think any the less of you.

810
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,348
Now, my boys - that's tricky.
They came lookin' for a massacre,

811
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,272
and I think you got
exactly enough magic between you

812
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,834
for a kiddy birthday party.

813
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,199
Then you'd be wrong.

814
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,029
Well, I'd better back off, or you might
what? Pull a rabbit out of a hat?

815
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,720
- Don't do that! Why would she do that?
- Look...

816
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,070
We don't want trouble.
You don't want trouble.

817
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,317
Of course we want trouble, we're demons.

818
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,874
We're really all about trouble.

819
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,877
Not this kind.

820
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,673
I get your point.

821
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,629
Now, let me tell you somethin', children.
We're not gonna fight you.

822
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:51,629
We're just gonna hold you down
and enjoy ourselves for a few hours.

823
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,069
You might even live through it.

824
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:59,957
Except that certain of my boys
got some anatomical incompatibilities

825
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,914
that tend to tear up little girls.

826
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,431
So, who wants to go first?

827
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,391
I was really hoping it'd be you.

828
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,548
Does this mean we win?

829
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,430
There. What's that?

830
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,075
It's just a machine, Dawn.

831
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,756
I know.

832
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,355
Dawn.

833
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,430
You're my sister Dawn.

834
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,156
Where did I go?

835
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,199
What?

836
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,675
Where did I go?

837
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,756
I was here.

838
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,359
Here.

839
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,630
But then I ran away.

840
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,956
- I don't...
- No.

841
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,070
Not me.

842
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,668
The other Buffy.

843
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,277
Yes. The other Buffy.

844
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,958
Buffy?

845
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,870
I don't...

846
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,959
I don't know where she ran off to.

847
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,638
Maybe...

848
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,911
Look what those filthy buggers done to you.

849
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:38,319
Willow's slap-and-paste job's not gonna
do the trick this time. Robot's done.

850
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,079
Hey? Little Bit?

851
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,198
Dawn!

852
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,113
Dawn!

853
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,709
Well, they wanted a massacre.

854
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,479
She's Buffy. She's herself again.

855
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,150
You're back, Buff, you really are.

856
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,592
Buffy!

857
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,873
- Where's she going?
- Should we follow her?

858
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,120
- I don't know.
- She just needs some time, is all.

859
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,555
The important thing
is that she's back. She'll be fine.

860
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,232
Xander, look out!

861
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,188
Now, what kind of slayer is it
runs out on her buddies...

862
01:16:09,223 --> 01:16:11,512
just when they need her the most?

863
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,516
So, witch, got a little power after all.

864
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,391
Well, let's see what tricks you can manage
while I choke the life outta ya...

865
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,154
Tara!

866
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,430
Nobody messes with my girl.

867
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,834
- Tara, nice axing.
- My first.

868
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,038
Buffy.

869
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,596
Buffy, no.

870
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,631
Dawnie, I have to.

871
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,716
Buffy?

872
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,515
Buffy.

873
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,318
Buffy.

874
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,198
How...?

875
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,996
Is it you?

876
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,196
I mean, really?

877
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,710
What are you...?

878
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,997
No!

879
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,758
Don't!

880
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,274
Don't jump, Buffy. Don't move.

881
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,276
Just walk to me.

882
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,958
Please.

883
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,598
Please?

884
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,598
I'm your sister Dawn.

885
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,676
We were up here together,
and then you went away.

886
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,514
And you don't wanna do that again.

887
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,680
I don't know how you're back,

888
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,711
but you are.

889
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,116
And, please, just stay still.

890
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,800
Or move. But towards me.

891
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:03,278
Because the tower was built by crazy people
and I don't think it's holding up very well.

892
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,716
Talk to me.

893
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,517
Say something!

894
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,678
Is this Hell?

895
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,237
What?

896
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,556
Is this Hell?

897
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,477
No!

898
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,750
Buffy, no!

899
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,715
You're here with me.

900
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,916
Whatever happened to you,

901
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:45,909
whatever you've been through,
it's over now. You're...

902
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,640
We have to get off of this tower!

903
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,792
It was so clear on this spot.

904
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,159
I remember how shiny

905
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,795
and clear everything was.

906
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,958
But now...

907
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,473
now...

908
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,158
Buffy.

909
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,398
Please. Listen to me.

910
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,198
You told me I had to be strong,

911
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,276
and I've tried.

912
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,193
But it's been so hard without you.

913
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,596
I'm sorry.

914
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,560
I promise I'll do better. I will!

915
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,236
If you're with me.

916
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,154
Stay with me.

917
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,838
Please.

918
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,831
I need you to live.

919
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,714
Live! For...

920
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,197
Buffy!

921
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,836
- Dawn.
- Buffy!

922
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,313
Dawn!

923
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,038
Buffy?

924
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,313
Buffy.

925
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,830
You're really here.

926
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:37,271
You're alive, and you're home.

927
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,876
You're home.
