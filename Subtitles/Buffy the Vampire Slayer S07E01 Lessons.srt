00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,807
Tara? Oh, God.

3
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:09,451
Somebody!

4
00:00:09,853 --> 00:00:11,366
- Things just got worse.
- How?

5
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:14,445
End-of-the-world worse.
Willow's going to destroy it.

6
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,124
I love you.

7
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:21,888
Things have really sucked lately.
That's all gonna change.

8
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:23,850
And I wanna be there when it does.

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,085
Make me what I was.

10
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:29,802
- We will return... your soul.

Ugh! Argh!

16
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,244
It's about power.

17
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:05,530
- Who's got it. Who knows how to use it.
<i>- (growling)</i>

18
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,287
So...

19
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,767
- Who's got the power, Dawn?
- Well...

20
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:14,406
- I've got the stake.
- The stake is not the power.

21
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,322
But, he's new.
He doesn't know his strength.

22
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:22,683
He might not know those fancy martial-arts
skills they inevitably seem to pick up.

23
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:24,729
Who's got the power?

24
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:28,089
- He does.
- Never forget it.

25
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:32,485
It doesn't matter how well prepped or
how well armed you are, you're a little girl.

26
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:33,892
- Woman.
- Little woman.

27
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,851
- I'm taller than you.
- He's a vampire, OK? Demon?

28
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,446
Preternaturally strong?

29
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,890
- Skilled with powers no human could...
- Excuse me. I think I'm stuck.

30
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:47,768
- You're stuck?
- My foot's caught on a root or something.

31
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,047
I don't even know how I got down there.
If you could give me a hand...

32
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,210
- So, he's got the power.
- Zip it.

33
00:02:56,293 --> 00:03:00,684
I really appreciate it. It's so dark,
and I don't even know what I'm doing here.

34
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:02,805
Whoa!

35
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:05,851
Ooh! Thanks. That was a help.

36
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,368
Unfortunately, it was the last...
<i>(wheezing)</i> thing you'll ever do.

37
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:13,968
Listen up. I'm the Slayer.
You don't wanna get into it with me.

38
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:16,408
You want blood? You can have hers.

39
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:22,252
Power. He's got it, he's going to use it.
You don't have it, so...

40
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:26,049
Use that. Perfect.

41
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:31,284
Argh!

42
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,444
Buffy!

43
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:20,645
It's real. It's the only lesson, Dawn.

44
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:25,286
- It's always real. Let me see.
- It's nothing. It's just a scrape.

45
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,926
- Plus, I had a plan the whole time.
- Really?

46
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:32,642
Yeah. I planned to get killed,
come back as a vampire and bite you.

47
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,088
- You wanted to be trained.
- The next time...

48
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,811
You did pretty well.

49
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:40,844
- I did?
- Yeah.

50
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:45,768
Cos, with the rolling thing, I was actually
using his strength. It was very t'ai chi.

51
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:50,404
- Plus, I nearly got the heart.
- My first time out, I missed the heart too.

52
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,764
- No way.
- Just the once.

53
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:58,449
- Well, the next vampire I meet...
- The next vampire you meet, you run away.

54
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:02,208
I just wish that was all we had to worry about.
Vampires, demons...

55
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,682
they're nothing compared to what's coming.

56
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:07,845
I know. I just can't believe it's back.

57
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,926
Believe me, I thought I was long past it.
I guess you never are.

58
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:16,884
A few more days till it starts, and...
then we'll never know what's coming next.

59
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:20,966
It is my great pleasure and privilege
to announce the official opening -

60
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,692
on the very ground that it first stood upon -

61
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:28,449
of the brand-new, state-of-the-art,
Sunnydale High!

62
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,761
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

63
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,492
- That doesn't belong there.
- No, it doesn't.

64
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:12,291
That's the flora kua ulaya.
Native of Paraguay, if my botany serves.

65
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:15,763
Is there anything
you don't know everything about?

66
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,845
Synchronised swimming.
Complete mystery to me.

67
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:26,244
Yep, Paraguay.

68
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,722
- Where's it come from?
- Paraguay.

69
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:34,284
- You brought it through the earth.
- It's all connected.

70
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:38,286
The root system, the molecules, the energy.

71
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:42,882
- Everything's connected.
- You sound like Miss Harkness.

72
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:48,051
- She's taught me a lot.
- Then why aren't you in your lesson?

73
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,967
- Sorry.
- It's all right. I think she was just...

74
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:54,965
Afraid. Yeah.

75
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:56,486
They all are.

76
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,805
The coven is...

77
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,647
They're the most amazing women
I've ever met.

78
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,726
But there's this look that they get.

79
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:08,601
Like I'm gonna turn them all
into bangers and mash, or something.

80
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,685
Which I'm not even really sure what that is.

81
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:14,845
They're cautious. I trust you understand that.

82
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,288
I don't have that much power, I don't think.

83
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:19,970
Everything is connected.

84
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:24,049
You're connected to a great power,
whether you feel it or not.

85
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:26,886
Well, you should just take it from me.

86
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:31,171
You know we can't.
This isn't a hobby or an addiction.

87
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,248
It's inside you now, this magic.

88
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,443
You're responsible for it.

89
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:41,685
- Will they always be afraid of me?
- Maybe. Can you handle that?

90
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:43,764
I deserve a lot worse.

91
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:47,571
- I killed people, Giles.
- I've not forgotten.

92
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,407
When you brought me here,
I thought it was to kill me.

93
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:56,886
Or to lock me in some mystical dungeon
for all eternity, or... with the torture.

94
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:01,209
Instead, you... go all Dumbledore on me.

95
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:04,167
I'm learning about magic,

96
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:08,485
all about energy and Gaia and root systems...

97
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,810
Do you want to be punished?

98
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,444
I wanna be Willow.

99
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,923
You are. In the end, we all are who we are.

100
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:24,250
No matter how much
we may appear to have changed.

101
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,725
- Dawn? Xander's here.
- Just a minute!

102
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:42,249
- You're gonna be late.
- I'm comfortable with that.

103
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,052
- Morning.
- You gotta eat something. I made cereal.

104
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,522
- OK!
- You're unconscionably spiffy.

105
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:50,446
Client meeting.
How exactly do you <i>make</i> cereal?

106
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:53,366
You put the box near the milk.
It was on the Food Channel.

107
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:56,843
- You want something?
- I ate. I'm good. How are you?

108
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:02,049
My sister's going to the same high school
that tried to kill me, I can't change districts,

109
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:06,968
I can't afford private school, and I can't
begin to prepare her for what might happen.

110
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,521
So, peachy with a side of keen,
that would be me.

111
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,649
Here's something for what ails you.

112
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,327
- Have you got the rest?
- Take a look.

113
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,089
- Hey, check out Double-o-Xander.
- Go, talk with your mouth full.

114
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:28,530
I've got two crews working on
this diabolical, yet lucrative new campus.

115
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:32,891
One here finishing the science building,
and one here reinforcing the gym.

116
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:35,885
There are no pentagrams,
no secret passageways.

117
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,203
Everything's up to code and safe as houses.

118
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:42,605
- Nothing creepy? Strange? From beyond?
- Maybe you're just paranoid.

119
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:44,684
There is one interesting detail.

120
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:48,129
I managed to scare up the plan
from the old high school.

121
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:51,364
You remember the very centre
of Sunnydale's own Hellmouth?

122
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:52,966
- Under the library.
- Right.

123
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:59,367
So I lined up the plans new and old, and right
exactly where the library was, we now have...

124
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:01,250
Principal's office.

125
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,370
- So, the principal's evil?
- Or in a boatload of danger.

126
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:07,968
The last two principals were eaten.
Who'd even apply for that job?

127
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,647
I guess we'll see.
Ooh, we have to leave though.

128
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,691
- Got everything? Books, lunch, stakes?
- Check thrice.

129
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,333
- Did you give her the...
- No, I was saving it.

130
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,085
What is it?

131
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,604
Back-to-school gift.

132
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:28,648
- It's a weapon, isn't it?
- Yes. It is.

133
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,568
I'll take her to class, have a look around.

134
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:40,043
- I'll be on-site here, so if you have any needs.
- Thanks.

135
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:52,211
Remember, if you see anything strange, or...

136
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:55,170
- dead...
- I got it.

137
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:58,928
And stay away from hyena people,
or any lizardy-type athletes.

138
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:01,083
Or if you see anyone that's invisible...

139
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:05,007
I think it's pretty safe to say
I'm not gonna see anybody that's invisible.

140
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:08,483
You could still drop out.
Only nerds finish high school.

141
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:12,282
It's not fair for you to try and scare me
on my first day of high school.

142
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:16,161
- Cos, it is <i>so</i> redundant.
- This place is evil.

143
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,524
<i>(man)</i> Tough to let 'em go, huh?

144
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:22,166
- Hi.
- I'm Robin Wood, new principal.

145
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,567
Oh. Buffy Summers. This is Dawn.

146
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,405
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

147
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:32,248
So you're the new principal.
I... expected you to be more... aged.

148
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,931
You seem a bit young
to have such a grown-up daughter.

149
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:37,731
No!

150
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,565
No... sister.

151
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:42,645
Oh, right... of course!

152
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:45,604
You didn't really think she's my...

153
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:48,968
- It's my hair. I have mom hair.
- No.

154
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:53,444
I have heard of you, Miss Summers, you
graduated from the old high school, right?

155
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,842
- Yeah, how did...
- I better get back to work.

156
00:12:55,933 --> 00:13:00,290
Gotta start deadening young minds.
It's really nice to meet you. You have fun.

157
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:05,603
- That was suspicious.
- You betcha. Bye.

158
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:08,571
- Ooh! Dawn...
- I know! You never know what's coming,

159
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:12,851
the stake is not the power, <i>To Serve Man</i>
is a cookbook, I love you. Go away!

160
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,244
<i>(class bell)</i>

161
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,333
OK. I'm Mr Longren.

162
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:23,723
Why don't we go around the room
and introduce ourselves?

163
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:26,168
Let's start with...

164
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:38,924
It's not mom hair.

165
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:47,925
You can't protect her.
You couldn't protect me.

166
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:56,204
Get out, get out, get out!

167
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,764
I love to dance. I like music.

168
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:10,768
I'm very into Britney Spears' early work,
before she sold out, so...

169
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:15,643
mostly her finger painting
and macaroni art. Very underrated.

170
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:20,844
Favourite activities include
not ever having to do this again, and...

171
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,366
Dawn!

172
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:26,613
- What?
- We have to go, it's not safe.

173
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:28,247
But...

174
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,366
We... I mean, I... saw...

175
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:35,045
Can I help you?

176
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:38,484
No. I...

177
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,731
Dawn, I just thought you were in danger...

178
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:45,132
of... smoking.

179
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,524
I'll... be around.

180
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:55,924
I also have a sister.

181
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,125
<i>(# "So High" by Strange Radio)</i>

182
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:16,611
God, they're depressing.

183
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:19,366
Who are they kidding
with that happy shiny crap?

184
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:24,486
Six weeks tops,
and she's calling on me for vengeance.

185
00:16:24,573 --> 00:16:26,768
Ooh, he'd better run for cover(!)

186
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,451
What's that supposed to mean?

187
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,047
Oh, sweetie, you know exactly what it means.

188
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,249
- Excuse me?
- It's the talk of the Order.

189
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,769
They're calling you Miss Soft Serve.
Tell me you don't know this.

190
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:39,605
But... who?

191
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:43,606
Listen, Anya. I know I've always been
a little competitive with you.

192
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:47,049
There was that thing in the Crimean War.
We laugh about it now,

193
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,488
but the fact is, I've always looked up to you.

194
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:53,282
You were the single most hard core
vengeance demon and everybody knew it.

195
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:55,443
Do I have to mention Mrs Czolgosz?

196
00:16:57,053 --> 00:17:00,568
- Good times.
- And then you lost your powers.

197
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,645
It happens, and...
you fell for this Xander guy.

198
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:07,408
It was a glitch. A summer thing.
I am so back in the vengeance fold.

199
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,484
No deaths. No eviscerations.

200
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:12,406
You're not goading women
into anything inventive.

201
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:13,528
I don't know...

202
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:17,288
Waitress downtown wished her husband
was a frog? You made him French!

203
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:21,565
He's smelly!
And with a little moustache, she...

204
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:25,965
- Listen, Anya. If it was just me...
- What do you mean, if it was just you?

205
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:30,046
D'Hoffryn? The lower beings?
They're all feeling the heat.

206
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:35,608
Something's rising. Something older than the
Old Ones, and everybody's tail is twitching.

207
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:39,368
- This is a bad time to be a good guy.
- What is this, an intervention?

208
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:42,331
- Shouldn't all my demon friends be here?
- Sweetie...

209
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,045
they are.

210
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,771
So, how's it looking?
Does the place pass inspection?

211
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:57,651
Oh, it's great! If you're a zombie ghost thing.

212
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,328
So school's back in session, huh?

213
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,884
Seems like old times.

214
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:10,482
- So, zombies or ghosts?
- I'm not sure. They were in the mirror,

215
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:13,451
but they disappeared.
But they touched me. I think.

216
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:17,287
- Let's just start with dead and pissed.
- They were after you personally?

217
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,887
Talked about protecting people.
Told me to leave.

218
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,964
No damage though?

219
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:26,205
I may have destroyed Dawn's social life
in 30 seconds. Apart from that, no.

220
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:29,922
Being popular isn't so great.
Or so I've read in books.

221
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:34,404
This isn't a coincidence. The school
being rebuilt? It means something.

222
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,248
As in what?

223
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,730
Can I borrow a pencil?

224
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,361
- Thanks a lot.
- Aargh!

225
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,372
Are you all right?

226
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,161
I'm sorry.

227
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:06,128
There was a bee. It flew in my eye.

228
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,130
I'm very allergic.

229
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,051
I think it's gone.

230
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:16,523
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- Of course.

231
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,412
Guess it runs in the family.

232
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,682
<i>(girl sobbing)</i>

233
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:54,244
<i>(sobbing continues)</i>

234
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,962
Ooh! Sorry!

235
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:15,042
Miss Summers.
I didn't know you were still about.

236
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,124
- I was looking...
- I thought, in general,

237
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:20,011
it was customary for a person
who's graduated to...

238
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,051
you know, go somewhere else.

239
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:27,730
Well, it's a new campus.
Just getting to know it.

240
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:30,407
You know, make sure it's safe. For my sister.

241
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:42,852
Hey.

242
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:47,851
- What's wrong?
- There's someone in here.

243
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,164
It's only me.

244
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,925
No. It's not.

245
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:59,686
You know, I... have to be honest,

246
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:03,766
I actually know a little bit more
about you than I let on before.

247
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:07,205
- Isn't that interesting.
- Oh, it really is.

248
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:09,488
Let's get you out of here, OK?

249
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,044
Maybe we can get some air.

250
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:19,605
- I'm Dawn.
- Kit.

251
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:26,444
- Saw something pretty creepy, huh?
- You wouldn't believe me.

252
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:33,324
I kinda sorta think I will.
Was there a pencil involved in any of...

253
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:38,807
<i>(both)</i> Aargh!

254
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:41,291
Come on!

255
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:59,644
- Just breathe!
- Giles, I... can't!

256
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:03,007
- God, it's...
- Just breathe.

257
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,165
What happened?

258
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:12,244
What do you remember?

259
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:18,648
We were talking... and... I felt...

260
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,724
<i>(rumbling)</i>

261
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:23,604
I felt the earth.

262
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:27,245
It's all connected. It is, but...

263
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:31,883
It's not all good and... pure and rootsy.

264
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:37,649
There's... deep... deep black, there's...

265
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:41,732
I saw... the earth, Giles.

266
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,451
- I saw its teeth.
- The Hellmouth.

267
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:49,412
It's gonna open.

268
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,484
It's gonna swallow us all.

269
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,324
Hey. Hey, wake up.

270
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:08,284
Please wake up.

271
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:11,524
Oh, God.

272
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:16,804
Are you OK?

273
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:21,003
- We have to leave.
- You're not wrong.

274
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:26,367
Come on. There's gotta be a staircase.

275
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:31,446
The school board recommended
I read your record.

276
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:35,731
It's quite a page-turner.
Kind of a chequered past.

277
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:41,892
More like a plaid.
A kind of a clan tartan of badness, really.

278
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:44,009
You know, but there were factors.

279
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:48,205
What did you see?
When I found you in the stall.

280
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,012
A girl.

281
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:56,847
She said she died here, and that everybody
dies here and that... we would too.

282
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:59,083
Here I was worried about not fitting in.

283
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,845
<i>(both scream)</i>

284
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:03,083
- Who are you?
- Who are you?!

285
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:05,243
- Are you dead?
- Stop saying that!

286
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:08,769
We're not dead. We saw creepy dead people.
We're just trying to get out.

287
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:11,367
I just came down here for a smoke.
And I saw a...

288
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:15,128
It was a janitor. He was yelling at me.
I thought he was just pissed, but...

289
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:18,444
- I saw him in the light.
- Wait, you came down stairs? Where?

290
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:23,971
Man, I got no clue. I ran away like a girl.
I don't know this place at all.

291
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,252
OK.

292
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:31,168
- So, we can run around in circles or...
- You really think you can run away?

293
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:36,651
- It's not real.
- Lesson one - it's always real.

294
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,405
<i>(second man)</i> I tried to run too.

295
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:41,445
<i>(woman)</i> I tried to scream.

296
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:45,242
It doesn't matter how much you scream.
Nobody ever hears you.

297
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:49,967
Hear me. Right! Oh, I got a present!

298
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:51,452
What is it?

299
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:53,562
A weapon.

300
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:58,773
- It's clear your sister looks up to you...
- No, she's much, much worse than me.

301
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:02,209
A troublemaker.
Expulsion is really the only way to go.

302
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,922
You know, or you could
suspend her for three... years.

303
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:10,211
How about we give her a chance first?
Just as long as she keeps her grades up...

304
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:12,853
<i>- (phone rings)</i>
- Boy! That's loud.

305
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:16,767
- That's why we don't allow cellphones...
- Excuse me. Yeah?

306
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,445
Sorry, my dog... dog... walker.

307
00:25:23,653 --> 00:25:26,451
- They're really dead?
- Oh, my God!

308
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:30,405
- No, I'll be right there.
- Your dogs are dead?

309
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:35,887
And Buffy? Isn't this reception amazing?
I'm in the fricking basement!

310
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,724
- OK.
- Sorry about that.

311
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:41,524
I have to...

312
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:46,607
Yeah, no, of course.
And good luck with that... dog tragedy.

313
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,686
Help is on the way, guys.
We've just gotta figure out...

314
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:58,170
Where did they go?

315
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:32,332
Dawn?

316
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:45,764
<i>(phone rings)</i>

317
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,444
Dawn? I'm close by.

318
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:56,924
<i>(man)</i> Too late. But then,
you're always too late, aren't you?

319
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:59,004
Sure as hell didn't save me.

320
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:04,203
Where's my sister?

321
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:06,170
I think she's lost.

322
00:27:06,253 --> 00:27:10,212
If I'm the one who let you die,
why take it out on her? I'm right here.

323
00:27:10,293 --> 00:27:13,808
Come on, what are you after?
Fear? Revenge? Tasty brains?

324
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:16,123
I'd like Dawn to be my girlfriend.

325
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:20,004
Again, wrong sister.
I'm the one that dates dead guys.

326
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:24,484
And no offence, but they were hotties.
I'm sure you had a great personality...

327
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:30,170
Busy making out with your dead boyfriend
while I was ripped to death by a werewolf?

328
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:32,084
Is that why you let me die?

329
00:27:32,173 --> 00:27:36,052
- I was screaming for help when they...
- Hello? Not making myself clear.

330
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:40,172
I don't care how you died. I'm sorry
for your loss, but where is my sister?

331
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:42,369
- Dawn!
- She's not gonna hear you.

332
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:45,286
- This place is like a maze.
- This place is ours now.

333
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,364
It was built on our graves.

334
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:51,332
All we want is for you to leave,
so we can rest again.

335
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:56,762
Actually, I'm thinking all you want
is to get between me and that door.

336
00:27:59,693 --> 00:28:01,684
Who's for finding out why?

337
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:16,443
If at first you don't succeed...

338
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:19,372
Cheat.

339
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:26,684
Dawnie, we have to get out...

340
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:38,365
Spike?

341
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:43,049
Are you real?

342
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:56,568
Buffy... duck.

343
00:28:57,213 --> 00:29:00,603
What? Duck? There's a duck?

344
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,971
No visitors today. Terribly busy.

345
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,003
Told you to get out.

346
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:20,370
- They'll probably show up in a sec.
- Nobody comes in here.

347
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,892
- It's just the three of us.
- Have you seen Dawn?

348
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:27,568
- She's down here with some kids.
- Don't you think I'm trying?!

349
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:33,489
I'm not fast. Not a quick study.

350
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:39,048
I dropped my board in the water
and the chalk all ran.

351
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:41,645
Sure to be caned.

352
00:29:43,053 --> 00:29:45,044
Should've seen that coming.

353
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,725
What did you do?

354
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:16,692
I tried...

355
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:19,924
I tried to cut it out.

356
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:25,284
<i>(phone rings)</i>

357
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:30,367
- Dawn?
- Buffy, where are you?

358
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,647
I...

359
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,568
- It's in my instinct...
- Where are you?

360
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:39,521
I don't know. In a room by the furnace.

361
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:42,889
Near where we fell in.
They dragged us in here then disappeared.

362
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,612
- Yeah, they came after me too.
- What do they want?

363
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:48,730
- So far, to piss me off.
- Please, tell me it's working.

364
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:54,171
I'm damage-bound. But ghosts can't touch
you and zombies can't disappear, so...

365
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,721
- Not ghosts.
<i>- (Dawn) Who was that?</i>

366
00:30:57,613 --> 00:30:58,966
Hold on.

367
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:00,645
You know what they are?

368
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:05,366
Manifest spirits controlled by a talisman,
raised to seek vengeance.

369
00:31:05,453 --> 00:31:07,648
A four-year-old could figure it.

370
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:11,570
Hang tight. I'll find you.
These things can hurt you.

371
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:15,202
You could hurt them too.
Find a weapon. I'll come for you.

372
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:18,805
- You gonna help me out?
- This is my home. I belong here.

373
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:20,372
Always been here.

374
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,925
Cheers for stopping by.

375
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,925
It's in the walls.

376
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:31,364
<i>(whimpering)</i>

377
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:34,164
I'll... get back to you.

378
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:41,692
Guys?

379
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:45,604
Resentful dead guys?

380
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:52,850
This can't be good.

381
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:58,164
Come on. Manifest spirits,
raised up, controlled by a...

382
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:01,012
talisman.

383
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:07,922
Xander.

384
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:11,642
We need to find some kind of a weapon.
Just to hold them off.

385
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,725
I got these.

386
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,404
Kit, give me your bag.

387
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:36,090
- Do you think they're gonna come back?
<i>- (mocking)</i> Think they're gonna come back?

388
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:40,086
We never left. We'll always be here.
Just like you.

389
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:42,047
No.

390
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:44,283
Why do you think we picked you?

391
00:32:44,373 --> 00:32:47,888
The ones no one will miss.
The ones that don't belong.

392
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:54,166
Spend all your time trying to get out of high
school, and now you'll never, ever leave.

393
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:00,122
Aargh!

394
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,452
Whoa!

395
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,644
Contracty goodness.

396
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:13,643
Talisman... talisman.

397
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,927
You can thank your sister for this.

398
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:25,253
- Thanks, sis.
- We need to keep them at bay.

399
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,612
The bag!

400
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:03,252
Yes!

401
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:06,245
Talisman.

402
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,723
- You really wanna keep this up?
- What are you gonna do? Kill us?

403
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,525
Aargh!

404
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,922
- Are they gone?
- Yeah.

405
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:36,366
The talisman must have been destroyed.

406
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:38,648
How'd you know it was a talisman?

407
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:41,284
There's always a talisman.

408
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:44,966
The real question is, who put it there?

409
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:47,965
Come on, you guys.
Let's go find a way upstairs.

410
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:50,044
Assuming there is one.

411
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:55,050
You really weren't kidding about this place.

412
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,124
I guess it hasn't changed.

413
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:00,128
I don't know. It seems smaller.

414
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:07,529
You're gonna be OK. School's intense,
but you'll do all right if you're careful.

415
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:10,571
And, you might wanna
think about sticking together.

416
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:12,245
Thank you.

417
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:17,764
Yeah, I mean it.
You are the coolest mom ever.

418
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:21,204
O... K! Come on!

419
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:24,285
We still have a few more classes
to live through.

420
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:33,650
- Curiouser and curiouser.
- What is?

421
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:36,613
Carlos Trejo and Kit Hollburn, right?

422
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:41,209
Possibly the only two students in this school
whose files are as thick as yours was.

423
00:35:41,293 --> 00:35:43,170
You really did your homework.

424
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:47,849
I was looking for one or both of them
to implode right before midterms...

425
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:52,002
but now I see that you got 'em
socialising and hugging, and actually,

426
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:54,687
if I'm not mistaken, headed <i>to</i> class.

427
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:57,731
Well, we shared an... encounter.

428
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:00,850
I know you were probably
happy to get out of this place,

429
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,845
but, I gotta tell you, Miss Summers,
I think you belong here.

430
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:07,084
- Hamnoo?
- Listen, I know this school's reputation.

431
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:09,812
What, you think I got this job
based on seniority?

432
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:14,011
We got troubled students here, and just
enough money to keep it from caving in.

433
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:18,769
- Yeah, you might need a little extra there.
- We do have a community outreach program,

434
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:22,482
and the money we could pay you
wouldn't even fold,

435
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:28,011
- but it would be a couple of days a week.
- Are you... asking me to be a counsellor?

436
00:36:28,093 --> 00:36:31,768
We have a guidance counsellor,
but the kids could use someone...

437
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:34,083
- closer to their age who still...
- I'm in.

438
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,686
What, you're serious? You did hear
the part about the money, right?

439
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:44,564
Yeah, I heard. My schedule might be
a little fun-tastic... but I'll work it out.

440
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:49,161
- I'd like to keep an eye on this place.
- Well, that's great!

441
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:53,926
It's not even noon and I've bullied
my first family member into helping out.

442
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:56,208
I'm gonna be the best principal ever.

443
00:36:59,573 --> 00:37:01,291
<i>(Spike) Everything is...</i>

444
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:05,485
I had a speech. I learned it all.

445
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:10,925
Oh, God, she won't understand,
she won't understand.

446
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:13,607
Of course she won't understand, Sparky.

447
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:16,244
I'm beyond her understanding.

448
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:21,767
She's a girl! Sugar and spice and everything...
useless unless you're baking.

449
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,084
I'm more than that.

450
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:27,085
- More than flesh.
- More than blood.

451
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:32,964
I'm... you know, I honestly don't think there's
a human word fabulous enough for me.

452
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:38,252
Oh, my name will be on everyone's lips.
Assuming their lips haven't been torn off.

453
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,563
But not just yet. That's all right though.

454
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:45,124
I can be patient.

455
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:48,011
Everything is well within parameters.

456
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:52,082
She's exactly where I want her to be.

457
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:55,124
And so are you, No.17.

458
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:58,844
You're right where you belong.

459
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:05,045
What'd you think, you'd get your soul back
and everything would be jim-dandy?

460
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:09,331
A soul's slipperier than a greased weasel.
Why do you think I sold mine?

461
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:15,767
Well, you probably thought that
you'd be your own man. And I respect that.

462
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:17,844
- But you...
- ..never will.

463
00:38:18,853 --> 00:38:20,844
You'll always be mine.

464
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:24,047
You'll always be in the dark with me.

465
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:27,727
Singing our little songs.

466
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,962
You like our little songs, don't you?

467
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:35,168
You've always liked them,
right from the beginning.

468
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:39,202
<i>(whispers)</i> And that's where we're going.

469
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:41,967
Right back to the beginning.

470
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,887
Not the bang. Not the word.

471
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:49,204
The true beginning.

472
00:38:50,813 --> 00:38:53,486
The next few months
are going to be quite a ride.

473
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:57,771
And I think we're all going to learn
something about ourselves in the process.

474
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:00,572
You'll learn you're a pathetic schmuck,

475
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,328
if it hasn't sunk in already.

476
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:06,125
Look at you.

477
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:08,684
Tried to do what's right.

478
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:10,965
Just like her.

479
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:13,444
You still don't get it.

480
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:15,842
It's not about right.

481
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,924
Not about wrong.

482
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:26,164
It's about power.
