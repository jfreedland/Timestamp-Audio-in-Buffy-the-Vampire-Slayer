00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,385
We go live to our field reporter,

3
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,138
who is at the waterfront
with this breaking news

4
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:06,350
about the murder that has shocked
the Mayor and residents of Sunnydale,

5
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:11,981
Fishermen discovered the body
today, the victim of a brutal stabbing,

6
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:18,070
Everyone was shocked when the slain man
was identified as Deputy Mayor, Allan Finch,

7
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:21,949
Still reeling from the news,
Mayor Wilkins had this to say:

8
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,746
Mr Finch was not only
my longtime aide and associate,

9
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:30,041
he was a close personal friend,

10
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:34,795
I promise you, I will not rest until whoever
did this is found and brought to justice,

11
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:37,548
Thank you very much,

12
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:41,260
Honey, you're up. It's just terrible, isn't it?

13
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:46,283
I want you to look into this. Find out all you
can about the murder of the Deputy Mayor.

14
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:52,373
But that's... I mean, that's not really
our jurisdiction, is it?

15
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,712
- It's no big, B. We'll get into it if he wants.
- No. Buffy's right.

16
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:02,508
The Deputy Mayor's murder was caused by
human malice. Nothing supernatural about it.

17
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:06,429
We don't know that for certain.
I say it merits investigation.

18
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,889
Which I'm sure the police are doing.

19
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:12,727
In the meantime, if you ask me,
there are better uses for the slayers' time.

20
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:15,646
But I don't believe I did ask you.

21
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,568
Considering the success
of your previous adventure...

22
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:24,655
Don't let me interrupt.
Wait. Let me interrupt. I'm in a hurry.

23
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:28,743
- What did you need?
- Psych class. Freud and Jung. Book me?

24
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:32,663
Happily.

25
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:37,460
Check out Giles, the next generation.
What's your deal?

26
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:39,253
I...

27
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,423
Well...

28
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:44,759
- I'm...
- New watcher.

29
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:48,804
- Does everybody know about you?
- She's a friend.

30
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:52,058
Let's not exaggerate.

31
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,644
So you're the new watcher.

32
00:03:55,853 --> 00:03:57,688
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

33
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:01,275
I like a man with two last names. I'm Cordelia.

34
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,779
- And you teach psychology?
- I take psychology.

35
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:08,574
- She's a student.
- Well... Yes.

36
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,952
In fact, I am here to watch.

37
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:15,623
Girls. Buffy and Faith, to be specific.

38
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,044
Well, it's about time
we got some fresh blood around here.

39
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:24,590
Well, fresh.

40
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:27,134
Yes.

41
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:30,221
- Here we go.
- Thanks.

42
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,349
So, welcome to Sunnydale.

43
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:40,231
My.

44
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:42,108
She's cheeky, isn't she?

45
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:46,112
First word, "jail", second word, "bait".

46
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,200
Well, where were we?

47
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:53,369
Done.

48
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,246
I mean, we were done, right?

49
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,667
Yep. Off to patrol. So we'll see ya.

50
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,502
One moment, girls.

51
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,756
I am your commander now and,
on the matter of this murder, I am resolved.

52
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:09,552
"Natural" or "super", I want to know.

53
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:13,180
Fine by me. Always ready
to kick a little bad guy butt.

54
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,529
So, you gonna rat me out? Is that it?

55
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:33,701
Faith, we have to tell. I can't pretend to
investigate this. I can't pretend I don't know.

56
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:36,954
But you can pretend Angel's dead
when you need to protect him.

57
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,290
I am trying to protect you.

58
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:42,710
If we don't do the right thing,
it'll make things worse for you.

59
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:46,339
Worse than jail for the rest
of my young life? No way.

60
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,549
- What we did was...
- Yeah. We.

61
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,469
You were there beside me
when this thing went down.

62
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:54,096
Anything I have to answer for, you do too.

63
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:56,807
You're a part of this, B. All the way.

64
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:26,003
- Hey.
- Hey.

65
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:29,965
Where's Faith? I saw her around.

66
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,720
Figured you two were gonna
go kill some more nasty stuff.

67
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,099
Not right now. I think she bailed.

68
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,269
- Will, I...
- Actually, I...

69
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,274
You go ahead.

70
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,777
I'm late.

71
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,822
I'm meeting Michael, the warlock guy.

72
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:55,366
We're still tryin' to "de-rat" Amy.

73
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:58,536
OK.

74
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,915
So, see ya.

75
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,752
See ya.

76
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,054
So you heard the man scream
about what time last night?

77
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,724
I'm not sure. Seven. Maybe eight.

78
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:24,145
Can you be more specific?
Say, between seven-thirty and eight?

79
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,080
- Your hand.
- It's OK.

80
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,762
It's not working.

81
00:07:57,803 --> 00:07:59,555
It does something besides shred?

82
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:04,518
It's supposed to cheer me up! Usually,
using the shredder gives me a lift. It's fun.

83
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,438
- And today you're not gettin' the ya-yas.
- No.

84
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:12,902
It'll take more than this
to turn my frown upside down.

85
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:17,657
I just don't understand why Allan would
leave such a paper trail about our dealings.

86
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,371
Do you think he was gonna betray me?
Now that's a horrible thought.

87
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,957
And now he's dead,
I'll never have the chance to scold him.

88
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,085
Maybe this'll change your mood.

89
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:33,631
- What is it?
- A bombshell.

90
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,134
The Deputy Mayor had
wooden splinters in his wound.

91
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,597
Struck right through the heart
with a sharp, pointed object.

92
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:46,185
Word is, someone was fighting vampires
not a block away from the scene.

93
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:49,563
The smart money says
it was a slayer who did this job.

94
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,691
What, do you think he talked? To them?

95
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:55,152
If he did,
I'm thinkin' he said the wrong thing.

96
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:59,156
Well, this is exciting.

97
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,410
The Slayer up for murder one.

98
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,706
That's sunshine and roses to me. It really is.

99
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,272
I'm tellin' you, we did the world a favour.

100
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:35,026
This guy was about as interesting
as watching paint dry.

101
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:36,527
Faith...

102
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:38,738
Joking. Jeez, lighten up a little, B.

103
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,628
He came out of nowhere.

104
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:57,506
I know.

105
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:02,261
Whatever. I'm not lookin' to
hug and cry, learn and grow.

106
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,056
I'm just saying it happened quick, you know?

107
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,645
You know what? Let's just blow.

108
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:14,315
Who cares what this guy was about?
It's moot now, don't you think?

109
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,943
I don't think he was in that alley by chance.
He was looking for us.

110
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:21,906
- I'd like to know why.
- So you think there's some big conspiracy?

111
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,077
You were saying?

112
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:29,622
So his papers are gone.
Doesn't prove anything.

113
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,209
Except that somebody
didn't want us to prove anything.

114
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:48,891
- Get as many men on it as you can.
- Yeah.

115
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,102
We'll be wantin' to turn up the heat.

116
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:07,368
So the Mayor of Sunnydale is a black hat.
That's a shocker, huh?

117
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:13,499
- Yeah. I didn't get the bad guy vibe off him.
- When are you gonna learn, B?

118
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,293
It doesn't matter
what vibe you get off a person.

119
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:20,297
Nine times outta ten the face
they're showing you is not the real one.

120
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,842
I guess you know a lot about that.

121
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,887
What is that supposed to mean?

122
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:30,933
Look at you, Faith.
Less than 24 hours ago you killed a man.

123
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:33,477
And now it's all zip-a-dee-doo-dah?

124
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,938
That's not your real face and I know it.

125
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:38,899
I know what you're feeling.
I'm feeling it, too.

126
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,569
Do you? So fill me in, cos I'd like to hear this.

127
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,532
Dirty. Like something sick creeped inside you
and you can't get it out.

128
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:49,910
And you hope it was just some nightmare,
but it wasn't.

129
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:54,206
- And we'll have to figure out...
- Is there gonna be an intermission in this?

130
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:58,002
Just let me talk to Giles. I swear...

131
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,755
We're not bringing anybody else into this.

132
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:04,133
Keep your head.
This will blow over in a few days.

133
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,052
And if it doesn't?

134
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,971
If it doesn't,
a freighter leaves the docks twice a day.

135
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:13,100
- Ain't fancy, but it gets you gone.
- And that's it? You live with it?

136
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,896
You see the dead guy in your head
every day for the rest of your life?

137
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:19,815
Buffy, I'm not gonna see anything.

138
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:25,738
I missed the mark last night. And I'm sorry
about the guy. I really am. But it happens.

139
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:30,076
Anyways, how many people do you think
we've saved by now? Thousands?

140
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:34,914
You stopped the world ending. In my book,
that puts you and me in the plus column.

141
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,958
We help people.
It doesn't mean we can do what we want.

142
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:42,588
Why not? The guy I offed was no Gandhi.
I mean, he was mixed up in dirty dealings.

143
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:45,883
Maybe. But what if
he was coming to us for help?

144
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:50,346
What if he was? You're still not seeing the
big picture, B. Something made us different.

145
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:54,016
- We're warriors. We were built to kill.
- To kill demons.

146
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:57,395
It does not mean we can pass judgement,
like we're better than everybody.

147
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:59,814
We are better.

148
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:04,193
That's right. Better.

149
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,696
People need us to survive.

150
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:10,199
In the balance, nobody's gonna
cry over a random bystander

151
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:12,702
who got caught in the crossfire.

152
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,578
I am.

153
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:18,582
That's your loss.

154
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:32,680
Buffy.

155
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:39,353
Tell me again.
You got home at what time last night?

156
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:42,690
Late. A little past one, I guess.

157
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:47,236
Maybe you can explain to me
what a girl your age is doin' out all night.

158
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,655
Just hangin'.

159
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,450
Hanging? By yourself?

160
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,869
No. I was with my friend, Buffy.

161
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:59,457
- We were at Faith's, watching TV.
- What did you watch?

162
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,085
Some old movie.

163
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,212
Infomercial.

164
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:10,259
That's funny. Cos I've got a couple of
witnesses who put you near the alley.

165
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,346
Witnesses?

166
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:22,480
Somebody stabbed this guy through
the heart. Strange thing is the weapon.

167
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,232
It was made outta wood.

168
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:28,986
Any of this mean anything to you?

169
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,449
Yeah. That whoever did it
wasn't hip to the Bronze Age.

170
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,829
Is that it? I'm kinda beat.

171
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:42,750
Yeah. I have enough for now.

172
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:47,380
Buffy, if you know something,
if you're protecting someone,

173
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:52,385
I promise you, it'd be better for everyone
if you come clean.

174
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:54,637
You mean, am I covering for someone?

175
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:57,848
Hardly. I'm not the
"throw myself on the sword" type.

176
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,267
I wish I could help you.

177
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:04,438
Well, call me if you remember anything.

178
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:43,853
Hey.

179
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:45,730
Hey.

180
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,775
I need to talk to you.

181
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:52,945
Good. Cos I've been letting things fester.

182
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:56,032
And I don't like it.

183
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:59,076
I wanna be fester-free.

184
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:02,288
Yeah. Me too.

185
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:05,416
I mean, don't get me wrong.

186
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,962
I completely understand why you and Faith
have been doing the bonding thing.

187
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:14,050
You guys work together.
You should get along.

188
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:16,469
- It's more complicated than that.
- But, see,

189
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:19,805
it's that exact thing that's ticking me off.

190
00:16:20,473 --> 00:16:23,684
It's this whole "slayers only" attitude.

191
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:28,606
Since when wouldn't I understand?
You talk to me about everything.

192
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:33,152
It's like all of a sudden
I'm not cool enough for you

193
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:36,364
because I can't kill things
with my bare hands.

194
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,702
Buffy, don't cry.

195
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,830
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:49,043
I was too hard on you. Sometimes I unleash.
I don't know my own strength.

197
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,506
It's bad. I'm bad.

198
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:55,758
I'm a bad, bad, bad person.

199
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,885
Will, I'm in trouble.

200
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:02,765
And Faith acts like she doesn't even care.

201
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:06,602
The way she talks,
it's like she didn't even make a mistake.

202
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:09,772
Do you think she's, like, in shock?

203
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:14,777
I don't know. But I think that detective
knows more than he's saying.

204
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:20,157
- I think he knew that I was lying.
- You have to go to Giles, Buffy.

205
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:23,119
He'll know what to do.

206
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:41,762
Giles?

207
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:48,019
Buffy.

208
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:58,070
I don't really know how to say this,
so I'm just gonna say it.

209
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:03,451
I know I've kept things from you before, but...

210
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:11,000
But...

211
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,919
But I've been blowing off my classes,

212
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:16,589
you know, in the sense of not attending.

213
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:20,259
- And...
- It's OK, Buffy. I told him.

214
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:25,890
- You told him?
- I had to.

215
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,977
He had to know what you did.

216
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:31,812
What I did?

217
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,693
Giles, no. That's not what happened.

218
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,779
- I don't want to hear it.
- No, I...

219
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:43,032
- I want no more lies.
- You can't be serious. You're setting me up?

220
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:45,826
In my office. Faith, we'll talk in the morning.

221
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:48,496
- Giles, please, you have to...
- Now.

222
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,923
I'm sorry.

223
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:12,687
Giles, I didn't do this. I swear.

224
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,524
Look, I know that I messed up badly.
But the murder was...

225
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:18,734
Faith. I know.

226
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:26,701
She may have many talents, Buffy,
but fortunately lying is not one of them.

227
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,749
Oh, God.

228
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:37,878
- I thought...
- I'm sorry.

229
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:45,136
I needed her to think that I was on her side.
I don't know how far she'll take this charade.

230
00:19:45,678 --> 00:19:47,513
Try far.

231
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,390
Like, all the way.

232
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,438
- You should have come to me right off.
- I know.

233
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:57,523
Well, I wanted to.

234
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,360
- But Faith wouldn't hear of it?
- It's not all her fault.

235
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:04,572
We both thought it was a vampire.
I only realised a second before.

236
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:08,034
Buffy, this is not the first time
something like this has happened.

237
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:09,452
It's not?

238
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:12,663
The Slayer is on the front line
of a nightly war.

239
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:15,666
It's tragic, but accidents have happened.

240
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:21,964
- What do you do?
- Well, the Council investigates.

241
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:26,177
Metes out punishment if punishment is due.

242
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:28,804
I have no plan to involve them.

243
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:31,932
I mean, it's the last thing
Faith needs at the moment.

244
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,729
She's unstable, Buffy.
She's utterly unable to accept responsibility.

245
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,149
She's freaking.

246
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:43,444
So then we just have to help her deal, right?

247
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:47,782
She's in denial. There is no help for her
until she admits what happened.

248
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,076
I could talk to her.

249
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:53,037
Perhaps.

250
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:55,081
Or maybe I'm too close.

251
00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:59,669
- Maybe one of the guys could?
- We should meet.

252
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:04,256
It may be that they're seeing
a different side of her.

253
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:06,342
OK.

254
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,096
In the meantime,

255
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:14,141
no one else is to know. Understood?

256
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:17,269
Of course.

257
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,981
Now this is extremely delicate.

258
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:24,485
If we scare her off now,
we may lose her forever.

259
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:44,380
Yes, hello. Mr Travers, please.
Quentin Travers.

260
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:47,383
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce calling.

261
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,678
The codeword? Monkey.

262
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:56,559
M-O-N-K... Just put him on, will you?
This is an emergency.

263
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:01,022
Maybe we should talk to Faith together,

264
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:04,775
You mean, like that intervention thing
you guys did on me?

265
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,862
As I recall, Xander and I
nearly came to blows.

266
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:12,283
You nearly came to blows.
I nearly came to loss of limbs.

267
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:16,579
No, Faith is too defensive
for a confrontation like that.

268
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,291
She'd respond better
to a one-on-one approach.

269
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,585
I can be the one. On her one.

270
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:28,549
Let's rephrase. I think she might listen to me.

271
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:31,594
We kind of have a connection.

272
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,680
A connection? Why would you think that...

273
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:37,141
I'm saying it's worth a shot. That's all.

274
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:39,310
No, I don't see it, Xander.

275
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:43,939
I mean, of all of us, you're the one person
arguably Faith has had the least contact with.

276
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:46,817
Yeah, but we hung out a little.

277
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:51,656
- Recently. And she seemed to be responsive.
- When did you guys hang out?

278
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,285
She was fighting one of those
apocalypse demon things and I helped her.

279
00:22:56,869 --> 00:22:59,246
- Gave her a ride home.
- And you guys talked?

280
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:03,125
Not extensively. No.

281
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,960
Then why would you...?

282
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:16,013
I don't need to say "Oh". I got it before.

283
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:18,099
They slept together.

284
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,022
Fine. Let's move on.

285
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:30,361
Look, I know that you mean well, Xander,
but I just don't see Faith opening up to you.

286
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:38,119
She doesn't take the guys that she
has a connection with very seriously.

287
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:41,247
They're kind of a big joke to her.

288
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,375
No offence.

289
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,962
Oh, no. I mean,
why would I be offended by that?

290
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,300
However, if you still want to be of assistance,
I need some help with research.

291
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:56,137
There's still the business of
the Mayor and Mr Trick to attend to.

292
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:59,098
Yeah. They seemed pretty cosy
the other night.

293
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:02,393
Willow, can you access the Mayor's files?

294
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:05,730
What?

295
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,190
Sure. I can try.

296
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,986
Good. Yes. Because, clearly,
we'll need to take a harder look at him.

297
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,281
He's obviously up to something.

298
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:18,784
What about Faith?

299
00:24:21,954 --> 00:24:24,248
I don't know. We need time.

300
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:26,709
She needs help now.

301
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:30,880
I owe her that.

302
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:30,773
What?

303
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:37,154
I just came by to see how you are, actually.

304
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:40,408
Sick of people asking me that, for one thing.

305
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:48,874
Can I come in? Just to talk, I promise.

306
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:52,545
Think something could happen
if I didn't want it to?

307
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,922
Yeah. You got me there.

308
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:58,926
Pretty much not gonna try to take ya
under any circumstances.

309
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:04,098
See? Here. Feel that.
Probably like a wet noodle to ya, huh?

310
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,642
- Five minutes.
- That's all I need.

311
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:10,855
For talking.
In conversation, I'm quick as a bunny.

312
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:13,149
The clock is running.

313
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,657
It's just I heard about what happened
and I thought you might need a friend.

314
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:25,369
So go talk to Buffy.
She's the one who killed the guy.

315
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:27,538
Yeah. I heard that version.

316
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:29,332
Version?

317
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:33,919
Either way, it sounds like it was an accident
and that's the important part.

318
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:39,050
No. The important part is that
Buffy is the "accidental" murderer.

319
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:43,262
Faith, you may not think so,
but I sort of know you.

320
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:50,019
And I've seen you post-battle. And I know,
first hand, that you're like a wild thing.

321
00:26:50,728 --> 00:26:53,314
And, half the time,
you don't know what you're doin'.

322
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:56,067
And you're living proof of that, aren't you?

323
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,571
See, you can try to hurt me, but right now
you need someone on your side.

324
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:06,994
What happened wasn't your fault. I'm willing
to testify to that. In court, if you need me.

325
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:10,414
You'd dig that, wouldn't you?

326
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:15,127
To get up in front of all your geek pals and
say how I made you my boy toy for a night.

327
00:27:15,753 --> 00:27:18,881
- No. No, that's not it.
- I know what this is all about.

328
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:22,843
You came by here
cos you want another taste, don't you?

329
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,220
No.

330
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:27,098
I mean, it was nice. It was great.

331
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:30,726
It was kind of a blur.

332
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:32,186
But, OK.

333
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,064
Someday, sure, yay.

334
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:36,857
But not now.

335
00:27:38,275 --> 00:27:39,944
Not like this.

336
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:42,989
Well, like how then? Lights on or off?

337
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,408
- Kinks or vanilla?
- Faith, come on.

338
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,869
I came here to help you.

339
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,001
I thought we had a connection.

340
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:02,758
You wanna feel our connection?

341
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:05,136
It's just skin.

342
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:07,888
I see. I want. I take.

343
00:28:11,434 --> 00:28:13,269
I forget.

344
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:15,771
No. Wait.

345
00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:19,483
- It was more than that.
- I could do anything to you now.

346
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,402
And you want me to.

347
00:28:22,695 --> 00:28:24,530
I could make you scream.

348
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,540
I could make you die.

349
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:20,044
Finally decided to tie me up, huh? I always
knew you weren't really a one-slayer guy.

350
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:24,507
I'm sorry about the chains.
It's not that I don't trust you. It...

351
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:26,968
Actually, it is that I don't trust you.

352
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,180
That thing with Xander... I know what
it looked like, but we were just playin'.

353
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:33,724
And he forgot the safety word.

354
00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:37,061
- Is that it?
- Safety words are for wusses.

355
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:41,649
I bet you're not big on trust games, Faith.

356
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:44,360
You gonna shrink me now, that it?

357
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:46,654
No. I just wanna talk to you.

358
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:48,739
That's what they all say.

359
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:53,244
And then it's "Just let me stay the night.
I won't try anything."

360
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:56,706
You wanna go the long way around?
I can do that.

361
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:00,626
I'm not gettin' any older.

362
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:18,894
- How's she doing?
- It's like talking to a wall.

363
00:30:19,437 --> 00:30:22,356
- Only you get more from a wall.
- But you'll keep trying?

364
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,943
Sure. We're just gettin' started.

365
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,989
- So what do I do?
- Look, right now there's nothing you can do.

366
00:30:31,949 --> 00:30:35,453
This could take a while.
So I'll go to Faith's and get some of her stuff.

367
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:39,665
- That way she'll see that we're on her side.
- That's a good idea.

368
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:42,084
- OK. I'll be back.
- Look, I...

369
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:48,382
I don't want you to get your hopes up, Buffy.
She may not want us to help her.

370
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:51,636
She does.
She just doesn't know how to say it.

371
00:30:51,969 --> 00:30:55,306
She killed a man.
That changes everything for her.

372
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:58,392
Giles said, with counselling,
they might not lock her up.

373
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:00,686
That's not what I mean.

374
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,732
She's taken a life.

375
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:06,942
I know.

376
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:09,195
She's got a taste for it now.

377
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:16,452
Not one slayer, but two.
Right here in the building.

378
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,374
- There was supposed to be a guard.
- Here comes my favourite part.

379
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:25,336
Where the slayers see us
in the hall together, thick as thieves.

380
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:28,255
Wait, we are thieves. And worse.
And now they know it.

381
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:31,300
They're not gonna be much of a threat in jail.

382
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:34,178
We don't have near enough
evidence to put 'em away.

383
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:39,475
No. You're gonna have to come up
with a more efficient solution.

384
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:42,937
And, Mr Trick, you'd better think of it soon.

385
00:31:52,947 --> 00:31:55,199
I know what's goin' on with you.

386
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:58,995
Join the club.
Everybody seems to have a theory.

387
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:02,707
But I know what it's like to take a life.

388
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:08,879
Feel a future, a world of possibilities,
snuffed out by your own hand.

389
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,884
I know the power in it. The exhilaration.

390
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,638
- It was like a drug for me.
- Yeah?

391
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:21,851
Sounds like you need some help.
A professional, maybe.

392
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:24,729
A professional couldn't have helped me.

393
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:31,319
It stopped when I got my soul back.
My human heart.

394
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:33,779
Goody for you.

395
00:32:34,238 --> 00:32:38,284
If we're gonna party, let's get on with it.
Otherwise, let me out of these things.

396
00:32:38,617 --> 00:32:40,911
Faith, you have a choice.

397
00:32:43,622 --> 00:32:45,875
You've tasted something few ever do.

398
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:50,004
I mean, to kill without remorse
is to feel like a god.

399
00:32:50,504 --> 00:32:53,716
Right now, all I feel
is a cramp in my wrist. Let me go.

400
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:57,386
But you're not a god.
You're not much more than a child.

401
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:01,557
Going down this path will ruin you.

402
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:05,353
You can't imagine the price for true evil.

403
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:08,397
Yeah?

404
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:11,025
I hope evil takes MasterCard.

405
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:16,113
You and me, Faith,

406
00:33:17,406 --> 00:33:19,533
we're a lot alike.

407
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:24,080
Time was, I thought humans existed
just to hurt each other.

408
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:32,380
But then I came here.

409
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:36,425
And I found out that there are
other types of people.

410
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:39,470
People who genuinely wanted to do right.

411
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:46,686
And they make mistakes. They fall down.

412
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:50,606
But they keep caring. Keep trying.

413
00:33:54,318 --> 00:33:57,446
If you can trust us, Faith, this can all change.

414
00:33:59,949 --> 00:34:01,909
You don't have to disappear into the dark.

415
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:19,927
What?

416
00:34:20,594 --> 00:34:23,264
By the order of
the Watchers' Council of Britain,

417
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:26,559
I am exercising my authority
and removing you to England,

418
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:30,646
where you will accept the judgement
of the disciplinary committee.

419
00:34:44,702 --> 00:34:46,954
I'm sorry for the extreme measures.

420
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,750
Unfortunately, this is
a rather extreme circumstance.

421
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,043
Whatever.

422
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:54,795
Please believe,
nobody is rushing to judgement.

423
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:59,091
The first priority of both myself
and the Council is to help you.

424
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:03,054
Now, none of that.

425
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:06,849
Tighten her restraints.
Faith, there's no point in fighting this.

426
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:12,855
Have to disagree with you. Unlock these
or I'll pop this guy's head like a grape.

427
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,279
Don't even think about it.

428
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:38,089
Faith, you can't keep running.

429
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:43,344
Wrong again, Wes.

430
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,288
It was the new watcher.
He had a couple of guys helpin' him.

431
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:13,082
Then he figured it out?

432
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:18,295
Which means Faith will be soon on her way
to England to face the Watchers' Council.

433
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:21,590
- And then what?
- They'll lock her away for a good long while.

434
00:36:22,925 --> 00:36:25,219
So we head them off at the airport
and stop them.

435
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:27,972
Can I... I'm just wondering. Why?

436
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:32,351
I'm not the most objective, I know.

437
00:36:32,935 --> 00:36:36,522
I kinda have an issue with Faith
sharing my people.

438
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:39,275
But she murdered someone
and accused Buffy.

439
00:36:39,817 --> 00:36:41,485
Then she hurt Xander.

440
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,114
I hate to say it,
but maybe she belongs behind bars.

441
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:51,078
She's out of control. But Angel was getting
somewhere with her. She was opening up.

442
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:55,082
- If we could just stop Wesley...
- That's no longer an issue.

443
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:59,628
- You let her get away?
- "Let" wouldn't be how I'd phrase it, but...

444
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:03,090
- Yes, she escaped.
- That's good work.

445
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:05,843
Terrorise her,
then put her back on the streets.

446
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:09,138
That was hardly my plan.
I was trying to save her.

447
00:37:09,847 --> 00:37:13,893
- But you didn't. You probably destroyed her.
- Buffy, that's enough.

448
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:19,231
We'd better find her
before she does any more damage.

449
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:22,276
Let's split up. I'll check the docks.
She's probably there.

450
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:26,280
Giles, you go to her motel.
Xander, Willow, her haunts. And be careful.

451
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:28,574
I'll try the airport.

452
00:37:31,744 --> 00:37:33,788
What can I do? I want to help.

453
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:37,166
Still got your ticket back
to the mother county?

454
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,696
You don't give up, do you?

455
00:38:08,614 --> 00:38:10,449
Not on my friends, no.

456
00:38:10,491 --> 00:38:13,202
Yeah. Because you and me
are such solid buds, right?

457
00:38:14,245 --> 00:38:16,288
We could be. It's not too late.

458
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:20,251
For me to change and be more like you,
Little Miss Goody Two Shoes?

459
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:25,423
- It ain't gonna happen, B.
- Faith, nobody's asking you to be like me.

460
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:29,218
- But you can't go on like this.
- It scares you, doesn't it?

461
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:35,182
Yeah, it scares me. You're hurting people.
You're hurting yourself.

462
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:38,185
That's not it.
That's not what bothers you so much.

463
00:38:38,644 --> 00:38:42,189
What bugs you is you know I'm right.
We don't need the law. We are the law.

464
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:43,649
No.

465
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:46,152
Yes. You know what I'm about.
You have it in you, too.

466
00:38:46,777 --> 00:38:49,030
- No. You're sick.
- I've seen it. You've got the lust.

467
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,742
- I'm not just talkin' about screwin' vampires.
- Don't bring him into this.

468
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:56,620
It was good, wasn't it? The sex? The danger?

469
00:38:56,787 --> 00:38:59,957
Bet a part of you even dug him
when he went psycho.

470
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,001
- No.
- You need me to toe the line

471
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:06,255
because you're afraid you'll go over it.
You can't handle the way I live.

472
00:39:06,797 --> 00:39:08,632
It tempts you. You know it could be you.

473
00:39:12,428 --> 00:39:15,056
- There's my girl.
- No. I'm not gonna do this.

474
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:17,600
Why not? It feels good. Blood rising.

475
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:44,478
I hear, once you've tasted a slayer,
you never wanna go back.

476
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:49,317
Oh, no.

477
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:51,861
No, this is no good at all.

478
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:13,507
So she saved you?

479
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:17,303
She could have left me there
to die, Giles, but she didn't.

480
00:41:17,303 --> 00:41:19,722
She opted to come back to town with you.

481
00:41:21,057 --> 00:41:22,892
That bodes well.

482
00:41:25,436 --> 00:41:28,939
She still has a lot to face
before she can put this behind her.

483
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,192
I'm not gonna give up on her.

484
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:36,405
Then I think she stands a chance.

485
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,055
You sent your boy to kill me.

486
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:03,432
That's right. I did.

487
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:06,352
- He's dust.
- I thought he might be.

488
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:09,313
What with you standing here and all.

489
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:13,234
I guess that means you have a job opening.
