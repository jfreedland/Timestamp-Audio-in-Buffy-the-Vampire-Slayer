00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:06,539
I'm a guy with his ear to the ground,
but even I can feel it.

3
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:10,696
<i>Something's coming. I don't know</i>
<i>what exactly, but something's brewing.</i>

4
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>And it's so big, ugly and damned, it makes</i>
<i>you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces.</i>

5
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:18,573
You'll live in there.
It looks like a closet, but it's a room now.

6
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:22,338
And I hate this plan. I don't understand
when his problems became yours.

7
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,062
The school basement is making him crazy.

8
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:28,931
It's just things are different now.
He has a soul.

9
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:30,615
Mom?

10
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:37,572
<i>Get off her and let her talk to me!</i>

11
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:42,501
Things are coming, Dawn.
When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you.

12
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,459
No!

13
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:48,932
This last year will seem like cake after
what I put you and your friends through,

14
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:51,412
<i>and I am not a fan of easy death.</i>

15
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:55,940
<i>The whole good-versus-evil,</i>
<i>balancing-the-scales thing? I'm over it.</i>

16
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,982
But believe me, I'm going for a big finish.

17
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:05,417
From beneath you, it devours.

18
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:08,697
What do you mean?
How do you know Spike?

19
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:12,856
What do you mean, how?
He was the guy that... Oh, what's the word?

20
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:16,253
- Sired.
- Yeah, he was the guy that sired me.

21
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:24,014
<i>(knocking)</i>

22
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:30,256
- OK, OK, I'm coming. I'm up.
- <i>(knocking continues)</i>

23
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:34,382
It's 4.30 in the morning.
Sweet mama-lution.

24
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:36,931
- Who is it?
- <i>(Buffy)</i> It's me.

25
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:41,578
- Buffy?
- Where's Spike? Xander, is he here?

26
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:46,737
- He's out. At least he was when I got home.
- Any idea where he went?

27
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:51,578
I don't know. Creature of the night, Buff.
He's probably out creaturing.

28
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:53,813
Why, what happened?

29
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:57,057
Is he in trouble?

30
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:59,134
I hope not.

39

What are you...

40
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,261
Dawn, what happened here? What...

41
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,935
You're cut.

42
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,856
- I'm all right.
- Let me see, make sure.

43
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,173
I saw Mom.

44
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:56,299
What?

45
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,102
She was here, Willow. I saw her.

46
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:01,822
She was here, and she spoke to me.

47
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,461
Sweetie...

48
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:08,776
No, she was right here,
and... then she wasn't. She...

49
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:11,218
It wasn't her.

50
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:14,579
- What?
- At least, I don't think.

51
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:21,494
I saw something too, and it looked like...
someone else.

52
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,699
But it wasn't.

53
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,694
I don't understand.

54
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:30,095
It's the big bad, Dawn.
The one we knew was coming.

55
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,974
But that's what she said.

56
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:37,261
Mom, she said that things were coming,
that things were on their way,

57
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:40,858
and... that she loved us.

58
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:46,574
So it had to be her, right?
I mean, her warning was true.

59
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:52,135
I don't know. I just don't think
we can trust anything right now.

60
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:55,374
So maybe the evil thing
messing with you was here too.

61
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:59,661
Only maybe it was the thing
trying to keep mom away.

62
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:03,416
Cos she was trying to protect me.

63
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:07,578
Maybe.

64
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:10,292
Why would a vampire lie
about who sired him?

65
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:16,458
What's that? Some kind of status symbol for
the undead? "My sire can beat up your sire."

66
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,613
I'm not saying I don't believe him.

67
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:21,571
You just don't want to.

68
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,213
OK, let's look at this objectively.

69
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:28,818
Figure it out in a cold,
impersonal, CSl-like manner,

70
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:31,861
cos we're a couple of carpet fibres
away from a case.

71
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,901
Spike can't be doing this.
He couldn't if he wanted to.

72
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:38,498
- Why not?
- Pain chip, remember? He can't hurt anyone.

73
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,619
It didn't stop him from hurting you.

74
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:44,662
Hey, objective here.
Maybe the chip's not working any more.

75
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:50,056
- Oh, it's working. I've seen it.
- Is it? Or is that what he wants you to think?

76
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,818
- You think it's an act?
- I don't really know. And neither do you.

77
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:56,781
No. There's something. I can feel it.

78
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,900
He's different. He's changed.

79
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,936
And, if it is an act, then the Oscar goes to...

80
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,536
<i>(door opens)</i>

81
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:11,855
Well, this can't be good -
you here at this hour.

82
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:16,172
- Is there trouble?
- No. No trouble.

83
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:18,094
I was just...

84
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:19,901
We were just...

85
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:23,415
Right.

86
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:26,415
None of my business. No worries.

87
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:29,775
Spike, I...

88
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:35,858
How was your night?

89
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:38,093
It was all right.

90
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:42,620
And yours? Did you... bag any baddies?

91
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:45,693
One.

92
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:47,774
Vampire.

93
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:51,701
Someone I used to know, actually, a little.

94
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,621
Holden.

95
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:57,978
Holden Webster.

96
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,738
You knew him, huh?

97
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:04,780
That must've been a picnic.

98
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:08,779
Yeah.

99
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:15,575
Well... I'm gonna turn in before I drop.

100
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,380
Night.

101
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:28,293
You see that? You see how he reacted
when you mentioned Webs?

102
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,261
Cool as Cool Whip.
What's up with that?

103
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:36,337
The sun's coming up. I need to go and check
on Dawn. We need to keep an eye on Spike.

104
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:40,177
Whoa, whoa, whoa. When you say "we"
you mean me. Me's gotta go to work.

105
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:43,494
- I got a big meeting in a couple of hours.
- This is serious.

106
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,337
We cannot let him leave this house
until we know if he's killing again.

107
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:49,175
We need someone to watch him.

108
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:52,812
- Uh-uh. Forget it, Harris.
- You said you'd do it on the phone.

109
00:08:52,903 --> 00:08:58,978
That was before you told me Spike's killing
again. You want to leave me alone with him?!

110
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:02,817
- Didn't mind being alone with him before.
- What was that?

111
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:08,899
Nothing. Look, we don't actually know
that he's killed anyone. You know, lately.

112
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,861
- Might all just be a mistake.
- But you don't think so.

113
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:17,176
Have you searched his room for clues?
Trophies from victims?

114
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:22,212
Killers like to keep trophies sometimes.
Scalps, necklaces made from human teeth.

115
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:26,262
It didn't occur to me to look,
but thanks for the tip.

116
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:29,460
You'll be safe here.
Plenty of sunlight for you to hide in.

117
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,295
What? That's it?

118
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:35,695
You're not gonna leave a crossbow or a
flame-thrower? Something to protect myself?

119
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,935
We don't want him to know we suspect.
If he tries to leave, don't confront him.

120
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:45,893
Call Buffy and just let her know that
he's on the move. You're gonna be fine.

121
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,896
Better be, cos if I get vamped,
I'm gonna bite your ass.

122
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:53,942
- Wouldn't be the first time.
- What was that?

123
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:00,856
<i>(door shuts)</i>

124
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:03,776
Dawn? Dawn!

125
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:07,014
Buffy, it's OK. She's OK. Not hurt.

126
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:10,140
She's just exhausted. Finally fell off to sleep.

127
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:13,818
- What the hell happened? It looks like...
- Hell happened? Yeah.

128
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:18,897
This big evil that's been promising to
devour us? Well, I think it started chomping.

129
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:22,498
- Oh, God. And it started with Dawn?
- Both of us.

130
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:28,135
Buffy, this thing knows us. It made us think
that we were talking to people we knew.

131
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:34,139
Mine said it came with a message from Tara.
But Dawn actually saw...

132
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:38,974
your mother.

133
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:45,058
This thing - it had me for a while.

134
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:49,295
I mean, before it started letting loose
with the pulse-pounding terror.

135
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:53,615
But before that,
the lies were very convincing.

136
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:55,978
It just seems real.

137
00:10:57,863 --> 00:10:59,091
Lies?

138
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:02,892
Maybe to confuse us, to mess us up.

139
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:05,895
Or maybe just to be cruel.

140
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:10,295
Vampire I killed last night
told me Spike sired him.

141
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,938
Two nights ago.

142
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:17,332
Well, that's impossible. Right?

143
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:23,021
So maybe it was another one.
A fake out. You got one too.

144
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:26,857
- It wasn't a real vamp.
- Dusted real enough.

145
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:30,413
- Buffy, do you think Spike is...
- I can't.

146
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:34,414
I hope not.

147
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,975
But if I'm wrong and he is...

148
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:43,499
then I have to see it for myself.

149
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,701
I have to be there to stop it.

150
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:38,895
Anya, do be specific and tell a fella
just exactly what you're doing here.

151
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,975
Well...

152
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,860
Spike...

153
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:49,581
I'm... here, obviously...

154
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:52,612
for... um...

155
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:57,581
sex.

156
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:58,539
Uh...

157
00:13:58,623 --> 00:14:00,500
Beg pardon?

158
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,653
You and me.

159
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,893
Here and now.

160
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:06,655
Let's go.

161
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:10,418
Let's... get it on, you big bad boy.

162
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:13,381
Wait, Anya. Just a minute.
This is not exac...

163
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:15,897
Is that a stake?

164
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,099
Yes. Kinky.

165
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:20,458
- Well, yeah, but what do you...
- Shh.

166
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,613
No questions.

167
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:24,933
No talking.

168
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,139
I can't help it.

169
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:33,901
I can't stop thinking about you and us
and our brief but unforgettable time together.

170
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:37,503
I mean, it's...
Why else would I be here?

171
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:42,782
It's not like I'm snooping around for proof
that you're some whacked-out serial killer.

172
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:45,252
I don't know why I said that.
Forget I said that.

173
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,052
It's craziness talking.
It's just nerves. Nerves.

174
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:53,057
Nerves and... and horniness.

175
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:57,341
Oh, just shut up, William, and take me.
Take me now.

176
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:10,822
- Anya.
- Hm?

177
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:16,660
It's not that I'm not tempted. Obviously,
if things were different, you're a right catch.

178
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:20,772
I got it. No problem. I understand.

179
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:24,015
- You think I'm fat.
- What?

180
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:27,379
- It's either that or the haircut.
- The do's quite fetching.

181
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,931
- Oh, right. Now you like the haircut.
- Love it.

182
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:33,299
Sure, as a friend. You were more fun
when you didn't have a soul.

183
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:35,613
Oh, come on.
I've just explained...

184
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:41,938
Soulless Spike would have had me upside
down and halfway to happy land by now.

185
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:44,218
I need my pants.

186
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:05,457
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, love.

187
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:08,262
Who's hurt? I'm fine.

188
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:11,620
Right.

189
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,612
Look, I've got things to do.

190
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:18,501
Don't stick around on my account.

191
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:37,777
It's me. He's leaving.

I'll guess...

200
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:38,376
you're a little bit bad.

201
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,816
Huh?

Are you a bad boy?

00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:53,134
Cos I don't mind.

205
00:18:54,423 --> 00:19:00,020
You know, I was getting pretty bored
waiting over there in that line.

206
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:02,901
I hate... waiting.

You know I want you to.

How could you use a poor maiden so?

216
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,501
- Did you kill her?
- What?

217
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,098
- The girl. Last night.
- What girl? What are you talking about?

218
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:26,621
I caught the first act. I missed the curtain call.
Did you kill her? Did you turn her?

219
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,933
Did you... Are you following me?

220
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:31,583
Answer the question. Where is she?

221
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,813
Who knows? I talked to her is all.

222
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:39,102
- Really? Looked like more than talking to me.
- Well, I certainly didn't off her.

223
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:42,732
Where are you getting this?
You know I can't.

224
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:44,415
Right. The chip.

225
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:48,212
No, not the chip!
Not the chip, dammit.

226
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:55,418
You think I'd go to the end of the underworld
and back to get my soul and then...?

227
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:59,894
Buffy, I can barely live with what I did.
It haunts me.

228
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,774
All of it.

229
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:07,254
If you think that I would add
to the body count now, you are crazy.

230
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:12,895
So you go looking for drunk co-eds
cos you're hungry for conversation?

231
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:16,134
- Oh, is that what this is? Right.
- What?

232
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:19,659
- You're jealous.
- Don't play games. Not now.

233
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:23,941
You saw me chatting up another bird,
giving the eye to somebody else.

234
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:27,538
- Touched a nerve, didn't it?
- Don't flatter yourself.

235
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:33,573
It burns. But you can't admit it, so you trump
up some charge that I'm back on the juice.

236
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:38,453
- This vampire I killed told me...
- Told you what? That I go out?

237
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:41,899
Yeah, I talk to people. Women.

238
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:46,659
- I talk to them cos I can't talk to you.
- Oh, Spike, save it.

239
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:49,655
As daft a notion as
"soulful Spike the killer" is,

240
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:55,295
it is nothing compared to the idea that
another girl could mean anything to me.

241
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:59,812
This chip... they did <i>to</i> me.

242
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,939
I couldn't help it.

243
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:04,981
But the soul, I got on my own.

244
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:07,054
For you.

245
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,781
- I know. But...
- So, yeah. I go and pass the time.

246
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,694
With someone.

247
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:22,335
But that's all it is, is time. Cos God help me,
Buffy, it's still all about you.

248
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:29,581
- Spike, this vampire told me you sired him.
- That doesn't mean...

249
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:33,133
He said you killed him,
dumped him in a parking lot somewhere.

250
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:37,614
- And you believed him? Vampires aren't...
- I did follow you last night.

251
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:42,219
You didn't look lonely or casual to me.
You looked like you were on the prowl.

252
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:45,852
- You can't know that.
- So, then, tell me. Tell me what happened.

253
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:49,379
- You talked to her, then what?
- We talked. That's all I remember.

254
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:52,216
- All you remember?
- I don't know. I go out.

255
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:57,058
I talk to people or I don't.
It's boring. It all bleeds together.

256
00:22:57,143 --> 00:23:00,055
- Well, if you seem to forget that much...
- Not that.

257
00:23:00,143 --> 00:23:03,453
The taste of human blood.
That, I'd remember.

258
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:08,663
You were camped out on the Hellmouth
talking to invisible people. Recently.

259
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:12,053
- How can you be sure of...
- No! You are wrong.

260
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:17,775
You've got an accusation
from a pile of dust, and not a shred of proof.

261
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,331
So I'll get some.

262
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,658
OK, guys, find me some evidence
that he did this.

263
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:40,101
- Really? Are you sure that's what you want?
- Find me proof that he didn't.

264
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:44,461
You only think Spike is turning people
cos that vampire told you so, right?

265
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:49,139
But that night,
we were all told things that weren't true.

266
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:50,975
Maybe.

267
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,531
What? What "maybe"?

268
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:57,616
Just because those weren't
the spirits of, you know, our people,

269
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:02,140
just because it was some evil thing,
doesn't mean what they said can't be true.

270
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:06,057
I used to tell the truth all the time
when I was evil.

271
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:08,782
We can't assume anything.
We need hard facts.

272
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:13,732
If Spike is biting people again, shouldn't
there be more dead people with neck trauma?

273
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:17,133
Right? And we can find that.

274
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,691
- No.
- No, we can't find that? But that's easy.

275
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:21,580
That computer's a moron.

276
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:27,579
I mean, no, there's not really
an increase in neck injuries. But...

277
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:29,540
But what?

278
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:32,660
Missing people. Eight, maybe.

279
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:35,339
Oh, ten of them.

280
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:38,938
No bodies, they're just missing.

281
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:41,332
Mostly young. Lots of girls.

282
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:48,739
So it's true. What that vampire
told Buffy turned out to be true.

283
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:50,734
Maybe.

284
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,815
But it still doesn't prove that it's Spike.

285
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:57,612
Right now,
he's the only one who knows for sure.

286
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:30,294
- No, no, no. You're not going out.
- I have to go.

287
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:32,613
Buffy was very clear
on the not leaving of you.

288
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:36,742
I know what she told you. It's not true.
Let me go, and I'll find a way to prove it.

289
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:39,974
OK, I'm gonna list the reasons
that won't happen. One...

290
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:41,862
Ow!

I was here talking with her.

293
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:41,218
The other night. I'm looking for
someone who might've seen her.

294
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:43,294
No. Sorry.

295

- He hit you?
- Knocked me out.

00:27:06,983 --> 00:27:11,420
- He's been gone at least half an hour.

- Is it me?
- Sorry, love. Don't think so.

Friendly warning, pet.

Oh. I get it.

307
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:04,381
You'd rather I slip into
something more comfortable.

308
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:12,173
Shall we pick off the crowd one by one,
or block the exits and ravish the place?

309
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:15,733

- What's with the wallflower act?

when you were biting me.

I'm not asking if you wanna be soul mates.
Just figured you'd wanna have some fun.

Mm.

Or the other way around. Whatever.

No, you're lying.

accent. Kind of sallow, but in a hot way?

Yeah, yeah, I know the guy.
Billy Idol wannabe.

Never mind. Has he been here?

This guy your boyfriend or something?

322

No, I just... I need to find him,
as soon as possible.

323
00:30:23,503 --> 00:30:29,499
He comes in a lot lately. Every night leaves
with a different girl. Chicks like Billy Idol.

324
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:32,653
How many girls?

325
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:35,860
Look, this guy, this not-your-boyfriend guy.

326
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:38,537
If I were you, I'd lose him.
He's a real player.

327

I think I've done some very bad things.

331
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,695
Where are you?

332
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:18,335
I need to see you. There's a house.
634 Hoffman Terrace.

333
00:31:18,423 --> 00:31:20,812
I'll meet you.

334
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:25,579
You shouldn't have done that.

335
00:31:25,663 --> 00:31:27,779
It's not time yet.

336
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:29,660
Not nearly.

337
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:32,337
You're going against the plan.

338
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:35,578
But we can make it work.

339
00:31:49,503 --> 00:31:51,494
Down here.

340
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,732
You won't come down?

341
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:07,253
I understand.

342
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:10,141
It's a risky proposition.

343
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:15,058
There's an order. The Slayer's not in order.
But it can't hurt to play.

344
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:19,819
- Get your claws in the mouse, you know?
- You are not here.

345
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:32,817
All right. What do you wanna show me?

346
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:35,701
I've been remembering.

347
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:38,661
The girl. I walked her home.

348
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:42,176
The one you saw.

349
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:44,857
And the one before that.

350
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:48,541
And I think I killed her.

351
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:53,697
And I think I... I think I killed...
the lady who lived here.

352
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:57,933
And... and there might be others.

353
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:02,381
Oh, my God.

354
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:05,140
Here.

355
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:12,142
I-I think I buried them here.

356
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,495
Spike, why?

357
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:20,258
Well, I don't know, do I?
I don't even know how. I shouldn't be able...

358
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:24,575
<i># Early one morning
just as the sun was rising

359
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:29,134
<i># I heard a fair maid sing
in the valley down below

360
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:32,097
- <i># Oh, don't deceive me
- What? What is it?

361
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:34,617
<i># Oh, never leave me

362
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:38,332
<i># How could you use a poor maid...

363
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:39,776
Spike!

364
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:48,292
What are you doing? Oh!

365
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,938
Spike, listen to me. You don't wanna do this.

366
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:57,538
And it's just about to get fun.

367
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:06,412
Oh, God.

368
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:22,533
You know what I want you to do.

369
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:38,419
They're waiting for you.
Take her, taste her. Make her weak.

370
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,540
Spike, no!

371
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:18,059
I remember.

372
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:45,092
You failed them.

373
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,378
Now she's gonna kill you.

374
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,215
You lose, mate.

375
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:57,695
Sorry, ma'am, but it's my job.

376
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:34,212
Do it fast, OK?

377
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:38,774
He said you would do it.

378
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,854
Who said?

379
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,180
Me.

380
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,494
It was me.

381
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:50,773
I saw it.

382
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:54,538
I was here the whole time,
talking and singing.

383
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,778
There was a song.

384
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:03,332
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

385
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,937
Please, I don't remember.

386
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,412
Don't make me remember.

387
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:13,896
Make it so I forget again!
I did what you wanted!

388
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:19,131
There's something here.

389
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:27,255
Oh God, no. Please. I need that.

390
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,336
I can't cry this soul out of me.

391
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,857
It won't come.

392
00:37:34,343 --> 00:37:37,062
I've killed, and I can feel them.

393
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:40,901
I can feel every one of 'em.

394
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:52,135
There's something playing with us.

395
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:54,020
All of us.

396
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:01,853
What is it?

397
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:04,411
Why is it doing this to me?

398
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,460
I don't know.

399
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:14,055
Help me.

400
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,380
Can you help me?

401
00:38:22,663 --> 00:38:24,654
<i>(Buffy)</i> I'll help you.

402
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:31,692
<i>(Anya)</i> And you believe him?

403
00:38:31,783 --> 00:38:36,299
<i>(Buffy)</i> You didn't see him down there.
He really didn't know what he'd done.

404
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:38,692
It wasn't in his control.

405
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:42,935
Oh, an out-of-control serial killer.
You're right, that <i>is</i> a great house guest.

406
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:46,379
Wait. Is he... is he staying here?

407
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:50,820
I don't know. But I'm not letting him
out of my sight, that's for sure.

408
00:38:50,903 --> 00:38:54,498
Buffy, he's been feeding on human blood.
That's gotta do stuff.

409
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:58,132
I'm not keeping him around just to help him.

410
00:38:58,223 --> 00:39:02,535
I think there was something there,
talking to him, making him do things.

411
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:05,456
Something like what was talking to us?

412
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,900
Maybe. And if it was, then it's been
screwing with Spike big time.

413
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:12,258
So, you want him around because...?

414
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:14,652
There's something evil working us,

415
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:19,100
and to have a chance to fight it,
we need to learn everything we can about it.

416
00:39:19,183 --> 00:39:22,061
This thing has been
closer to Spike than any of us.

417
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:26,978
- And if you wanna understand it...
- I'm gonna have to get close to Spike.

418
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:29,497
- It's too dangerous.
- <i>(Buffy)</i> I don't have a choice.

419
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:32,416
Whatever this thing is from beneath us,

420
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,971
it's bad,

421
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:38,180
and it's only getting worse.

422
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,334
Oh, dear God!

423
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:53,692
Robson, are you here?

424
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:57,174
Robson?

425
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:59,060
<i>(groaning)</i>

426
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:07,983
You too?

427
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:18,301
- Dear God, I thought you were...
- Gather them.

428
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,977
- What?
- It's started.

429
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:24,940
It's all right. I understand.
I'll take care...

430
