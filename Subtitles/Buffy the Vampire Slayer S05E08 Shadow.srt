1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,522
You keep refusing to tell me where the Key is.

2
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:09,641
We had to hide the Key.
Made it human and sent it to you.

3
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:12,603
- Dawn.
- What's wrong with Mom?

4
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:16,129
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
- I don't know.

5
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:20,843
Buffy's like nobody else. When I'm with her,
it's like half of me is just on fire,

6
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:25,484
going crazy if I'm not touching her.
But she doesn't love me.

7
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:27,930
I know you got a lot on your mind.

8
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:31,642
If you decide you wanna let me in
on any of it, you let me know.

9
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:37,169
We could go somewhere else.
Someplace more private.

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,607
Sandy, Sandy.

11
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,567
My heart belongs to another.

12
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:45,403
Besides, I don't go out with vampires.

13
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,481
Spike, I want you.

14
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,890
God, I love you so much.

15
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:57,048
Oh, God, no. Please, no.

16
00:00:58,173 --> 00:00:59,288
Are you OK?

17
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:03,764
The "nothing" I've been dealing with
the last two weeks might not be nothing.

18
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:04,968
What is it?

19
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:09,968
I'm staying overnight at the hospital
for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,074

21
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,284
What is a CAT scan exactly?

22
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:07,849
I don't know. It's some x-ray, I guess.

23
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:12,527
Where do they get the "CAT" scan from?

24
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:16,802
I mean, do they test it on cats or...

25
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:23,207
- Or does the machine sorta look like a cat?
- Dawn, I'm really...

26
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:45,963
"Your One-Stop Spot to Shop
for all your Occult Needs."

27
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:47,725
- Catchy.
- Think so?

28
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:51,601
Uh-huh, in a hard-to-read sort of way,
but I think it's great.

29
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:58,605
- I'm saying I think it's rude.
- I wouldn't call it rude.

30
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:01,287
Rude-ish. Rude-esque.
Whatever you wanna call it.

31
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:06,083
If you make a destroy-all-vampires date,
it's courtesy to wait for your co-destroyers.

32
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:07,606
Am I right, Giles?

33
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:10,844
I'm almost certain you're not
but, to be fair, I wasn't listening.

34
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,970
The new phone book's in with Mr Giles's ad.

35
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,448
Nice.

36
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:20,411
- Am I mentioned?
- Not as such.

37
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:25,728
We were supposed to hook up with Riley to
take on a nest o' vamps holed up in a tomb?

38
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:28,486
So we get there and guess what?
Tell him, Will.

39
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:30,331
- Tomb go boom.
- Yep.

40
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:34,326
Captain America blowed it up real good.
All by his Ione-wolf Ionesome.

41
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:37,405
- Rather reckless of him.
- I'd say very rather.

42
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:40,530
I should think you'd be pleased
to avoid the confrontation.

43
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:46,165
That's what I've been saying. I mean, I for one
didn't wanna start my day with a slaughter.

44
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:49,723
Which really just goes to show
how much I've grown.

45
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,812
Yes. In any event, since you're all here,

46
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:57,932
Tara and I could use your help
researching Buffy's mysterious woman.

47
00:03:58,213 --> 00:04:00,169
Oh, yeah. This has been fruitful.

48
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:03,802
Trying to look up something
you never saw and don't know the name of.

49
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:07,249
Just do what I do.
Flip through the pages and look busy.

50
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,564
It'd be nice if we knew where she was,
where she's hiding out.

51
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:13,451
No doubt lurking around
some sewer or condemned church

52
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:17,526
or rat-infested warehouse.
You know, the usual haunts.

53
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:20,525
Most Beauteous
and Supremely Magnificent One,

54
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:25,528
this dark spell I hold in my worthless
and scabby hand is our gift to you,

55
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:28,173
Most Tingly and Wonderful Glorificus.

56
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:30,244
Please, call me Glory.

57
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,403
Get up.
Looking at you is hurting my neck.

58
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,212
Forgive me, Shiny Special One.

59
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:38,524
I beg of you to rip out my inadequate tongue.

60
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,604
Gimme.

61
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,722
I thought...

62
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:54,330
You should know,
Your Elaborate Marvellousness,

63
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:59,368
that this dark incantation has been lost for
aeons, and great dangers have been faced...

64
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:02,286
Does this pump make my ankle look bony?

65
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:04,810
No.

66
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,968
No, Your Terrifically Smooth One.
It is the epitome of ankles.

67
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:13,251
To touch such an ankle would be...
But I'm not touching. I'm backing away.

68
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,611
- Thank you.
- Dreg, is it?

69
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:21,050
Yes. Dreg. Your Creamy Coolness
has honoured me by speaking my name.

70
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:25,041
- Your voice is like a thousand songbirds...
- I never tire of hearing that.

71
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:28,523
Look, just so we're clear,
this spell's gonna work, right?

72
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,922
Nothing worse than a gift that doesn't work.

73
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:35,006
Then I'd have to get all mad and kill you.
It's this whole big thing.

74
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:39,406
It will work, Your Extremeness.
Provided you have the other items you need.

75
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,644
Don't worry.

76
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:44,602
I'll have them, all right.

77
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:51,882
I'll have it all.

78
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,564
Hello?

79
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,324
Buffy?

80
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:20,649
What are you doing in here?

81
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,691
What, me? I was...

82
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:27,652
- What are you doin' here?
- Looking for the girl who'll rip your arms off

83
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:32,249
- when she finds out you were in here.
- Oh, yeah? Well, me too.

84
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,806
Were you just smelling her sweater?

85
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:41,962
No.

86
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:47,088
Well, yeah, all right. I did.

87
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,733
It's a predator thing. Nothin' wrong with it.

88
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:53,169
Know your enemy's scent,
whet the appetite for a hunt.

89
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:58,566
That's the stuff. Slayer musk.
It's bitter and aggravating.

90
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:02,332
Out.

91
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:08,090
Watch it. Easy, you're bruisin' the leather.

92
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,930
Look. I know for a bleedin' fact
the Slayer wouldn't mind me bein' here.

93
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:17,244
Right. What's a little sweater-sniffing
between sworn enemies?

94
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,563
She in the habit of
buyin' her enemies drinks?

95
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:23,248
Cos she spent the better part of
last night with me, doin' just that.

96
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,087
Cos you guys are such tight pals.
That's good. Tell me another.

97
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:32,008
OK. Twice recently, she's had the
lover-Wiccas do a de-invite on the house.

98
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:36,883
Keep out specific vamps. Asked yourself why
she's never taken my name off the guest list?

99
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:41,086
- Because you're harmless.
- Yeah, right.

100
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:44,727
Takes one to know, I suppose.

101
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:49,045
At least I still got the attitude.
What you got? A piercing glance?

102
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:52,489
Face it, white bread.
Buffy's got a type, and you're not it.

103
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:56,009
She likes us dangerous, rough,
maybe bumpy in the forehead region.

104
00:08:56,093 --> 00:09:00,723
Not that she doesn't like you. But sorry,
Charlie, you're just not dark enough.

105
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:07,208
- Am I dark enough for you now?
- Pull me back in. I'm startin' to sizzle.

106
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:10,365
You don't know anything about Buffy.
I know what she needs.

107
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:13,411
So you're at the hospital now,
givin' her what she needs?

108
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:17,202
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you know? Didn't she tell you?

109
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:20,251
- You tell me.
- Her mum's sickly.

110
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,166
Buffy took her to hospital
for a bit of prod 'n' probe.

111
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:28,373
Bite-sized one went too. You know,
it's funny her not calling you about that.

112
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:30,764
I've known since last night.

113
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,524
Blanket!

114
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:54,044
- Riley.
- Sorry.

115
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,209
I heard. I thought maybe you'd need...

116
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:03,765
I do. I'm glad.

117
00:10:03,893 --> 00:10:08,125
I just... I didn't...
I mean, until we knew what it was...

118
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:10,773
I understand. How's she doing?

119
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:16,122
Well, she's just had a CAT scan.
I was about to go in and find out.

120
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:20,121
Will you sit with Dawn while I talk to Mom?

121
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:23,410
- She's in the waiting room.
- Yeah, you got it.

122
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,763
Hi.

123
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:37,572
- May I come in?
- Of course, baby. Come on in.

124
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,845
Where's Dawn?

125
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,493
With Riley. Watching TV in the waiting room.

126
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:45,929
Excuse me, I'm just gonna
check on the status of the OR.

127
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,445
The OR?

128
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:53,970
Dr Isaacs says I'm lucky
there's one available on such short notice.

129
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:58,009
Some people wait for days,
sometimes weeks.

130
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:01,487
Mom, what did they find?

131
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:06,367
A shadow. I've got a shadow.

132
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:08,569
Somewhere over there.

133
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:14,205
He showed it to me, but they have to do
a biopsy to find out exactly what it is.

134
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:23,085
The doctor says it's
too early to be concerned.

135
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:25,964
Right.

136
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,648
- No concern.
- Right. Just a shadow.

137
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:39,645
I wish we knew what we were dealing with.
It feels like we're going around in circles.

138
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:44,409
Our circles are going around in circles.
We've got dizzy circles here, Giles.

139
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:47,883
Weeping Buddha.
Shoulders your spiritual burden.

140
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,850
Makes a lovely paperweight, too.

141
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,566
- Maybe she's not in the books.
- What do you mean?

142
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:59,922
I mean, what if she's not a demon, sorceress
or spirit, or whatever these books cover?

143
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,247
What if she's something else altogether?

144
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,324
Thank you. Come again.

145
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:10,529
- Something new, you mean?
- Something old.

146
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,412
So old it predates the written word.

147
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:18,842
Giles, the Dagon Sphere.
You said that was created to repel...

148
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,328
That-Which-Cannot-Be-Named.

149
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:25,407
So, I'm thinking maybe she...

150
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,643
Predates language itself?

151
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:35,044
If it means I don't have to read any more,
whoo. And might I add a big "hoo".

152
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,966
If Tara's right, then we're blind.

153
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:44,050
There's no way we can determine her moves,
her habits, where she'll turn up next.

154
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,086
- I beg your...
- Uh-huh.

155
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:49,846
- I want these.
- Yes, of course.

156
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:55,048
- Did you find everything all right?
- No problemo.

157
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,084
That's...

158
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,648
your receipt. And...

159
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:08,931
thank you.

160
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,563
She could be anywhere.
But if she is as powerful as Buffy says,

161
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:20,487
I imagine it won't be long
before she makes herself known.

162
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:12,168
Everything went fine.
They're moving her into Recovery now.

163
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,648
Do we have the results yet?

164
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:18,406
- Let's sit down over here for a minute.
- No.

165
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:23,729
Excuse me. No, I don't mean to be rude.
It's just I've been sitting for hours.

166
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:27,567
I don't wanna sit. I just... Tell me, please.

167
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:33,571
Your mother has...
the term is "low-grade glioma".

168
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:36,804
It's a brain tumour.

169
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:42,047
The clinical name is oligodendroglioma.
It's in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum.

170
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,728
In your mother's case,
the tumour seems to have started...

171
00:14:55,293 --> 00:15:01,368
I know this is very difficult and, because
of the nature of your mother's illness,

172
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:04,684
unfortunately things may
progress very quickly.

173
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,729
Things? What things?

174
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:10,806
Symptoms.
There's a fair variety that might present.

175
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:14,411
Loss of vision or appetite.

176
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:17,724
Lack of muscle control. Mood swings...

177
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:19,929
But what can we do?

178
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:23,926
Not much, until we determine
if the tumour's operable,

179
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:28,127
which we are working on.

180
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:33,531
Is there something that I...?
I mean, can I help?

181
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:36,446
There's some literature
you might want to look at.

182
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,001
If we aren't able to go in surgically,

183
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:42,324
there are a number of new treatments
that are very promising.

184
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:48,010
Your mother's prognosis is a lot better today
than it would have been only a year ago.

185
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:51,881
Even if the tumour's not operable,
she has a real chance.

186
00:15:51,973 --> 00:15:55,045
What's "a real chance"?

187
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:59,046
Nearly one out of three patients
with this condition does just fine.

188
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:04,609
Now, let me ask. Does your mother's
insurance company require copies

189
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,729
of the MRI and pathology reports?

190
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:10,203
- I'm not sure.
- Well, just let me know as soon as possible.

191
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:14,844
And I could use some information regarding
your mom's lifestyle and home environment.

192
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,766
For instance, does she use a cellphone?

193
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,923
I think so, yeah.

194
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,573
She has one of those ear things.

195
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:29,206
OK. Is your house near any power lines,
chemical plants, waste-disposal facilities?

196
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,887
I don't know. Maybe.

197
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,567
Well, the more we know...

198
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,569
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:44,762
Excuse me, Doc, but they told me
you're needed in ICU.

200
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:48,846
- Excuse me, Miss Summers.
- It's OK.

201
00:16:53,853 --> 00:16:56,572
You looked like you needed
a break. That guy's great,

202
00:16:56,653 --> 00:17:01,169
but he doesn't have that bone
in his head that tells him when to back off.

203
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,813
You mean that they didn't need him?

204
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:06,607
I'm sure someone does somewhere.
They always do.

205
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,208
He really is a good doctor.
Your mom's in good hands.

206
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:11,851
Thank you.

207
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,924
- It's Ben, right?
- Right.

208
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:20,086
He was just telling me
that there's nothing I can do.

209
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:24,967
And I'm gonna tell you the same thing.
Give yourself a break.

210
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:30,252
Listen, your mom's gonna be unconscious
for at least another six, seven hours.

211
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,445
- A break?
- Well, I just mean go out, get some air.

212
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:38,651
Come back later on this evening.
Talk to the doc then if you want.

213
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:41,327
My unsolicited advice for the day.

214
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:51,924
Buffy.

215
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:57,453
- It's bad.
- I know.

216
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:02,606
I have to do something.

217
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:07,566
- Do something?
- Yeah, like magic. Like a healing spell.

218
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,367
Buffy, people get sick.

219
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:14,726
- I don't think magic can help.
- That attitude's not helping.

220
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:18,204
I have to try.

221
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:21,051
OK.

222
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:25,331
I need to talk to Giles. Will you do me
a favour and drop Dawn off at school?

223
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:28,246
Tell her I'll meet her at the magic shop
when she gets off.

224
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,642
Of course. Whatever you need me to do.

225
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,524
Buffy.

226
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:38,126
What do you want me
to tell Dawn about your mom?

227
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:48,732
Tell her we don't know anything yet.

228
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:16,411
- Your "heys" are startling the customers.
- And pretty much the state.

229
00:19:16,493 --> 00:19:20,805
You sold someone a Khul's amulet
and a Sobekian bloodstone.

230
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,772
- Yes, I believe I did.
- Are you stupid or something?

231
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,607
Allow me to answer
that question with a firing.

232
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:29,842
She's kidding.

233
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:35,803
An, we talked about the employee-employer
vocabulary no-nos. That was number five.

234
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:39,681
You never sell these things
together, ever. Bad news.

235
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:42,731
- Don't you know about the Sobekites?
- I do.

236
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:46,647
It was an ancient Egyptian cult,
heavy into dark magic.

237
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:49,806
Wasn't the Khul's amulet
a transmogrification conduit?

238
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:52,965
- Damn straight.
- But I still see no reason for concern.

239
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:56,841
The Sobekian transmogrification
spells were lost thousands of years ago.

240
00:19:56,933 --> 00:20:01,290
And the young woman to whom I sold them
would have to have had enormous power...

241
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:03,762
Young woman?

242
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:06,844
Dear Lord.

243
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:10,124
What?

244
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:22,328
You're melting.

245
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,603
Guess I'm not hungry.

246
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:31,453
Maybe I'm not making this any better.

247
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,524
No, I just...

248
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:36,523
This is better.

249
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,933
I had my tenth-birthday party here.

250
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:47,644
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

251
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,124
We'd just moved to Sunnydale.

252
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:55,809
Mom rented the carousel for
an entire hour forjust me and my friends.

253
00:20:56,733 --> 00:21:00,931
Except I hadn't made any friends yet,
so it was just me and Mom and Buffy

254
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:05,131
riding it by ourselves, over and over again,

255
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:11,167
for the whole hour, just so Mom
felt like we'd gotten our money's worth.

256
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,364
She's...

257
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,607
She's not gonna get better, is she?

258
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,208
Absolutely she will.

259
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,409
Summers women are tough.

260
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:31,565
- I'm really glad you're here.
- Thanks.

261
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:36,369
Buffy's glad too.

262
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,804
Yeah?

263
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:44,410
She sure cries a lot less with you
than she did with Angel.

264
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:47,166
Angel made her cry a lot?

265
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:50,645
Everything with him
was all "Eee!", you know?

266
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:52,731
AII...?

267
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:57,443
You know, "My boyfriend's
a vampire" crazy-crazy.

268
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,964
Every day was like the end of the world.

269
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,521
She doesn't get all
worked up like that over you.

270
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:12,044
I think you've been really good for her.

271
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:18,971
So I figure there has to be
some kind of mystical cure.

272
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:23,524
I mean like a potion or a spell
or something. We have to look.

273
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:28,084
We can look. I mean, we will,
but I haven't seen anything.

274
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:34,169
The truth is, the mystical and
the medical aren't meant to mix, Buffy.

275
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:39,687
Sorry. The human mind is very delicate.
Too much could go wrong.

276
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:42,810
I've heard stories about
people trying healing spells.

277
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:45,361
If we did something
it could make things worse.

278
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:50,243
We've done just about enough making
things worse for one day, haven't we?

279
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,528
Why? What do you mean?

280
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:58,529
Nothing. Anya broke a bippity boppity boo.
A thing. Don't worry about it.

281
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:01,327
- I did not. I didn't break...
- Anya.

282
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:05,088
Buffy doesn't need to hear
about your clumsiness right now.

283
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:08,245
My clumsiness. I mean, that is so...

284
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:15,931
like me. Slippery butterfingers.

285
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:18,288
- What happened?
- Nothing to concern you...

286
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,603
Giles.

287
00:23:22,053 --> 00:23:26,046
The demon woman was here,
the one who attacked you.

288
00:23:26,893 --> 00:23:30,488
It's no biggie. She just got
an amulet and a bloodstone.

289
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:33,690
- That can create a monster.
- OK. Biggie.

290
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:36,606
My God. Are you guys OK?
I mean, no one got hurt, right?

291
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:39,446
No, thankfully. No violence to speak of.

292
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,648
OK, so that's good.

293
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:46,089
How did she get away
with this bad mojo stuff?

294
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:52,531
Giles sold it to her.

295
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:56,769
I didn't know it was her. I mean, how could I?

296
00:23:58,093 --> 00:24:00,766
If it's any consolation,
I may have overcharged her.

297
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:03,731
Anya figured out
what the demon lady's up to.

298
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:08,125
Yeah, a few thousand years ago
there was this cult, the Temple of Sobek.

299
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,646
Sobek?

300
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:13,089
Reptile demon. Sobekites
were reptile worshippers.

301
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:17,368
Just once I would like to run into
a cult of bunny worshippers.

302
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:20,411
Great. Thank you very much
for those nightmares.

303
00:24:20,613 --> 00:24:22,683
Sorry.

304
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:27,244
Anyway, their high priest Khul
had great mystic powers.

305
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,848
He forged an amulet
with a transmogrifying crystal.

306
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:36,453
Transmogrifying is changing a living thing
into a different kind of thing.

307
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:40,685
We've managed to decipher the markings
that were on the bloodstone that I sold...

308
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:45,244
that she left with. A cobra.
She's going to transmogrify a cobra.

309
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,882
OK, so she's making a monster.
What for? What does it do?

310
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:51,806
That's the part... We're working on it.

311
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:55,011
Well, you keep working on it. I'll go kill it.

312
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:58,129
- Buffy?
- What? I'm going.

313
00:24:58,213 --> 00:25:02,570
- Buffy, this chick creamed you last time.
- I wasn't ready for her last time. I am now.

314
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:06,202
- But you...
- But what? Will, I can'tjust sit here.

315
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:08,887
I have to do something.

316
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:36,284
Chill, worm. I'm gonna make you a star.

317
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,163
Chant.

318
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:01,723
Sobek, grant the power that it
may mould this wretched creature,

319
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:05,210
that it may be reborn,
that it may serve.

320
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:08,886
Dark incantations. Always overwritten.

321
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,324
Why can't they just cut to the...

322
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:13,404
Fight?

323
00:26:13,493 --> 00:26:14,687
No fair.

324
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,571
Attacking when I wasn't even looking.

325
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:23,848
No, this is no good.

326
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:28,172
I'm out of the moment and
you're not giving me anything I can use.

327
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,326
Dreg, I am not hearing chanting. Continue.

328
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:33,732
Yes, Glory.

329
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:38,601
Work with me here.

330
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:45,731
There. That feels more real, don't you think?

331
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:55,367
Even if I do have to carry your performance.

332
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:58,527
Scene.

333
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,448
Arise.

334
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:06,048
Arise.

335
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:10,852
Arise.

336
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,847
He is arisen.

337
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,924
'Bout damn time.

338
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:35,364
Spawn of Sobek.

339
00:27:41,053 --> 00:27:46,571
The power is yours to see what is unseen,
to find what is shrouded in shadow.

340
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:49,323
Already, you know what I seek.

341
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:54,362
I have given you form. Now find for me
the Key. Seek it out in the holy places.

342
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:56,930
Yes, yes, yes.

343
00:27:57,013 --> 00:28:01,768
Let your vision guide you to its hiding place,
then return to me and tell me where it lies.

344
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,524
Now would be good.

345
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:14,488
Fun, fun, fun.

346
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:18,528
"Aleister Crowley Sings"?
Sadly, no, I don't carry that,

347
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:23,482
but I do have some very nice whale sounds.
Excuse me for a moment.

348
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:28,327
- Where's Buffy?
- She left a while ago.

349
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:31,406
What? Where?

350
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:35,725
That creepy demon woman's
conjuring some kind of monster.

351
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:38,202
And you let Buffy go after her? Alone?

352
00:28:38,293 --> 00:28:43,287
"Let" isn't really a factor when she sets
her mind to something. You know that.

353
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:48,126
She'll get herself killed. It's crazy.

354
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:53,492
Yeah, crazy. Going off alone, half-cocked,
instead of waiting for much-needed backup.

355
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:56,849
Charging in with a big ol'
hand grenade... Oh, wait.

356
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:01,564
- This is different.
- Yeah, it is.

357
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:05,441
Buffy needs something she can fight,
something she can solve.

358
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:10,091
I don't know what kind of action
you're looking for. Do you?

359
00:29:12,573 --> 00:29:15,326
- I'm not trying to get...
- It's cool.

360
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:18,412
You OK?

361
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,245
Just a little crazed. I hear ya.

362
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:27,166
If she needs me...

363
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:58,970
- Magic Box, your one-stop spot to shop for...
- Giles, it's me.

364
00:29:59,053 --> 00:30:00,964
Buffy. Are you all right?

365
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,204
No, I'm really not.

366
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:07,251
I couldn't stop her.
I couldn't even slow her down.

367
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:10,604
- Where are you?
- Sunnydale Memorial.

368
00:30:10,693 --> 00:30:13,765
- Are you badly hurt? I'll come right over.
- No.

369
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,892
No, I just wanted to warn you that
that thing she conjured, it's loose.

370
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:22,285
It's a big snake thing. Not Mayor big,
but it's pretty lethal-Iooking.

371
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:25,365
- Do you know why she raised it?
- I don't know yet.

372
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:29,924
- I'll warn the others. We'll get weapons...
- Wait a second. What time is it?

373
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:32,811
- Half past four. Why?
- School's out.

374
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:36,408
- Dawn's on her way over to you. Giles...
- Understood.

375
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:39,724
- We'll keep her safe here until you arrive.
- Thanks.

376
00:30:39,813 --> 00:30:41,804
- And Giles...
- Yes?

377
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:46,129
Dawn's kind of fragile right now, about Mom.

378
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:50,203
- She doesn't know how bad it is.
- We'll not say a word.

379
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:56,008
Well, my mom's gonna wake up soon, and
I should be there when the doctors tell her.

380
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:58,129
She's in good hands, Buffy.

381
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:00,968
There's really nothing else you can do.

382
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,169
OK. Bye.

383
00:31:03,773 --> 00:31:05,764
Bye.

384
00:33:52,693 --> 00:33:55,048
Is she awake yet?

385
00:33:56,373 --> 00:33:58,967
Yeah. She's waiting for us.

386
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:03,732
Can we take her home now?

387
00:34:05,213 --> 00:34:07,522
We'll see.

388
00:34:07,973 --> 00:34:09,964
Go get your stuff.

389
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:25,285
- So, any monster-reptile sightings?
- None.

390
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:29,812
Tara and I did a mini-patrol earlier,
but the biggie snake was nowhere to be...

391
00:34:56,893 --> 00:35:00,772
- Dawn, are you OK?
- Why was the big snake afraid of Dawn?

392
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:02,651
It knows.

393
00:35:47,573 --> 00:35:50,565
- I've gotta stop it before it gets back to Glory.
- Glory?

394
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:53,565
He called her that. She'll know
Dawn's the Key if we don't...

395
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,644
We will.

396
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:00,283
Please, mistress.

397
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:04,412
Perturbed, Yet Ultimately
Merciful One. Please, no.

398
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:09,089
What is taking so long, Dreg? You told
me snakey-wakey would find my Key.

399
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:11,528
Why isn't he back with a beautiful message?

400
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:16,129
I grovel like a bug, Most Silky
and Effervescent Glorificus.

401
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:22,772
Glory, Your Most Fresh and Cleanness,
it's just a matter of time.

402
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:27,044
Everything takes time. What about my time?

403
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:30,364
Does anyone appreciate
that I'm on a schedule here?

404
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:34,642
Tick, tock, Dreg. Tick frickin' tock.

405
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,166
- Do you want me to stay?
- No, I'm fine.

406
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:52,326
I think I should talk to Dawn alone.

407
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:56,564
OK.

408
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:01,771
Do I have bad hair?
I don't look like Scary Mom, do I?

409
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:04,651
No. You look beautiful.

410
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,808
OK. Let's do this.

411
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:20,490
Stay close.

412
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:23,964
I will.

413
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:50,524
Buffy.

414
00:39:57,693 --> 00:39:59,968
You OK? You look pretty beat up.

415
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:09,363
Minimal damage of the fighting kind.
It's all the other kind.

416
00:40:10,413 --> 00:40:12,085
Come here.

417
00:40:14,893 --> 00:40:17,088
It's OK. Just let it out.

418
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:20,284
I'm right here.

419
00:40:23,493 --> 00:40:25,404
I can't.

420
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:27,764
Not now.

421
00:40:28,413 --> 00:40:30,404
They need me.

422
00:40:31,613 --> 00:40:35,003
If I start now, I won't be able to stop.

423
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,889
Buffy?

424
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:32,292
