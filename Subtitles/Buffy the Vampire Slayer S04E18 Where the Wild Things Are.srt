2
00:00:04,973 --> 00:00:06,452
Remove your clothing now.

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:10,321
Relationship. What kind do we have,
and what is it progressing toward?

4
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:12,405
They don't even know I exist.

5
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:18,443
I just like having something
that's just, you know, mine.

6
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:21,527
I am, you know.

7
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:23,410
What?

8
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:25,965
Yours.

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,801
OK, you get Fang, I'll get Horny.

11
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:11,087
I mean...

12
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:42,092
Vampire-demon tag team.
Who says we can't all get along?

13
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:45,449
- I don't recall ever seeing that before.
- Cos it never happens.

14
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,922
Vamps hate demons.

15
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:53,329
It's like stripes and polka dots.
Major clashing.

16
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:58,282
- So, I guess we should tell Giles about this.
- Right.

17
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:01,809
I mean, it's the kind of thing he'd...
wanna know about.

18
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:06,050
- Like... as soon as possible.
- As soon as possible.

19
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:12,369
I mean it now. First thing
in the morning, we go tell Giles.

20
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:14,330
First thing. Good plan.

21
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:26,965
Aw, come on. Big party at Riley's house.
It's gonna be fun.

22
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:30,568
- Why don't you wanna go?
- You know why not.

23
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:35,807
Those Initiative men make me
not comfortable. And you don't care.

24
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:40,171
They don't know you're an ex-demon. And we
don't know they'd care even if they did know.

25
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,244
Which they're not gonna find out.

26
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,848
Anyway, they'll be too busy
flirtin' with girls to notice you.

27
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:50,131
So, you don't think I'm desirable
enough to be flirted with?

28
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:53,125
- Is that it?
- I'm just not gonna win here, am I?

29
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:58,004
- You don't find me attractive any more.
- What? I think you're gorgeous.

30
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:02,763
Oh, really? Well, then,
why didn't we have sex last night?

31
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:06,243
Is that what this is about?
We've gone other nights without sex.

32
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,404
I know. Twice.

33
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:13,325
- I can't believe we're breaking up!
- Breaking? We're not.

34
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:15,563
- Are we?
- Of course we are.

35
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:20,329
You've obviously grown tired of me. I've seen
it happen to many women over the centuries.

36
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,722
I just never thought it would happen to me.

37
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:26,328
Anya, there's a lot more
to you and me than the sex.

38
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,491
Well, there should be.

39
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:32,851
A relationship is something that
you work at. Work through. Together.

40
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,893
I don't understand. I'm pretty, I'm young.

41
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:39,124
I mean, why didn't you take advantage of me?

42
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:43,764
- Is something wrong with your body?
- There's nothing wrong with my body.

43
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:45,844
Well, there must be.

44
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:49,562
I saw that wrinkled man on TV
talking about erectile dysfunction...

45
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:51,689
Whoa! Hey!

46
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:55,368
All systems go here.
No function problem, OK?

47
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:02,322
You want sex? Let's have sex.
Right here. Hot, sweaty, big sex.

48
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,052
There's always been
discord between them.

49
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:15,763
And yet you say the vampire
went to the demon's aid.

50
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,923
The two of them were working as a team?

51
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:20,846
Everything except patting
each other on the behind.

52
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,969
Extraordinarily odd.

53
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:28,173
As a rule, demons have no empathy for
any other species other than their own.

54
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:35,688
Most think of vampires as abominations.
Mixing with human blood and all.

55
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:40,005
- So what brought these two together?
- Not what. Who.

56
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:42,810
- Adam?
- Think about it.

57
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:47,205
Who better to bring together demon types
than someone made out of demon types?

58
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:50,365
So he's bridging the gap
between the races.

59
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:53,286
Huh. Like Martin Luther King.

60
00:07:54,733 --> 00:08:00,046
I suggest that over the next few nights you
two concentrate your patrol in that same area.

61
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,967
If there's any other peculiar pairings
or groupings, you let me know.

62
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:09,287
I'll tell the squad as well. They're patrolling.
We'll have a reserve unit out during the party.

63
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,728
- Party?
- Tomorrow. We're havin' a thing.

64
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:15,164
- At a time like this? Whose idea was that?
- Mine.

65
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:18,802
The boys are pretty ragged.
Need to let off steam.

66
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:21,726
- Point taken.
- You're welcome to come.

67
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:27,126
Well, much as l, er, long for
a good kegger, I have other plans.

68
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:30,683
- The Espresso Pump.
- What are you doing there?

69
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:35,244
I'm... It's a meeting of grown-ups.

70
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,166
It couldn't possibly be
of any interest to you lot.

71
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:41,370
Buffy, hey, look at the time.
Don't you have a class?

72
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:46,447
- Yeah, in about 20 minutes.
- Yeah, but I have that thing.

73
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:50,321
Right, that thing
we could squeeze in before.

74
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:51,482
Bye.

75
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:55,123
They're probably going to...

76
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:58,728
Yes, thank you, Willow. I did attend
a university in the Mesozoic era.

77
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:00,804
I do remember what it's like.

78
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:13,851
- Didn't we fix the furnace? It's freezing.
- I'll call in the a.m., get somebody to come.

79
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:18,771
When do these two come up for air?

80
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,844
Slaves to the rhythm.

81
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:44,281
- It should've warmed up by now.
- I built this an hour ago. It's still an icebox.

82
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:48,685
Don't bother, Mason. We got a couple of
heat generators pumpin' away upstairs.

83
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:25,612
Jesus!

84
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:32,369
Call an ambulance! Get help!

85
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,364
Oh. It's you.

86
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,882
Spike! What are you doing?
You made me yell really high.

87
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:57,771
Hey. Yeah, I did. I scared you.

88
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:03,848
- Give me money.
- I'm not paying you for scaring me.

89
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:08,324
- You're not paying me. I'm robbing you.
- Oh, that's just ludicrous.

90
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:14,245
You can't hurt me - you got a chip in your
brain. And I like my money when it's mine.

91
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:19,692
Oh, now come on.
You're not even bumpy any more.

92
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:24,690
I was just a minute ago.
Hang on. Get me mad again.

93
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:28,763
Does this really work? Scaring people
into giving you their money?

94
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:31,242
Yeah, it works. Keeps me in blood and beers.

95
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,767
Plus it's funny, watching
the little humans quail.

96
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:38,210
- Now I understand why you're friendless.
- Look who's talking.

97
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:40,761
I don't see Droopy Boy on your arm.

98
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:43,489
Did he have better things to do?

99
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:02,491
You're kidding?
Mason requested to go on patrol?

100
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:05,292
He didn't want the girls
to see his eyebrows burnt off.

101
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:07,091
He's lucky that's all he lost.

102
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:10,768
You should've seen it, Rye.
It was weird as hell.

103
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:15,892
How many kids?

104
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:19,124
I don't know. A whole herd of 'em.
And some parents to boot.

105
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:21,966
It's kind of embarrassing -
welcome to the life with Anya.

106
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:27,446
- You don't know if she's coming tonight?
- I'm thinking no. She was pretty upset.

107
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:30,764
Which makes me wonder, is it me?
Am I the crazy one?

108
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,324
Uh-huh. Absolutely.

109
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:40,011
Hey, Buffy, this might be a good time
to mention that someone, so not me,

110
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:44,848
spilled something purply on your peasant
top, which I'd never borrow without asking.

111
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,401
- Still love me?
- Uh-huh.

112
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:51,684
Huh? What about my peasant top?

113
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:55,366
- Nothin'.
- Xander was just talking about Anya.

114
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:57,125
Oh, it's nothing much.

115
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:00,762
Just feeling glad that a certain ex-demon
doesn't have any powers.

116
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:03,447
Boy, I miss those powers.

117
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:07,492
Yeah. Tell me about it.

118
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:12,166
A year and a half ago, I could have
eviscerated him with my thoughts.

119
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:17,122
Now I can barely hurt his feelings.
Things used to be so much simpler.

120
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:20,843
You know, you take the killing for granted.

121
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:23,808
And then it's gone, and you're like...

122
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:30,050
I wish I'd appreciated it more.
Stopped and smelled the corpses, you know?

123
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:33,489
Yeah. Now everything's complicated.

124
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:37,009
It's a terrible thing, love is.
I've been there myself.

125
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:41,327
- Ended badly.
- Of course it did. It always does.

126
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,881
I've seen a thousand relationships.

127
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:49,127
First there's the love and sex. Then
there's nothing left but the vengeance.

128
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:51,204
It's how it works.

129
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:56,691
You and I should just go
do the vengeance. Both of us.

130
00:13:56,773 --> 00:14:01,449
You eviscerate Xander and
I'll stake Dru. Like a project.

131
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,642
I don't know. I just can't.

132
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:11,644
But you can go do Dru, though.

133
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,724
Yeah. I will.

134
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,444
Maybe later.

135
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:26,333
See, the thing they're afraid to teach us about
is the inherent sensuality of language.

136
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:30,850
You learn French and they make it all about
conjugations and fronted vowels,

137
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:36,849
but nobody really talks about...
you know, the way language tastes.

138
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,323
You know, the way it feels
rolling over your tongue.

139
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:45,123
I mean, just think about
"car" versus "voiture".

140
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,289
- Wow!
- Are you all right?

141
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,085
I'm fine! I...

142
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:57,444
Oh, my God!

143
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,524
Wow. Wow.

144
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:03,567
- You really like French.
- Yeah, well...

145
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:14,491
Lowell House. 1962.

146
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:17,244
Yes.

147
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:22,885
I'm just, you know, impressing you
with my knowledge of local history.

148
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,325
Or my knowledge of reading.

149
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:28,291
And you didn't even have
to sound anything out.

150
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:31,968
You should see me add
short columns of small numbers.

151
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:35,404
You're funny.

152
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:37,964
Thanks.

153
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:43,605
That is, funny "how amusing",
or funny "back away and avoid eye contact"?

154
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:47,124
Kinda both.

155
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:53,369
- Who are you here with?
- Right now I seem to be here with you.

156
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:59,843
Hey, can we...?

157
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:04,290
I... need you to take a look
at an essay for a class.

158
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:06,011
That essay. Right.

159
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:07,606
Here.

160
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:12,403
I'll catch you guys in a minute.
There's an essay I gotta look at.

161
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:15,087
And I'm the one who got a D in covert ops.

162
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:21,602
- Hey, Evan, come here. You gotta see this.
- I'm gettin' a beer.

163
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:27,006
No, no, no. First, just
put your hand right here.

164
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:29,368
OK. Somehow this is a trick, I know it.

165
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,845
Now stay.

166
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:35,049
Don't move.

167
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,012
Whoa!

168
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,728
What is that?

169
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:43,844
I kinda feel...

170
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,046
God!

171
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,124
Oh, God!

172
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:56,041
Horses. Like, big, tall,
teeth-that-could-take-your-arm-off horses?

173
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:59,489
Well, sure. I learned to ride
when I was a kid. It's fun.

174
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:03,452
And, by the way, most horses
don't like arm very much.

175
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:07,929
I had a bad birthday-party-pony thing
when I was four.

176
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:11,085
I look at horses and I see really big ponies.

177
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:15,724
You should ride with me sometime.
I guarantee safety and fun.

178
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:18,611
Well, if you promise you'll look after me.

179
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,769
Don't touch me! That's disgusting!

180
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:27,404
Tara? What's the matter?

181
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:30,369
I don't know.

182
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,842
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

183
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:37,968
- Are you feeling OK?
- I'm fine. I just wanna go to the bathroom.

184
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,131
Hey. I know these guys from somewhere.

185
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:53,812
Initiative soldiers. They live here.
Experiments happen under the house.

186
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:56,202
It's where they put in your chip.
Let's have fun!

187
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,090
You brought me here?

188
00:17:58,173 --> 00:18:01,609
Anya? What are you doing?
You brought him here?

189
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:04,566
That's what I said. Only I hit the "here" part.

190
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:10,808
Anya, we had a little fight. Itjust means
we have to work our way through some stuff.

191
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:14,090
It doesn't mean we rebound
with the evil undead.

192
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,926
And what have you been
doing with him, anyway?

193
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:21,768
Who's the puffed-up manly man,
all splotchy and possessive?

194
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:24,003
It's not very convincing, is it?

195
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:27,689
I see now what you said about him
earlier. No follow-through.

196
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,968
Hey! What a surprise.

197
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:33,887
Hostile 17!
Can I get you a drink, Hostile 17?

198
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:35,201
Xander, stop.

199
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:47,247
Well, may be some fun to be had
in the lion's den after all.

200
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,245
You two keep scraping. I'll find the liquor.

201
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,052
Anya, what are you doin' with him?

202
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:57,411
We didn't have sex, if that's what you mean.
That's all I do now - not have sex.

203
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:02,692
You're overreacting. We had a fight.
But see, it's OK. It's normal.

204
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:07,164
Yes. It's the normal part of ending a
relationship, before the vengeance begins.

205
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:09,209
Right. No!

206
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:11,761
- Vengeance?
- Relax, I'm not going to do it.

207
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:15,846
It's just that we have nothing in common
besides both of us liking your penis.

208
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:20,609
And now I don't even have that!
So I get to say when it's done. And it's done.

209
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:24,208
You know what? You don't deserve
to be the one to walk away from this.

210
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:27,922
I've put up with a hell of a lot from you,
much of that in the last minute,

211
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:30,766
and if anyone gets to be
the one to leave, it's me.

212
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:33,048
- You're leaving me?
- Yes. I am.

213
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:36,125
- Where are you going?
- To enjoy the party.

214
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,409
Well, then, I'm staying too,

215
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:42,849
to show you how much
I'm not bothered by you having fun.

216
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:46,164
- Because I'll be having more fun.
- I'm having fun already.

217
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,652
Me too.

218
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,132
Whoo-hoo!

219
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:05,131
Sometimes I just don't get
the sophisticated college lifestyle.

220
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,692
Gee, it's a good thing Mom's out.
We'd be in trouble.

221
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:39,126
Hey, buddy. You look familiar.

222
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:41,283
Yeah. I get that a lot.

223
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,212
Hey, Xander.

224
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,444
Julie.

225
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:59,730
OK. This, then, would be the kissing.

226
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:08,404
Very smooth cheek you have there.
Do you exfoliate?

227
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,322
Whoa!

228
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:19,404
Julie! What?

229
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:22,964
I'm sorry. I didn't...

230
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:25,446
I'm sorry.

231
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:40,647
Oh... my... God!

232
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:49,484
Touch it!

233
00:21:57,413 --> 00:22:00,291
- I'm bad. I'm bad.
- Hi.

234
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,604
You OK?

235
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:06,445
Julie?

236
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:09,605
I'm bad.

237
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:11,845
I'm bad.

238
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:13,765
I'm bad.

239
00:22:14,093 --> 00:22:15,492
I'm bad.

240
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,132
I'm bad.

241
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:18,885
I'm bad.

242
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,368
Tara? It's me.

243
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:28,884
Tara?

244
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,843
Tara?

245
00:23:31,653 --> 00:23:33,291
Was that Willow?

246
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:34,965
I don't know.

247
00:23:35,653 --> 00:23:37,450
Doesn't matter.

248
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:47,610
Hey, guys, that girl Julie, she's freakin' out.

249
00:23:48,813 --> 00:23:50,610
Is anyone friends with Julie?

250
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:55,772
Xander?

251
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:57,652
Tara?

252
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:01,921
Xander. Ghost Boy. Drowning in a tub.

253
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:07,246
I tried to save him, but, being a ghost already,
well, I was way too late.

254
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:09,444
A ghost?

255
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:12,844
What's the deal?
Is every frat on this campus haunted?

256
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:17,723
And if so, why do people keep coming
to these parties? Cos it's not the snacks.

257
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,642
Tara, how are you?

258
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:24,726
I'm OK, but I don't like it here. This house.

259
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:26,804
I think we should go.

260
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:37,244
We need Buffy.

261
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:43,367
Buffy?

262
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:45,250
Buffy? Riley?

263
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:52,609
Buffy!

264
00:24:57,213 --> 00:24:58,612
Buffy!

265
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:03,566
Buffy!

266
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:27,570
- Do you wanna go back?
- Never.

267
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:30,164
Buffy! Riley!

268
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:31,652
Buffy!

269
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,689
We gotta get 'em outta there.

270
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,930
Well, this party's starting to liven up after all.

271
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:20,092
Graham! Help get these people to safety!

272
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:21,606
Touch not the impure thing.

273
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:25,572
For ye shall perish. Find salvation
in the cross of our Lord and Saviour.

274
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:26,847
Right.

275
00:26:30,773 --> 00:26:33,082
Retinal scan accepted.

276
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:12,363
Anya. Come on.

277
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,649
Please, God, help me!

278
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:38,004
We got trouble upstairs. Some sort of
disembodied presence in the house.

279
00:27:38,093 --> 00:27:39,606
We've been paging you.

280
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:42,127
This thing must be scrambling
the frequencies.

281
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:47,003
Guard section 2, level 5 precautions.
If the locking mechanisms malfunction,

282
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:49,482
- you know what to do.
- Got it.

283
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:52,321
- You with me?
- I'm good.

284
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:54,483
Let's lock it down.

285
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:00,803
- We have to go back in there.
- Why?

286
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:03,369
Because Buffy and Riley are trapped.

287
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:06,923
So? She's the Slayer, he's a soldier boy.
What do they need you for?

288
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,124
Anya, look around.

289
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:13,286
There's ghosts and shaking, and people
are going all Felicity with their hair.

290
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:16,683
We're fresh out of superpeople
and somebody's gotta go back in there.

291
00:28:16,773 --> 00:28:18,252
Now who's with me?

292
00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:20,645
I am.

293
00:28:21,173 --> 00:28:26,372
I know I'm not the first choice for heroics.
And Buffy's tried to kill me more than once.

294
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:30,249
And I don't fancy
a single one of you at all. But...

295
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:35,487
Actually, all that sounds pretty convincing.

296
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:39,684
I wonder if Asian House is open.

297
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:43,288
- Xander, let's get outta here.
- You wanna bail, fine.

298
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:47,207
I'm goin' in there and I'm not comin' out
until I bring my friend with me.

299
00:28:57,813 --> 00:29:01,169
Or... it could be Watcher time.

300
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,286
We'll go to Giles.

301
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:05,967
He isn't there. He was going
to the Espresso Pump.

302
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,962
Right. He told us not to come.
He needed some grown-up time.

303
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:15,411
 No one knows what it's like

304
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:18,202
 To be the bad man

305
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,882
 To be the sad man

306
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:26,242
 Behind blue eyes

307
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:31,410
 No one knows what it's like

308
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,370
 To be hated...

309
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:34,363
Wow...

310
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:40,606
Could we go back to the haunted house?
Because this is creeping me out.

311
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:42,604
Does he do this a lot?

312
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:46,891
Sure. Every day the earth rotates backward
and the skies turn orange.

313
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:55,767
 As my conscience seems to be

314
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,204
 I have hours

315
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:04,083
 Only Ionely

316
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:08,052
Now I remember why I used
to have such a crush on him.

317
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:10,601
Well, he is pretty good.

318
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:14,731
His voice is pleasant.

319
00:30:15,453 --> 00:30:17,045
What?

320
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:19,363
Oh, come on. It is kinda sexy.

321
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:24,811
I'm fighting total mental breakdown here,
Will. No more fuel in the fire, please.

322
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,363
 And I blame you

323
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:52,522
You're... you're too far away from me.

324
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:55,404
I'm right here.

325
00:30:55,893 --> 00:30:58,885
You have to... keep touching me.

326
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,693
When you called to Buffy and Riley,

327
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:05,606
they didn't cry out or respond in any way?

328
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:07,684
No. They're probably dead.

329
00:31:07,773 --> 00:31:09,968
Unless they're too busy doin' it to answer.

330
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:12,044
Doing what?

331
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:16,486
You know, for a god of acoustic rock,
you're kind of naive.

332
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:19,244
I didn't think you meant...

333
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:23,686
In the midst of all that, do you really
think they were keeping it up?

334
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:27,807
- Oh, for a different phrasing.
- That's the thing.

335
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:32,250
People all over the party
were starting to act weird. Sexually.

336
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:34,569
In what way?

337
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:37,087
You know. Ways.

338
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:42,288
Well, it could be some form
of succubi, or a satyr's prank.

339
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:46,252
It could even be energy coming
from the lab beneath Lowell fraternity.

340
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:49,086
It wasn't always a fraternity. Look.

341
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:56,012
Between 1949 and 1960, the Lowell Home for
Children housed upwards of 40 adolescents.

342
00:31:56,133 --> 00:32:01,002
Runaways, delinquents, and emotionally
disturbed teenagers from the Sunnydale area.

343
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:03,812
Children? Did any of them...

344
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,645
die in there?

345
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:11,523
If there were deaths, then perhaps we're
dealing with a fairly standard haunting.

346
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:15,845
It doesn't say. It's mostly about
the old house director, Genevieve Holt.

347
00:32:16,093 --> 00:32:19,881
Sunnydale children's aide.
30 years of community service,

348
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:23,170
giving disadvantaged kids
the love and care they deserve.

349
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,444
When did she die?

350
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:27,612
She didn't.

351
00:32:28,773 --> 00:32:31,367
No, no, I don't mind at all. I was up.

352
00:32:31,453 --> 00:32:35,969
Early morning prayer, of course.
And I like talking about my kids.

353
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:38,044
I still call them that. My kids.

354
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:42,012
I suppose you were just like a mother
to them. You did everything for them.

355
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:46,962
Oh, yes. I fed them and clothed them.
Educated them in the way of the Lord.

356
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:49,772
- I was given a medal.
- Yes. Wonderful.

357
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:51,844
Congratulations.

358
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:58,772
This'll sound a little strange, but did you
notice any odd disturbances in the house?

359
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:01,251
I don't understand.

360
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:05,008
Well, like furniture moving of its own accord,

361
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:07,561
or objects appearing out of nowhere.

362
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:11,089
Or perhaps you saw someone
appear one moment

363
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:14,051
and then they were gone
the next, inexplicably.

364
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:16,806
Why, that sounds like crazy talk.

365
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:19,123
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

366
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:24,042
Forgive me for asking this,
but the children in your care,

367
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:28,365
were any of them ever ill, or did
anything ever happen to any of them?

368
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:33,926
Well, some had the flu and such.
No one died, if that's what you mean.

369
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,050
The medal says how good
I was with the children.

370
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:38,248
Oh, yes.

371
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:41,370
I treated them as I would
my own flesh and blood.

372
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,967
Gave them hugs and praise
when they were good,

373
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:47,090
and punished them when they were dirty.

374
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:52,167
Children will be children.
They do like to play in the muck.

375
00:33:54,093 --> 00:33:59,213
- You didn't mean muddy dirty.
- My kids didn't think I knew, but I did.

376
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:02,611
Very perceptive of you.

377
00:34:03,613 --> 00:34:07,208
Without me they would have been
shut out of the Kingdom.

378
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:10,250
Lost to lust.

379
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:13,409
But you helped them.

380
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:16,970
The girls fell to vanity more than the boys.

381
00:34:17,093 --> 00:34:21,689
I'd see them preening like Jezebel,
doting over their pretty hair.

382
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,850
So you'd hack it off?

383
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:27,448
I'd remove the temptation
to admire themselves.

384
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:31,522
- They were better for it.
- What about the bathtub?

385
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:35,210
I performed baptisms on the most unclean.

386
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:38,922
Those who were tainted
with impure thought and deed.

387
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,288
You held them under.

388
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:44,410
They needed to be reborn.

389
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:48,722
- You choose to pass judgment on me?
- Well, someone ought to!

390
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:52,567
You traumatised and abused these children.

391
00:34:52,653 --> 00:34:56,089
Children who would no doubt
become extremely disturbed adults.

392
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:58,289
You have ruined lives, Mrs Holt.

393
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:02,328
What you did has now manifested itself
as a malevolent presence

394
00:35:02,413 --> 00:35:05,803
which threatens more lives!
You have a great deal to answer for.

395
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:10,125
I refuse to listen to this when I can smell
the sin on each and every one of you.

396
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:12,124
Yeah? You smell sin?

397
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:15,603
Let me tell you somethin', lady.
She who smelt it dealt it!

398
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:18,282
It's like what you said, but faster.

399
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:22,446
This totally adds to my
"old people are crazy" theorem.

400
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:26,685
Those kids were tortured but not killed,
so where are those ghosts coming from?

401
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:29,412
I don't believe there are any ghosts.

402
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:32,485
- One ran right through me.
- Not a ghost. An apparition.

403
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:36,806
We're dealing with a kind of poltergeist.
A whole cluster of them.

404
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:41,444
Born out of intense adolescent
emotion and sexual energy.

405
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:45,446
Both of which were totally pent up
during Mrs Holt's reign of repression.

406
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:51,403
So, with Buffy and Riley having...
acts of nakedness around the clock lately,

407
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:55,372
maybe they set something free.
Like a big burstin' poltergasm.

408
00:35:55,453 --> 00:36:00,083
Yes. And now the poltergeists are drawing
more and more energy out of them.

409
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:04,132
Feeding on them, in fact. Buffy and Riley
are powering this whole thing.

410
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:08,809
OK, they're the battery in the boo factory.
So what happens when the battery's drained?

411
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,884
They die.

412
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:26,044
Don't stop.

413
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:28,404
Never stop touching me.

414
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:40,331
What good are weapons
against disembodied spirits?

415
00:36:40,493 --> 00:36:44,691
- They have no ass to kick.
- She's right. You should just stay outside.

416
00:36:44,773 --> 00:36:47,685
We'll bind the spirits so you can
get Riley and Buffy out.

417
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:50,048
- How much time are you buyin'?
- Could be tricky.

418
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:54,331
We're calling upon the communal spirit
of a certain time and place.

419
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:57,530
Let's go.

420
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:05,082
- What do you feel?
- Sad. Afraid of being without you.

421
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:06,925
And a little hungry.

422
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:10,972
- I meant about the house.
- Oh. Still haunted.

423
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:14,851
Give me your hands. Form a circle.

424
00:37:18,213 --> 00:37:20,408
Children of the past,

425
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,528
spirits of Lowell,

426
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:27,048
be guided by our light.

427
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,166
Come forth and be known to us.

428
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:37,402
How will we know when it works?

429
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:45,804
We'll know.

430
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:00,769
House is clean.

431
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:03,048
Let's go. You first.

432
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:19,689
Need to work fast. Never know how long
before the munchkins get homesick.

433
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:21,684
Or the human battery conks out.

434
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:23,684
Watch your fingers.

435
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,362
We implore you,

436
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:30,569
be still.

437
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:33,725
Find it in your hearts
to leave our friends passage.

438
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:37,928
Transform your pain. Release your past.

439
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:39,925
And...

440
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:43,049
get over it.

441
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:47,525
You OK?

442
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,290
Find here the serenity you seek!
The peace you...

443
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:12,850
- What's happened?
- We lost them.

444
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:13,683
Xander.

445
00:39:15,173 --> 00:39:16,572
Xander!

446
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:20,372
Xander!

447
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:53,567
Shut up, repressed cry-babies!

448
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:22,764
Come on. We just gotta...

449
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:24,532
Xander!

450
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:33,405
We can make it through this.

451
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,564
Xander, get it off!

452
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:51,971
Push.

453
00:40:57,573 --> 00:40:59,529
Xander! Don't you knock?

454
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,290
I can't believe it happened.

455
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:08,490
I just had no idea.

456
00:41:08,573 --> 00:41:10,564
It's so creepy.

457
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:12,889
He was really singing?

458
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:15,328
I'd say it was more like crooning.

459
00:41:15,413 --> 00:41:19,167
If we grow old together,
remind me to skip the midlife crisis.

460
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:20,129
OK.

461
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:22,363
You have to admit, it was kinda sexy.

462
00:41:22,453 --> 00:41:25,604
Please stop saying that.
I'm willing to offer cash incentives.

463
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:28,002
We're just lucky no one got injured.

464
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:31,210
- No thanks to us.
- Don't be too hard on yourself.

465
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:35,650
He's right, Will. If Riley and I hadn't
gotten so wrapped up in each other,

466
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:39,248
- none of this would've happened.
- True. Feel shame.

467
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,893
My girlfriend.
Mistress of the learning plateau.

468
00:41:41,973 --> 00:41:46,364
Really, it wasn't your fault. You were
under the influence of powerful magics.

469
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:50,162
We were like zombies.
I had no control over myself at all.

470
00:41:50,253 --> 00:41:52,721
Must've been horrible.

471
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:59,369
- Yeah. Horrible.
- It was bad.

472
