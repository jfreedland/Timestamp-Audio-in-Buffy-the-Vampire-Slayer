1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,010
I was thinking of asking out Buffy.

2
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:06,163
I've never courted anyone like Buffy before.

3
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:08,608
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like Buffy before.

4
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:10,411
Um, Buffy...

5
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:13,485
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

6
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:17,285
Big Bad is back. And this time...

7
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:24,371
The Slayer set me up too.

8
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:31,125
- Situation?
- Gentlemen, suit up. We have a code red.

9
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:32,965
Hostile 17 has escaped.

10
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:37,046
Fail to recapture it, and everything
we've worked for - the Initiative - could end.

11
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:38,566
Nobody's failin' on my watch.

12
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:40,371
- My implant?
- The implant works.

13
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:44,366
Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature
without intense neurological pain.

14
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:48,366
- You're a little peculiar.
- I can live with that.

15

16
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:11,087
- Looking for me?
- Holy... What do you want?

17
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,482
- Look who's home.
- Slayer...

18
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:23,888
Go back where you came from.
Things were great before you came.

19
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:33,532
And they say one person
can't make a difference.

20
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,209
Of all the duties of a dean,

21
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:55,127
one of the most pleasant
is to see a colleague realise a dream.

22
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:57,602
Ladies, gentlemen, students,

23
00:02:57,693 --> 00:03:02,164
I present to you Professor Gerhardt
of the Anthropology Department.

24
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:09,685
When I first realised we were outgrowing
our cultural centre, I was concerned.

25
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:14,893
Then I realised it was like seeing one's child
grow up and move on to better things.

26
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,852
In this case, a spacious new facility
to be built on this site.

27
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:23,370
Look at him. Have you ever seen
anything so masculine?

28
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,729
- Dean Guerrero, or his wife?
- I think she means...

29
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:30,803
Oh. Very manly. Not at all Village People.

30
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:33,487
So much sexier than
the outfit from his lastjob.

31
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,527
I miss the free hot dogs on sticks.

32
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:40,128
I'm imagining having sex with him, right now.

33
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,331
That's why it's appropriate
that the groundbreaking

34
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:47,371
for the UC Sunnydale
Cultural Partnership Center

35
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:51,685
is taking place so near Thanksgiving.
Because that's what the melting pot is about:

36
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:56,847
contributions from all cultures,
making our culture stronger.

37
00:03:57,413 --> 00:04:01,565
- What a load of horse hooey!
- We have a counter point?

38
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:05,009
Yeah. Thanksgiving isn't about
blending of two cultures.

39
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:07,323
It's about one culture wiping out another.

40
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:12,771
And then they make animated specials
with the maize and the big, big belt buckles.

41
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,686
They don't show you the scene
where all the bison die,

42
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:18,765
and then Squanto
takes a musket ball in the stomach.

43
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,645
For some of that
you were channelling your mother?

44
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:27,853
Well, yeah, sort of. That's why she doesn't
celebrate Thanksgiving or Columbus Day,

45
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,367
the destruction of the indigenous peoples.

46
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:34,282
I know it sounds a little overwrought,
but really she's right.

47
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:38,652
Yeah. I guess I never really
thought about it that way.

48
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:42,283
With Mom at Aunt Arlene's
I'm not getting a Thanksgiving.

49
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:44,409
Maybe it's just as well.

50
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,929
Well, I think that's a shame.
I love a ritual sacrifice.

51
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:50,004
Not really a one-of-those.

52
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:54,448
To commemorate a past event,
you kill and eat an animal.

53
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,888
It's a ritual sacrifice - with pie.

54
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:00,525
..and thus, a symbolic beginning.

55
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:03,931
What's she doing?

56
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:07,528
Xander said he was gonna dig.
I want to see Xander dig.

57
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,127
- That part's just ceremonial.
- Well, it bites.

58
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:16,201
She's not rippling at all.

59
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:26,249
Oh, look. There he goes.

60
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,692
Look at him.

61
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:32,328
Very... diggy.

62
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,606
Soon he'll be sweating.
I'm imagining having sex with him again.

63
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:40,332
Imaginary Xander is quite the machine.

64
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:49,489
What happened?
Hey, buddy, are you all right?

65
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,803
OK, don't move.

66
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:56,126
I'm OK! I'm...

67
00:05:57,013 --> 00:06:00,005
- I'm OK.
- All right. We'll get you some help.

68
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:06,090
Where am I OK?

69
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:37,526
While they were pulling Xander out,
I heard the anthro professors talking about it.

70
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:39,490
Man, were they excited.

71
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:43,202
It's the old Sunnydale Mission,
which everyone thought was lost.

72
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:45,363
Huh?

73
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:47,887
Is there something out there?

74
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:50,529
Oh. No.

75
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,808
I'm sorry. A lost mission.

76
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:56,932
A hairbrush I can understand. By the way,
I will find that and get it back to you.

77
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:00,972
- But how do you lose a mission?
- Huge earthquake in 1812.

78
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:05,444
Everyone just assumed the mission was
levelled. Instead, they built right over it.

79
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:09,367
It's like what happened in the '30s
with that church the Master was in.

80
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:13,605
Doesn't it make you wonder what else
is there? Right under our feet.

81
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:17,881
- Mostly, I've found sewers full of demons.
- Oh, right.

82
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:26,326
- Man, it's crazy out there.
- Post-midterm frenzy.

83
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,768
And the holiday. Everyone's goin' home.

84
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:35,688
It looks like a lotta lucky moms are gonna be
getting brimming baskets of dirty laundry.

85
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:38,128
It's so not fair.

86
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:43,241
I mean, they all get a family holiday just
because they can go home to their families.

87
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,767
It's a turvy-topsy world.

88
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:49,646
You know what? I should have
my own Thanksgiving.

89
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:53,442
I can cook the meal,
have all you guys over. It'll be great.

90
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:58,402
Buffy, earlier you agreed with me about
Thanksgiving. It's a sham. It's all about death.

91
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:03,282
It is a sham.
But it's a sham with yams.

92
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:05,364
It's a yam sham.

93
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:10,447
- You won'tjokey-rhyme your way out of this.
- I know. But I want it.

94
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:14,204
It's like Professor Walsh
was saying about sense memory.

95
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,490
I smell a roasting turkey
and I'm eight years old.

96
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,531
I liked having that to look forward to.

97
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,244
Everything's different now.

98
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:27,161
Well, I suppose there could be slight yams.

99
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:32,370
I mean, we could definitely use
a little comfort food.

100
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:34,444
I bet Giles doesn't have any plans.

101
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,252
And Xander always avoids
his family gatherings.

102
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:40,010
We could not invite Anya.

103
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:44,648
I don't know. She and Xander
seem pretty tight lately.

104
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:47,363
Grumble, grumble.

105
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:53,723
Look, Pilgrims aside, isn't that the point of
Thanksgiving? Everybody has a place to go?

106
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,810
Man, I'm beat.

107
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:21,603
- We'll do one more sweep, then cash it in.
- I gotta pack tonight.

108
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,570
- You got a flight?
- Wednesday night.

109
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:26,121
Professor Walsh
wants me here for the debriefing.

110
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:27,805
That's a short Thanksgiving.

111
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:30,805
With the hostile loose,
we're lucky to be goin' home at all.

112
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:34,442
It's neutered. The implant works great.
He can't hurt any living thing.

113
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:39,653
As long as he knows about the Initiative,
he's a threat. We do this the professor's way.

114
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,371
Mama's boy.

115
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:45,162
That's a nasty cough. You might need
to spend the weekend in quarantine.

116
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,369
Oh, no. I'm done coughing.

117
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,444
I just don't want anyone gettin' sick.

118
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:58,084
Xander, what are you doing?

119
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,969
You're supposed to be digging.

120
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:04,011
I went to watch you digging,
and you weren't there doing it.

121
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:06,084
I'm going now.

122
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:09,245
Just kinda tough gettin' going today.

123
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:13,169
Your head is moist. Oh! You're sick.

124
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:16,563
Well, you can't go to work.

125
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:21,249
- Oh. Anya...
- You're pasty and wet and disgusting.

126
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,403
They can dig without you.

127
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:28,288
I don't really feel that bad.

128
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:34,209
I inflicted a lot of putrefying diseases
on men when I was an avenging demon.

129
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:36,807
You look like you're getting all of them.

130
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:41,409
OK. I'll stay.

131
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,801
But you should go. You could catch it.

132
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:48,243
Then we'll die together. It's romantic.

133
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,525
Let me get your trousers off.

134
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:52,683
You're a strange girlfriend.

135
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:56,488
I'm a girlfriend?

136
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:00,161
There's a chance I'm delirious.

137
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:01,811
Ah, yes.

138
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:06,091
Well, whatever it is
that's making you sick, so far I like it.

139
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:21,083
It's a very exciting opportunity.

140
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,323
I can't wait to go down there myself.

141
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:26,165
It's just...

142
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:30,132
It means we're gonna have to
start looking for a new location.

143
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:32,204
No, it's really up to the dean.

144
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:35,765
I just hope this doesn't
cost us another year.

145
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:37,844
OK. Talk to you later.

146
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,209
I'll never get used to this.

147
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:05,366
One day she's at the Friendship Ceremony,
and the next day, she's on the news.

148
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:08,092
The coroner's office said
she was missing an ear.

149
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:10,767
So I'm thinking
maybe we're looking for a witch.

150
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:14,732
There are some great spells that work
much better with an ear in the mix.

151
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:17,725
That's one fun little hobby
you've got there, Will.

152
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:21,567
Or maybe an ear-harvesting demon that...

153
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:25,692
It's, like, building another demon
completely out of ears.

154
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:28,162
Or... Oh. Thought.

155
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:30,813
We're just assuming
someone else cut off the ear.

156
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:34,363
What if it was self-inflicted, like Van Gogh?

157
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:40,085
So she brutally stabbed herself, dumped
the body and then cut off her own ear?

158
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:44,803
No. She cut off her ear, then killed herself,
then dumped the body...

159
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,808
I'm really off my game, aren't I?

160
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,485
Yeah.

161
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:52,846
Wait. Something's missing from this case.

162
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:59,007
- Early 1800 Chumash knife. There's a picture.
- What's it look like?

163
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:02,444
Pretty darn scary.
It was more like a riot than a Ralphs.

164
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:06,651
I nearly used slayer moves on a woman
who was hoarding the pumpkin pie filling.

165
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:10,043
And at some point you are going
to tell me about the murder?

166
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:14,172
Oh. Right. The knife was
some sort of Indian artefact.

167
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:18,610
- Chumash, I think. That's all we got.
- Oh, the Chumash Indians.

168
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:21,844
They were indigenous to this whole area.
That's interesting.

169
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:26,211
Then, of course, the murder weapon
might have just been a convenient choice.

170
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:30,332
Uh-uh. There was a big scissors right there.
That knife was picked for a reason.

171
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:32,847
Do you even own a turkey pan?

172
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:36,323
Tell me again why
we're not doing this at your house.

173
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:41,362
Giles, if you would like to get by in American
society, you have to follow our traditions.

174
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,923
You're the patriarch.
You have to host the festivities.

175
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:49,052
And this is in no way an elaborate scheme
to stick me with the cleanup?

176
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:53,285
How about that ceremonial knife, huh?
Juicy piece of clueage, don't you think?

177
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:56,012
All right, I'll look into
the Chumash connection.

178
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:59,529
See if there's any ritual significance
to the ear removal.

179
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:01,410
Thank you.

180
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:04,852
- You all right?
- Yeah.

181
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,204
I still need to pick up a few things,
so I'll check in.

182
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:11,249
And keep your hands off the food.

183
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:16,407
Oh, I'll try and restrain myself from eating
uncooked potatoes and cranberries.

184
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,644
So, what do you think?

185
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,764
She sounds good.

186
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:31,285
Kind of intense
about this Thanksgiving thing.

187
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:35,924
I think perhaps she's a little Ionely.
But I meant about the murder.

188
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:39,244
Whatever killed the woman in the museum
is probably the danger.

189
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,723
This danger... Your friend has
some ominous vision about Buffy?

190
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:45,964
It's all terribly vague.
There are other things happening.

191
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,965
Maybe I'm wrong,
but I can'tjust keep watching.

192
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:52,682
I'm glad you're watching out for her,
but she's not helpless,

193
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:56,766
- and it's not yourjob to keep her safe.
- It's not yours any more either.

194
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:58,969
Are you gonna walk away?

195
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:00,611
All right.

196
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:05,046
But I feel we should tell her.
I don't like keeping this secret.

197
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:08,967
If she knew I was here,
it would distract her. It could get her hurt.

198
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:11,044
I don't want to get in the way.

199
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,853
I assume there is a connection
to the old mission.

200
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,925
Something is angry about being disturbed.

201
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,322
Or it was trapped there
and now it's released.

202
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,927
Something with a fondness
for ancient weapons?

203
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:27,641
- You know Father Gabriel?
- No.

204
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,964
He knows the history of this place
back to mission times.

205
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:34,887
- He might be able to fill in some blanks.
- OK. I'll see about contacting him.

206
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:38,806
- Where are you going?
- To watch her.

207
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:40,531
It's not fair.

208
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:44,049
You know that's what she'd say.
You can see her, but she can't see you?

209
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:47,205
Believe me, I'm not gettin'
the good half of this deal.

210
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:50,763
To be on the outside
looking in at what I can't...

211
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:55,565
No. I'd forgotten how bad it feels.

212
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:21,325
But you have whipped cream.
I saw it in Giles's fridge.

213
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:25,406
But that's whipped cream in a canister.
It's only right if you whip it yourself.

214
00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:30,203
Hey, and then later we can churn our own
butter and make sweaters out of sheep.

215
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:33,083
OK. It's the last thing. I promise.

216
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:35,892
Besides, I have to see that priest
Giles called about.

217
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:40,603
- Thinks he might have some information.
- Buffy? Hey, Buffy.

218
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:44,525
Riley. Where did you come from?
I didn't see you at all.

219
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:46,808
Oh, just across the street.

220
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:49,043
And a couple of blocks down.

221
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,603
- Hey, Willow.
- Hi.

222
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:54,048
Well, I'm just gonna let you two...

223
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:58,808
Look! They're selling coffee
in the coffee shop. Yum.

224
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:07,248
Angel! Evil - you're all evil again.

225
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,528
I'm not evil. I'm here to help Buffy.

226
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:14,610
- What's goin' on?
- My friend had a vision. Buffy's in danger.

227
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:17,526
- So tell her. Help her.
- If she sees me, it'll be worse.

228
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:23,529
See, I don't get all this "leaving for her
own good" garbage. Because that's what it is.

229
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:26,889
You can'tjust give up
because there's obstacles.

230
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:29,407
- Willow.
- Sorry. My stuff.

231
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:32,612
You know how I feel about her.
If there was any way...

232
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:34,411
Yeah, I know.

233
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:37,451
It's just everything's different now.

234
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:43,968
Hey, is Cordelia really working for you?
Of all the people you could've hired...

235
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:48,171
Willow, I'm here to protect Buffy.
I don't have a lot of time for personal stuff.

236
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:50,130
Right. Well, how can I help?

237
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:53,562
Well, if you can just tell me...

238
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:56,928
Who's that guy?

239
00:17:57,013 --> 00:18:01,564
It'll be just like when I was a kid. Only without
me building a fort out of mashed potatoes.

240
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,645
- Sounds like fun.
- It will be.

241
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:11,004
You know, if you don't already have plans,
you should come.

242
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:14,244
I'm a great cook - in theory. I've eaten a lot.

243
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,210
That sounds so great.

244
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:19,683
But I'm outta here tonight.
I got a last-minute flight to Iowa.

245
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:20,922
Iowa.

246
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:23,527
That's one of the ones in the middle, right?

247
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:29,128
My folks and I always do Thanksgiving at my
grandparents' house. A farm outside Huxley.

248
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:31,852
- Sounds nice.
- It is.

249
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:36,449
After dinner, we all go for a walk
down by the river with the dogs.

250
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:41,323
There's trees and... And you're thinking
it's like I grew up in a Grant Wood painting.

251
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,768
Exactly - if I knew who that was.

252
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:46,925
Just a guy who painted stuff
that looked like where I grew up.

253
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:49,083
Well, have fun at the homestead.

254
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:53,849
Always do. What's the line? "Home's the
place that, when you have to go there..."

255
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,127
"..they have to take you in."

256
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:56,806
Get out!

257
00:18:56,893 --> 00:19:00,044
- But, babe, this is where I belong.
- Out! I mean it.

258
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:03,808
I've been doing a lot of reading,
and I'm in control of my own power now,

259
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,884
so we're through.

260
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,404
You don't mean that.

261
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:14,004
Yes, I do.

262
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:16,764
I do.

263
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:22,168
I mean it a lot.

264
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,165
See?

265
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:31,611
I knew you'd end up
welcoming me back with open...

266
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:33,684
arms.

267
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:36,848
No.

268
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:41,449
I'm powerful and I'm beautiful
and I don't need you to complete me.

269
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,488
And you're mean.

270
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:47,170
You had that in our bed?

271
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,853
- Do you know how dangerous that is?
- Let's find out.

272
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:54,288
- You wouldn't.
- You did it to me, remember?

273
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:56,933
All right. All right. I'll go. Just...

274
00:19:57,013 --> 00:19:58,810
What?

275
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:00,611
Can I have someone to eat?

276
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:14,484
Father Gabriel?

277
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:20,644
Father Gabriel?

278
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:28,645
Father?

279
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:31,563
Are you out here?

280
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,324
God...

281
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,411
- You can't stop me.
- You're very wrong about that.

282
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:56,290
I am vengeance. I am my people's cry.

283
00:20:56,373 --> 00:21:01,447
They call for Hus,
for the avenging spirit to carve outjustice.

284
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:03,524
They tell you to start an ear collection?

285
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:19,967
You slaughtered my people.
Now you kill their spirit.

286
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:22,564
This is a great day for you.

287
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:44,523
It's clear we're dealing
with a spirit of some kind.

288
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:48,288
It's very common for Indian spirits
to change to animal form.

289
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,729
Well, it's plenty uncommon
for me to freeze up during a fight.

290
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:54,931
I had the guy. I was ready
for the takedown and I stopped.

291
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,402
- And "Native American".
- Sorry?

292
00:21:58,213 --> 00:22:00,443
We don't say "Indian".

293
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,364
Oh, right. Yes, yes.

294
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,364
Always behind on the terms.

295
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:08,002
Still trying not to refer
to you lot as "bloody colonials".

296
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:12,450
And the thing is, I like my evil
like I like my men: evil. You know?

297
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:17,527
Straight up, black hat, tied to the train tracks,
"my electro-ray will destroy Metropolis" bad.

298
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:21,242
Not mixed up with guilt and
the destruction of an indigenous culture.

299
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:25,963
This spirit warrior - Hus, you called him -
has killed innocent people.

300
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:29,968
OK, we need to boil those
and put them through the ricer.

301
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:32,044
I don't think I have a ricer.

302
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:34,962
You don't have a ricer? What do you mean?

303
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:38,489
- How could someone not have a ricer?
- Well, do you have one at home?

304
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:40,564
I don't know. What's a ricer?

305
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:43,087
We'll mash them with forks,
as the Pilgrims did.

306
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:47,610
- Did you get the part about innocent people?
- Yes. OK? And I do wanna stop him.

307
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:50,526
I'd just like to find
a non-slayey way to do it.

308
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:01,003
- Hey.
- Hey.

309
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:03,084
- Peas?
- Peas.

310
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:07,524
- These are frozen.
- What's all that?

311
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:13,131
Atrocities. I got the full poop on the Chumash
Indians and our fabulous buried mission.

312
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:15,681
- You said you'd get fresh ones.
- Atrocities?

313
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:17,968
Peas. They come in pods. You shell them.

314
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:20,965
I didn't have time. I was reading
about the Chumash war.

315
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:22,532
The Chumash were peaceful.

316
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:26,811
Oh, they were fluffy indigenous kittens,
till we came along.

317
00:23:26,893 --> 00:23:28,884
- They'll be mushy.
- They won't be.

318
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:31,009
I like mushy peas.

319
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,891
You're the reason we had Pilgrims
in the first place.

320
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,848
So what happened to the Chumash?

321
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:39,447
How about imprisonment, forced labour,

322
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:43,526
herded like animals into a mission
full of bad European diseases.

323
00:23:43,613 --> 00:23:47,606
Boy. The Cultural Partnership Center
didn't stress any of that stuff.

324
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,446
Not even a diorama. And it gets better.

325
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:53,491
The few Chumash
who tried to rebel were hanged.

326
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:58,203
And when a group was accused
of stealing cattle, they were killed.

327
00:23:58,293 --> 00:24:00,363
Men, women and children.

328
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:02,842
And for proof
to bring back to their accusers...

329
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:04,924
They cut off their ears?

330
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:11,446
So Hus wasn't kidding about vengeance. He's
re-creating all the wrongs done to his people.

331
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,526
- Then it's up to us to stop him.
- Yes, but after dinner, right?

332
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:17,683
Are you sure we shouldn't be helping him?

333
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:22,528
No, I think perhaps we won't help the angry
spirit with his rape and pillage and murder.

334
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:26,083
Well, OK, no. But we should be
helping him redress his wrongs.

335
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,891
Bring the atrocities to light.

336
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:30,885
If the history books are full of them,
they already are.

337
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:34,329
- Giving his land back.
- It's not exactly ours to give.

338
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:38,884
I don't think you wanna help. I think you just
wanna slay the demon, then go "La, la, la".

339
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:43,330
And I think your sympathy for his plight
has blinded you to certain urgent facts.

340
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:45,244
We have to stop this thing.

341
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,166
- OK, Unfeeling Guy.
- Willow, that's not fair.

342
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,244
I have to baste.

343
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,166
Willow,

344
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:59,804
I have reason to believe that Buffy may be
in particular danger from this menace.

345
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:02,089
You mean... Angel?

346
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:05,365
- I saw him too.
- That's not terribly stealthy of him.

347
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:07,364
I think he's lost his edge.

348
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:10,251
- But Buffy doesn't know?
- No, no. Not a peep.

349
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:14,406
That's good. But this is why I think
we should all keep a level head in this.

350
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:19,442
I think mine is the level head
and yours is the one things would roll off of.

351
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:28,483
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Xander!

352
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:30,529
- You look like death.
- Are you OK?

353
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,126
You didn't bring rolls?

354
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:51,332
The doctor couldn't figure it out. He said
I had a lot of symptoms that didn't connect.

355
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:53,131
I think they do connect.

356
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:56,171
What, to this Chumash spirit vengeance guy?

357
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:59,529
Didn't you say the Chumash
got all diseased in the mission?

358
00:25:59,613 --> 00:26:03,083
Yeah. This has a better account.
It lists the various...

359
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:05,607
Various? As in?

360
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:08,571
Well, the important thing is not to panic.

361
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:13,329
You just recited the mystical panic-causing
incantation, so little hope there.

362
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:15,131
Let's talk about the various.

363
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:20,287
Well, they did suffer from malaria,
some smallpox...

364
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:23,683
- I was gonna say smallpox.
- You know, syphilis...

365
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:26,003
- But basically standard...
- Syphilis?

366
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:30,964
Well... But this is probably mystical,
and it'll all go away as soon as...

367
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:32,327
As soon as what?

368
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:36,247
- We still don't know what we're gonna do.
- Maybe I can find something.

369
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,325
Let's give him some land.
That'll clear everything up.

370
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:43,452
- Sarcasm accomplishes nothing, Giles.
- It's sort of an end in itself.

371
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:47,048
Can we come rocketing back to the part
about me and my new syphilis?

372
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:50,045
It'll make you blind and insane.
But it won't kill you.

373
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:51,691
The smallpox will.

374
00:26:51,773 --> 00:26:54,651
Maybe there's a Wiccan spell that can cure it.

375
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:57,372
Something regular medicine
doesn't know about.

376
00:26:57,453 --> 00:26:59,683
Ooh, there was a potion!

377
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:02,892
Sage, salt... onion?

378
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:04,964
- That's the stuffing.
- Oh, God.

379
00:27:05,653 --> 00:27:09,692
Oh. You're gonna get vesicles and pustules.
They have pictures.

380
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:13,483
- I hate this guy.
- He's just doing what was done to him.

381
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:16,292
- I didn't give him syphilis.
- You freed his spirit.

382
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:19,649
And after a century of unrest,
he saw you as one of his oppressors.

383
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:23,487
What, so he rises up and
infects the first guy he sees?

384
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:26,770
- That's no fair.
- Like you've never woken up cranky?

385
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,969
Why the others? Why them particularly?

386
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:30,964
So we take this guy out.

387
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:34,125
Buffy, it is for to be slaying
sometime soon, yeah?

388
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:36,966
That's sort of the question before the court.

389
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:39,804
Question?

390
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:43,206
- There are two sides to it.
- To slaying him?

391
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:46,603
- Well, the member from Syphilis votes yea.
- It's not that simple.

392
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:51,323
He's a vengeance demon. You don't talk
to vengeance demons. You kill them.

393
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:55,282
- I didn't know you felt that way.
- What?

394
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,603
Anyway, he's a spirit, not a demon.

395
00:27:57,693 --> 00:28:01,686
And we've never faced this sort of spirit
before. We don't know what will kill it.

396
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:05,402
- Again with the killing.
- Figuratively speaking. Or bind it. Whatever.

397
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:07,802
Willow, we all appreciate your perspective.

398
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:11,283
- Sometimes vengeance is justified.
- You know I didn't mean you.

399
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:14,046
No one appreciates the truth of the situation.

400
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:16,089
I think we do.

401
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:18,403
This is no good!

402
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:24,886
It needs more condensed milk.

403
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:31,090
Buffy, Xander is in danger.
Are you sure the solution is pie?

404
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:34,085
- Over bickering, I'll take pie.
- We will find a solution.

405
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:37,848
And we will have a nice dinner, OK?
Both. End of story.

406
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:40,731
I'm going to have Thanksgiving,
and it'll be perfect.

407
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:43,964
Hus won't stop.
Vengeance is never sated, Buffy.

408
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:46,442
Hatred is a cycle. All he will do is kill.

409
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:01,892
Help me.

410
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:07,606
What part of "help me"
do you not understand?

411
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,604
The part where I help you.

412
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:12,253
Come on. I'm parboiling out here.

413
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,166
- Want me to help make it quicker?
- Invite me in.

414
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:17,490
- No.
- Very unlikely.

415
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:20,052
Damn it!

416
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:27,003
Look, I'm safe. I can't bite anyone.

417
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:29,643
Willow, tell 'em what I did.

418
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,930
You said you were gonna kill me, then Buffy.

419
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:36,483
Yes, bad, but let's skip to the part
where I couldn't bite you.

420
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:39,007
It's true.

421
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:43,723
- He had trouble performing.
- Yeah. It looks like they've done me for good.

422
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:46,572
What are you saying?

423
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:51,647
Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now
he doesn't chase the other puppies any more.

424
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:54,566
I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.

425
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:58,851
So you haven't murdered anybody lately?
Let's be best pals.

426
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:04,613
I've got information - about the soldier boys
you were fighting. I've got the inside scoop.

427
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:09,130
Come on. What have you got to be afraid of?

428
00:30:10,693 --> 00:30:13,366
First People, who dwell in Mishupashup,

429
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:15,444
hear me and descend.

430
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:18,971
Walk with me upon Itiashup again.

431
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:22,687
Hear me also, Nunashush,

432
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:25,367
spirits from below,

433
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:27,683
creatures of the night.

434
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,326
Take human form and join the battle.

435
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:34,407
Bring me my revenge.

436
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:48,887
Bloody hell, woman!
You're cuttin' off my circulation.

437
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,886
- You don't have any circulation.
- Well, it pinches.

438
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:57,410
- Get over it. I have more important worries.
- I came to you in friendship.

439
00:30:57,493 --> 00:31:03,090
Well, all right, seething hatred. But I've got
useful information and I'm being mistreated.

440
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:04,970
So tell me everything you know.

441
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:08,363
- I'm too hungry to remember everything.
- Then sit.

442
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:13,685
- How much butter goes in with these?
- Half a stick, and a quarter cup of brandy.

443
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:16,412
You do have brandy, don't you?

444
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:17,562
What?

445
00:31:17,653 --> 00:31:20,690
Oh. Yes. On the bookcase.

446
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:24,367
- I wouldn't say no to a brandy.
- What's wrong?

447
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:25,772
The victims.

448
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:29,482
Apart from Xander,
Hus has targeted authority figures.

449
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:32,531
Father Gabriel,
the curator of the cultural centre...

450
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,811
- Who else fits?
- Just a small brandy.

451
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:39,169
Dean Guerrero. He's the king of us,
and he was at the ceremony.

452
00:31:39,253 --> 00:31:41,369
A likely candidate. We should warn him.

453
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:45,446
Will, anything in those books about
how to stop a Native American spirit guy?

454
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,570
Some nice, nonjudgmental way to,
you know, kill him?

455
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:51,292
I'm not gonna help you kill him.
I'm not on board.

456
00:31:51,373 --> 00:31:53,284
Will, what choice do we have?

457
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:59,482
Buffy, this isn't a Western. We're not at Fort
Giles with the cavalry coming to save us.

458
00:31:59,573 --> 00:32:04,203
It's one Ionely guy. Oppressed
warrior guy, who's just trying to...

459
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:07,763
- Kill a lot of people?
- Well, I didn't say he was right.

460
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:10,890
Will, you know how bad I feel
about this. It's eating me up.

461
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,645
A quarter cup and simmer.

462
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:15,247
But even though it's hard,
we have to end this.

463
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,684
Yes, he's been wronged,
and I personally would apologise...

464
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:22,243
Oh, someone put a stake in me.

465
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,449
You got a lot of volunteers in here.

466
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:30,212
I just can't take all this mamby-pamby
boohooing about the bloody Indians.

467
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:33,126
- The preferred term...
- You won. All right?

468
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:37,809
You came in, killed them and took their land.
That's what conquering nations do.

469
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:43,047
Caesar did, and he didn't say "I came,
I conquered, I felt really bad about it."

470
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:45,604
History is not people making friends.

471
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:49,049
You had better weapons
and you massacred them. End of story.

472
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:53,570
Well, I think the Spaniards actually did
a lot of... Not that I don't like Spaniards.

473
00:32:53,653 --> 00:32:56,850
Listen to you. How are you gonna
fight anyone with that attitude?

474
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,528
- We don't wanna fight anyone.
- I just wanna have Thanksgiving.

475
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:03,845
Yeah. Good luck.

476
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:07,812
- If we could talk to him...
- You exterminated his race.

477
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:10,930
What could you possibly say
that would make him feel better?

478
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:14,210
It's kill or be killed here.
Take your bloody pick.

479
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:17,842
Maybe it's the syphilis talkin',
but some of that made sense.

480
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:21,243
I made these points earlier,
but it's fine. No one listens to me.

481
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,052
Fine, OK. But someone
still has to go warn the dean.

482
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:27,569
- I'll go. I need the air.
- Not alone.

483
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:29,609
- I'll go.
- Me too.

484
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:32,366
- You sure you're up to it?
- Oh, leave that one.

485
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:37,163
He looks like he's ready to drop, and I think
I can eat someone if he's already dead.

486
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:41,166
- I'm up to it.
- I'll keep on looking for a solution.

487
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:45,007
Yeah. Guys, the dean's house
is up past the gym. And hurry!

488
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:46,492
Dinner's in an hour.

489
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:55,491
- Hey. When do I get fed?
- Later. I hope the others are OK.

490
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:58,485
Do you know what happens to vampires
who don't get to feed?

491
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,484
- I wondered that.
- Giles, plates.

492
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:05,283
Living skeletons, mate. Like famine pictures
from those dusty countries.

493
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:07,170
Only not half as funny.

494
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:11,246
- You can have gravy. That has blood in it.
- Do you know what else has blood in it?

495
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,812
Blood.

496
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:16,886
Do I have to gag you? Because I won't
listen to you whine all through my dinner.

497
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,043
It'll be a nice, quiet, civilised...

498
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:23,563
You!

499
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:27,965
Listen, maybe I wasn't clear about
how terrible we all feel. We're trying to help.

500
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:30,846
- What's goin' on?
- It isn't working.

501
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:33,049
You can have casinos now.

502
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:37,808
Get down!

503
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:40,487
What about me? You gonna
leave me here like this?

504
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:45,604
Hey! Watch the heart.

505
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:50,764
- That was a waste of time.
- I think he thought we were crazy.

506
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:54,641
If Anya hadn't opened the conversation
with "Everybody got both ears?"

507
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:56,963
I liked his wife. She gave me pie.

508
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:01,410
- So what do we do now?
- We could stay here and stand watch, or...

509
00:35:01,493 --> 00:35:03,051
Willow.

510
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:04,771
Angel?

511
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:08,163
So this is Angel.
He's large and glowery, isn't he?

512
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:12,050
- He's evil again.
- I'm not. Why does everyone think that?

513
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:15,762
- Angel's here to protect Buffy.
- I haven't been evil for a long time.

514
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:18,686
She's not supposed to know he's here.
Angel, any news?

515
00:35:18,773 --> 00:35:22,129
The Chumash weapons are missing
from the centre. Where's Buffy?

516
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:24,932
At Giles'. She sent us
to check on Dean Guerrero.

517
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:27,925
- Why the Dean?
- He may go after someone in charge.

518
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:29,651
- A leader?
- He's a warrior.

519
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:33,009
To a warrior, the leader means
the strongest fighter.

520
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:35,484
- Buffy.
- He's formed a raiding party.

521
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:38,371
- We gotta get over there.
- I'll call her. Get back fast.

522
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:40,444
Here. You guys can ride.

523
00:35:43,493 --> 00:35:44,721
Hello?

524
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:46,166
Yes.

525
00:35:46,253 --> 00:35:48,767
Yes, we're well aware of that. We're...

526
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:51,367
under siege now, actually. Thank you.

527
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:56,365
- Who was that?
- A... Someone. We need a plan.

528
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,603
Yes. Let's talk about it some more.

529
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:02,925
- Where's your weapons chest?
- Over there.

530
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:08,685
Buffy!

531
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:15,365
Remember that conquering nation thing?
Apologise.

532
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:17,523
- Shut up, Spike.
- Fine. I'll do it myself.

533
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:19,683
Hey, sorry. Sorry about that, chief.

534
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,329
How many?

535
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:25,165
The leader, upstairs.

536
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:29,292
Two by the living-room windows.
One through the window by the door.

537
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:31,170
- There's too many.
- We need help.

538
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:45,491
OK. One,

539
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,652
two,

540
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,086
three.

541
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:02,772
Stop them!

542
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:13,644
Enough!

543
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,883
Ow! Bloody hell!

544
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,608
- Giles, these guys, they don't die.
- Bit busy over here.

545
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:06,606
Why... won't... you die?

546
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:13,483
What's he like when he is evil?

547
00:38:33,973 --> 00:38:36,168
Help the others.

548
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:57,804
Your knife can kill you.

549
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:05,486
A bear! You made a bear.

550
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:08,690
- I didn't mean to.
- Undo it! Undo it!

551
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:28,568
Hey, Gentle Ben! Over here!

552
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:33,288
That's for giving me syphilis.

553
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,243
What happened? Did we win?

554
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:29,723
I feel lousy.

555
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:34,489
- Well, the turkey came out rather splendidly.
- Oh, it was yummy.

556
00:40:34,573 --> 00:40:37,133
It's just... Did you see me?

557
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:42,890
Two seconds of conflict with an indigenous
person and I turn into General Custer.

558
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:46,010
Violence does that.
You know, instinct takes over.

559
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,091
Yeah. That's the fun.

560
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:52,007
Nobody asked you.

561
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:55,608
Oh, lay off. You all had a fine meal.

562
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:57,684
But me?

563
00:40:57,773 --> 00:41:01,652
An entire siege. You'd think
one of you would bleed a little.

564
00:41:02,853 --> 00:41:05,651
Good work, Buffy. On both counts.

565
00:41:06,573 --> 00:41:10,282
- Thanks.
- Well, you know, you should be very pleased.

566
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:15,251
It wasn't exactly a perfect Thanksgiving.

567
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:18,967
I don't know. Seemed kinda right to me.

568
00:41:19,053 --> 00:41:22,443
A bunch of anticipation,
a big fight, and now we're all sleepy.

569
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:24,683
And we did all survive.

570
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:27,570
I guess that much is true.

571
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:30,372
First Thanksgiving on my own
and we all got through it.

572
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:34,890
And you know what?
I think my syphilis is clearin' right up.

573
00:41:35,573 --> 00:41:39,851
And they say romance is dead.
Or maybe they just wish it.

574
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:42,891
Well, maybe we started
a new tradition this year.

575
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:46,771
Maybe not.

576
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:50,562
But at least we all worked together.
It was like old times.

577
00:41:50,653 --> 00:41:53,850
Especially with Angel
bein' here and everything.

578
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:01,244
Oops.

579
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:06,810
