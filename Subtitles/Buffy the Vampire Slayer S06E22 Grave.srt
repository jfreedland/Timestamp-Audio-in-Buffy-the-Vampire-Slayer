1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,275
Get nice and comfy, Slayer.
I'll be back.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,391
Previously
on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,354
And you want to return
to your former self?

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,993
Bitch is gonna see a change.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,588
You think you can just do that to me?

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,513
- How did this happen?
- Warren, he had a gun.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,709
We need to find Willow.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,879
She's off the wagon big time.
Warren's a dead man if she finds him.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,271
Willow.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,278
- What about Warren?
- She killed him. The two of you are next.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,958
- Get in.
- Go.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,675
Willow, just stop for a second.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,909
- Is she coming?
- I don't see anything.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,036
I get it now. It's about the power.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,432
- Let's go.
- What about Willow?

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,710
- Buffy can handle her.
- Are you sure?

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,989
No. That's why we're leaving.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,398
And there's no one in the world
who has the power to stop me now.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,679
I'd like to test that theory.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,918
Giles?

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,519
Giles.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,788
- Daddy's home. I'm in wicked trouble now.
- You have no idea.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,278
You have to stop what you're doing.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,153
Sorry. Can't do that.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,510
I'm not finished yet.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,911
Neither am I. Stay down.

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,756
How'd you do that?

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,398
That's borrowed power.
No way is it gonna be strong enough...

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,476
I'm here to help you.

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,635
Thanks, but I can kill
a couple of geeks all by myself.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,752
But, hey, if you'd like to watch...

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,676
And that's what you watchers
are good at, right? Watching.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,793
Butting in on things that don't concern you.

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,070
You concern me, Willow.

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,509
Stay on this path and you'll wind up dead.

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,153
Willow, listen to him.
I don't wanna fight you any more.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,109
I don't wanna fight you either.
I wanna fight him.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,556
- Stay down.
- No.

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,110
Remember that little spat we had
before you left?

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,995
When you were under the delusion
that you were still relevant here?

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,795
You called me a rank, arrogant amateur.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,470
Well, buckle up, Rupert.

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,356
Cos I've turned pro.

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,393
Asmodea, bring forth...

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,479
No! Get off!

47
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,239
What did you do?

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,397
Contained her and her powers
within a binding field.

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,637
It puts her in a kind of stasis,
for the time...

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,036
You cut your hair.

51
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,110
I'm blonde.

52
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,353
I coloured my hair. Again.

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,598
I'm blonde.

54
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,438
Yes, I noticed.

55
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,795
I'm very sorry about Tara.

56
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,749
This... won't hold me... for ever.

57
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,434
I came as soon as I heard.

58
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,073
The Council?

59
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,079
The Council haven't a clue.
About much of anything, really.

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,198
No, there's an extremely
powerful coven in Devon.

61
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,156
They sensed the rise of a dangerous
magical force here in Sunnydale.

62
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,914
A dark force fuelled by grief.

63
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,953
Willow.

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,230
I'd so hoped it wasn't her.

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,758
And then a seer in the coven
told me about Tara.

66
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,679
That's when the coven
imbued me with their powers.

67
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,708
And sent you here to bring Willow down?

68
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,594
Buffy, what's happened here?

69
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,996
God, I don't even know where to start.

70
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,192
Well, Willow's clearly
been abusing the magics.

71
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,676
She has.

72
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,469
She was. And I barely even noticed.

73
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,553
Giles, everything's just been so...

74
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,913
Xander left Anya at the altar,
and Anya's a vengeance demon again.

75
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,750
Dawn's a total klepto.

76
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,118
Money's been so tight that
I've been slinging burgers...

77
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:31,195
at the Double Meat Palace, and...

78
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,040
and I've been sleeping with Spike.

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,917
Sorry.

80
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,476
Anya.

81
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,959
Willow?

82
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,789
I need you, Anya.
I need you to do something for me.

83
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,435
I know what you're trying to do.

84
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,395
But that mind-control mojo doesn't work on
vengeance demons, so why don't you just...

85
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
- Stop talking and listen.
- OK.

86
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,156
You need to free me.

87
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,354
No.

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,235
You don't wanna call out to them.
You wanna take away this binding spell.

89
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,033
- I don't know how.
- I do. Do you want me to tell you?

90
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,235
- Duct tape?
- On their mouth! So the demon, he said...

91
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,313
Because they were figments!

92
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,829
All of it. You, Sunnydale...
And I was just some nutcase in LA.

93
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,988
Of course. Why didn't we see it before?

94
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,756
Can you forgive me?

95
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,633
- For what?
- I should never have left.

96
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,549
No. You were right to leave.

97
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,076
We're just... stupid.

98
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,509
I know you're all stupid.

99
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,154
I should never have abandoned you.

100
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,111
No.

101
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,518
Giles, you were right about everything.
It is time I was an adult.

102
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,589
Sometimes the most adult thing you can do
is ask for help when you need it.

103
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,790
Nowyou tell me.

104
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,235
I guess... I wasn't ready before.

105
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,392
It took a long time for that feeling
to go away.

106
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,998
The feeling that I wasn't really here.

107
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,589
It was like...

108
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,838
when I climbed my way out of that grave,
I left something behind.

109
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,796
Part of me.

110
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,556
I just...

111
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,994
I don't understand why I'm back.

112
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,954
You have a calling.

113
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,437
But it was my time, Giles.
Someone would have taken my place.

114
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,390
So why?

115
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,392
Right.

116
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,435
What's gonna happen to Willow?

117
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,585
Well, the coven's working on a...

118
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:22,351
way to extract her powers without...
killing her.

119
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,514
And, should she survive...

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,711
You ought to know, Buffy, that there's
no guarantee she'll... be as she was.

121
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,670
Willow's killed a human being.

122
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,193
How will she be able to live with herself?

123
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,551
I wouldn't worry about that.

124
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,914
Willow doesn't live here any more.

125
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,709
Fool me once...

126
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,108
Willow.

127
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,073
Shame on you.

128
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,199
- Where are we going?
- I have no idea.

129
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,436
- What?
- I don't know, OK?

130
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,715
I can't even run away well.
That's something I'm usually good at.

131
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,977
Maybe we should go back and help.

132
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,231
Yeah, cos I've been such a big help already.

133
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,079
Standing around like a monkey
while Buffy gets shot.

134
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,829
Tara's dead, and Willow's... losing it.

135
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,158
Well, feeling sorry for yourself
isn't helping either, Xander, OK?

136
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,440
You know, if Spike were here,
he'd go back and fight.

137
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,393
Sure - if he wasn't too busy
trying to rape your sister.

138
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,669
What?

139
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,756
Forget it.

140
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,235
- I don't believe you.
- Fine.

141
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,113
He wouldn't do that.

142
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,993
Is this blind spot a genetic trait
with the Summers women?

143
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,795
The only useful thing Spike ever did
was finally leave town.

144
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,830
Well, that was a bloody doddle
and a piece of piss.

145
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,998
You got any more ruddy tests for me,
you ponce?

146
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,988
I'll take anything you can throw at me.

147
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,317
If it'll get me what I need
to take care of the Slayer.

148
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,635
Give her what's coming to her.

149
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,237
You just bring it on.
Bring on the whole...

150
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,196
Bloody hell.

151
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,193
That all you got, Jeeves?

152
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,920
Cos I could stand to go another ten rounds.

153
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,591
Whereas... you can barely stand.

154
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,271
Your powers may be undeniably greater,

155
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,632
but I can still hurt you if I have to.

156
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,197
Boy, you just don't get it, do you?
Nothing can hurt me now.

157
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,196
This...

158
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,716
is nothing.

159
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,875
It's all nothing.

160
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,596
I see.

161
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,595
If you lose someone you love,

162
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,111
then the other people in your life
who care about you

163
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,993
become meaningless.

164
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,429
I wonder what Tara would say about that.

165
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,879
You can ask her yourself.

166
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,555
You're always saving everyone.
It's kinda pesky.

167
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,157
You probably even think you're buying
escape time for Jonathan and the other one.

168
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,192
Well, I got a little secret for ya.

169
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,959
I can kill them from anywhere I want.

170
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,196
With this.

171
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,592
It'll find them. It'll bury them.

172
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,708
Along with anyone else
helping those dead men walking.

173
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,869
Don't.

174
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,982
Unless somebody, somehow,

175
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:24,712
can get there in time to save them.

176
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,235
Oh, well.

177
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,078
Fly, my pretty, fly.

178
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,159
- See what I did there?
- Go.

179
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,312
Good luck.

180
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,556
Thought she'd never leave.

181
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,795
Now I finally have you all to myself.

182
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,114
You're such a hypocrite.

183
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,028
Waltzing in here
with your borrowed magics...

184
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,234
So you could tell me what?

185
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:07,713
"Magic's bad. Behave. Be a good girl."

186
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,917
Well, I don't think you're in any position
to be telling me what to do.

187
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,598
Do you?

188
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,033
I used to think you had all the answers.

189
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,718
That I had so much to learn from you.

190
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,992
Willow.

191
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,428
You were jealous. Still are.

192
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,676
Just couldn't bear
that I was the one with power.

193
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,909
That's why you ran away.

194
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,268
That's why you...

195
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,875
That was rude.

196
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,676
Now I forgot what I was saying.

197
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,755
Perhaps you're not as strong as
you think you are.

198
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,677
You're expending way too much of your
mystical energies to maintain your powers.

199
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,354
At this rate you're going to
burn out and...

200
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,232
Blah, blah, blah.

201
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,353
Willow, you need to stop.

202
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,075
What I need is a little pick-me-up.

203
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,996
Head rush.

204
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,516
Who's your supplier?

205
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,874
This is...

206
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,356
It's incredible.

207
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,716
I'm so juiced.

208
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,638
Giles, it's like...

209
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,710
no mortal person has ever
had this much power - ever.

210
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,955
It's like I'm connected to everything.

211
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,356
I can feel...

212
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,836
It feels like...

213
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,916
I can feel...

214
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,271
everyone.

215
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,193
Oh, my God.

216
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,631
All the emotion and the pain.

217
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,075
No, it's too much.

218
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,036
It's just too much.

219
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,351
Willow.

220
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,835
It doesn't have to be like that.

221
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,036
You can stop it.

222
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,912
Yeah. I can.

223
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,196
I have to stop this.

224
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,716
I'll make it go away.

225
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,469
No.

226
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,915
You poor bastards.

227
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,190
Your suffering has to end.

228
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,999
No.

229
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,232
- Son of a bitch.
- Buttwipe.

230
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,193
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Oh. Reflex.

231
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,072
Man, they've really
tightened security up here.

232
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,475
One too many squatters from the Hellmouth.

233
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,633
Hide out in the cemetery -
what a fantastic idea.

234
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,593
I'm working on a "shut the hell up" pitch
you might like too.

235
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,436
Xander.

236
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,394
I've had just about as much as I can stand
babysitting a couple of social retards

237
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,636
- who don't appreciate...
- Xander.

238
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,399
- What?
- What is that?

239
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,436
Get out of there!

240
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,512
Move!

241
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,111
Dawn. Dawn.

242
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,596
Hold on.

243
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,036
Mexico, huh?

244
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,116
Giles.

245
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,909
Giles!

246
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,519
Anya.

247
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,270
I'm so sorry. Willow forced me to free her
with her brain. Are you OK?

248
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,235
I can see.

249
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,555
It's a... miracle.

250
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,875
Willow.

251
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,036
I can see her.

252
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,588
She took the magic I had and...

253
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,436
I know where she is.

254
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,436
I can feel what...

255
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,036
Oh, God.

256
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,879
Giles, you have to rest.

257
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,635
Silly girl. I'm dying.

258
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,630
No, you're not.

259
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,477
It was... it was the only way.

260
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,434
I thought we...
there'd be a chance, but now...

261
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,070
I know where Willow is.

262
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,830
She's going to finish it.

263
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,991
Finish what?

264
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,595
The world.

265
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,359
No!

266
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,072
Buffy!

267
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,114
- Are you OK?
- We have to get outta here.

268
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,152
- Xander!
- I think I saw him hit his head.

269
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,918
Xander!

270
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,511
This looks a little like Spike's place.
You know, under his crypt?

271
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,790
- What are you doing?
- If we can pull these out,

272
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,390
we can use the coffins for height
and maybe get outta here.

273
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,154
Maybe one of the tunnels Spike uses
is around here. We could get to his place.

274
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,319
That's the last place on earth
we need to be.

275
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,672
But it was good enough for you
to take me there after what he did to you?

276
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,712
- What he...?
- Tried to do. Whatever.

277
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,393
- Xander.
- So it's true.

278
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,990
Dawn, you may not have noticed,
we are in really big trouble here.

279
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,350
Why did you not tell me?

280
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,597
- Because you didn't need to know.
- Yes, I do.

281
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,029
I need to know. I'm not a kid any more.

282
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,833
- Dawn, I am trying to protect you.
- Well, you can't.

283
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,838
Look around, Buffy. We're trapped in here.

284
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,396
Willow's killing,
and people I love keep dying.

285
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,715
And you cannot protect me from that.

286
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,795
- Dawn...
- Hello?

287
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,875
Xander?

288
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,956
Buffy, are you OK?

289
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,196
- Where's Dawn?
- Here.

290
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,278
Are Jonathan and Andrew
up there with you?

291
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,588
No. They must've skedaddled
when I was out. Weasels.

292
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,076
Xander, you've gotta find a rope
or something and get us out of here.

293
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,838
Right.

294
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,918
OK, I'll... I'll take a look around.

295
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,996
And hurry up, before...

296
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,479
- Holy frijole.
- What are you doing here? Where's Giles?

297
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,272
- Giles?
- He's at the magic shop.

298
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,790
- Giles is back? You didn't tell me that.
- Did he stop Willow?

299
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,798
- No. And things just got a whole lot worse.
- How worse?

300
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,037
End-of-the-world worse.
Willow's going to destroy it.

301
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,639
She can do that?

302
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,990
She can and will
when she gets where she's going.

303
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,159
- Where is she going?
- Big old satanic temple. Kingman's Bluff?

304
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,795
There's no temple on Kingman's Bluff.

305
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,119
Proserpexa? Who's she?

306
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,356
Way up there in the hierarchy of she-demons.

307
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,393
Her followers intended to use
her effigy to destroy the world.

308
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,274
They all died when the temple got
swallowed up in the big earthquake of '32.

309
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,551
So now, 70 years later, Willow's
gonna make their dreams come true?

310
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,840
She's going to drain
the planet's life force,

311
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,992
and funnel its energy
through Proserpexa's effigy

312
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,111
and burn the earth to a cinder.

313
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,194
- Not if I can help it.
- You can't.

314
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,154
Something else Giles said -
no magic or supernatural force can stop her.

315
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,794
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

316
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,276
He said "The Slayer can't stop her",
then a bunch of other stuff.

317
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,516
He really wasn't too clear.

318
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,995
Anya, what do you...

319
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,078
I should get back to him. He's alone.

320
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,277
Is he OK?

321
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,358
I don't think he has a lot of time left.

322
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,476
I'm sorry.

323
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,954
Xander! Where is that rope?

324
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,036
- Buffy...
- Xander!

325
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,635
Where is he?

326
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,355
You heard what Anya said.
You heard what Giles said.

327
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,356
I heard, and I don't care. I have to try.

328
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,830
From the pit of forgotten shadows...

329
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,475
I'm not sitting here while Willow
incinerates what I'm chosen to protect.

330
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,478
- I have to stop her.
- Always the Slayer.

331
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,470
Right to the last.

332
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,557
- Willow?
- And it is the last, you know?

333
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,468
For all your fighting,
thinking you're saving the world.

334
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,116
Buffy?

335
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,516
And, in the end,
I'm the only one that can save it.

336
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,952
By killing us?

337
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,833
It's the only way to stop the pain.

338
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,070
I can't take it any more.

339
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,236
But I know you, Buffy.

340
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,909
You're a warrior.
You won't go out without a fight.

341
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,956
I don't really have time for one.

342
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,155
But you should go out fighting.

343
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,037
- Willow, what are you...
- It was me who took you out of the earth.

344
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,071
Well, now...

345
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,356
the earth wants you back.

346
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,632
Buffy!

347
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,635
They just keep coming. I can't take 'em all.

348
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,197
Dawn... Will you help me?

349
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,236
I got your back.

350
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,753
Proserpexa,

351
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,192
let the cleansing fires from the depths
burn away the suffering souls

352
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,356
and bring sweet death.

353
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,035
Willow.

354
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,034
Giles. Giles!

355
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,792
Don't die. Not yet.
There are things I wanna tell you.

356
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,591
Thanks a lot for coming.
It was good of you to teleport all this way.

357
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,835
Though in retrospect it probably
would've been better if you hadn't come

358
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,114
and given Willow all that magic that
made her, like, ten times more powerful.

359
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,359
That would've been a plus.

360
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,911
Hey, black-eyed girl. Whatcha doin'?

361
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,350
- Get out of here.
- Oh, no.

362
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,189
You're not the only one with powers.
You may be a hopped-up über-witch,

363
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,756
but this carpenter can dry-wall you
into the next century.

364
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,158
I'm not joking, Xander.
Get out of my way - now.

365
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,592
There.

366
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,072
What?

367
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,636
It's not over.

368
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,316
Dawn! I'm coming!

369
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,437
What? You think I never watched you?

370
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,357
You can't stop this.

371
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,556
Yeah. I get that.

372
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,313
It's just, where else am I gonna go?

373
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,670
You've been my best friend my whole life.

374
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,997
World gonna end,
where else would I wanna be?

375
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,031
Is this the master plan? You're gonna
stop me by telling me you love me?

376
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,354
I was gonna walk you off a cliff and hand
you an anvil, but it seemed kinda cartoony.

377
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,837
Still making jokes.

378
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,916
I'm not joking.

379
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,950
I know you're in pain.

380
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,435
I can't imagine the pain you're in.

381
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,950
I know you're about to do something
apocalyptically evil and stupid.

382
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,878
And, hey, I still wanna hang.

383
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,872
- You're Willow.
- Don't call me that.

384
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,437
The first day at kindergarten, you cried
because you broke the yellow crayon

385
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,074
and you were too afraid to tell anyone.

386
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,829
You've come pretty far.
Ending the world - not a terrific notion.

387
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,952
But the thing is... yeah, I love you.

388
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,836
I love crayon-breaky Willow
and I love scary, veiny Willow.

389
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,834
So if I'm goin' out, it's here.

390
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,470
If you wanna kill the world,
well, then start with me.

391
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,035
I've earned that.

392
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,277
- You think I won't?
- It doesn't matter.

393
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,118
- I'll still love you.
- Shut up.

394
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,918
I love you.

395
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,279
I... love you.

396
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,152
Shut up.

397
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,155
I love you, Willow.

398
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,236
Stop.

399
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,395
- I love you.
- Stop.

400
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,876
I love you.

401
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,276
What happened?

402
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,319
Giles.

403
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,396
- You're not dead!
- No.

404
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,599
However, I am still in some pain.

405
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,240
Well, why aren't you dead?

406
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,677
Why aren't I dead?

407
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,270
The threat's gone. Willow's been stopped.

408
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,195
- You mean she's...
- No, she's alive.

409
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,432
It... The magic she took from me,
it did what I hoped it would do.

410
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,518
You dosed her.
You knew she'd take your powers all along.

411
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,636
The gift that was given me by the coven
is the true essence of magic.

412
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,038
Willow's magic came from
a place of rage and power.

413
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,077
And vengeance. Don't forget vengeance.

414
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,918
How could I?

415
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,952
In any case, the magic she took from me

416
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,198
tapped into the spark of humanity
she had left.

417
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,790
Helped her to feel again.

418
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,718
Gave Xander the opportunity to reach her.

419
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,758
Xander?

420
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,913
Yes.

421
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,349
It was he who got to her in time.

422
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,116
He saved us all.

423
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,955
I think it's over, Buffy.

424
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,076
The world's still here.

425
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,589
Sorry to disappoint you.

426
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,597
Wait. Is... is that happy crying?

427
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,598
Yes, dummy.
You think I wanted the world to end?

428
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,711
I don't know.

429
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,796
Didn't you?

430
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,596
Dawn.

431
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,390
I'm so sorry.

432
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,958
I'm sorry.

433
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,310
It's OK, Buffy. It's OK.

434
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,550
No. It hasn't been.

435
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,875
It hasn't been OK.

436
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,237
But it's gonna be now. I see it.

437
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,916
See what?

438
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,236
You.

439
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,951
Things have really sucked lately.
That's all gonna change.

440
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,429
And I wanna be there when it does.

441
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,509
I wanna see my friends happy again.

442
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,194
I wanna see you grow up.

443
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,509
The woman you're gonna become.

444
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,834
Because she's gonna be beautiful.

445
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,189
And she's gonna be powerful.

446
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,070
I got it so wrong.

447
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,519
I don't wanna protect you from the world.

448
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,950
I wanna show it to you.

449
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,918
There's so much that I wanna show you.

450
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,475
You have endured the required trials.

451
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,676
Bloody right I have.

452
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,270
So you give me what I want.

453
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,154
Make me what I was
so Buffy can get what she deserves.

454
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,515
Very well.

455
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,393
We will return your soul.
