I'm Ben. We had
Algebra II together last year?

12
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:05,190
I'm sorry, I pretty much repress
anything math-related.

13
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:08,154
Ms. Jackson? Second period?

14
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:10,854
You sat in the seat three over
and one behind.

15
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,279
Oh! Yeah, I remember now.
It's the one with the

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,561
desks, and the chalkboards,
and pencils, and stuff, right?

17
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:18,854
- That's the one.
- Like a steel trap.

18
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:22,082
So, I was wonderin',
you know the dance tomorrow night?

19
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:24,657
- Are you goin'?
- You mean the Sadie Hawkins thing?

20
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:27,759
- The deal where the girls ask the boys?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:32,645
And I thought maybe, you know,
if you're free, you might ask me.

Oh, gosh...

- Oh, hey, hey, no. Don't, don't worry...

No! No, no, you seem
like a really great guy.

00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:41,980
It's... me, I...

26
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,047
I'm not seeing anybody.

27
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,557
- Ever again, actually.

Hey. You're bailin'?

36
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,321
Yeah. I'm gonna stop by the library
and see if Giles wants me to patrol,

37
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:29,276
and then... sack it.

38
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:32,806
You've been doing that a lot -
patrolling and sacking.

39
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:36,073
In fact, you've, kind of, been
"All work and no play Buffy".

40
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:40,244
I play. I have big fun.
I came here tonight, didn't I?

41
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,790
You came, you saw, you... rejected.

42
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,570
You mean that guy?
I'm just not in date mode right now.

43
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:52,204
Maybe you need to date
to get in date mode.

44
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,675
I don't think I'm ready for that, Will.

45
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,384
You're thinking too much.
Maybe you need to be impulsive.

46
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,162
Impulsive? Do you remember
my ex-boyfriend, the vampire?

47
00:03:02,163 --> 00:03:04,954
I slept with him, he lost his soul,
and now my boyfriend's gone for ever

48
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:07,474
and the demon that wears
his face is killing my friends.

49
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:10,439
The next impulsive decision I make
will involve my choice of dentures.

50
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:13,975
OK, the Angel thing went badly.
I'm on board with that.

51
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,692
But... that's not your fault.

52
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,325
And anyways,
love isn't always like that.

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,966
Love can be... nice.

54
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:26,039
Come back here! We're not finished!

55
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:28,339
You don't care any more, is that it?

56
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,487
It doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter what I feel!

57
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:33,314
Then tell me you don't love me.
Say it!

58
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,175
Will that help?
Is that what you need to hear?

59
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,194
I don't. I don't! Now, let me go.

60
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:44,184
No! A person doesn't just wake up one day
and stop loving somebody.

61
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:53,558

- What happened?!

68
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,255
You just went O.J. on your girlfriend.

69
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,848
This is nuts. I-I...
I don't know why I got so mad.

70
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:24,826

- He's not.

71
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:26,706
We weren't even fighting
a few minutes ago.

72
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:28,731
We weren't. I, I swear to God.

73
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:30,454
If you weren't fighting,
then why'd you have a gun?

74
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:34,260
I don't... I don't know.
I don't even know where I got it.

75
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,121
I don't see any gun.

76
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:46,317
I'm sure you know
why I asked you here.

77
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:50,122
- To thank me?
- That's right, I wanna thank you.

78
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:53,267
What would Sunnydale High do
without you around

79
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:56,005
to incite mayhem, chaos and disorder?

80
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,395
I don't incite! I stopped that boy
from killing his girlfriend.

81
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,220
Ask him. Ask the janitor.

82
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:03,088
People can be coerced, Summers.

83
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:06,561
I'm no stranger to conspiracy.
I saw "JFK".

84
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:10,763
I'm a truth seeker. I've got a missing gun
and two confused kids on my hands.

85
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:12,375
Pieces of the puzzle.

86
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:15,499
And I'm gonna look at all the pieces
carefully and rationally,

87
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:20,233
and I'm gonna keep looking until I know
exactly how this is all your fault.

88
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,358
Mr. Snyder, Billy Crandal chained himself
to the snack machine again.

89
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:27,706
Pathetic little no-life vegan.

90
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,702
Not so fast, missy.
I'm not done with you yet.

91
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:38,214
You stink of lies.

92
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:09,072
So, for next time read the chapters on
information grouping and binary coding.

93
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,390
I bet you'll think
coding is pretty cool. I mean...

94
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,892
if you find two-digit,
multi-stacked conversions

95
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:18,605
and primary-number clusters a big hoot!

96
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,658
Giles! I made them laugh. Did you hear?

97
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:29,239
- I did the joke thing!
- Yes, yes, so it seems.

98
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:34,386
I-I mean, um, uh, you did indeed.
Good, good, good show.

99
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:37,206
I-I-I just stopped by to, to
see if you needed any assistance,

100
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:41,546
but you... seem to have things
quite under control.

101
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,465
Well, I had... good lesson plans.

102
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,263
Ms. Calendar had them on her computer.

103
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,253
Yes, yes, she was very, um...

104
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:53,894
uh, dedicated.

105
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:57,182
And I found a bunch of
files and Internet sites

106
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:59,461
on paganism and magic, and stuff.

107
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:02,664
- Oh?
- Yes. It's really interesting.

108
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,230
And, uh...

109
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:09,279
I found this in her drawer.

110
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:14,316
She told me it was a rose quartz.
And it has healing powers.

111
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,986
I thought she'd want you to have it.

112
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,372
Oh, thank you, Willow, that's, um...

113
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,597
that's very thoughtful of you.

114
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:46,676
Before 1935, the New Deal focused on
revitalizing stricken business

115
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:48,594
and agricultural communities.

116
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,470
The New Deal also tried to regulate
the nation's financial hierarchy

117
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:57,556
to avoid another disaster
like the 1929 stock market crash.

118
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:01,329
Don't forget your assignments
are due on Friday, class.

119
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,450
I told Miss Hall we'd go help
decorate the gym. Who are you taking?

120
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:10,348
- David said yes.
- Oh, you're kidding! He's so dreamy!

121
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:13,564
Thank you.

122
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:21,453
Thank you, James. How are you enjoying
that... book I loaned you?

123
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:24,355
- The Hemingway.
- I like it.

124
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,042
Very much.

125
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:30,504
It's honest.

126
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,365
Yes, it's, um...

127
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,692
it's based on a true story, actually.

128
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,185
He fell in love with his...

129
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,152
...hours...

130
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:48,618
child... labor...

131
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:53,423
and... collective bargaining.

132
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:55,636
<b><u>DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME BITCH!</u></b>

133
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:58,906

134
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,653
I'm telling you,
something weird is going on.

135
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:10,057
"Something weird is going on" -
isn't that our school motto?

136
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:14,359
Pretty much. But I don't know.
This time... it bugs me.

137
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:18,187
I don't wanna pooh-pooh your wiggins,
but a... domestic dispute,

138
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:20,468
a little case of chalkboard Tourette's?

139
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:23,174
All sounds like Hellmouth Lite to me.

140
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:50,331
Xander, what happened?

141
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:53,309
Did Cordelia win another round
in the broom closet?

142
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:56,462
You're just a big bucket of funny, Will!

143
00:10:56,497 --> 00:11:00,215
I'll have you know I was just
accosted by some kind of, um...

144
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:02,037
locker monster.

145
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:04,650
- Loch Ness Monster?
- 'Locker' monster is what he said.

146
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:07,596
But it wasn't really a monster. It was
this big arm that came out of the locker.

147
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:09,684
But then we opened it again,
it was gone. Nothing.

148
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:12,026
This was right after Buffy's
history teacher starts doing some

149
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:13,839
freaky channeling thing in class.

150
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,946
Ooh! Sounds like paranormal phenomena.

151
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,354
- A ghost? Cool!
- Oh, no, no. No. No cool.

152
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,178
This was no wimpy chain rattler.

153
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:24,735
This was: "I'm dead as hell,
and I'm not gonna take it any more."

154
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,524
Well, despite the
Xander-speak, that's a...

155
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:29,067
fairly accurate definition of a...
poltergeist

156
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:32,426
I defined something? Accurately?

157
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:38,385
- Guess I'm done with the book learning.
- So we have some bad boo on our hands?

158
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,829
- Yes.
- Well, why is it here?

159
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,460
Does it just wanna scare people?

160
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:45,918
Unfortunately, it doesn't know exactly
what it wants. That's, that's the trouble.

161
00:11:45,953 --> 00:11:50,098
See, many times the spirit is plagued
by all manner of worldly troubles,

162
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:53,360
only being dead, it has no way to...
to make its peace.

163
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:58,549
So, it lashes out, growing ever more...
confused, ever more...

164
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,302
- angry.
- So it's a normal teenager. Only dead.

165
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,140
What can we do?
Is there any way to stop it?

166
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:06,943
The only tried and true way is to...

167
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:10,245
work out what unresolved...
issues keep it here...

168
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,735
and-and-and, um... resolve them.

169
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,642
Fabulous! Now,
we're Dr Laura for the deceased.

170
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:18,583
Only if we can find out
who the spirit is.

171
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,933
Or was.

172
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,282
- Working late, Ms. Frank?
- My fault. Let myself get behind.

173
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:38,878
Is it OK to walk here, George?
It is George, right?

174
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:41,755
- Yes, ma'am. Go ahead.
- Thanks. Have a nice evening.

175
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,663
- You, too. Drive safe. Oh, Ms. Frank?
- Yes?

176
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,915
You can't make me disappear
just because you say it's over.

177
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,792
There's no way we can be together.

178
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,248
No way people will ever understand.
Accept it.

179
00:12:57,283 --> 00:13:00,409
Is that what this is about?
What other people think?

180
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:05,407
No! I just want you to be able
to have some kind of a normal life.

181
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:09,865
- We can never have that. Don't you see?
- I don't give a damn about a normal life.

182
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,915
I'm going crazy not seeing you.

183
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:16,482
- I think about you every minute.
- I know... but...

184
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:21,038
But it's over.

185
00:13:21,073 --> 00:13:23,485
It has to be.

186
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,372
Come back here! We're not finished yet!

187
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:30,063
- You don't care any more? Is that it?
- It doesn't matter.

188
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:33,494
- It doesn't matter what I feel.
- Then tell me you don't love me.

189
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,488
Say it!

190
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,847
Will that help?

191
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:42,256
Is that what you have to hear?

192
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:47,123
I don't. I don't!

193
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,342
- Now let me go.
- No.

194
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:54,032
A person doesn't just wake up one day
and stop loving somebody.

195
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,503
Love is forever.

196
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:08,108
I'm not afraid to use it.
If I can't be with you...

197
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,192
Don't walk away from me, bitch!

198
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:23,680
I need you.

199
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:29,630
Jenny.

200
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:39,616
Don't! Don't do that, dammit!
Don't talk to me like I'm some dumb...

201
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:04,822
- What's going on?
- What's going on?!

202
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:07,734
You just shot a woman.

203
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:15,340
And this...

204
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,364
This is the garden.

205
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,295
Wow!

206
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,557
Look. Jasmine.

207
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:27,710
- Night-blooming.
- Like us.

208
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:33,115
Oh, Angel... it's fairyland.

209
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,866
It's paradise.

210
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,328
Big windows, lovely gardens.

211
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:43,393
It'll be perfect
when we want the sunlight to kill us.

212
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:46,739
If you don't like it, Spike,
hit the stairs and go.

213
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,470
Take a stand, man.

214
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:53,401
Well, our old place was just fine
till you went and had it burned down.

215
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:57,235
Things change, Spikey.
You gotta roll with the punches.

216
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,511
Well, actually, you pretty much
got that part down, haven't you?

217
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:03,509
Very funny, mate.

218
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:06,716
What can I say?

219
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:10,400
I just love to see you smile, buddy!

220
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:16,094
Yeah... you're a giver.

221
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:19,812
It was just as with the, the couple
you encountered the other night, Buffy.

222
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,016
The, the janitor remembered everything.

223
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:25,592
He, he knew he'd killed this poor woman,
but he had no idea why.

224
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,740
Well, they-they had no...
intimate relationship.

225
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:32,484
- What about the gun? Did you find it?
- No. No.

226
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,468
No, the police, everybody,
we-we-we-we searched high and low.

227
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,914
I think it's very clear
what's happening here.

228
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:40,342
Fill me in, then.
'Cause I've read the book,

229
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:42,776
seen the movie, and I'm still fuzzy
about what's going on.

230
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:44,928
It's Jenny.

231
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:48,244
- What?
- You think she's the ghost?

232
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,177
Well, don't you see?
Well, she-she-she died here

233
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,589
under tragic circumstances,
a-a-and now she's trapped.

234
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:59,735
But... what about the gun?
I mean, Angel didn't shoot Ms Calendar.

235
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,668
The gun is insignificant. It's the
violence of the thing that matters.

236
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:08,792
I don't know. These fights these couples
keep having, it's sort of... specific.

237
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,807
She's right. It's a pattern that doesn't
fit with the way Ms. Calendar died.

238
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:15,742
Yes, well, I, uh, I... appreciate
your thoughts on the matter.

239
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,360
I, in fact I... well, I encourage you
to, to always, uh...

240
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,668
challenge me, uh,
when you feel it's appropriate.

241
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:24,557
You should never be
cowed by authority.

242
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:26,390
Except of course in this instance,
when I am clearly right

243
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:28,188
and you are clearly wrong.

244
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,823
This is freaky. I don't remember
ever seeing Giles be this weird.

245
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:37,489
I know. He's usually "Investigate-Things-
From-Every-Boring-Angle" guy.

246
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,899
Now he's "I-Cling-Onto-My-One-
Lame-Idea" guy. What gives?

247
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,183
He misses her. He can't think.

248
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:46,815
Just a little more fallout
from my love life.

249
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,785
OK, but this ghost stuff
is something else.

250
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,783
Let me do a crosscheck
on other shootings at the school.

251
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:55,657
Yeah, we need some alternate
ghost theories. What do we know?

252
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:57,582
Dog's spit is cleaner than human.

253
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:01,417
- Besides that?
- Oh, boy! We know plenty.

254
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:05,716
It says a student murdered a teacher
on the night of the Sadie Hawkins Dance.

255
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,189
The rumor was they were having an affair,
and she tried to break it off.

256
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:13,600
After he killed her, he went into
the music room and shot himself.

257
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:17,304
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a ghost.
It is one of those two, right?

258
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:20,172
It all fits: the gun,
the Sadie Hawkins Dance.

259
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:22,171
- Which is tonight.
- How come we've never heard about

260
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:24,577
this murder-suicide thing before?
When did it happen?

261
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:26,968
1955.

262
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:29,567
How did you know?

263
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:31,904
OK, here's the new strangeness.

264
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:35,154
I dreamt about this woman,
Grace Newman, the other day.

265
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:37,969
- Her and this guy.
- James Stanley?

266
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,789
He's the one! He did it!

267
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:42,124
Your dreams are getting
wicked accurate, Buff.

268
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:45,280
You wouldn't happen to see me
coming across some big cash?

269
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:49,519
Or possibly knowing the love of a woman?
In a full body sense?

270
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:54,220
He couldn't make her love him,
so he killed her. Sicko.

271
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:59,038
He looks so normal on this picture.
He was smart, too. He made the honor roll.

272
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:02,056
- Smart?
- He killed a person and killed himself.

273
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:05,361
Those are pretty much two of the
dumbest things you could do.

274
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:09,934
I know, but...
Well, don't you feel kind of bad for them?

275
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:13,499
Sure I feel lousy. For her.
He's a murderer and should pay for it.

276
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:15,919
- With his life?
- No, he should be doing

277
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,957
60 years in a prison, breaking rocks

278
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:20,243
and making special friends
with Roscoe the weightlifter.

279
00:19:20,278 --> 00:19:23,813
Yikes! The quality of mercy is not Buffy.

280
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:26,656
Whose ghost do you think
we're dealing with? His or hers?

281
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:30,192
Well, considering how violent it is,
I'm gonna say his.

282
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:31,789
That tracks.

283
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:35,204
Well, I've been browsing on
some of Ms. Calendar's pagan sites.

284
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:38,174
Maybe I can find a way
to communicate with him, and...

285
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:40,086
we can find out what he wants.

286
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:42,110
Who cares what he wants?

287
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:44,378
We need to shut him down
before some other innocent guy

288
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:46,115
goes and kills some poor nice girl

289
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,448
and then blows his brains out
all over the music room wall.

290
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,629
OK!

291
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,590
Who's hungry?

292
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,457
Next, please. Move along.

293
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,916
I hope you, guys, aren't going
to the Sadie Hawkins Dance tonight,

294
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,581
'cause I'm organizing a boycott.

295
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:10,899
Do you realize that the girls have to ask
the guys? And pay and everything?

296
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,952
I mean, whose genius idea was that?

297
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:15,412
Obviously some hairy-legged feminist.

298
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,971
Really? Well, we need to
nip this thing in the bud.

299
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:21,034
I mean, otherwise,
things are going to get really scary.

300
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,131
They're everywhere!

301
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:59,406
Perfect. I'm gonna be scarred and swollen.
Why didn't they just kill me?

302
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:04,508
- Schoolboy pranks?
- Never sell.

303
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,047
The sewer got backed up.

304
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:09,057
Better. I can probably make that one fly.
But this is getting out of hand.

305
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:11,616
- People will talk.
- You'll take care of it.

306
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:14,547
I'm doing everything I can,
but you people have to realize...

307
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:17,102
- Snyder, what's going on here?
- Backed-up sewer line!

308
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:20,527
Same thing happened
in San Diego just last week!

309
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,229
We're on a Hellmouth.

310
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:27,059
Sooner or later...
people are gonna figure that out.

311
00:21:27,094 --> 00:21:29,860
The city council was told
you could handle this job.

312
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:32,722
If you feel that you can't,
perhaps you'd like to take that up...

313
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:35,445
with the Mayor.

314
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,715
I'll handle it.

315
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,272
I will.

316
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:43,938
Remember the plan to contact the spirit
and talk to it? Scrap that plan.

317
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:47,787
Buffy, you were right. The time for
touchy-feely communication has passed.

318
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:52,443
I've done some homework and found out
the only solution is the final solution.

319
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,413
Nuke the school?

320
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:59,786
- I like that.
- Not quite. Exorcism.

321
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:03,580
Are you crazy? I saw that movie.
Even the priest died!

322
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:07,802
- What's the deal?
- OK. See here, the balcony?

323
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:12,858
That's where the original teacher died
back in 1955, and that teacher last night.

324
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:16,200
That's the hot spot where
all the bad mojo is coming from.

325
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:19,989
- We need to create a Mangus tripod.
- A what?

326
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:23,314
One person chants here on the hot spot.

327
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:28,079
And the other three chant in other places
around the school, forming a triangle.

328
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,739
It's supposed to bind the bad spirit
and keep it from doing any more harm.

329
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:37,823
Well, I'll take the hot spot.
If there's trouble, that's where it'll be.

330
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:42,303
This ghost, this James guy, is fixating
on you, Buffy. The dreams, the yearbook...

331
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,479
You sure you can handle it?

332
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:49,208
Well, I'm hoping he'll show. I truly am.

333
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:56,271
OK, we have our places. We do the chant
and light candles at midnight exactly.

334
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:58,137
- Any questions?
- Yeah. What if this

335
00:22:58,172 --> 00:23:00,739
mangled triangle thingy doesn't work?

336
00:23:00,774 --> 00:23:03,886
Oh! I almost forgot!
I made us all scapulars.

337
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:07,804
OK. So we can flip the ghost over
when it turns a nice golden brown?

338
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,135
Scapular, not spatula!

339
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:13,801
Um... you wear it around your neck
for protection.

340
00:23:13,836 --> 00:23:16,550
You expect me to wear this?
It smells like grandpa breath.

341
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:19,198
Sorry. I didn't have a lot of time.
I had to use sulphur.

342
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:22,878
- Stinky, but effective.
- OK, let's do this.

343
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:28,888
No problem.
This will be a piece of cake, right?

344
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:46,167
Maybe I'll sleep underground.

345
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,699
Dig myself a little burrow.

346
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:52,919
What about your pretty dress, sweet?
It'll get all dirty.

347
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:55,802
Then I'll sleep naked.
Like the animals do.

348
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:58,463
You know?
I'm suddenly likin' this plan.

349
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:02,037
Fortunately, nobody cares
what you like... mate.

350
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:05,438
Oh, yeah? Let's ask Dru.

351
00:24:05,473 --> 00:24:08,184
There's a gate!

352
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:11,881
- It's opening!
- Incoming! I love when she does this.

353
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:16,613
- What gate, pet? What do you see?
- It's black.

354
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:20,055
It wants her.

355
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:24,395
- Wants who?
- The Slayer.

356
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,896
It's time, Angel.

357
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:32,311
She's ready for you now.
She's... dancing.

358
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:36,712
- Dancing with death.
- Big deal. He won't do anything.

359
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:40,298
Our man Angel here likes to talk,
but he's not much for action.

360
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:42,990
All hat and no cattle.

361
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:46,498
I don't know about that.

362
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:50,044
I think this whole Slayer thing
has run its course.

363
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:53,782
I'm ready to focus my energy elsewhere.

364
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,408
- Really?
- Oh, yeah!

365
00:24:57,443 --> 00:24:59,721
What, with you being Special Needs Boy,

366
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:03,084
I figure I should stick close to home.

367
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,995
You and Dru can always use
another pair of hands.

368
00:25:22,743 --> 00:25:26,255
God, Willow, what are you doing here?

369
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:29,369
- You're not supposed to be inside.
- Me? What about you?!

370
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:33,191
I'm, uh, I'm, I'm trying to, uh...

371
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:38,102
I think I-I may be close to, uh...
contacting Jenny.

372
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:43,289
- What's that smell?
- It's my scapular.

373
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:45,724
- Ah, right. Did you use sulphur?
- Yeah.

374
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,727
That's clever.
Uh, well, uh... run along then.

375
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:52,773
Th-there may be some, uh, paranormal
ph-phenomena if I contact her.

376
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:56,140
Y-y-you don't want to be
in the line of fire.

377
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:59,811
OK. Night.

378
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:32,187

Giles! Giles!

- Where are you?!
- Please!

390
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:11,620
Help! Help me!

00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,769

00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:46,947
Get out!

393
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:57,165
- Are you all right?
- Giles...

394
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,161
Jenny could never be this mean.

395
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,014
I know.

396
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:07,894
It's... it's not her, is it?

397
00:29:08,394 --> 00:29:10,229
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:11,689 --> 00:29:14,400
Oh, God. Oh!

399
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:16,986
Careful up here!

400
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:30,201
I shall confront and expel all evil...

401
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:33,841
I shall totally
confront and expel all evil...

402
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:35,957
out of marrow and bone...

403
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:40,044
out of house and home -
never to come here again.

404
00:30:10,198 --> 00:30:13,159
Oh, my God!

405
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:18,228
You all right?

406
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,818
Get back!

407
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:35,792
Check it. I'd say school's out for good.

408
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:47,819
The good news is...
none of you girls were shot.

409
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:51,056
We've, we've established,
based on all the parallels

410
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,072
and-and-and... Buffy's visions that...

411
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:57,073
- it's James' spirit.
- So what do we do, Giles? About James.

412
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:59,925
Well, he's obviously reliving
the night of the Sadie Hawkins Dance

413
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:02,792
when he killed Ms. Newman.
It's, it's common enough for a spirit

414
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:06,255
to do this - to... recreate a, a tragedy.

415
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,882
Hey! If Sunnydale High School
shuts down forever,

416
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:11,315
do we automatically graduate?

417
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,777
But why? What does he want?

418
00:31:13,812 --> 00:31:17,563
- Actually, that's an interesting point.
- He's, he's trying to...

419
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:20,313
resolve whatever issues
are keeping him in limbo.

420
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:24,055
- W-w-what exactly those are, I'm not...
- He wants forgiveness.

421
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:28,969
Yes... Yes, I imagine he does!

422
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,587
But when... James possesses people,

423
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:36,050
they act out exactly
what happened that night.

424
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:40,201
So he's experiencing
a form of... purgatory instead.

425
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:43,157
I mean, he's doomed to,
to kill his Miss Newman

426
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:46,336
over and over and over again, and...

427
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:52,147
- forgiveness is impossible.
- Good. He doesn't deserve it.

428
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:56,846
To forgive is
an act of compassion, Buffy.

429
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:59,707
It's, it's not done
because people deserve it.

430
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:02,410
- It's done because they need it.
- No.

431
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:05,098
James destroyed
the one person he loved the most

432
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:07,069
in a moment of blind passion...

433
00:32:07,104 --> 00:32:11,309
And that's not something you forgive -
no matter why he did what he did.

434
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:14,974
And no matter if he knows now
that it was wrong and selfish and stupid,

435
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:18,739
it is just something
he's gonna have to live with.

436
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,418
He can't live with it, Buff.

437
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:26,751
He's dead.

438
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:37,831
OK. Overidentify much?

439
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:57,206
I need you.

440
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:09,178
So what do we do next?
Do we go in again?

441
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,893
Uh, not now. No, the, uh...

442
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:17,629
The spirit is too... angry,
too, too powerful.

443
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:20,457
No, we have to work out...

444
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:25,492
exactly how and, and if this...
thing can be defeated.

445
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:59,803
Hey, Buffy, are you...?

446
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,283
Oh, God... Giles!

447
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:08,750
She went back.

448
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:15,927
So, what now? Not even a mega-vat
of Raid's gonna do the trick here.

449
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:19,408
I don't get it. Is she trying to be
a big loner hero or something?

450
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:22,376
No. I believe
she's under the spirit's thrall.

451
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:24,112
He's, he's calling her.

452
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,927
But why?

453
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:27,923
James needs her to re-enact
everything that happened

454
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,882
on the night that he...
he killed Ms. Newman.

455
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:33,233
He wants to change things,
make... make a happy ending.

456
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:36,107
But it can't ever happen!
It always ends the same,

457
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:39,559
which means Buffy just went in there
to get shot, Giles!

458
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:41,693
Yes.

459
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,820
But the school's deserted.

460
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:47,485
There's no way for James to...

461
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,389
to play his part. There's, there's
no man inside for him to possess.

462
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,626
So Buffy should be safe
until we find a way to get her out.

463
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:57,332
In theory, yeah.

464
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,291
Fun fact about wasps.

465
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:30,238
They have no taste for the undead.

466
00:35:30,273 --> 00:35:35,722
Hey, not that a sting would do me
any damage. It's just... tonight's special.

467
00:35:36,164 --> 00:35:39,325
I wanted to look my best for you.

468
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,599
You're the only one.

469
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:44,652
The only person I can talk to.

470
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:49,198
Gosh, Buff. That's really pathetic.

471
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:54,082
You can't make me disappear
just because you say it's over.

472
00:35:54,307 --> 00:35:58,273
Actually... I can.

473
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:01,985
In fact...

474
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:09,203
I just want you to be able to have
some kind of normal life.

475
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:11,113
We can never have that, don't you see?

476
00:36:11,148 --> 00:36:16,875
I don't give a DAMN about a normal life!
I'm going crazy not seeing you.

477
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:20,533
I think about you every minute.

478
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:23,808
I know.

479
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:29,301
But it's over. It has to be!

480
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:33,513
Come back here! We're not finished!

481
00:36:33,514 --> 00:36:35,530
You don't care any more? Is that it?

482
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:37,475
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter what I feel!

483
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,978
Then tell me you don't love me!

484
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:42,853
Say it!

485
00:36:42,888 --> 00:36:46,930
Is that what you need to hear?
Will that help?

486
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:51,049
I don't.

487
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:54,977
- I don't. Now let me go.
- No!

488
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:59,522
A person doesn't just wake up
and stop loving somebody!

489
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:06,234
Love is forever.

490
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:11,039
I'm not afraid to use it, I swear!

491
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:13,670
If I can't be with you...

492
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:16,240
Oh, my God!

493
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,734
- Don't walk away from me...
- bitch!

494
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,588
Stop it!

495
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:26,675
Stop it! Don't make me!

496
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,950
All right. Just...

497
00:37:34,407 --> 00:37:37,254
You know you don't wanna do this.

498
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:40,372
Let's both...

499
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,942
just calm down.

500
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:47,173
Now give me the gun.

501
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:51,714
Don't! Don't do that, dammit!

502
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:55,041
Don't talk to me like I'm some stupid...

503
00:38:04,637 --> 00:38:06,921
James.

504
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:33,777
<i># My love must be a kind of blind love</i>

505
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:40,340
<i># I can't see anyone but you</i>

506
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:53,430
- Grace!
- Don't do this.

507
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:55,326
But... but I killed you.

508
00:39:55,361 --> 00:39:57,649
It was an accident.
It wasn't your fault.

509
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:00,248
- It is my fault. How could I...
- Hush.

510
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:03,135
I'm the one who should be sorry, James.

511
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,091
You thought I stopped loving you...

512
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:08,562
But I never did.

513
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:12,256
I loved you with my last breath.

514
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:16,675
Shh... No more tears.

515
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:59,904
Angel.

516
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:18,524
Everything seems normal.
Not a snake, not a wasp.

517
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,773
Yep. School can open again tomorrow.

518
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:24,240
Explain to me again
how that's a good thing.

519
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:27,070
I'm drawing a blank.

520
00:41:35,607 --> 00:41:40,440
- Are you feeling any better?
- James picked me.

521
00:41:41,863 --> 00:41:44,073
I guess...

522
00:41:44,365 --> 00:41:48,089
I guess I was the one
he could relate to.

523
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,753
He was so sad.

524
00:41:55,427 --> 00:41:57,396
Well...

525
00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:01,570
They can both rest now.

526
00:42:01,571 --> 00:42:03,752
I still...

527
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:09,427
Part of me just doesn't understand
why she would forgive him.

528
00:42:11,638 --> 00:42:14,511
Does it matter?

529
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,296
No.

530
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:21,058
I guess not.

531
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:30,375
You might want to let up.

532
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:33,503
They say when you've drawn blood,
you've exfoliated.

533
00:42:33,504 --> 00:42:35,194
What do you know about it?

534
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:38,826
I'm the one who was freakin' violated.
You didn't have this thing in you.

535
00:42:38,861 --> 00:42:41,589
What was it? A demon?

536
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:43,841
Love!

537
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:45,865
Poor Angel.

538
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:51,036
Let's get out of here.
I need a real vile kill before sunup

539
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:53,637
to wipe this crap out of my system.

540
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:58,361
Of course.
We'll find you a nice toddler.

541
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:01,853
Want to come, pet?

542
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:07,440
No can do, Dru.
I'm sure he'd be hell on wheels,

543
00:43:07,475 --> 00:43:11,543
but we don't have much time.
Gotta travel light.

544
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:16,582
Sorry. Try to have fun without me.

545
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:28,723
Oh, I will.

546
00:43:43,726 --> 00:43:46,181
Sooner than you think.
