1
00:00:02,653 --> 00:00:05,804
So this is what it is.
We're talking about communication.

2
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:09,283
We're talking about language.
Not the same thing.

3
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:14,891
It's about inspiration. Not the idea, but
the moment before the idea when it's total.

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,806
When it blossoms in your mind
and connects to everything.

5
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:22,523
It's about the thoughts and experiences
that we don't have a word for.

6
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:25,446
A demonstration. Buffy Summers.

7
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,887
Come on down to the front here.

8
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:38,486
A typical college girl, one assumes.

9
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,848
Lie down on my desk.

10
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,731
- What?
- Go ahead, you're perfectly safe.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:57,289
Riley, if you could oblige.

13
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:03,412
- A demonstration, right?
- Be a good boy.

14
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:19,047
This feels very strange.

15
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,762
Don't worry. If I kiss you,
it'll make the sun go down.

16
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:53,364
See?

17
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:58,044
Fortune favours the brave.

18
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,808
Do you hear that?

19
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:12,723
 Can't even shout, can't even cry

20
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:16,408
 The Gentlemen are coming by

21
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:19,724
 Looking in windows, knocking on doors

22
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:23,010
 They need to take seven
and they might take yours

23
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:27,003
 Can't call to Mom, can't say a word

24
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:30,722
 You're gonna die screaming
but you won't be heard

25
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,370
So I'll see you all Monday
for a final review session.

26
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:39,923
Man, that was an exciting class, huh?

27
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:43,972
- Oh, yeah, well...
- And the last 20 minutes was a revelation.

28
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:46,931
Just laid out everything
we need to know for the final.

29
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:50,722
- I'd hate to have missed that.
- Just tell me I didn't snore.

30
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:53,805
- Very discreet. Minimal drool.
- Oh, yay.

31
00:02:56,213 --> 00:03:00,365
- So were you dreaming?
- Yeah. And it was kind of intense.

32
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:05,208
Intense? Really?
Cos you seemed so peaceful.

33
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:09,809
- Of course, it was only for a moment.
- Right. You guys headed over toward Judd?

34
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:12,487
- Student centre.
- Oh, great. So this dream...

35
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:16,248
You know, you guys go.
I'm gonna do the thing.

36
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,609
- So I'll see you after Wicca group.
- OK. Bye.

37
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:21,524
Bye.

38
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:27,245
So tell me about your dream.
As a psych major, I'm qualified to go "hm".

39
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,483
I don't really remember it.

40
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:32,565
Well, did I appear at all in this dream?

41
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:36,372
- There might have been a cameo.
- Is that right?

42
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:38,683
Maybe more like a featured role.

43
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:41,845
- Romantically?
- I'm not saying a word.

44
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:45,531
- So what have you got goin' on tonight?
- Patrolling.

45
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,764
- Patrolling?
- Petroleum.

46
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,650
Petroleum?

47
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,088
Tonight you have crude oil?

48
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:55,164
And homework.

49
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:58,643
What about you?

50
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,293
You know, grading papers.

51
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:05,366
- That'll be fun.
- Not petroleum fun, but it passes the time.

52
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:10,010
- So I...
- Yeah.

53
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:14,922
I guess I won't see you until...

54
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:17,531
Yeah.

55
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:24,488
- What papers?
- Papers?

56
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:30,532
Grading what papers? We only have the final.

57
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,332
Yeah...

58
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:36,246
No, I... Late papers I gotta look at.

59
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,322
OK. Neat.

60
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,887
- So...
- Class.

61
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:46,764
- I'll see you then.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,284
Fortune favours the brave.

63
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:51,128
"Can't even shout, can't even cry.
The Gentlemen are coming by."

64
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:56,241
It sounds vaguely familiar. You're sure it's
nothing you heard when you were a child?

65
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,722
All right. Nothing else?

66
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:04,291
Well, it could definitely be
one of your prophetic dreams,

67
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:07,604
or it could just be
the eternal mystery that is your brain.

68
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:11,288
I'll check it out
and I'll let you know if I find something.

69
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,364
All right. Bye-bye.

70
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:19,565
- You heard of a group called the Gentlemen?
- Group of what?

71
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:21,644
- The Gentlemen.
- Don't know.

72
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:24,725
- You certain?
- No. We're out of Weetabix.

73
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,486
We are out of Weetabix because you ate it all.

74
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:31,007
- Again.
- Get some more.

75
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:34,403
I thought vampires
were supposed to eat blood.

76
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:38,452
Yeah, well, sometimes I like to
crumble up the Weetabix in the blood.

77
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,524
Gives it a little texture.

78
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:46,608
Since the picture you just painted means that
I will never touch food of any kind again,

79
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:50,003
- you'll just have to pick it up yourself.
- Sissy.

80
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:53,764
- Where is this coming from?
- What am I supposed to think?

81
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:57,812
- How could you say I'm using you?
- You don't care about what I think.

82
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:00,566
- You don't ask about my day.
- You did turn into a real girl.

83
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:05,124
See? And you make jokes during my pain.
You don't care about me at all.

84
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:07,602
- I care about you.
- How much?

85
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,684
- What do I mean to you?
- I...

86
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:18,723
We, you know, we spend...
We'll talk about it later.

87
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:22,723
- I think we should talk about it now.
- Thank you for knocking.

88
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:25,327
- If you don't know how I feel about...
- I don't.

89
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:30,806
This isn't a relationship. You don't need me.
All you care about is lots of orgasms.

90
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:37,452
OK. Remember how we talked
about private conversations?

91
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,967
How they're less private
in front of my friends?

92
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,971
- We're not your friends. Go on.
- Please don't.

93
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:45,123
- This is important.
- But why is it here?

94
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,602
Mom said you wanted me to swing by.

95
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:53,370
Oh, yes. Well, I meant after sunset.
I need you to take Spike for a few days.

96
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:54,488
- What?
- What?

97
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:56,803
- What?
- I'm not staying with him.

98
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,363
I've a friend who's coming to town,
and I'd like us to be alone.

99
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:02,125
You mean an orgasm friend?

100
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:05,842
Yes, that's exactly the most
appalling thing you could have said.

101
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:09,608
- If he stays with me, he'll get tied up.
- What about our romantic evening?

102
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:12,082
I'm not having them shag
while I'm tied to a chair.

103
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:15,210
- Hardly my fantasy either.
- You're blowing off our evening...

104
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,521
I don't want him to come.

105
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:23,047
We come together, daughters of Gaea,
sisters to the moon.

106
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:28,568
We walk with the darkness,
the wolf at our side,

107
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:34,444
through the waterfall of power
to the blackest heart of eternity.

108
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:37,804
I think we should have a bake sale.

109
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,282
- I don't know.
- You guys like a bake sale, right?

110
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:43,843
We need money for the dance recital,
and I do an empowering lemon Bundt.

111
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,652
The most important thing
is the Gaea newsletter.

112
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:50,169
We need to get the message
of blessing out to the sisters.

113
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:54,451
Also, who left their scented candles
dripping all over my woman-power shrine?

114
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,172
Well, this is good.

115
00:08:57,253 --> 00:09:00,051
I mean, this is all fun, you know.

116
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:05,332
But there's also other stuff that we might
show an interest in, as a Wicca group.

117
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:09,012
Like what?

118
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:14,645
Well, there's the wacky notion of spells.
You know, conjuring, transmutation.

119
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:19,887
Yeah, then we could get on our broomsticks
and fly around on our broomsticks.

120
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:22,965
You know, certain stereotypes
are not very empowering.

121
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:26,409
- I think that...
- One person's energy can suck the power

122
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:29,087
from an entire circle. No offence.

123
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:32,643
- Well, maybe we could...
- Yeah, Tara?

124
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,531
Guys, quiet. Do you have a suggestion?

125
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:44,689
OK, let's talk about the theme
for the bacchanal.

126
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:49,209
- So not stellar, huh?
- Talk. All talk.

127
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,012
Blah, blah, Gaea. Blah, blah, moon.

128
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,766
Menstrual life-force power thingy.

129
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:59,005
After a couple of sessions, I was hoping
we would get into something real, but...

130
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:01,527
No actual witches in your witch group?

131
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:04,810
No. Bunch of wanna-blessed-bes.

132
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:08,522
You know, nowadays every girl
with a henna tattoo and a spice rack

133
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:12,686
- thinks she's a sister to the dark ones.
- I'm sorry it was a bust.

134
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:15,082
I know you wanna go further
in that department.

135
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:18,768
I'd just like to float something
bigger than a pencil someday.

136
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:24,007
Hey, how's with you and Riley?
You two seemed pretty snuggly after class.

137
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:26,971
See above, re talk. All talk.

138
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:31,765
- Do I have to tie you two together?
- We almost, but...

139
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:35,163
Well, get with it.
I need my vicarious smoochies.

140
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:39,404
I don't know. I get nervous
and I start babbling.

141
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:42,769
And he starts babbling and it's a babblefest.

142
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:45,321
Plus, every time we talk, I have to lie.

143
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:50,841
The Slayer thing comes up one way
or another. I wish I could just come clean.

144
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:54,243
- Well, you can't.
- Yeah, I know I can't.

145
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:58,008
- But it bugs me this time.
- This is the burden we bear, brother.

146
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:03,008
We have a gig that would inevitably cause
any girl living to think we are cool upon cool.

147
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:08,486
Yet we Clark Kent our way through the dating
scene, never to use our unfair advantage.

148
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:12,921
- Thank God we're pretty.
- But it's just Buffy's special.

149
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:17,404
You think she's special? Wow. The first
486 times you told me, it didn't register,

150
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:20,530
but now I see that you think she's special.

151
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,731
See, you're naturally inclined
to talk too much. I don't have that.

152
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,202
Then get with the kissin'.

153
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,968
- Riley Finn.
- Initiative vocal-code match complete.

154
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:37,806
- Don't see why I have to be tied up.
- It's just while I'm sleepin'.

155
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:39,929
Like I'd bite you anyway.

156
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:42,322
- Oh, you would.
- Not bloody likely.

157
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:47,286
I happen to be very biteable, pal.
I'm moist and delicious.

158
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,763
All right, yeah, fine. You're a nummy treat.

159
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:53,641
And don't you forget it.

160
00:11:56,493 --> 00:12:00,042
Xander, don't you care about me?

161
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,693
- Shut up.
- We never talk.

162
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:05,727
Shut up.

163
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:07,485
- Xander.
- Shut up.

164
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:10,444
"They need to take seven."

165
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:14,808
Take seven what?

166
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:23,608
- Olivia.
- Sorry I'm so late.

167
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:27,208
- The flight was a horror.
- Oh, no.

168
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:30,683
- Bad weather?
- Baseball movie.

169
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:32,968
- So sorry.
- Yeah.

170
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,851
That's enough small talk, don't you think?

171
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:16,042
Retinal scan accepted.

172
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:32,081
Vocal code not accepted. Please state
your name for vocal identification.

173
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:38,403
Vocal code not accepted. Unauthorised
beings will be considered hostile.

174
00:16:38,493 --> 00:16:43,647
Please commence vocal identification in the
next 20 seconds to avoid countermeasures.

175
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,964
Override code incorrect.

176
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:55,327
Lethal countermeasures engaged.

177
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,484
..news from Sunnydale, California.

178
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:03,088
Apparently the entire town has been
quarantined, due to an epidemic of-

179
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:05,687
as strange as this may sound- laryngitis.

180
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:08,333
It seems the town has been
rendered unable to speak.

181
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:12,929
There's no word yet what might have caused
this or what other effects might be seen.

182
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:16,210
Local authorities have issued
a written statement

183
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,682
blaming recent flu vaccinations.

184
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:21,162
A few sceptics call it a citywide hoax.

185
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:24,404
Sunnydale has effectively
shut down all schools.

186
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,768
Businesses will be closed for the time being.

187
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:29,606
Residents are advised
to stay home and rest up.

188
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:33,163
The Centers for Disease Control
have ordered the town quarantined.

189
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:38,452
No one can go in or out until the syndrome
is identified or the symptoms disappear.

190
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:41,331
We'll bring you more on that as it develops.

191
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:54,163
Because there will be chaos.
You will help keep order. Dress as civilians.

192
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:58,485
A military presence
would only increase panic.

193
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,442
We are looking into it. Go.

194
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:12,730
Help maintain order. We will find an answer.

195
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:13,163
You were there looking for me?

196
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:17,041
I thought maybe we could do a spell.
Make people talk again?

197
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:21,243
I'd seen you in the group, the Wicca group.

198
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:28,285
You were different than them.
I mean, they didn't seem to know...

199
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:30,762
What they were talking about.

200
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:37,851
I think if they saw a witch,
they would run the other way.

201
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:42,362
- How long have you been practising?
- Always.

202
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:45,684
I mean, since I was little.

203
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:48,651
My mom used to. She...

204
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:52,726
She had a lot of power. Like you.

205
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:56,006
Oh. I'm not...

206
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,527
I don't have much in the way of power.

207
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:02,925
Really, I mean,
most of my potions come out soup.

208
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:07,651
Besides, spells going awry,
friends in danger...

209
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:11,692
- I'm definitely nothing special.
- No, you are.

210
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:24,326
So would you say this was
your best visit ever?

211
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:30,923
All the time you used to talk to me
about witchcraft and darkness and the like,

212
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:35,131
- I just thought you were being pretentious.
- Oh, I was.

213
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:37,568
I was also right.

214
00:40:37,653 --> 00:40:40,247
So everything you told me was true?

215
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:46,967
Well, no, I wasn't actually one of
the original members of Pink Floyd, but...

216
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:49,324
But the monster stuff, yes.

217
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:51,605
Scary.

218
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:55,684
Too scary?

219
00:40:55,773 --> 00:40:57,923
I don't know.

220
00:41:06,493 --> 00:41:07,721
Hi.

221
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,322
Hi.

222
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:28,252
Well...

223
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:33,327
I guess we have to talk.

224
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:40,327
I guess we do.

225
