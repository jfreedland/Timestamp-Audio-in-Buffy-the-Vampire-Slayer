2
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:33,546
That's right. Big boy.

3
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:35,949
Come and get it.

4
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:41,824
I got him! Go!

5
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,426
Any time now...

6
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:53,168
He's getting away!

7
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:55,007
And... ow.

8
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:08,284
That really never works.

9
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,792
Are you guys all right?

10
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,886
First of all. What was
with the acrobatics?

11
00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:14,726
How did that happen?

12
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,427
Wasn't Andy Hoelich
on the gymnastics team?

13
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:20,800
That's right. He was.
Cheater!

14
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:24,967
OK. And the second problem
I'm having...

15
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:26,805
"Come and get it. Big boy"?

16
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:28,208
Well...

17
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:31,043
Well. The slayer
always says a pun

18
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:32,742
or a witty play on words.

19
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:34,978
And I think it throws
the vampires off

20
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:37,680
and it makes them frightened
because I'm wisecracking.

21
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:40,315
OK. I didn't really have
a chance to work on that one.

22
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,154
but you try it every time.

23
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:43,557
Uh. If I may suggest...

24
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:45,652
"This time it's personal."

25
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,993
I mean. There's a reason
why it's a classic.

26
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:51,091
I've always been amazed
with how Buffy fought. But...

27
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:53,898
in a way. I feel like
we took her punning for granted.

28
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,996
Xander. Past tense rule.

29
00:01:56,073 --> 00:02:00,271
Oh. Sorry. I just meant we
in the past took it for granted

30
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:03,370
and. Uh. We won't
when she gets back.

31
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:07,877
Do you think Buffy knows
school's starting tomorrow?

32
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:10,443
Tomorrow.

33
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,852
Right.

34
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,287
Big day.

35
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:16,019
Oh. I'm gonna be busy a lot.

36
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:17,924
but. But only till 3:00.

37
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:19,895
and that's when
you usually get up.

38
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:22,933
I can't wait to see Cordelia.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,059
I can't believe
I can't wait to see Cordelia.

40
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:27,729
I wonder what our first
homework assignment's gonna be.

41
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:32,100
Hey. You're excited
over Cordelia. OK?

42
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:34,144
We've all got issues.

43
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:36,543
I guess we should pack it in.

44
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,546
Yeah.

45
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:42,512
Wouldn't it be great if Buffy
just showed up tomorrow?

46
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:44,076
Like nothing happened?

47
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:46,588
She just can't show up.
she got kicked out.

48
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:50,525
Well. Yeah. I know.
I just wish...

49
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:52,562
I wish we knew where she was.

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,056
How did you find me here?

51
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,218
If I was blind.
I would see you.

52
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:30,891
Stay with me.

53
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:32,595
Forever.

54
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,162
That's the whole point.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,834
I'll never leave.

56
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,139
Not even if you kill me.

57
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:24,940
Anything else?

58
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,778
That'll do us. Peaches.

59
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,010
Pay at the counter.

60
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,485
Sure you don't want me
to work it off for you?

61
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:37,585
Ha ha ha ha.

62
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:46,217
You guys ready?

63
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:48,846
Yeah. I think we're good.

64
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,254
Um..."Anne."

65
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:54,558
What'll you have?

66
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:59,155
Well. OK... what can
we get with this?

67
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:01,699
Um...

68
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:03,360
Can we get cake?

69
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:04,664
Don't be stupid.

70
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:06,534
We gotta eat healthy.

71
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,767
We can't have cake.

72
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,331
Can we get pie?

73
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,469
We've got a peach pie.

74
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:15,207
I can't guarantee
there's a peach in it.

75
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,306
We shouldn't have
blown all our money.

76
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:20,784
Come on. It was worth it.

77
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:23,651
Hey. Check this out.

78
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:27,852
It's nice.

79
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:30,293
It's nice and. Uh. Permanent.

80
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:33,264
Yeah. Forever.

81
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,234
I mean. That's
the whole point.

82
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:41,169
Hey. Do I know you?

83
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,765
I don't think so.

84
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:46,277
Really? Where are you from?

85
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:47,745
I'll get your pie.

86
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:54,414
I'm not feeling great.

87
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,421
Do you think you
can cover for me?

88
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:58,320
Sure. Okay.

89
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:03,923
So. No joy at the cemetery?

90
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,988
No. He got away.

91
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:08,056
We still have some
glitches in the system.

92
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:09,123
like...

93
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:10,567
vampires getting away.

94
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:12,126
But I think we're improving.

95
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:14,264
For God's sake be careful.

96
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,740
I mean. Uh.
I appreciate your efforts

97
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:18,470
to keep the vampire population down

98
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:19,670
until Buffy returns.

99
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:23,807
but. Uh. Well. If anything
should happen to you...

100
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,248
you should be killed.

101
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:26,376
I should take it somewhat amiss.

102
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:28,215
You'd be cranky?

103
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,447
Entirely.

104
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:31,046
Well. We try not to get killed.

105
00:07:31,124 --> 00:07:33,183
That's part of our whole
mission statement.

106
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,624
"Don't get killed."

107
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:35,683
Good.

108
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:37,389
I think you're going
to love that one.

109
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:40,392
- Hi.
- Hey. Willow.

110
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,127
How was your summer?

111
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:44,066
Oh. I can't believe
you brought that up.

112
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,503
Las Palmas was
the nightmare resort.

113
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,803
They order you around and
make you have organized "fun."

114
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,844
and I use sarcastic quote marks.

115
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:54,402
Plus the fact there are
cockroaches in Mexico

116
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,414
big enough to own property.

117
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:57,744
It was all about dread.

118
00:07:57,817 --> 00:07:59,011
How was your summer?

119
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,746
Oh. It was OK.

120
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,082
Is Xander around?

121
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:03,679
Well. Uh. Yeah. Somewhere.

122
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:07,089
Good. Great.
I haven't seen him yet.

123
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,525
Do I look OK?

124
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:10,459
- Oh. Yeah.
- How's my hair?

125
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,259
Uh. It's good.

126
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:14,162
He didn't meet anybody
over the summer. Did he?

127
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,827
No. Who's he gonna meet
in Sunnydale.

128
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:19,371
but monsters and stuff?

129
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,704
But then again he's always
been attracted to monsters.

130
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:23,901
How's my hair?

131
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:25,807
Still good.

132
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:26,810
Hi.

133
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,676
Maybe he's forgotten me.

134
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:32,206
Well. I'll just
have to make him remember.

135
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:33,877
See ya.

136
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:35,716
You came to visit me.

137
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:37,153
You came with books?

138
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:38,520
Are they books for me?

139
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:40,422
Actually. They're kind of for me.

140
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:42,017
I don't get it.

141
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:43,858
Well. It's sort of a funny story.

142
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,864
You remember when I didn't graduate?

143
00:08:45,932 --> 00:08:47,900
Well. I know you had
a lot of incompletes.

144
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,026
but that's what
summer school was for.

145
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:52,503
Yeah. Remember when I didn't go?

146
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,335
Whoa. Slow down. People.

147
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,466
Summer is over.

148
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:57,873
Be somber.

149
00:08:57,944 --> 00:08:59,468
But you never said anything.

150
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:02,571
How am I supposed to react
to this rather alarming news?

151
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:06,015
Well. Actually. I was pretty much
banking on you finding it cute.

152
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:10,351
Traditionally. You know. Repeating
a grade isn't exactly a turn-on.

153
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:12,220
And-And you're
practically a genius.

154
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,589
You're Mr. Test Scores.

155
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,525
It's all a little weird.

156
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,154
So the cute thing is out?

157
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,528
Have you guys seen Cordelia?

158
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,794
Yeah. She's around here somewhere.

159
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:23,130
I don't want to
come on too geeky.

160
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:26,103
But. Uh. OK. I'm psyched.

161
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:27,901
There's gonna be some heat.
if you know what I mean.

162
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:31,273
So you guys might want
to duck and cover.

163
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:34,370
And I'm starting to be geeky.

164
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,540
OK. Bye.

165
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,447
- How's my...
- Your hair is fine.

166
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:39,985
Cool.

167
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:41,451
This is our year.
I'm telling you.

168
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:43,489
Best football season ever.

169
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,717
I'm so in shape. I'm a rock.

170
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,156
It's all about egg whites.

171
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:49,524
If we can focus.
keep discipline.

172
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:52,029
and not have quite
as many mysterious deaths.

173
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:54,362
Sunnydale is gonna rule!

174
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:56,401
I'm trying to get
to cute. Really.

175
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:58,562
But I'm still sorta
stuck on "strange."

176
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:00,833
Well. I'd be willing
to bargain down to "eccentric"

177
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:03,000
with an option on "cool."

178
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:05,009
- Hey.
- Hey.

179
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:07,011
Good summer?

180
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:09,047
It was all right.

181
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:10,946
Cool.

182
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:13,349
Yeah.

183
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:16,047
Well. I'll see ya.

184
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:18,249
Yeah. Whatever.

185
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:53,654
I'm no one.

186
00:10:53,726 --> 00:10:54,886
I'm no one.

187
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:58,620
I'm no one.

188
00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:01,689
Yes? Thank you. Thank you.

189
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:05,902
I have a lead.

190
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:07,302
A friend in Oakland

191
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:10,706
has a sketchy report
of a young girl

192
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:13,643
fending off a group
of vampires about a week ago.

193
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:15,543
There's a plane out
in about an hour.

194
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:19,345
And what makes this different
from the last 9 leads?

195
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:22,910
Well. I believe there's
a meal on this flight.

196
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:25,752
Look. I don't mean
to poop the party here.

197
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:28,258
it's just. You get
your hopes all up.

198
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:31,626
and then it's just a big fat
raspberry. And I feel bad.

199
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:34,222
But it's good that
you're looking. Though.

200
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,291
You shouldn't give up.

201
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:37,858
Oh. Yeah. Definitely.

202
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,165
Yes. One must try.

203
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,433
Well. I should go.

204
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:47,203
You don't think
maybe he'll find her?

205
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,077
I think he'll find her
when she wants to be found.

206
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:56,218
Anne?

207
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,119
Anne?

208
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,124
Buffy?

209
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:03,451
Don't be mad.

210
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,463
I won't turn you in or nothing.

211
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,522
I guess you don't recognize me.

212
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:13,035
Lily?

213
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:15,005
I mean from before.

214
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:18,168
I was calling myself
Chantarelle then.

215
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:19,939
I used to...

216
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:23,004
Well. I was in this cult
that worshipped vampires.

217
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:25,448
So lame. I know.

218
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:28,452
Yeah...
I. Uh. I remember.

219
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,422
But you kinda saved us.

220
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:35,688
I never thanked you or anything.

221
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:38,286
Did you tell anyone who I was?

222
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:40,730
Oh. No.
Not even Rickie.

223
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,461
I mean. I was so surprised
to see you here.

224
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:44,627
waiting tables...

225
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:48,440
But I wouldn't tell.

226
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:51,135
I know how it is
when you gotta get lost.

227
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:58,209
Do you. Uh...
Do you live nearby?

228
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:00,479
Well. There's
a couple of places.

229
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:05,046
Uh. They're abandoned. And
a lot of people stay there.

230
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:08,616
So how come you
came up with Anne?

231
00:13:08,694 --> 00:13:10,958
It's my middle name.

232
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,429
Lily's from a song.

233
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:14,898
Rickie picked it.

234
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:17,993
I'm always changing anyway.

235
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,133
Chantarelle was part
of my exotic phase.

236
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,837
It's nice.
It's a mushroom.

237
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:29,506
It is?

238
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:31,811
That's really embarrassing.

239
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:34,352
Um. Well. It's
an exotic mushroom.

240
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,650
if that's any comfort.

241
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:39,418
Well. Before that. I was
following this loser preacher

242
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,789
and calling myself
Sister Sunshine.

243
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,658
What do they
call you at home?

244
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:52,129
I like Lily.

245
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:55,002
It's cool for now.

246
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,304
Hey. Do you have any money?

247
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:00,504
I didn't mean that like...

248
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:04,140
Well. I just mean.
I know this guy.

249
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:07,549
he's gonna have this kinda
rave thing in his basement.

250
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,314
We could go.

251
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:12,050
I mean. I could show you
if you had...

252
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:14,149
'Cause I'm broke.

253
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:17,559
I don't think so.

254
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:21,030
I just kind of...
I want to be alone.

255
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,068
I didn't mean to bug you.

256
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:27,003
No. I didn't mean
that. It's just...

257
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:30,064
A lot of people like that...
It's too much.

258
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:31,609
I do have the money.
though. So.

259
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:32,769
why don't you and Rickie go.

260
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:33,971
and then maybe
I could meet you...

261
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:38,039
No. It's OK.
Forget about it.

262
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:40,244
That's not very polite.

263
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:46,549
Are you OK?

264
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:50,955
I'm no one.

265
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:14,808
Are you OK?

266
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,151
Geez. I didn't see you.

267
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:19,156
Maybe you shouldn't move.

268
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,624
Maybe you should lie down.
Somebody call an ambulance!

269
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,092
No! I'm OK. I just...

270
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:24,652
I need to go.

271
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,729
Whoa.

272
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:33,702
Oh.

273
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,325
where are you running to?

274
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:38,202
Sorry.

275
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:41,333
Maybe I should ask.
where are you running from?

276
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:47,846
You're pretty new around here.

277
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,178
You've got the look. Though.

278
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,809
The look?

279
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:54,287
Like you had to grow up
way too fast.

280
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:56,756
What's your name?

281
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:59,851
Hey. Um. I'm Ken.

282
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:01,190
Here. Go ahead.
take one of these.

283
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:05,460
Don't be shy
about stopping by.

284
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,024
I guess you're not
starving. But...

285
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:09,900
we're not just interested
in feeding the body.

286
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:12,565
You might find something
you're missing.

287
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:13,699
I'm all right.

288
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,471
Then why are you here?

289
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,007
This is not a good place
for a kid to be.

290
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:23,346
You get old fast here.

291
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:27,411
The thing that drains
the life out of them is despair.

292
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:31,892
I mean. Kids come here. And
they got nothing to go home to.

293
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,397
This ends up being
the last stop for a lot of them.

294
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:38,399
Shouldn't have to be that way.

295
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:46,973
Ooh-ooh-ooh

296
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:51,103
On my way to freedom

297
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:58,948
I ask myself

298
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,148
Why did I come here?

299
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:05,125
To find my

300
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:11,257
Own way to freedom

301
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:18,705
And a change is gonna come

302
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:21,867
- I'm gonna find my way
- Find my way

303
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:26,039
Find my way back to freedom

304
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:29,015
- Gonna find my way
- Find my way

305
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:31,348
Find my way

306
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:35,412
Find my way back to freedom

307
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,593
Boy. I'm glad we showed up
for "Depressing Night."

308
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,760
I wonder what she's
doing right now.

309
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:49,235
Oh. I know what she's doing.

310
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:52,330
Gabbing to all of her friends
about her passionate affair

311
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:53,772
with Pedro the cabana boy

312
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:55,469
laughing about me thinking

313
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:57,478
how she still might have
feelings about me.

314
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:02,440
Oh. It's possible you were
talking about Buffy.

315
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:04,451
It's possible.

316
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,613
The Bronze just never
seems the same without her.

317
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,884
And the slaying isn't
getting any easier. Either.

318
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,859
I don't know. I think we're
kinda getting a rhythm down.

319
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:14,793
We're losing half the vamps.

320
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:16,831
Yeah. But. Rhythmically.

321
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:19,298
We just need to work
on our timing. I think.

322
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:22,632
No. I know what we need.

323
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:23,864
A vampire slayer?

324
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:24,997
Next best thing.

325
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:30,507
Bait.

326
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,452
[Knock On Door]

327
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:52,290
Uh. Hello.

328
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,232
Hello. Um. May I...

329
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:57,135
Oh. Uh. Of course.
Come on in.

330
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:59,366
I've just come back from Oakland.

331
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:02,842
A friend of mine
called with a lead.

332
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:06,210
Stories about someone
fighting vampires.

333
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:08,010
It didn't pan out.
I'm afraid.

334
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:10,948
No Buffy.

335
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,613
No vampires.

336
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:15,485
Bunch of schoolkids
in heavy mascara

337
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:18,287
listening to extremely
silly music.

338
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,055
Well. Thank you for going.

339
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,619
I can hardly...

340
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:24,164
I can hardly leave the house.

341
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:27,065
I'm just afraid she'll call
and she'll need my help.

342
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:32,232
Buffy is the most capable
child I've ever known.

343
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:34,332
I mean. She may be
confused. Unhappy.

344
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:37,105
but I honestly believe
she's in no danger.

345
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:41,080
I just wish
I could talk to her.

346
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:43,777
The last thing
we did was fight.

347
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:48,016
Joyce. You mustn't blame
yourself for her leaving.

348
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,649
I don't.

349
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,492
I blame you.

350
00:19:56,965 --> 00:20:01,561
You've been this huge
influence on her. Guiding her.

351
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:05,697
You had this whole relationship
with her behind my back.

352
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:08,868
I feel like you've
taken her away from me.

353
00:20:13,314 --> 00:20:15,908
I didn't make Buffy
who she is.

354
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:18,851
And who exactly is she?

355
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:26,890
Buff... Uh. Anne?

356
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,360
Can I talk to you?

357
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,261
Look. This really isn't
a good time. Can it wait?

358
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,629
Rickie's gone.

359
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,134
I haven't seen him
for more than a day.

360
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:36,432
I... He's never left
for that long.

361
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:38,734
I think something's...
happened.

362
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:40,434
Maybe something's happened.

363
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,066
Well. Did you call the police?

364
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:43,075
[Sighs]

365
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:45,578
Rickie skipped out on his parole.

366
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:48,707
They would just cause
more trouble.

367
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:52,082
I don't know.
did you ask around?

368
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:55,054
Can you help me?

369
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:57,023
Uh. I can't.

370
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,083
But that's who you are
and stuff. Right?

371
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,594
I mean. You help people.
and. You know...

372
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:04,427
I can't get into this.
I'm sorry. Lily.

373
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:07,093
You know how to do stuff.

374
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:10,194
I don't. Not anymore.

375
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,935
But... I don't know
what to do.

376
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:24,343
We gave blood lots of times
'cause you get a few bucks

377
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,182
and they have cookies.

378
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:28,313
You're a fan of the sugar rush?

379
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:29,413
It's nice.

380
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:31,789
Hi. Are you here to donate blood?

381
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,157
Uh. We're looking for a friend.

382
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:35,753
Rickie T.?
We come in sometimes.

383
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,991
Rickie. Sure.
Uh. He's not here.

384
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,466
Well. Do you know if he's
been in the last day or so?

385
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:42,230
Let me check the sheet.

386
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:48,140
This'll probably go
faster if we split up.

387
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:50,040
Can I come with you?

388
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:53,569
OK. Where did I lose you
on the whole splitting up thing?

389
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:55,131
Oh. Sorry.

390
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:57,596
I was thinking we could check out
some of your hangouts

391
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:01,535
and then. I guess.
meet later at my place.

392
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:02,866
OK.

393
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:04,702
Sorry. Guys.

394
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:06,366
He hasn't been here.

395
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:07,932
Thanks.

396
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,443
I'll tell him you were looking.

397
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:10,911
Great.

398
00:23:27,957 --> 00:23:29,652
Rickie?

399
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:47,035
Did you find Rickie?

400
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:48,406
I thought of...

401
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,035
Well. He likes to go
to this movie house.

402
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:51,636
you can get in
around the back...

403
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:53,341
Lily...

404
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,645
I think he's dead.

405
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:04,048
But...

406
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,686
he takes care of me.

407
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:09,560
I'm sorry.

408
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:13,193
We're gonna get a place.

409
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:15,760
His cousin can get him
a job at the car wash.

410
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:17,066
Lily. There's...

411
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,073
there's something else.

412
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,579
The person that I found...

413
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:25,906
was old.

414
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:27,040
He looked about 80.

415
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:28,242
Well. That's not Rickie.

416
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:29,807
I'm sure it was.

417
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:36,189
I don't know how. But...

418
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:39,524
it was like something
drained the life out of him.

419
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:42,086
Do you mean like a vampire?

420
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:43,961
No.

421
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:48,265
A vampire couldn't accelerate
the aging process.

422
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:51,170
Maybe it was something
in his blood.

423
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,037
When was the last time
you guys gave blood together?

424
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:55,339
I don't understand.

425
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,935
Maybe it's not Rickie. OK?

426
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:59,208
Lily. This is something you're
just gonna have to deal with.

427
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:01,045
But he didn't do anything wrong.

428
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:02,345
why would this happen to him?

429
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,942
That's not the point.

430
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:06,481
These things happen all the time.

431
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:08,386
You can't just...
close your eyes

432
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:11,017
and hope that they're
gonna go away.

433
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:15,293
Is it 'cause of you?

434
00:25:15,364 --> 00:25:17,958
What?

435
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:24,166
You know about monsters
and stuff.

436
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,231
You could have brought
this with you.

437
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:29,938
I didn't bring
anything with me.

438
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:32,572
And I didn't ask for you
to come to me with your problems.

439
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:34,445
I just wanted to be left alone.

440
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:36,849
If you can't deal.
then don't lay it off on me.

441
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:56,902
Are you OK?

442
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,837
Hey. It's OK.

443
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:05,244
Maybe I can help.

444
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,942
You can't.

445
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:11,077
Look. I know you all think
I'm a big square

446
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,020
handing out leaflets
about hope.

447
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,024
But hope is a real thing.

448
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:18,219
just like despair.

449
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:22,560
Hope can fill up the part
of you that's missing.

450
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:25,065
But Rickie...

451
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:27,125
Rickie?

452
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:30,900
Say. Are you Lily?

453
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:33,908
Right. He was
talking about you.

454
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,307
You've seen Rickie?

455
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,575
Oh. Sure.

456
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:43,345
Rickie's with us now.

457
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:44,716
She said he was dead.

458
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:47,449
Well. Someone's sure
handed you a tall tale.

459
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,686
Rickie's no more dead
than I am.

460
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,955
Why don't you come
to Family Home?

461
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,190
We'll get you taken care of.

462
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:32,338
Candidate for what?

463
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:36,501
What are you doing?

464
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:39,671
Breaking into your office and
going through your private files.

465
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:41,510
Candidate for what?

466
00:27:41,582 --> 00:27:43,482
I'm calling the police.

467
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:48,351
Now. You've got a whole bunch
of candidates here.

468
00:27:48,422 --> 00:27:50,583
I wonder if any of them
are missing like Rickie.

469
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:53,627
Gosh. I bet they are.

470
00:27:53,694 --> 00:27:54,991
You're getting yourself
in a lot of trouble.

471
00:27:55,062 --> 00:27:57,394
I don't want any trouble.

472
00:27:57,465 --> 00:28:00,901
I just want to be alone
and quiet in a room

473
00:28:00,968 --> 00:28:04,563
with a chair and a fireplace
and a tea cozy.

474
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:07,402
I don't even know what
a tea cozy is. But I want one.

475
00:28:07,475 --> 00:28:09,067
Instead. I keep
getting trouble.

476
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:11,805
which I am more than
willing to share.

477
00:28:13,414 --> 00:28:15,439
What are you doing
with these kids?

478
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:17,245
Nothing.

479
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:19,115
I just...

480
00:28:19,186 --> 00:28:22,178
I give him the names
of the healthy ones.

481
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:26,816
Give them to who?

482
00:28:26,894 --> 00:28:28,088
Well...

483
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:30,096
don't you look nice?

484
00:28:30,164 --> 00:28:31,597
I guess.

485
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:34,395
Well. You don't want to wear
your own outfit to the cleansing.

486
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:35,435
It'll get soaked.

487
00:28:35,503 --> 00:28:38,939
A cleansing is
like a baptism? Right?

488
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:40,940
Not quite the same.

489
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:42,441
Will I see Rickie after?

490
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,444
Oh. Of course.
He's waiting for you.

491
00:28:44,512 --> 00:28:46,446
He's very excited.

492
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:52,281
Cordelia:
Why do I have to be bait?

493
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:53,786
I'm always bait.

494
00:28:53,854 --> 00:28:55,947
Why can't Willow be bait?

495
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:57,957
He's already seen Willow.

496
00:28:58,025 --> 00:29:00,960
And could you complain louder
so all the vampires leave?

497
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:04,463
I think this is a good spot.

498
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:05,624
Is everybody packin'?

499
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,302
Let's do it.

500
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:19,638
I'm doing this
for Buffy's sake.

501
00:29:19,713 --> 00:29:21,305
This has nothing to do with you.

502
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:23,816
Yeah. Like I needed
that cleared up.

503
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:25,476
Go away.
This is my hiding spot.

504
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:26,485
Where do I hide?

505
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:28,146
You don't hide.
You're bait.

506
00:29:28,222 --> 00:29:29,883
Go act baity.

507
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:31,185
What's the plan?

508
00:29:31,258 --> 00:29:33,249
The vampire attacks you.

509
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:34,089
And then what?

510
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,253
The vampire kills you.

511
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:37,388
We watch. We rejoice.

512
00:29:37,464 --> 00:29:39,432
Cordelia:
Everything's a joke with you.

513
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,092
Xander:
No. Just our relationship.

514
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:42,260
What relationship?

515
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:43,769
Right. I forgot.
We actually want

516
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:46,238
to bury that piece
of the past. Don't we?

517
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:51,438
We come to this station
to wash away the past.

518
00:29:51,512 --> 00:29:53,446
Go ahead. Kneel.

519
00:29:57,017 --> 00:30:01,784
We let the water
run over the sin

520
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:03,448
and the pain

521
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:05,958
and the uncertainty.

522
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:08,290
It looks kinda... dirty.

523
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:09,693
Yeah.

524
00:30:09,763 --> 00:30:11,128
Buffy:
You know. I just...

525
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:13,462
I woke up.
and I looked in the mirror.

526
00:30:13,534 --> 00:30:14,466
and I thought.

527
00:30:14,535 --> 00:30:16,628
hey. What's with all the sin?

528
00:30:16,704 --> 00:30:18,797
I need to change.

529
00:30:18,873 --> 00:30:19,965
I'm...

530
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,064
I'm dirty.

531
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:22,972
I'm...
I'm bad with the...

532
00:30:23,043 --> 00:30:24,977
sex and the envy

533
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:28,981
and that loud music
us kids listen to nowadays.

534
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:31,306
Uh...

535
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:33,319
Oh. I just suck at undercover.

536
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:34,684
Where's Ken?

537
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:54,165
This is a private moment.

538
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:55,503
If you could just...

539
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:57,009
