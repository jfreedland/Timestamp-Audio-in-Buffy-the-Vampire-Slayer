1
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:12,902
Oh, look!

2
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:16,448
- It's Buffy and all her friends.
- That's witty.

3
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:19,826
Do you ever wonder why nobody cool
ever wants to hang out with you?

4
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:20,994
Just thankful.

5
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:24,789
Were you this popular at your old school
before you got kicked out?

6
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:29,085
Careful. She might beat you up.

7
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:39,951
Hey! Buffy!

8
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:41,636
- You missed it.
- Missed what?

9
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:44,775
We just saw the zebras mating!
Thank you. Very exciting.

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,311
It was like the Heimlich, with stripes!

11
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:51,440
And I missed it. Yet somehow
I'll find the courage to live on.

12
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:53,817
- Where were you?
- Uh, I was looking at the fishes.

13
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,395
- Was it cool?
- It was fishes.

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,907
I'm feeling that you're not
in the field-trip spirit here.

15
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,152
Well, it would... It's nothing, I...

16
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:06,842
We did the same zoo trip at my old school
every year. Same old same old.

17
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:09,123
Buffy, this isn't just about
looking at a bunch of animals.

18
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:13,438
- This is about not being in class!
- You know, you're right.

19
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:18,007
- Suddenly the animals look shiny and new.
- Gotta have perspective.

20
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:24,888
Lance!

21
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:29,017
- How's it going?
- Hey, Kyle.

22
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:32,104
So, is this like a, uh, family reunion?

23
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:36,108
- No.
- I think it's a family reunion. It's so...

24
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,820
touching. Doesn't anybody have a camera?

25
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,899
Hey! Does your mom still
pick out your lice,

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,932
or are you old enough
to do that yourself now?

27
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,075
Quit it.

28
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,993
Hey! Guys, come on!

29
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:51,080
- It's got my notes in there!
- What's going on here?

30
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:53,499
I've had it up to here with you four.

31
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:56,419
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

32
00:01:56,502 --> 00:01:58,371
Did I ask you to speak?

33
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:01,924
OK, I guess I did.
But I want the truth. Lance?

34
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:07,847
They weren't doing anything.

35
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,975
Really. We were just playing around.

36
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:13,268
All right.

37
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:18,064
I'll be watching you.

38
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,320
You...

39
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:26,698
...came through big time.

40
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,867
Way to go, Lance!

41
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,428
Flutie's been looking for a reason
to come down on us.

42
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:32,306
It's OK.

43
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:34,683
Come on, we're gonna
check out the Hyena House.

44
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:39,274
- But I think it's off limits.
- And therein, my friend, lies the fun.

45
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,518
What are Kyle and his buds
doing with Lance?

46
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:59,354
Oh, playing with him
as a cat plays with a mouse.

47
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:03,009
- What is it with those guys?
- They're obnoxious. Professionally.

48
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:05,457
Well, every school has 'em.
So, you start a new school,

49
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:09,097
you get your desks,
some blackboards and some mean kids.

50
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:11,649
- Yeah, well, I'd better extract Lance...
- I'll handle it.

51
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:14,869
This job doesn't require actual slaying.

52
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,320
- You don't think we should follow?
- Kyle and those guys are jerks,

53
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:23,419
but they're all talk.

54
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,754
- Mostly.
- Why don't we...?

55
00:03:25,803 --> 00:03:27,923
Yeah, why don't we.

56
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:31,968
Hold it, hold it.
Are you blind or are you just illiterate?

57
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:34,315
Because hyenas are
very quick to prey on the weak.

58
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,696
- We were just...
- You're not going in there.

59
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:38,439
Anyone that does is in a world of trouble.

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,276
No. No one's going in there.

61
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,910
- Why is it off limits?
- It's a quarantine.

62
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:48,175
These hyenas just came in from Africa,
so keep out.

63
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:51,928
- Even if they call your name.
- What are you talking about?

64
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:56,316
A Masai tribesman told me that hyenas
are capable of understanding human speech.

65
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:59,558
They follow humans around by day,
learning their names.

66
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:03,472
At night, when the campfire dies,
they call out to a person.

67
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:06,941
And once they separate him,

68
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:12,053
the pack... devours them.

69
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:26,062
Cool!

70
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,282
I don't see any hyenas.

71
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:42,728
OK. Now we've seen it.

72
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:45,956
- It looks cute.
- I think it looks hungry.

73
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,560
- Come on, Spot! Suppertime!
- Stop... Guys...

74
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:53,689
Stop! It's not funny!

75
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:55,733
Stop it! It's not funny!

76
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:57,726
Why don't you pick on
someone your own species?

77
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,693
What, are you gonna get in my face?

78
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,414
<b>"The Pack"</b>

79
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,795
I thought Xander would be here by now.

80
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,631
That'd make him on time.
We couldn't have that.

81
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,968
Did he seem upset at all
on the bus back from the zoo?

82
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:52,445
About what?

83
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:55,164
I don't know. He was quiet.

84
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,332
I didn't notice anything.

85
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:02,421
But then again I'm not as hyperaware of him
as, oh, say, for example, you.

86
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:03,464
Hyper-aware?

87
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:08,052
I'm not constantly monitoring his health,
his moods, his blood pressure.

88
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:09,940
130 over 80.

89
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,013
You got it bad, girl.

90
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:16,011
He makes my head go tingly.
You know what I mean?

91
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:19,562
- I dimly recall.
- But it hasn't happened to you lately?

92
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,939
Not of late.

93
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:25,651
Not even for a dangerous
and mysterious older man

94
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:28,428
whose leather jacket
you're wearing right now?

95
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,697
- It goes with the shoes.
- Come on!

96
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:33,950
Angel pushes your buttons.
You know he does.

97
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:39,381
I suppose some girls
might find him good-looking.

98
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,626
If they have eyes.
All right, he's a honey, but

99
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:45,137
it's just... he's never around, and,

100
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:49,299
when he is, all he wants to do
is talk about vampires and I...

101
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:51,885
- I just can't have a relationship...
- There he is!

102
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:54,261
- Angel?
- Xander.

103
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,270
- Girls!
- Boy!

104
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,191
Sorry I'm late. I... just forgot
that we were gonna be here.

105
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:08,368
Hungry!

106
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:11,542
Xander, you still want me
to help you with geometry tomorrow?

107
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:13,954
We can work after class.

108
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:16,117
Yeah. What is this crap?

109
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:19,030
Well, it was my buttery croissant.

110
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,793
Man, I need some food. Birds live on this.

111
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,196
What?

112
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,430
- What's up with you?
- Is something wrong?

113
00:08:30,465 --> 00:08:33,517
- Did I do something?
- What could you possibly do?

114
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:36,853
That's crazy talk. I'm just... restless.

115
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:41,065
- Well, we could go to the ice-cream place.
- I like it here.

116
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:48,021
- OK, now what?
- You took a bath.

117
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:51,775
Yeah. I often do.
I'm actually known for it.

118
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,318
That's OK.

119
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:59,158
And the weird-behavior award goes to...

120
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,009
<i><b>(# "Reluctant Man" by Sprung Monkey)</b></i>

121
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,729

00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:07,410

00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,934
I don't understand
why you're sitting at our table.

131
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:38,573
Yeah, shouldn't you be
hovering over the football stadium

132
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:41,008
with Goodyear written on you?

133
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,205
The kid's fat!

134
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:08,216
Right! That's enough training for one day.

135
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,902
That last roundhouse was kinda sloppy.
Are you sure you don't wanna do it again?

136
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:13,772
No! No, no, that's fine.

137
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,524
You just... run along to class.

138
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:22,099
While I wait for the feeling
to return to my arms.

139
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,533
Oh, my God!

140
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,953
Look out!

141
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,580
Stop! Whoa! Get it! Get it!

142
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,755
Lordy, Herbert!
Gave Mr. Flutie quite a scare, didn't he?

143
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,007
Students, I'd like you all to meet Herbert,

144
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:47,219
our new mascot
for the Sunnydale High Razorbacks!

145
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,969
- He's so cute!
- He's not cute!

146
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,296
No! He's a fierce razorback!

147
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:02,368
- He doesn't look mean, Mr. Flutie.
- He's mean. He's ready for action, see?

148
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:06,946
Here are the tusks... A scary razorback.

149
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,283
You're right. He's a fine mascot
and will engender school spirit.

150
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:12,534
He'd better.
Costs a fortune to feed him.

151
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:17,031
All right, let's get you
back into your cage.

152
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:19,417
This way.

153
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:23,721
- I'm not getting this.
- It's simple, really.

154
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:26,299
See, the bisector of a vertex

155
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:31,511
is the line that divides the angle
at that vertex into two equal parts.

156
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:33,814
It's like a big blur,
all these numbers and angles.

157
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,641
It's the same stuff from last week.
You had it down then.

158
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:40,729
- Why do I need to learn this?
- 'Cause otherwise you'll flunk math.

159
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:42,773
Explain the part why that's bad.

160
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:46,026
You remember. You fail math,
you flunk out of school,

161
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:49,654
you end up being the guy at the pizza place
that sweeps the floor and says:

162
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:52,749
"Hey, kids, where's
the cool parties this weekend?"

163
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:55,668
We've been through this.
Do you have a headache?

164
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:59,338
Yeah. And I think
I know what's causing it.

165
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:03,801
Ah! That's better.
It goes right to the source of the pain.

166
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:06,086
- Xander...
- Look, forget it, OK? I don't get it.

167
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:09,199
I won't ever. I don't care!

168
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:12,168
We can finish this another time.

169
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:16,380
See, the problem is you kids today
have no school spirit.

170
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,750
Hold on. Let me get his outfit off.

171
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:25,389
Today it's all gangs and drugs and
those movies on Showtime with the nudity.

172
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:26,973
I don't have cable. I only heard.

173
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,689
When I was your age,
we cared about the school's reputation

174
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:32,217
and the football team's record.
All that stuff.

175
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,930
Of course, when I was your age
I was surrounded by old guys

176
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:40,246
telling me how much better
things were when they were my age.

177
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:41,621
Yeah.

178
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:04,601
All right... it's raining.

179
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:09,531
All regular gym classes
have been postponed.

180
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:12,216
So you know what that means.

181
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,444
Dodge ball.

182
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,489
For those of you that may have forgotten,
the rules are as follows:

183
00:13:18,573 --> 00:13:20,491
You dodge.

184
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,835
- Here we go!
- On your guards!

185
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,925
God, this game is brutal.

186
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,802
I love it!

187
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:16,419
Xander?

188
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:18,504
What's wrong with you?

189
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,888
I guess you've noticed
that I've been different around you lately.

190
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:30,650
- Yes.
- I think I'm...

191
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:34,061
I think it's because my feelings for you
have been changing.

192
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:37,581
And while we've been friends
for such a long time

193
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:40,584
that I feel like I need to tell you something.

194
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:43,712
I've, um...

195
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:50,522
I've decided to drop geometry. So I won't
be needing your math help any more.

196
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:55,599
Which means I won't have to look
at your pasty face again.

197
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:17,070
Are you gonna say something to me?

198
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,310
- Dogs.
- Where?

199
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,156
You're out of your mind!
That's no way to play lead guitar!

200
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,411
- What're you talking about?
- That's just hunt and peck.

201
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:51,845
- It's not!
- Hey, Xander.

202
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,103
You've heard Wretched Refuse play. What
do you think of the guy who plays lead?

203
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:58,075
Hey!

204
00:16:58,158 --> 00:16:59,910
- Hey! What are you guys...?
- Shut up.

205
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,453
You're sharing.

206
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:03,747
Friends like to share.

207
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,086
- Good?
- It's too well done.

208
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:12,296
Hey! That is not cool.

209
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:21,305
Hey!

210
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:49,875
Let's do lunch.

211
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:02,807
<i><b>(# "Job's Eyes" by Far)</b></i>

212
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:22,490
<i># I'm sure this rain won't last</i>

213
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:30,504
<i># I'm sure its time is up</i>

214
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:38,341
<i># Though it's pouring down</i>

215
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:43,398
<i># I'm sure this rain won't last</i>

216
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:47,589
<i># And it falls on Job's eyes</i>

217
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,463
<i># This water of doubt</i>

218
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:56,013
<i># And I'm wading in lies</i>

219
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:59,360
<i># It's wearing me out</i>

220
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:03,374
<i># But if you want it, alright</i>

221
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,458
<i># I'll buy it, I'll buy it,</i>

222
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:11,737
<i># I'll buy it, I'll buy it,</i>

223
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:15,341
<i># I'll buy it, I'll...</i>

224
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:35,910
I've known him my whole life, Buffy.

225
00:19:35,945 --> 00:19:40,605
We haven't always been close,
but he's never...

226
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:43,191
I think something's wrong with him.

227
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:46,236
Or maybe there's something wrong with me.

228
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:50,615
What are you talking about?

229
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:56,121
Come on. He's not picking on you.
He's just sniffing you a lot.

230
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:00,876
I don't know.
Maybe three isn't company any more.

231
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:04,037
You think this has something to do with me?

232
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,047
Of course.

233
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,967
No. That still doesn't explain why
he's hanging out with the Dode Patrol.

234
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:13,429
Something's going on. Something weird.

235
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,190
What are you gonna do?

236
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:18,392
Talk to the expert on weird.

237
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:21,395
Xander's taken to teasing
the less fortunate?

238
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:24,332
And there's a noticeable change
in both clothing and demeanor?

239
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:25,080
Yes.

240
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:29,427
And, well, otherwise all his spare time
is spent... lounging about with imbeciles.

241
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:32,973
- It's bad, isn't it?
- It's devastating.

242
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:36,726
He's turned into a 16-year-old boy.
Of course, you'll have to kill him.

243
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,646
- Giles, I'm serious!
- So am I!

244
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:42,232
Except for the part about killing him.

245
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:45,510
Testosterone is a great equaliser.
Turns all men into morons.

246
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,279
He will, however, get over it.

247
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:50,155
I cannot believe that you, of all people,
are trying to Scully me!

248
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:53,127
There is something supernatural
at work here.

249
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,995
Get your books! Look stuff up!

250
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,522
Look under what?

251
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,749
I don't know. That's your department.

252
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,669
The evidence that you've presented me with
is sketchy at best.

253
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:06,672
He scared the pig.

254
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:10,326
- Well, he did.
- Buffy, boys can be cruel.

255
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:16,498
They tease. They prey on the weak.
It's a natural teen behavior pattern.

256
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,033
What did you just say?

257
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:21,753
Um... they tease.

258
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:26,224
They prey on the weak.
I've heard that somewhere before...

259
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:30,053
Xander has been acting totally wiggy
ever since we went to the zoo.

260
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,348
Him and Kyle and all those guys,
they went into the hyena cage.

261
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,333
Oh, God, that laugh.

262
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:37,951
You're saying that
Xander's becoming a hyena?

263
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:39,144
I don't know.

264
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,648
Or been possessed by one?
Not just Xander. All of them.

265
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:47,361
- Well, I've certainly never heard of...
- Herbert! They've found him!

266
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:50,277
- The pig?
- Dead.

267
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:54,437
And also eaten.
Principal Flutie's freaking out.

268
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:57,136
Testosterone, huh?

269
00:21:58,822 --> 00:22:01,074
What are you gonna do?

270
00:22:01,158 --> 00:22:03,242
Get my books.

271
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:05,619
Look stuff up.

272
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:15,755
You four!

273
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:19,675
- What?
- Oh, don't think I don't know.

274
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,514
Three kids saw you outside Herbert's room.
You're busted. Yeah. You're going down.

275
00:22:26,098 --> 00:22:29,225
- How is Herbert?
- Crunchy!

276
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:34,105
That's it! My office! Right now!

277
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:36,649
Now!

278
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,103
You're gonna have so much detention,

279
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:46,639
your grandchildren'll be
staying after school.

280
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:50,538
Wow! Apparently, Noah rejected
the hyenas from the Ark

281
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:54,600
because he thought they were
an evil, impure mixture of dogs and cats.

282
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:56,694
Hyenas aren't well liked.

283
00:22:56,777 --> 00:23:00,155
They do seem to be the schmoes
of the animal kingdom.

284
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:04,368
Why couldn't Xander be possessed
by a puppy or some ducks?

285
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,527
That's assuming "possession" is the right word.

286
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:09,784
Oh, I'll say it is.
The Masai of the Serengeti have spoken of

287
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:12,658
animal possession for generations now.

288
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:15,403
- I should've remembered that.
- So, how does it work?

289
00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:18,590
Apparently, there's a sect
of animal worshippers known as primals.

290
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:23,094
They believe that... humanity...
consciousness... the soul

291
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,072
is a perversion, a dilution of spirit.

292
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,324
To them the animal state is holy.

293
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,519
They're able,
through transpossession, to-to...

294
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:34,622
draw the spirit of certain animals
into themselves.

295
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,708
And then they started acting like hyenas.

296
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,935
Only the most predatory of animals
are of interest to primals.

297
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:42,029
So, yes, that would fit.

298
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:45,666
So, what happens to the person
once the spirit's in them?

299
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:48,468
If it goes unchecked?

300
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,559
I gotta find Xander.

301
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:27,673
They are strong.

302
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,107
Xander!

303
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:53,405
This is ridiculous. We need to talk.

304
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,436
I've been waiting for you to jump my bones!

305
00:24:59,471 --> 00:25:05,000
I have seen some sick things
in my life, believe me!

306
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:07,544
But this is beyond the pale!

307
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:11,924
What is it with you people? Is it drugs?

308
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:17,178
How could you? A poor, defenseless pig!

309
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,889
What are you doing?

310
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:26,562
- Get off of me!
- Is that what you really want?

311
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:31,359
We both know what you really want.
You want danger, don't ya?

312
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:34,237
- You like your men dangerous.
- You're in trouble, Xander.

313
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,973
You are infected with some hyena thing.
It's like a demonic possession.

314
00:25:37,008 --> 00:25:42,044
Dangerous and mean, right?
Like Angel, your mystery guy.

315
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,604
Well, guess who just got mean.

316
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:48,317
Now stop that! You're only gonna
make things worse for yourselves.

317
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:52,913
I'll tell you how this is gonna work.
I am gonna call your parents,

318
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:55,646
and they're gonna take you all home.

319
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,539
Thank you.

320
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,168
I'm sorry.

321
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:09,603
That is it!

322
00:26:12,148 --> 00:26:15,359
Do you know how long I've waited

323
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:19,155
until you'd stop pretending
that we aren't attracted...

324
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:27,121
Until Willow stops kidding herself

325
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,799
that I could settle with anyone but you

326
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:32,792
Look, Xander, I don't wanna hurt you.

327
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:37,305
Now do you wanna hurt me?

328
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,076
Come on, Slayer. I like it when you're scared.

329
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,871
The more I scare you... the better you smell.

330
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:51,728
You're about this close to expulsion, people!

331
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:56,732
I'm willing to talk to the school
counselor and we can discuss options.

332
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,318
Get down from there this instant!

333
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:02,152
Ow!

334
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:05,532
Are you insane?!

335
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:34,711
Hurry up. We gotta get him
locked up somehow before he comes to.

336
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:37,405
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- I hit him.

337
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,474
- With what?
- A desk.

338
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:42,334
He tried his hand
at felony sexual assault.

339
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:46,597
- Oh, Buffy, the hyena in him didn't...
- No.

340
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:49,700
No, but it's safe to say that
in his animal state his idea of wooing

341
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:53,745
doesn't involve a Yanni CD
and a bottle of Chianti.

342
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:56,500
There. That oughta hold him. Where's Giles?

343
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:59,120
He got called to some teacher's meeting.
What are we gonna do?

344
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,420
I mean... How do we get Xander back?

345
00:28:01,503 --> 00:28:04,048
Right now I'm a little more worried about
what the rest of the pack are up to.

346
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:09,644
The rest of the pack was spotted
outside Herbert the mascot's cage.

347
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,850
- They were sent to the principal's office.
- Good. That'll show 'em.

348
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:17,708
Did it show 'em?

349
00:28:19,312 --> 00:28:21,489
They didn't hurt him, did they?

350
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:24,650
They, uh... ate him.

351
00:28:29,864 --> 00:28:32,449
They ate Principal Flutie?

352
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:34,159
Ate him up?

353
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:41,333
The, uh, official theory is that wild dogs
got into his office somehow.

354
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,835
There was no one at the scene.

355
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:48,381
But Xander didn't. He was with you.

356
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:51,760
Oh! Well, that's a small mercy.

357
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:54,779
Giles, how do we stop this?
How do you transpossess someone?

358
00:28:54,814 --> 00:28:57,423
I'm afraid I still don't have all the pieces.

359
00:28:57,458 --> 00:29:01,193
Accounts of the primals and their methods
are a bit thin on the ground.

360
00:29:01,228 --> 00:29:06,574
There is some talk of a predatory act,
but the exact ritual is, um...

361
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:15,332
The Malleus Maleficarum deals in the
particulars of demonic possession, which

362
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:17,951
may apply.

363
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:23,356
Yes. One should be able
to transfer the spirits to another human.

364
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:27,378
- Oh, that's great! Any volunteers?
- Oh. Good point.

365
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:30,109
What we need to do
is put the hyena back in the hyena.

366
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:33,483
- B-but until we know more, uh...
- Betcha that zookeeper could help us.

367
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:38,096
Maybe he didn't quarantine those hyenas
because they were sick.

368
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:40,306
- We should talk to him.
- OK.

369
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,892
- Oh, wait! Somebody's gotta watch Xander.
- I will.

370
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:48,063
- Will, are you sure? If he wakes up...
- I'll be all right. Go.

371
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:51,066
Come on.

372
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:00,632
Willow.

373
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:04,386
How are you feeling?

374
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:08,349
Like somebody hit me with a desk.

375
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:13,437
- What am I doing here?
- You're resting.

376
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:17,358
You guys got me locked up now.

377
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:19,860
'Cause you're sick. Buffy said.

378
00:31:19,943 --> 00:31:22,825
Oh, yeah. Buffy
and her all-purpose solution.

379
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:24,939
Punch 'em out, knock 'em down.

380
00:31:24,974 --> 00:31:27,250
I'd love to see what she'd do
to somebody who was really sick.

381
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,495
That's not fair!
Buffy's saved both of our lives.

382
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:34,482
Before she came here, our lives didn't
need that much saving, did they?

383
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:39,170
Weren't things a lot simpler
when it was just you and me?

384
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,967
- Maybe.
- When we were alone together.

385
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:48,261
Willow, I know there's something
wrong with me. I think it's getting worse.

386
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:51,144
But I can't just stand around
waiting for Buffy to decide it's time

387
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:53,650
to punch me out again.

388
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:57,805
Look, I want you to help me. I want you.

389
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,952
I am helping you.

390
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:02,830
You're doing what you're told.

391
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:07,848
Buffy's trying to help you, too.
You know that.

392
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:10,282
- Or Xander does.
- Yeah.

393
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:15,062
Buffy's so selfless.
Always thinking of us.

394
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:18,249
Well, if I'm so dangerous,
how come she left you alone with me?

395
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:20,334
- I told her to.
- Why?

396
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:23,629
'Cause I know you better than she does.

397
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:28,551
And I wanted to be here to see if
you were still you.

398
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:31,637
You know I am.

399
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:33,306
Look at me.

400
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:40,061
Look.

401
00:32:40,145 --> 00:32:42,230
Xander...

402
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:46,234
Now I know.

403
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:49,362
Let me out! Let me out!

404
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:52,483
- The students have been possessed?
- Yes!

405
00:32:52,982 --> 00:32:55,789
- Are you sure?
- We're really, really sure.

406
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:58,095
You don't seem
enormously surprised by this.

407
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,297
The zoo imported those hyenas from Africa.

408
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:02,875
There was something strange
about them from day one.

409
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,920
I did some homework.
That particular breed is very rare.

410
00:33:07,004 --> 00:33:11,425
Totally vicious. Historically,
they were worshipped by these guys.

411
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:14,094
- Primals.
- Yeah. Creepy guys.

412
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:17,514
Now, they had rituals
for taking the hyena spirits, but

413
00:33:17,598 --> 00:33:20,109
I don't see how that
could've happened to your kids.

414
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:24,362
We don't know how the ritual works.
Only that it involves, uh,

415
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:26,480
a predatory act and some kind of symbol.

416
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,815
Predatory act? Of course.
That makes sense.

417
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,683
- Where did you read that?
- D'you have Sherman Jeffries' work

418
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:36,132
- on cults and...
- Boys?

419
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,117
- Sorry.
- Look. Look...

420
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:40,306
I think we may have enough information

421
00:33:40,307 --> 00:33:44,482
so that together we could
pull off a reverse transpossession.

422
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:45,500
What do we do?

423
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:48,961
You've gotta get those possessed students
over to the hyena cage right away.

424
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:51,505
I'll meet you there.
We can begin the rituals.

425
00:33:51,618 --> 00:33:53,257
Well, we can guarantee you one of them,

426
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,816
but there are four more and
we have no idea where they are.

427
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,386
No, I wouldn't worry about that.

428
00:33:57,421 --> 00:34:00,174
After hyenas feed and rest, they will track

429
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:02,933
the missing member of their pack
until they find him.

430
00:34:02,968 --> 00:34:05,644
They should come right to you.

431
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:08,599
Willow!

432
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:16,362
Willow!

433
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:18,948
I'm not listening.

434
00:34:31,585 --> 00:34:34,338
Willow

435
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:39,801
Willow

436
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,762
Xander shut up!

437
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:45,515
Willow!

438
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:42,419
Run!

439
00:36:55,557 --> 00:36:58,452
- I think they're going.
- They could be faking it.

440
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:00,861
No, they're hungry.
They'll be looking for somebody weak.

441
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:03,376
I'm really sorry, Will. I didn't know
they were gonna come after Xander.

442
00:37:03,377 --> 00:37:05,419
- It's OK.
- We must lead them back to the zoo.

443
00:37:05,454 --> 00:37:07,836
- if we're going to stop it.
- And before their next meal.

444
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:09,791
- Guess that's my job.
- Well, individually

445
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:11,699
they're almost as strong as you.
As a group, they're...

446
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:14,061
They're tough,
but I think they're getting stupider.

447
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:17,654
You guys go to the zoo
and I will bring them to you.

448
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:23,292
I didn't say she looks better than you.
I said she looks better.

449
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:29,672
I heard what I heard. Joey, chew.
You have to chew or you'll choke.

450
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:38,014
I don't see why we have to have
this conversation every time we see them.

451
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:40,600
I didn't start it.

452
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:42,935
Damn!

453
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:45,897
- Where are the keys?
- Huh?

454
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:49,691
Joey!

455
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:51,443
Joey!

456
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:53,945
Joey.

457
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,159
Get out!

458
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,164
What's going on?
Hey, get off! Get off!

459
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:11,546
Joey! Joey!

460
00:38:12,047 --> 00:38:13,340
Joey!

461
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:23,224
Joey!

462
00:38:24,192 --> 00:38:26,819
Didn't your mom teach you?

463
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:29,363
Don't play with your food.

464
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:39,498
Come on. You know what you want.

465
00:38:51,468 --> 00:38:53,929
The pathway to the hyena house.

466
00:38:54,462 --> 00:38:57,674
- Where's the zookeeper?
- He must be inside.

467
00:38:57,757 --> 00:38:59,716
I'll go in and prepare things. You just...

468
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:04,244
warn, uh, us when you hear
Buffy and the others approaching.

469
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:30,496
Doctor?

470
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:34,042
Uh... zookeeper?

471
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:42,884
Oh, of course. The, uh...
Masai ceremonial garb. Yes. Very good.

472
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:46,929
Are you, uh, otherwise prepared
for the transpossession?

473
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:49,057
Almost.

474
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:54,811
Oh, right. The, uh sacred circle.

475
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,481
Yes, you'd need that to, um...

476
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:01,985
But this would be here when...
when the children first came.

477
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,197
Why would you...?

478
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,812
How terribly frustrating for you,

479
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:15,690
that a bunch of schoolchildren
could accomplish what you could not.

480
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:18,250
It bothered me.

481
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:21,462
But the power will be mine.

482
00:40:50,774 --> 00:40:53,935
They're almost here! Giles! Giles!

483
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,079
Where are the hyenas
for the transpossession?

484
00:40:56,114 --> 00:41:00,917
They're right here in the feeding area.
Stay back. They haven't been fed.

485
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:04,128
- Where's Giles?
- He's... laying in wait.

486
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,206
They're almost here!
Shouldn't you bring the hyenas out?

487
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:11,010
When the time is right.
I'm gonna need your help.

488
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,473
They're right behind me!

489
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,642
That's Buffy. Get ready!

490
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,187
- Here.
- What is this?

491
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,189
A predatory act, remember?

492
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:28,234
Uh, right.
You'll pretend to slash my throat and

493
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,572
- and put the evil in the hyenas?
- Something like that.

494
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:36,951
Buffy, it's a trap!

494
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,309
YU BA YA SA NA!

495
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:55,802
Willow!

496
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:37,176
Uh... did I miss anything?

497
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,264
I heard the vice principal's taking over
till they can find a replacement.

498
00:42:43,348 --> 00:42:45,137
Shouldn't be too hard
to find a new principal.

499
00:42:45,138 --> 00:42:47,419
Unless they ask
what happened to the last one.

500
00:42:47,454 --> 00:42:49,262
OK, but I had nothing
to do with that, right?

501
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:51,385
- Right.
- You only ate the pig.

502
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,110
I ate a pig? Was he cooked
and called bacon, or...

503
00:42:55,193 --> 00:42:57,279
Oh, my God! I ate a pig?

504
00:42:57,362 --> 00:42:59,871
I mean, the whole
trichinosis issue aside, yuck!

505
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:02,479
- Well, it wasn't really you.
- Well, I remember

506
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:05,077
I was goin' on the field trip,
and then goin' down to the Hyena House,

507
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,406
and next thing, some guy's
holding Willow and he's got a knife.

508
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:12,543
- You saved my life.
- Hey, nobody messes with my Willow.

509
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:20,884
This is definitely the superior Xander.
Accept no substitutes.

510
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:23,279
I didn't do anything else, did l,
around you guys?

511
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:26,054
Anything embarrassing?

512
00:43:27,391 --> 00:43:30,268
- Nah!
- Not at all.

513
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:32,612
- C'mon. We're gonna be late.
- See you at lunch.

514
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:33,855
Cool!

515
00:43:33,938 --> 00:43:37,741
Oh, hey, going vegetarian, huh?

516
00:43:40,403 --> 00:43:42,739
I've been reading up on my...
animal possession.

517
00:43:42,822 --> 00:43:47,633
I cannot find anything anywhere
about... memory loss afterwards.

518
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:53,181
- Did you tell them that?
- Your secret dies with me.

519
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:57,651
Shoot me, stuff me, mount me.
