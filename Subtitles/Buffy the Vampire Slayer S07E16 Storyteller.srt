Somebody! Help!

4
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:11,768
We gotta get out of this town. Mexico.

5
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:14,212
lt's not a happy scenario,

6
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:17,205
but we're dealing with the Big Bad
that can be any dead person.

7
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:20,808
You know the rules.
l can't take corporeal form.

8
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:23,970
l don't think l can kill anybody else.

9
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:31,525
Look who l found. Guess who was buying
mass amounts of blood at the butcher's shop.

10
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:34,571
Andrew is our... Actually, he's our hostage.

11
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:37,884
l like to think of myself more as a "guestage".

12
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:39,929
<i>- They're all slayers?</i>
<i>- Potential slayers.</i>

13
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:43,767
<i>There were many more like them all over</i>
<i>the world, but now there's just a handful.</i>

- Oh, Principal Wood.

15
00:00:46,973 --> 00:00:49,168
l'd like to take you out to dinner.

16
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:51,528
- l'd be happy to have dinner with you.
- Great.

17
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:54,605
- How do you know about slayers?
- My mother was one.

18
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:56,251
She was killed when l was four.

Oh, hello there, gentle viewers.

23
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:21,924
You caught me catching up
on an old favourite.

24
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:25,722
lt's... wonderful to get lost in a story, isn't it?

25
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:30,686
Adventure and heroics and discovery.

26
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,241
Don't they just take you away?

Join me on a new voyage of the mind.

29
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:55,683
A little tale l like to call:
"Buffy, Slayer of the Vampires".

30
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:05,566
<i>(Andrew) lt was cold last night and the wind</i>
<i>was cruel, but the Slayer had a job to do.</i>

31
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:21,401
<i>Unfortunately, vampires have a job to do too.</i>

32
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:36,407
Ouch! My goodness!
Things look bad for the Slayer, don't they?

33
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:41,089
She didn't see that second vampire,
concealed by cover of darkness,

34
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:43,289
- ready...
- <i>(knocking)</i>

35
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:46,445
..ready to attack and make her
his own vampirical spawn.

36
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,684
<i>- (knocking continues)</i>
- Let's rejoin them now to see...

37
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:54,403
For God's sakes, Andrew, you've been
in here for 30 minutes. What are you doing?

38
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:57,485
Entertaining and educating.

39
00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:01,566
Why can't you just masturbate
like the rest of us?

40
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:06,849
That was great. l got you dusting that guy
on film. Why do vampires show up on video?

41
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:11,051
l told you l didn't want you doing that.
lt's distracting.

42
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,488
l'll cut it together
and do the intro tomorrow.

43
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:17,771
- "She was a woman in danger, or was she?"
- Are you still filming me? Stop!

44
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:23,485
But it's a valuable record. An important
document for the ages. "A slayer in action."

45
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:27,805
"A nerd in pain." Would they like that?
Cos we could do that.

46
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,363
But the story needs to be told.

47
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:34,092
Birds need to fly
and girls need to use the toilet.

48
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:39,201
Why were you video-taping yourself,
anyway? Sounds like kinky business to me.

49
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:41,363
The world will wanna know about Buffy.

50
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:46,288
lt's a story of ultimate triumph tinged with
bitterness for what's been lost in the struggle.

51
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:49,763
- lt's a legacy for future generations.
- lf there are any.

52
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:53,607
Buffy thinks that this apocalypse
is going to actually be apocalyptic.

53
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,288
l think your story seems pretty pointless.

54
00:04:57,373 --> 00:05:00,843
Oh. l was gonna interview you later today.

55
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:05,290
Cos, you know, your unique
perspective on the whole thing.

56
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:09,491
Give it editorial balance and... glamour.

57
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:11,762
Oh...

58
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:17,211
Well, balance is important.
People don't always take that into account.

59
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:19,568
l could bring that to you. Absolutely.

60
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:25,004
Let's explore the world of our story, shall we?

61
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:28,369
Buffy lives in Sunnydale, California.

62
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:32,403
This is the local high school.

63
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:37,328
There's a Hellmouth...
Hellmouth... underneath the high school.

64
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:40,325
See, weird things happen on a Hellmouth.

65
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:46,124
lt attracts all sorts of bad people
and demons and vampires.

66
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:53,767
Now there's this thing in the basement of
the high school called the Seal of Danzalthar,

67
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,323
and it's sort of a door to the Hellmouth.

68
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:04,292
Due to some circumstances,
it got opened up... a little bit...

69
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,408
recently.

70
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:12,729
And this nasty, nasty
vampire thing came out of it.

71
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:15,691
lt was just awful.

72
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:17,764
lt was awful.

73
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:20,603
This whole thing

74
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:25,369
is being orchestrated
by something called "the First".

75
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:28,053
lt's made up of all the evil in the whole world.

76
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:31,969
Oh, there's also these guys.

77
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:37,169
They work for the First.

78
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:41,728
We don't know much about them
except for they're very ugly

79
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:46,170
and they're very mobile for blind people.

80
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:50,487
ls that all clear?

81
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:54,965
- lt's morning in Sunnydale...
- Who the hell's got the low-fat milk?

82
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:56,691
lt's morning in Sunnydale,

83
00:06:56,773 --> 00:07:02,166
and the women of Command Central take the
time to fortify themselves for the day ahead.

84
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:05,006
- Hey!
- <i>(Andrew)</i> Women and Xander.

85
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:07,887
Hey, l'm gonna do your special intro later.

86
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:10,612
"The man who is the heart
of the Slayer machine."

87
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,684
Yeah? The heart?

88
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:16,488
Things are tense this morning.

89
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:22,808
Buffy is concerned with some unknown
danger and the air is filled with foreboding.

90
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:26,169
- Oh, we're out of Raisin Bran.
- l'll put it on the list.

91
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:29,962
That's probably not the unknown danger.

92
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:34,767
Look at this place.
Damn girls' dorm is what it is.

93
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:38,129
That's nice. Second-hand stinkiness.

94
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:43,446
lt's a full house. l think it's a good time
to do some introductions, gentle viewers.

95
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,526
- l'm Amanda, and l grew up right here...
- Not you, sweetheart.

96
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:48,841
<i>(Dawn laughs)</i>

97
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:52,121
Let's start from the top.

98
00:07:54,173 --> 00:08:00,931
<i>You've already met Buffy. She's beautiful,</i>
<i>with a lion's heart and the face of an angel.</i>

99
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:06,212
<i>She's never afraid because</i>
<i>she knows her side will always win.</i>

100
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:12,004
<i>Buffy and Spike have some kind of history.</i>
<i>You can feel the heat between them,</i>

101
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:17,167
<i>although technically, as a vampire,</i>
<i>he's room temperature.</i>

102
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:23,688
<i>Anya - a feisty waif with a fiery temper</i>
<i>and a vulnerable heart that she hides,</i>

103
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:25,764
<i>even from herseIf.</i>

104
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:35,170
<i>This lovely girl- l don't remember her name.</i>

105
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,642
ls he doing that again?
Can't we make him stop?

106
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:41,567
l don't know. lf we save the world,
it will be kinda nice to have a record of it.

107
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:45,282
lf we don't save the world,
then... nothing matters.

108
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:49,082
That's catchy, Amanda.
Let's make that our slogan.

109
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:52,768
lt is strange how you keep saving the world,
and there's not any proof.

110
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:55,083
Yeah. For future generations.

111
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:59,485
And it does help the girls with training.
You know, viewing the tapes.

112
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,724
- No one else thinks this is idiotic?
- <i>(Xander)</i> Or is it important?

113
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:05,281
Buff, l don't get why
this bothers you so much.

114
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:09,685
Because it's a waste of time.
Someone has to agree with me. Spike?

115
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:13,004
Long as you're not pointing it at me.
lt keeps the boy busy.

116
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:17,291
This isn't about keeping busy.
This is about war.

117
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:23,972
l'm sorry to jump all over you guys,
but l have to tell you what's really going on.

118
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:29,170
There's something new. Amanda, Dawn,
you're gonna stay home from school today.

119
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:31,642
We can survive what's coming,
but not like this.

120
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:37,165
l had a vision of what's to come.
A horrible vision.

121
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:38,527
Hundreds upon hundreds...

122
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:42,845
Gentle viewers, these motivating speeches
of hers tend to get a little long.

123
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,367
l'll take you back in there in a while.

124
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:49,332
ln the in-between time, l thought
you might want to know a little about me,

125
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:51,290
your humble host.

126
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:56,731
You see, l'm a man with a burden.
A man with a dark past.

127
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:01,083
You see, l was once a supervillain.

128
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:05,768
Thus the validity
of the Bronsted-Debye-Huckel equation

129
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:09,562
at low ionic strength has been amply tested,

130
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:12,645
and the charges
on the reactant ions are well known,

131
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:15,452
if their reagents are properly characterised.

132
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,491
- lt smells funny.
- l know. Kinda sweaty.

133
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:22,566
- What'll it do to Buffy?
- Make her supermagnetic!

134
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:27,044
- Wow! She won't be able to get out of her car.
- Knives and sharp things will fly at her.

135
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,522
We could walk by her,
she'd not be able to stop us.

136
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:32,605
Unless we had metal belt buckles,
then we'd stick to her.

137
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:35,253
ln my plan, we are beltless.

138
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,801
Wow! You're the best, Andrew.

139
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:41,966
- Yep. Good-looking and smart too.
- Yeah, wow!

140
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:47,248
Warren was cool.
And wasn't Jonathan just the cutest thing?

141
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,803
Well, shall we see if Buffy's still talking?

142
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:54,886
l mean mentally. And from what l've seen
so far, there's no way you girls...

143
00:10:54,973 --> 00:11:00,093
She's not done. Even Willow looks bored and
she can take a lot of that stuff. Look at her.

144
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:03,370
Ooh, ooh. Do you see that? That's important.

145
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:08,481
Willow and Kennedy have been in kind of
a bad place lately, but things are looking up.

146
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:12,566
You see, Kennedy pursued
the reluctant Willow and won her heart,

147
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:17,727
only to find herself frightened when she saw
the darkness within the witch's mind.

148
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:23,490
Side-note: l once had my own
personal encounter with Dark Willow.

149
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,203
Jonathan. Andrew.

150
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,806
You boys like magic, don't you?

151
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:31,565
Abracadabra.

152
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,809
- <i>(Jonathan yelps)</i>
- Haltem!

153
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:38,407
OK. Didn't see that coming.

154
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:41,883
- We have power you can't imagine.
- We do?

155
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:45,568
You, Dark Willow, wield the force
of mighty evil, it is true.

156
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:48,884
- But you are new to the game, little one.
- You know what they say.

157
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:52,409
- lf at first, you don't succeed...
- Holy cats, here it comes again.

158
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,806
l deflect thy power.

159
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:59,566
Damn, that is one effective counterspell.

160
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:03,441
Thank you, little one. Thank you.

161
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:06,605
She was something. lndeed she was.

162
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:13,766
Hey, l think Buffy stopped talking.
That usually means she had to go to work.

163
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:17,528
Let's see what the little locusts
left for breakfast, shall we?

164
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,206
Not late. Not late till the bell rings.

165
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:28,613
Hey! Hey! Break it up!

166
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,047
- <i>(bell)</i>
- Get to class.

167
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,524
Uh-oh.

168
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:49,286
Hey, shy girl. Don't do this.

169
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:52,244
Oh.

170
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:56,092
- You knew l was there.
- Yeah.

171
00:12:56,173 --> 00:13:00,405
- You noticed me.
- lt's OK, l promise. lt may seem that...

172
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,370
What's wrong?

173
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:09,727
The mirror said l was fat. lt said it.

174
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,730
l can't take this semester any more.
lt's so much to handle.

175
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:18,603
Not only does Mr Hildebrand move up the trig
exam, but it also covers three more chapters.

176
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:21,651
l've got an English paper due tomorrow.
l'm gonna explode.

177
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:25,726
Hey, l can help. You just need to relax.

178
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:28,885
Maybe one of you guys
could give him a foot rub?

179
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:31,644
Something bad is going on.

180
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:34,725
- ls that right?
- Oh, you're hurt. What happened?

181
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:38,044
Someone threw a rock at me
as l got out of my car.

182
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:41,569
- l didn't get a chance to see who.
- lt could have been any of 'em.

183
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:44,725
Students, teachers.
Something is going on today.

184
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:49,603
Yes, well, that occurred to me
as l ducked the other two rocks.

185
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:52,002
Buffy, what the hell is this?

186
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:55,881
- Everything.
- Slowly, l may be concussed here.

187
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:06,290
There's this thing that happens here,
in this school, over the Hellmouth,

188
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:14,053
where the way a thing feels...
it kind of starts being that way... for real.

189
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:18,684
l've seen all these things before.
Just not all at once.

190
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:22,402
So, what, it's like hell's a-bustin' out all over?

191
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,007
Exactly.

192
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,842
- What's the worst that can happen?
- War, pretty much.

193
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:34,687
l see you're being amusing now
with comical exaggeration.

194
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,607
Being in high school can feel
like being at war. Now it's true.

195
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:43,642
The students feel the teachers are out to get
them. The chess club resents the French club.

196
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,008
Everybody hates the cheerleaders.

197
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,005
lf we don't do something,
we'll have a riot on our hands.

198
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:51,368
And a lot of other nasty stuff too.

199
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:53,762
- Like what?
- Aargh!

200
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:59,767
Really shoulda had that foot rub.

201
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:08,006
Dawn is a typical American teenager -
bubbly and sweet with a hunger for fun

202
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:10,971
and a smile that lights up the room.

203
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:13,286
Hello.

204
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:17,969
Dawn used to be a key.
l don't really know what that means.

205
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:25,370
Hey. Here's something l think you're
going to be interested in, gentle viewers.

206
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:28,445
Look at the work Xander did
replacing that window sash.

207
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,889
You can't even tell it's new,
it blends in so well.

208
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,168
He's extraordinary.

209
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:41,327
You've dealt with this before? l mean,
you've seen stuff like this in a high school?

210
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:46,246
Sure. You know, swim team monsters
or killer prom dogs.

211
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,767
Again, not all at once.

212
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:51,651
So, what makes now so special?

213
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:54,725
My guess, it's that seal thing in the basement.

214
00:15:55,573 --> 00:16:00,283
All the Hellmouth's energy is trying to escape
from that one spot, and it's getting all...

215
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:02,364
Focusy.

216
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:07,452
Careful. You're starting to speak like me now.

217
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:13,172
This is Xander and Anya interview No.1
for "Buffy, a Slayer of the Vampires".

218
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:14,606
That's what it's called?

219
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:18,481
That or "Buffy, the Slayer
Who Knew No Fear".

220
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:22,122
- l like that one.
- Thank you, Xander. That's sweet of you.

221
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:28,806
l understand that exactly one year ago today
you left Anya at the altar. Any comment?

222
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:32,852
- Whoa. What the hell...?
- l just think people will be interested.

223
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:36,403
l know l am. What do you have
to say for yourself one year later?

224
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:39,690
l've apologised enough.
That's what l have to say.

225
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,571
But it was something
that called for an apology?

226
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,211
Well, yes.

227
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:47,205
So you don't think
it was the right thing to do?

228
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,409
Of course he doesn't think it was.

229
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:52,610
- lt was the right thing to do.
- What?

230
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:55,441
lnteresting. l think
we're getting to something.

231
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:59,731
Anya, if l had married you, it would have been
against everything l thought was best.

232
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:02,885
- lt wouldn't have worked.
- But we...

233
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:06,081
We still spark.

234
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,722
l getjealous of you. You getjealous of me.

235
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:13,882
You still love me.

236
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:19,052
ls that true, Xander? Do you still love her?

237
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:27,322
- l swear we just covered this thing up.
- lt doesn't wanna stay hidden.

238
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:32,646
lt wants to turn these kids into monsters
and victims and who knows what.

239
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,928
lt's more than that.

240
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,322
Look, Robin, l...

241
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:39,881
l had a vision the other day.

242
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:43,522
You have visions?

243
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:45,808
- Sometimes.
- Oh.

244
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:51,050
Well, how do you know
that they're notjust dreams?

245
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:54,250
You're running to catch the bus naked?
That's a dream.

246
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:58,292
Army of vicious vampire creatures?
That's a vision.

247
00:17:58,373 --> 00:18:00,933
- Also l was awake.
- A bus to where?

248
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:05,449
- l mean, an army of how many?
- Hundreds.

249
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:08,570
Maybe hundreds of hundreds.

250
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:11,963
All l know is the last Ubervamp l faced
crawled out of that hole.

251
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:15,523
lt makes me awfully nervous.
What are you doing?

252
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:18,764
Have you ever really studied it?
Gotten close?

253
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:21,731
Well, l know it's a goat with its tongue out.

254
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,407
Willow did a search
on the symbolic database,

255
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:27,724
but it turns out everybody likes
a good goat's tongue.

256
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:32,125
Rock groups, covens, Greek cookbooks.
She said she couldn't narrow it down.

257
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:36,604
- And you trust her?
- Yes. Why wouldn't l trust her?

258
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:40,003
Why should any of you trust each other?
You've all been evil.

259
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:42,846
No, that's not true.

260
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:47,085
Yeah, Willow had a bad patch,
but l've never been.

261
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:50,768
Evil is what evil does,
and l know what you're doing.

262
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:57,528
You're with that vampire,
screwing that vampire.

263
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:59,808
You filthy whore!

264
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:03,453
Robin, are you OK?

265
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,524
Whoa...

266
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:07,731
What happened?

267
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,885
l... think it was controlling you.

268
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:17,321
Buffy, we gotta get rid of this seal. Shut
it down before it starts affecting everyone.

269
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:20,052
l have a pretty good idea
who we should talk to.

270
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:23,091
Yeah? Who's that?

271
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:26,404
The guy that fed it its first drop of blood.

272
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:28,484
<i>(oinking)</i>

273
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:33,413
God, l hope that's not a student.

274
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:41,161
l thought l told you to piss off with
this bloody camera. Yet here you are again.

275
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:44,051
Would you sod off
before l rip your throat out and...

276
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:48,251
<i>(Andrew)</i> Spike, the light
was kinda behind you.

277
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,324
Oh, right.

278
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:54,928
ls this better then?

279
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:59,487
l thought l told you
to piss off with that camera.

280
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,928
Here you are again. Would you sod off...

281
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:06,165
- You keep dodging the question.
- l don't mean to.

282
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:09,689
lt's just... You know how l feel, right?

283
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:13,686
You were the one who didn't want
to keep seeing each other.

284
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:16,526
Now we hop on the merry-go-round
of rotating knives.

285
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:21,607
l blame you, and you blame me,
and we both end up all cut to shreds.

286
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:24,048
Please just tell...

287
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,328
Do you still love me?

288
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:28,131
Yes.

289
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:31,125
l still love you. l always will.

290
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:33,568
l just don't know if that
means anything for us.

291
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:35,644
l love you too.

292
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:40,051
l don't know if that means anything either.

293
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,324
Well, it's nice to hear.

294
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:48,852
<i>l'm not gonna find</i>
<i>anyone out there like you, am l?</i>

295
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,724
<i>Doesn't seem likely.</i>

296
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:55,852
<i>l guess l'm more replaceable, obviously.</i>

297
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,924
<i>No.</i>

298
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:00,684
<i>There's no one like you, Xander.</i>

299
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:04,368
<i>You were willing to stand up to danger,</i>
<i>even when you had no weapons.</i>

300
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:07,092
<i>You were ready to protect me with your life.</i>

301
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:11,292
<i>l guess we fit together pretty good.</i>

302
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:14,046
<i>(Anya) We fit together great.</i>

303
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:17,921
<i>(Xander) Sometimes</i>
<i>l wanna be back in your life.</i>

304
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:21,801
<i>(Anya) l hope you know</i>
<i>you never left my heart.</i>

305
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:31,292
<i>l'm not gonna find</i>
<i>anyone out there like you, am l?</i>

306
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:34,408
<i>Doesn't seem likely.</i>

307
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,529
Heads up, Andrew. We gotta talk.

308
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:40,845
- We just spent the day keeping a lid on a war.
- That would be very exciting on tape.

309
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:44,892
The school is out of control with energy
from the Hellmouth. lt's time to help.

310
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:49,364
- Right now l'm more about the recording...
- No! No more watching.

311
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:54,129
The seal thing is your baby, and you gotta
get in there before it tears everything apart.

312
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:14,604
<i>(chanting)</i>

313
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:32,481
<i>(voice) Desde abajo te devora.</i>

314
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:35,767
<i>Desde abajo te devora.</i>

315
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:51,126
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- <i>Jesús.</i>

316
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:53,329
Did you have it again?

317
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,483
l had it again.

318
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:59,532
That voice... "Desme abdul te debora."

319
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:02,252
What does it mean? What does it mean?

320
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:06,042
Let's try looking it up again
in the morning in the dictionario.

321
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:09,569
- Holy cats, that was terrifying.
- We're fugitives.

322
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:15,046
Haunted by our past, tormented
by a message we don't understand.

323
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:19,092
We're hunted men, driven mad
by forces beyond our understanding.

324
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:24,372
We're men of faded power, tortured
from within by a voice... out of nowhere.

325
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:27,889
l don't deserve this. l wasn't even that evil.

326
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,766
- l thought you were evil.
- Yeah?

327
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:33,844
Sure.

328
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:40,168
l respected your ideas for evil projects.
l thought you had good follow-through.

329
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:44,212
Oh... Well, thanks. lt's nice that you noticed.

<i>(Willow) We're getting off track here.</i>

331
00:23:46,613 --> 00:23:49,332
l don't wanna do this any more.
Everyone's staring at me.

332
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:53,565
Just focus on the charm. You have to focus
on the charm to pull the memories out.

333
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:56,565
- Tell us about the seal.
- lt tickles and l'm all tense.

334
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:59,451
- Can't l have a cool, refreshing Zima?
- <i>(Buffy)</i> No Zima.

335
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,683
<i>(Spike)</i> Shut up about the Zima. Just talk.

336
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,846
You were the first to feed the seal blood.
How did you know what to do?

337
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:09,050
l don't know. Stuff happened. l forget.

338
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:11,931
So remember. Look at the charm.

339
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:15,608
But l'm not a part of this.
l document, l don't participate.

340
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:18,605
l'm the journalist,
recording with a neutral eye.

341
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:22,732
Andrew! Stop it, or l'm going
to smash this camera over your head.

342
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:24,804
l might do that anyway, so talk.

343
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:28,124
- Stop going off topic.
- l wasn't off topic.

344
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:32,604
lt's gonna get relevant in a second, because
Jonathan's gonna go to the bathroom.

345
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:35,807
l'm gonna go to the bathroom.

346
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:41,888
<i>(# sings "La Cucaracha")</i>

347
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:52,284
Did you get the knife?

348
00:24:52,973 --> 00:24:55,248
God...

349
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,893
- l'm glad to see you.
- Me too. You're looking good.

350
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:00,885
Am l? l probably have pillow creases.

351
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:05,649
No, no, it's good. You're a man on the run.
You have a wild, desperate thing going.

352
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:10,366
Did you... did you get the knife?

353
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:15,402
Yeah. lt wasn't easy. l had to meet this demon
guy who sells weird weapons and stuff.

354
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:17,848
- Show me.
- Well, l didn't buy them,

355
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:22,563
but there were poison arrows
and this sort of collapsible sword...

356
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:25,247
- Show me the knife!
- Oh, right.

357
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:29,565
- Quick, before the shortcake comes back.
- Oh, it'll be a while.

358
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,644
He's got a shy bladder.

359
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:36,090
- Jonathan, you OK in there?
- Don't talk to me. l'm fine.

360
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:43,012
Pretty knife. Except the stabbing...
l don't think l can do it.

361
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:47,689
Jonathan has been a good friend to me
here in <i>México.</i> He said he'll buy me a burro.

362
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:51,527
Oh, you can stab him. lt's all part of the plan.

363
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:55,322
That boy's blood is
a powerful tribute. lt's a gift

364
00:25:55,413 --> 00:26:00,931
to something very big, very important,
and, ultimately, won't even hurt him.

365
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:03,607
We get a reward. You and me and him too.

366
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:09,086
- We live as gods.
- That's right, man. The Trio. Livin' as gods.

367
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:11,885
<i>#</i> We are gods

368
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:14,282

<i>#</i> We are as gods, we are as gods!

370
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:21,525
There's power in that knife.

371
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:25,447
Drive the words deep into him.
lt's the only way for us to get our reward.

372
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:29,606
Got it. lf l kill him with this knife,
we live as gods.

373
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:32,971
Wait a second. Go back.
What was that part again?

374
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:34,406
You mean this part?

375
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,961
<i>#</i> We are as gods

376
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:40,841
Not that part. We need to see that knife.
There's something there.

377
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,924
Kennedy, search his stuff.

378
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:48,041
lt's not in my stuff.
lt's in the kitchen in the cutlery drawer.

379
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:50,044
You didn't have any steak knives.

380
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:53,523
You put your old murder weapon
in with our utensils?

381
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,286
- l washed it.
- What are you looking for?

382
00:26:56,373 --> 00:27:01,572
He said the First said something about
words. "Drive the words deep into him."

383
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:06,408
There was some carving on the blade.
l just thought it was a pattern.

384
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:08,484
Found it.

385
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:16,052
OK, you're Mr Demon-Summoner.
How are you with demon languages?

386
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:23,562
Whoa, you were right. lt's in Tawarick.
lt's, like, proto-Tawarick. lt's really, really old.

387
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:27,009
- But what's the big?
- We've never known anything about this seal.

388
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:31,245
Now we know that this knife and
this language are connected to it somehow.

389
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:34,769
- Andrew, do you speak Tawarick?
- l'm OK with it.

390
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,367
lt says...

391
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:42,925
"The blood which l spill
l consecrate to the oldest evil."

392
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:44,048
<i>(Kennedy)</i> Creepy.

393
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:48,524
Will, what are you thinking?
You think you can do something with that?

394
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:50,922
Let me work on it.

395
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:53,208
l think it's got a shot.

396
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:59,446
Guess what, Andy. You just won yourself
a free vacation to the Hellmouth.

397
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:02,093
So he can do what?
Yell at it in its own language?

398
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:03,731
- Maybe.
- What?

399
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:07,567
- l'm not following.
- We have to deal with the seal right away.

400
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:11,612
We might have to shut the school,
and l'm not losing more territory to the First.

401
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:13,809
Besides, it's all we've got.

402
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:19,126
The seal responds to this language somehow,
or the First wouldn't have needed the knife.

403
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:23,001
Andrew knows the language,
can talk to it, maybe give it commands.

404
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:25,971
Come on. Robin, Spike, let's go.

405
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:43,362
- Riot that almost happened.
- Looks to me like it happened after all.

406
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:47,570
Looks to me like it's still happening.

407
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:53,567
Nice way to run a school.
There's gotta be kids injured in here.

408
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:56,213
Yeah. Easy pickings for the likes of you.

409
00:28:57,053 --> 00:29:00,045
- Hey, here to help, you know.
- Right.

410
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:05,246
Check out Spike and the principal.
There's something going on there.

411
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,052
Sexual tension you could cut with a knife.

412
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:14,804
<i>(distant shouting)</i>

413
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:22,887
- These kids went nuts, didn't they?
- No kidding.

414
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:26,568
- Shh, they'll hear you.
- Buffy, they're all the way down...

415
00:29:31,093 --> 00:29:33,971
- Spike!
- The kids are getting stronger.

416
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:37,363
<i>(Andrew)</i> Oh, God. Struck down
before l achieve redemption.

417
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:12,528

- They'll live.

418
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:22,604
Spike, Wood, l need you to stay here,
hold our line of retreat.

419
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:26,447
So l'll stay here with these men,
helping out that holding the line thing.

420
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,524
l'll be with Buffy.

421
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:34,486
We make our way down the stairs,
alert for any danger.

422
00:30:34,573 --> 00:30:36,803
- Oh, stop it.
- l was just...

423
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:38,611
No more.

424
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:41,332
But l want the world to see what you do.

425
00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:44,962
- This is too important to show the world.
- Ooh, l like that.

426
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:48,932
Be quiet! l don't want a biographer,
especially a murderer.

427
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:54,326
Yeah, about that. We keep tossing that word
around, but that's not really what happened.

428
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:58,452
What? You stabbed Jonathan to death.
What were you trying to do?

429
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:01,843
- Scratch his back from the front?
- lt was confusing.

430
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:05,482
Jonathan and l were digging, but Warren
was there. Only l could see him.

431
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:11,170
- <i>(Andrew)</i> Not one of them cares about you.
- But l care about them. That's why l'm here.

432
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:14,211
- Do it. Stab him.
- No, l can't do it.

433
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:16,011
- What?
- Do it now.

434
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:18,129
- This isn't right.
- Stab him.

435
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:20,568
- Who are you talking to?
- What's wrong with you?

436
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:24,771
- Are you a little coward?
- No. But did you think l could use this?

437
00:31:24,853 --> 00:31:26,445
- That's good.
- A knife?

438
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,489
- Just do it.
- What's going on?

439
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:31,963
- He's making me do it.
- You tricked me.

440
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:35,329
- Damn you! l'll kill you first.
- Stab him. You have to!

441
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:38,450

- No, l just thought you would say that.

445
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:59,730

No. We are going in.

Go.

459
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:56,483
Nope. They're OK.

Spike's chains down, huh?

You said it.

Mm... l feel good.

00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:30,922
Well, yeah. l'm a spitfire in the bedroom.

00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,925
Yeah. One more time, anyway.

Sure.

How'd they make this in here, you suppose?

Wood shop, l guess. lt's nice to know
they pay attention in class.

She's like a woman fighting for more than life.
She fights like fighting is her life.

she will win because there is no alternative.

00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,608
lt's your turn, Andrew.

484
00:35:32,253 --> 00:35:35,131
So you figure, what? l...

485
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:40,765
l stand on the seal, and hold the knife,
and command it to stop glowing in Tawarick?

486
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,846
- Or we could do this.
- What?

487
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:50,203
Doesn't really make sense, does it?
Bringing you here to talk to it?

488
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:54,002
This thing doesn't understand words.
lt understands blood.

489
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:58,564
Blood opens it. You don't wanna open it.
Opening it... would be bad.

490
00:35:58,653 --> 00:36:01,451
Yeah, Willow did a little research.

491
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:05,208
Turns out, the blood of the person
that awoke it - you -

492
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:09,127
different kinda deal.
lt reverses the whole thing.

493
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:12,011
So... how much blood?

494
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:15,323
Are you gonna...

495
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:18,883
l don't know. Maybe not enough to kill you.

496
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,211
So, this is my redemption at last.

497
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:28,923
l buy back my bruised soul
with the blood of my heart.

498
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:31,447
But not enough to kill...

499
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:33,171
Stop!

500
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:35,483
Stop telling stories.

501
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:37,768
Life isn't a story.

502
00:36:37,853 --> 00:36:39,684
Sorry. Sorry.

503
00:36:39,773 --> 00:36:42,924
Shut up. You always do this.

504
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:47,245
You make everything into a story,
so no one's responsible for anything

505
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:51,292
- because they're just following a script.
- Please don't kill me.

506
00:36:51,373 --> 00:36:55,764
Warren said Jonathan would be OK.
l trusted him, and l lost my friend.

507
00:36:55,853 --> 00:36:59,482
You didn't lose him. You murdered him.

508
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,850
l know.

509
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,082
You don't need to kill me.
You said we could all get through this.

510
00:37:06,173 --> 00:37:09,483
l made it up. l'm making it all up.

511
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:13,610
So what kinda hero does that make me?

512
00:37:13,693 --> 00:37:16,810
No, you're doing great. Really. Kudos.

513
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:19,451
Yeah?

514
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:25,449
Well, l don't like giving speeches about
how we're all gonna live, because we won't.

515
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:30,402
This isn't some story where good triumphs
because good triumphs.

516
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:32,643
Good people are going to die!

517
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:35,165
Girls.

518
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,403
Maybe me.

519
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:39,211
Probably you.

520
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:42,321
Probably right now.

521
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:44,324
Don't... Please.

522
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:46,404
Don't, please!

523
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:50,643
When your blood pours out,
it might save the world.

524
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:54,772
What do you think about that?
Does it buy it all back? Are you redeemed?

525
00:37:54,853 --> 00:37:56,809
- No.
- Why not?

526
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:59,282
Because l killed him.

527
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:01,364
Because l...

528
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:06,888
l listened to Warren,
and l pretended l thought it was him,

529
00:38:06,973 --> 00:38:09,965
but... l knew. l knew it wasn't.

530
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:15,007
And l killed Jonathan.

531
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:18,324
And now... you're gonna kill me.

532
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:23,248
And l'm scared, and l'm going... to die.

533
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:30,444
And this... this is what Jonathan felt.

534
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:35,924
<i>(Andrew sobs)</i>

535
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:48,292
- lt stopped.
- Didn't want blood. lt wanted tears.

536
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:52,972
Thanks.

537
00:38:54,653 --> 00:38:56,371
- Sorry l had to...
- You...

538
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:59,365
So you weren't really
gonna stab me, were you?

539
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:01,648
l wasn't going to stab you.

540
00:39:04,413 --> 00:39:06,881
What if the tears didn't work?

541
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:32,324
- She got it done.
- Always has.

542
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:34,404
So far.

543
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:46,882
Here's the thing.

544
00:39:46,973 --> 00:39:49,362
l killed my best friend.

545
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:55,488
There's a big fight coming, and...
l don't know what's gonna happen.

546
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:02,008
l don't even think l'm gonna live through it.

547
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:08,003
That's... probably the way it should be.

548
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,882
l guess l'm...
