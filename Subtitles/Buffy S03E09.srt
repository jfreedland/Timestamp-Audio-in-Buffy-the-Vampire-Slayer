Nnnfrr!

5
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:19,401
Oh, God! Demon! Demon!
What kills a demon?!

6
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:22,844
Nrrrf!

00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:24,540
Nnffrr!

00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:25,547
Oh, Nerf!

11
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,828
OK. That was too close
for comfort.

12
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:43,594
Not that slaying
is ever comfy, but...

13
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,430
you know what I mean?

14
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,334
If you guys hadn't
been here to help...

15
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:48,337
Willow: But we were.

16
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:51,466
And we did,
and we're all fine.

17
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:53,134
Isn't he gonna go poof?

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,111
Uh, I guess these guys don't.

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,205
We'll have to bury him
or something.

20
00:00:58,282 --> 00:00:59,214
Ooh...

21
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:01,410
makes you appreciate vamps,
though.

22
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:02,509
No fuss, no muss.

23
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:04,281
So how come Faith
was a no-show?

24
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,983
I thought mucusy demons
were her favorites.

25
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:09,890
Couldn't reach her... again.

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,791
She hasn't been
hanging out much.

27
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,524
I detect worry.

28
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:16,463
A little bit.

29
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,765
Slaying's a rough gig.
Too much alone time isn't healthy.

30
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:21,828
Stuff gets pent up.

31
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:24,568
We should try to do more
socializing with her.

32
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:26,507
Well, burial detail aside...

33
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:28,306
does this cap us off
for the day?

34
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,472
You got plans?

35
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,847
I cannot stress enough
how much I don't have plans.

36
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:35,351
No luck reaching Cordelia?

37
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:38,149
I've left a few messages.

38
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:41,953
60... 70.

39
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:43,857
But you know
what really bugs me?

40
00:01:43,928 --> 00:01:46,055
OK, we kissed.
It was a mistake.

41
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,065
But I know that was positively the last
time we were ever gonna kiss.

42
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,065
Darn tootin'.

43
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,795
And they burst in
rescuing us...

44
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,200
without even knocking?

45
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,070
I mean, this is really
all their fault.

46
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:59,837
Your logic does not
resemble our Earth logic.

47
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,707
Mine is much
more advanced.

48
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,076
At least tomorrow's Monday...

49
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:04,171
another school day.

50
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:06,773
Well, that's good.
You know, focus on school.

51
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:08,910
That's the strong
Willow way to heal.

52
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:11,113
Actually, I was more
thinking Oz will be there...

53
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:13,122
and I can beg
for forgiveness.

54
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,385
That works, too.

55
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:17,017
I want to be strong, Willow.

56
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:18,118
But then I think...

57
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:20,993
I may never get to be
close to Oz again...

58
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:24,899
and it's like all the air
just goes out of the room.

59
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:26,527
I know the feeling.

60
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:30,370
Right. I mean, you went through it
with Angel, and you're still standing.

61
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,604
So tell us, wise one,
how do you deal?

62
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:35,406
I have you guys.

Hey, it's Xander.

64
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:41,978
If you get this, call me.

Hi. Xander.

66
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:52,361
I, uh... Well, I'm in
if you feel like calling.

67
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:53,794
Bye.

Hi, Cordelia. Um...

69
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:05,202

if we can talk, I'm here.

[Beep]
Hey, again. It's me.

71
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:15,511
I'm here. Again.

72
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,917
How's it goin'?

73
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:27,422
Oz hasn't been
to his locker.

74
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:30,016
There may be books
in there that he needs...

75
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:32,028
but still, he doesn't come.

76
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:33,154
Has Xander seen Cordelia?

77
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,527
I don't think so.

78
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,089
But she is coming in today.

79
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:39,692
Amy saw her last night
at the mall.

80
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,237
How was she?

81
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:42,772
I don't know.

82
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,832
Amy said she looked
pretty... scary.

83
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:13,328
Cordelia!

84
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:15,337
You look amazing.

85
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,773
Oh. You have to meet Anya.

86
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:21,276
She just moved here...

87
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:23,711
and her dad just bought...
What was it?

88
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,475
Oh. A utility.

89
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:27,414
Or something.

90
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:29,111
Nice bag. Prada?

91
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:30,585
Good call.

92
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:34,112
Most people around here
can't tell Prada from Payless.

93
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,182
God, Cordy!
When I heard about...

94
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,591
Well, I mean,
I couldn't believe it.

95
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:40,687
But it was smart,
you know, the injury thing?

96
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:42,459
You take a week off...

97
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,330
let everybody forget
about the temporary insanity...

98
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:45,629
that was Xander Harris.

99
00:05:45,702 --> 00:05:47,533
Xander who?

100
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:48,969
Oh!

101
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,509
You know what
you have to do.

102
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:54,009
Start dating.

103
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:55,544
Get back on the horse.

00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:56,544
Oh, absolutely!

105
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:58,945

106
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:02,213

109
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:17,060
I'm pretty sure
he won't cheat on you.

110
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,034
At least not for a while.

111
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:22,230
Plus, he's got a kill moped.

112
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:42,448
Oz. Wow.

113
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:44,653
Look at us,
running into each other...

114
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:47,196
as two people who go
to the same school...

115
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:50,893
are so likely to do
now and then.

116
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:51,900
Hey.

117
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:55,835
Oz, wait. Please?

118
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:57,237
What I did...

119
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:59,901
When I think that
I hurt you...

120
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:03,208
Yeah. You said all
this stuff already.

121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,681
Right, but... I want
to make it up to you.

122
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,084
I mean, if you let me,
I want to try.

123
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,712
Just...

124
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:16,625
You can leave me alone.

125
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:20,259
I need to figure things out.

126
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,094
But maybe if we talk
about it, we could...

127
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,430
Look...

128
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:28,266
I'm sorry this is hard for you.

129
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:30,329
But I told you what I need.

130
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:33,706
So I can't help feeling
like the reason you want to talk...

131
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:37,213
is so you can feel
better about yourself.

132
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,873
That's not my problem.

133
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,471
Hey, John Lee.

134
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:08,943
Do I have something
caught in my teeth?

135
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:25,852
So... what's new?

136
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:29,194
God, it's been, like,
a gazillion years.

137
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,393
Look, the guys are kinda
down on me lately.

138
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,493
Coach just cut me back
to second string.

139
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,003

castoff on top of that...

death, you know, but...

142
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,804
maybe... if you want to
go someplace private...

143
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,380
What?

144
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:48,884
Think about it.

145
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:55,686
Hey.

00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,990

your oh-so-brilliant insults.

00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:00,529
Just join the club.

148
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:03,293
Hardly. Actually,
I've been looking for you.

149
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,528
Ever since we met this morning,
I was, like...

150
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:07,729
thank God there's one other
person in this town

151
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:09,738

00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,399
Oh, she follows me around.

154
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:16,810
If that girl had an original thought,
her head would explode.

155
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,313
Is that Gucci?

156
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,748
Um... no.

my dad gave me.

one of those pre-Xander.

thinking about him.

I am past it.
I am living my life.

Still, I mean...
Don't you kinda wish...

168
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,411
I don't wish. I act.

169

Starting now,
Xander Harris is gonna get...

00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:54,745

how over him I am.

Excuse me.

I need to be both giving
and receiving of mirth.

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,024
It's true. Cordelia belongs
to the justified camp.

182
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:35,259
She should make us pay.

183
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,460
And pay and pay and pay...

184
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:39,366
In fact, there's just not
enough pay for what we...

185
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:42,895
Look, you want to do
guilt-a-palooza, fine...

186
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,168
but I'm done with that.

187

Starting this minute...

188
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:48,440
I'm gonna grab ahold of
that crazy little thing called life...

189
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:50,447
and let it do
its magical little healie thing.

190
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,676
What's done is done.

191
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,616
Let's be in the moment.

Behold the beauty
that is now.

193
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,478
Who's with me?

194
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,390
He's actually making sense.

195
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,189
We're young and free
in America.

196
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:07,527
How dare we be spun by love
or the lack of same?

197
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,896
Absolutely.

198
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,901
I-It's self-indulgent.

I-I'm in.

00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,771
I'm on the joy train.

201
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,806
That didn't work.
Who wants chocolate?

00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:24,849
I'm up.

Look at her.

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,882
Tears of a clown, baby.

205
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:35,289
Or is it...
grins of a sad person?

206
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,292
Or maybe it's...

207
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:37,293
Xander, your hand.

208
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:38,329
Oops! Sorry.

209
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:39,829
But why oops?

210
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,059
I mean, we always touch digits.

211
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,395
It's a friend thing.

212
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,766
Comfort, like chocolate.

213
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:49,796
Maybe it used to be,
but since we...

214
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:50,806
It's different.

215
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,243
I-I'm sorry.

216
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:57,145
But if I want to make things
right with Oz...

217
00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:01,413

my... all my stuff...

Hey, Cordelia, wait a second.

220
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,558
Did Xander send you
to beg for him?

221
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:42,820
Because if he did...

222
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:46,330
No. I'm a free agent,
I promise.

223
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:48,831
I just wanted
to see how you are.

224
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,425
Never been better.

225
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,767
Cordelia, I know what it's like
to be hurt by someone.

226
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:57,239
Hurt so much that you don't think
you're gonna make it.

227
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:00,744
But I told my friends how I felt,
and you know what?

228
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,076
I got a little better.

00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:54,894
You know what I've been
asking myself a lot this last week?

233
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:55,898
Why me?

234
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:58,299
Why do I get impaled?

235
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:00,360
Why do I get bitten
by snakes?

236
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:02,929
Why do I fall
for incredible losers?

237
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,306
And you know,
I think I finally figured it out...

238
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,641
what my problem is.
It's...

239
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:11,477
Buffy Summers. That's when
all my troubles started.

240
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:12,982
When she moved here.

241
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,484
Are you OK?

242
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,986
Oh, I just pulled
some stitches last night.

Surprise.
It was Buffy's fault.

00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,820
Oh, hey, it's garbage girl.
Loved the look last night, Cor.

246
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:27,160
Dumpster chic

I think you need this
more than I do right now.

Yeah, I can use some luck.

sharp bits.

If that Buffy wasn't...
I swear...

She's a pain.

253
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:52,019
But Xander,
he's an utter loser.

Don't you wish...

I never would have
looked twice at Xander...

marginally cooler...

Her pulse is strong.

What was she doing
wearing that?

364
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:15,591
Everyone knows that vampires
are attracted to bright colors.

365
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:18,565
That's Cordelia. It's better
to look good than to feel alive.

Uh, go and watch
the perimeters...

I remember that lust
for the kill.

on the Rialto?

a long, healthy life...

her money back.

everything being different...

supposed to be like this.

the slayer was supposed
to be here...

to have been here already.

Certainly would
have helped.

Yes. I tried calling her,
but, um...

00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:44,372
haven't completely
atrophied after all.

544
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:46,542
Great.

545
00:32:46,618 --> 00:32:48,051
What's her power center?

546
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,747
Um, well, um... um...

547
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,255
It doesn't say.

548
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:56,706
Why don't I just put
a stake through her heart?

549
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,670
She's not a vampire.

550
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:01,107
Well, you'd be surprised
how many things that'll kill.

551
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:02,735
I don't want to kill her,
Miss Summers.

552
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:05,747
I want to reverse
whatever effect...

553
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:08,079
she's had on this... this world.

554
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,517
[Sighs]

555
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,952
You're taking an awful lot
on faith here, Jeeves.

556
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:13,954
Giles.

557
00:33:15,258 --> 00:33:16,919
Kill the bad fairy...

558
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:19,393
destroy the bad fairy's
power center, whatever...

559
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:21,327
and all the troubles
go away?

560
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:22,989
Well, I'm sure
it's not that simple, but...

561
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,624
World is what it is.

562
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:26,794
We fight. We die.

563
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:28,996
Wishing doesn't change that.

564
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:31,199
I have to believe
in a better world.

565
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:32,400
Go ahead.

566
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:35,603
I have to live in this one.

567
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:39,637
Cordelia said she knew that
I was meant to be your watcher.

568
00:33:39,716 --> 00:33:41,183
She said she knew you.

569
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,980
She's probably
just a big fan.

570
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:47,614
The Master sent his most
vicious disciples to kill her.

571
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,682
Now, she must have posed
some threat to him.

572
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,784
The Master?

573
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,295
Um, supreme vampire
around these parts.

574
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:57,162
He lives on the outskirts
of town in an old club.

575
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:59,064
You know where he lives...

576
00:33:59,135 --> 00:34:01,194
and no one's ever tried
to take him out?

577
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,897
People have tried.

578
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:05,706
Well, point the way.

579
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:08,073
I might as well do some good
while I'm in this town.

580
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:09,133
You can't just walk
in there and...

581
00:34:09,212 --> 00:34:11,976
Look, you wanna stay here
and play make-believe, fine.

582
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:13,447
I'm not gonna be any help
to you anyway.

583
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:15,484
There's only one thing
I'm good at.

584
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:17,746
At least let's muster
some kind of force.

585
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,448
I don't play well
with others.

586
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:21,854
Now, I'm gonna
ask you this once...

587
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:23,221
and then I'm gonna get testy.

588
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:26,125
[Drops Book]

589
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:27,594
Where is this club?

590
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:07,636
Angel: Buffy.

591
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:09,295
Buffy Summers.

592
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,779
It's you.

593
00:35:18,848 --> 00:35:22,181
I mean...
you don't remember.

594
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:23,718
How could you?

595
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:25,413
How did you
know my name?

596
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:29,117
I waited.

597
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:32,059
I waited here for you.

598
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:35,222
But you never...
I was supposed to help you.

599
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:37,232
[Scoffs]

600
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,064
You were gonna help me.

601
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:42,502
The Master rose.

602
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:46,406
He let me live...
to punish me.

603
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:50,003
I kept hoping
maybe you'd come.

604
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:54,082
My destiny.

605
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:58,216
Is this a get-in-my-pants thing?

606
00:35:58,287 --> 00:36:00,949
You guys in Sunnydale talk
like I'm the Second Coming.

607
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:01,955
I'm sorry.

608
00:36:02,024 --> 00:36:02,956
I just meant...

609
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:05,516
Look, I don't have time
for stories.

610
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:07,654
Where's the Master?

611
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,631
They're at his factory.

612
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,463
It starts tonight.

613
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:14,196
Factory?

614
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,932
I... [Grunts]
I can take you there.

615
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:36,218
[Gasp]

616
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:38,658
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me!

617
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:40,218
Wait! I won't hurt you.

618
00:36:40,296 --> 00:36:42,287
No. You'll leave that
to your Master.

619
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:44,299
You don't believe
I want to help you?

620
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:54,107
Believe I want him dead.

621
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:03,009
The Master: And now behold
the technical wonder...

622
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:06,577
which is about to alter
the very fabric of our society.

623
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:10,592
Some have argued that such an
advancement goes against our nature.

624
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,154
They claim that death is our art.
I say to them...

625
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:18,166
Well, I don't say anything
to them because I kill them.

626
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:21,601
Undeniably, we are
the world's superior race.

627
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:24,231
Yet we have always been
too parochial...

628
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:28,403
too bound by the mindless
routine of the predator.

629
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:32,038
Hunt and kill, hunt and kill.
Titillating?

630
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:33,046
Yes.

631
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:35,743
Practical? Hardly.

632
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:39,447
Meanwhile, the humans,
with their plebeian minds...

633
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:43,083
have brought us
a truly demonic concept...

634
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,354
mass production!

635
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:47,589
Vampires: Yeah!

636
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:48,925
Yeah!

637
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:53,230
We really are living
in a golden age.

638
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:05,179
O... Anyanka...
I beseech thee.

639
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:06,771
Um...

640
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:14,117
In the name
of all women scorned...

641
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,919
come before me.

642
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:20,656
Oh!

643
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:23,047
Do you have any idea
what I do to a man...

644
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,947
Do you have any idea
what I do to a man...

645
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:27,678
who uses that spell
to summon me?

646
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:32,420
Bring on the first!

647
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,718
Get back!

648
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:37,288
You!

649
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:39,621
Girl: Nooo!

650
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:43,326
No! Please! No!
Help me!

651
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:44,959
No!

652
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:46,503
Noooo!

653
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,004
- No... Oh!
- [Electric Shocks]

654
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:00,775
She's still alive, you see...

655
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,284
for the freshness.

656
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:41,449
What's the plan?

657
00:39:41,525 --> 00:39:43,152
Don't fall on this.

658
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:04,280
Welcome to the future.

659
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:06,145
To the future!

660
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:07,445
The future!

661
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:08,985
The future!

662
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:20,221
Uh-oh. Puppy got out.

663
00:40:37,214 --> 00:40:39,705
Cordelia Chase...
what did she wish for?

664
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:43,151
I had no idea her wish
would be so exciting.

665
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,051
Brave new world.

666
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:47,647
I hope she likes it.

667
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:57,297
You're gonna
change it back.

668
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,770
I'm not afraid of you.

669
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,899
Your only power
lies in the wishing.

670
00:41:04,975 --> 00:41:06,101
Wrong!

671
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:24,160
Angel: Buffy, look out!

672
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:29,764
Buffy...

673
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:34,201
Anyanka: This is
the real world now.

674
00:41:34,271 --> 00:41:36,000
This is the world
we made.

675
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:39,406
Isn't it wonderful?

676
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:51,877
Anyanka:
You trusting fool!

677
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:54,918
How do you know the other world
is any better than this?

678
00:42:56,253 --> 00:42:57,845
Because it has to be.

679
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:07,730
No!

680
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:25,980
I wish Buffy Summers
had never come to Sunnydale.

681
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:28,283
Done.

682
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:30,377
That would be cool.

683
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:31,751
No. Wait.

684
00:43:31,822 --> 00:43:34,882
I wish Buffy Summers
had never been born.

685
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:35,891
Done!

686
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,224
And I wish
that Xander Harris...

687
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:40,695
never again knows
the touch of a woman.

688
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:44,393
And that Willow wakes up tomorrow
covered in monkey hair.

689
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,095
Done!

690
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:50,903
In fact, I wish all men, except maybe the
dumb and the really agreeable kind...

691
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:54,741
disappear off the face of the Earth.
That would be so cool!

692
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:57,280
Or maybe...

693
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:39,855
Grr! Arrgh!
