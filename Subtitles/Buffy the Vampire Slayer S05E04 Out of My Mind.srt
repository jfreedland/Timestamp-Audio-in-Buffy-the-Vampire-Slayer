1
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:05,322
Buffy's like nobody else in the world.

2
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:09,525
But she doesn't love me.

3
00:00:09,613 --> 00:00:12,889
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
- What have you done to me?

4
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:16,010
Professor Walsh.
She implanted the behaviour modifier.

5
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:18,766
- A chip in my head.
- Actually, the chip is here.

6
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,368
Tied directly into your central nervous
system through the thoracic nerve.

7
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:24,523
What's happening to me?

8
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:27,844
- Walsh was feeding you drugs.
- Something's crawling inside.

9
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:31,084
I don't wanna think about the damage
our guys could do in withdrawal.

10
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:34,848
Buffy? If you're going out,
why don't you take your sister?

11
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,161
Mom!

12
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,687
Nobody knows who I am. Not the real me.

13
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,763
No one understands.

14
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:44,287
No one has an older sister who's a slayer.

15

16
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:36,162
- Riley?
- Buffy, what are you doing here?

17
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:38,721
- My job?
- I thought you were in the north sector.

18
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:40,565
Watch out!

19
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:47,445
Never mind.

20
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,569
Why do I even bother to show up?

21
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:04,684
Spike, what are you doing here?

22
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:07,765
Same thing as you
and your cub scout here, I'll wager.

23
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:12,403
A spot of violence before bedtime.

24
00:02:29,053 --> 00:02:31,044
What? I softened him up.

25
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,368
Better keep out of my way, Spike.
I'm not gonna take this much longer.

26
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:39,492
And do what with my spare time?
Sit at home knitting cunning sweater sets?

27
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:42,007
- Would it keep you out of my way?
- She's right.

28
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:44,891
You shouldn't be out here
when she's patrolling.

29
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:47,931
Oh! I saw that.

30
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:53,241
Looks like neither boy's entirely welcome.
You should take him home, Slayer.

31
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,848
Make him stay there.
I've got knitting needles he can borrow.

32
00:02:56,933 --> 00:03:01,370
Spike, I just saw you taste your own
nose blood. You know what?

33
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:06,766
I'm too grossed out to hear
anything you have to say. Go home.

34
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:11,447
It's blood. It's what I do.

35
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:16,287
Hey, hope I didn't get in the way.

36
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:19,570
Of course not. I was just startled.

37
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:24,046
And, you know I don't...
Iove the idea of you patrolling alone.

38
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:28,847
- Not much for bench-warming.
- No, you made the squad.

39
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:32,926
You threw that vampire like he was
a teeny-weeny little vampire.

40
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:38,129
Hey, you wanna go again? I bet this place
is just teeming with aerodynamic vampires.

41
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:44,402
Nah. Unless you wanna go back
and kill Spike for the fun of it?

42
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,727
I will know your blood, Slayer.

43
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:56,847
I will make your neck my chalice

44
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,924
and drink deep.

45
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:06,603
Ow!

46
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:04,168
You can't possibly be arguing that Marat
didn't betray the French Revolutionaries.

47
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:06,813
This was the guy
who declared the rights of man,

48
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:11,364
and then the next thing you know he's
killing Girondins like it's going out of style.

49
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:15,128
Will, you're missing my point.
I agree that Marat wasn't a real martyr,

50
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:20,367
but the death in the tub, the neck wound...
just a little more fangy than knifey.

51
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,411
- Charlotte Corday wasn't a martyr either...
- Buffy...

52
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:26,451
- What?
- Listen to us. We're arguing.

53
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:32,324
We're having a debate about a college lecture.
I have dreamt of this day since... forever.

54
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:35,887
You are turning into quite the student.

55
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:39,968
- Should I be watching my occipital lobe?
- Your what?

56
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,487
Occipital. The lobe in the back of your brain.

57
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:45,041
You know, like,
"Should I be watching my back?"

58
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:48,728
You know, the... back of your brain.

59
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:53,284
Apparently not. Don't worry, Will,
you still wear the smarty-pants in the family.

60
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:56,604
I don't know.
You've been studying really a lot.

61
00:05:56,693 --> 00:06:02,290
I'm trying. But they're piling on the reading
and Giles fills any free time with training.

62
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,487
- This working hard is hard work.
- Isn't it crazy like that?

63
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:10,646
I thought it was gonna be like in the movies.
You know - inspirational music,

64
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,169
a montage, me sharpening my pencils,
me reading, writing,

65
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:18,769
falling asleep on a pile of books, my glasses
crooked, cos in my montage I have glasses.

66
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:22,445
But real life is slow
and it's hurting my occipital lobe.

67
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,524
Oh! Poor Buffy's brain.

68
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:27,252
I'm heading to training now.
You wanna come with?

69
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,609
I'm in. Maybe we can argue some more
about the French Revolution.

70
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:34,003
Hey! Wasn't that Robespierre the coolest?

71
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:38,208
- Robespierre? You're kidding me, right?
- I'm just getting it going.

72
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:40,887
It seems the plans worked perfectly.

73
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:46,847
Yeah, blueprints. Not a bad idea. That and
getting straight "measure twice, cut once".

74
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:50,130
For the longest time I had it backwards.
Mess-y!

75
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:55,004
- Well, I must say, I'm very impressed.
- Yeah, carpentry is pretty cool.

76
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:04,047
Oh! Who put the monkey head
near the Styx water?

77
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,966
Do we want to pick
exploded monkey out of our hair?

78
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:09,722
Trick or treat!

79
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:12,771
- Come on in.
- Thank you, kind proprietor.

80
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:15,048
- Hey, you.
- Hey!

81
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:20,526
Oh, wow, this place looks great.
Oh, I feel like a witch in a magic shop.

82
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:24,567
Ooh. Are these real newt eyes?

83
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:28,441
No, too rich for my blood, I'm afraid.
No, these are salamander eyes.

84
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:31,650
The cataracts give them
their newt-like appearance.

85
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:35,692
They're equally effective.
It's just a matter of overcoming snobbery.

86
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:41,131
You gotta set up a blind taste test and prove
that generic amphibian eyes are just as good.

87
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:45,001
I don't know. If you ask me,
the newt name still means something.

88
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,563
- You ready to train?
- You betcha.

89
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:50,451
- Shall we then?
- We shall then.

90
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:53,607
I just keep thinking how cool it would be,

91
00:07:53,693 --> 00:07:57,368
if we got a real psychic to sit up here
and read fortunes and stuff.

92
00:07:57,453 --> 00:08:00,445
- You should do it.
- Not me.

93
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:04,242
But I'd love to watch and learn.
From someone who's really good.

94
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,370
You're really good. I'll prove it.

95
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,444
Here, do me.

96
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,124
What do you see?

97
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,369
Willow hand.

98
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,843
Ow! Riley!

99
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:37,131
- Just keeping you on your toes.
- Or off them, as it were. What got into...?

100
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:40,604
Oh, my God.

101
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:43,004
Look at this place!

102
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,166
Thank you. Thank you so much.

103
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:53,689
- You need a proper space to train, so...
- I love it.

104
00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:57,004
So, come on, let's test this puppy out.
Think you can take me?

105
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:03,051
- What's the matter? Afraid of competition?
- It must have been so much work.

106
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,283
I'm the dummy man.

107
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:09,127
I mean, I made the dummy.
The thing that you hit that doesn't hit back.

108
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:11,602
- That, I made.
- It's great.

109
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:14,685
- It's all great.
- Well, you've earned it. Truly.

110
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,045
Thank you, guys, so much.

111
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:22,730
You're like my fairy godmother and
Santa Claus and Q, all wrapped up into one.

112
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:26,766
Q from Bond, not Star Trek.

113
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:30,366
I'm gonna go change.

114
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:42,686
Oh, Pacey, you blind idiot.
Can't you see she doesn't love you?

115
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:53,923
- Well, well, well. Lookee here.
- Is it safe?

116
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:59,485
Has Buffy gotten to you yet?
I saw her patrolling just now... with a stake!

117
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,130
She won't give up
until she's killed me to death!

118
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:06,205
- Buffy's looking for you?
- Of course!

119
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:09,888
That's why I'm on the lam. Didn't you hear?

120
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,969
I'm totally her arch-nemesis!

121
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:15,726
Is that right? I must have missed the memo.

122
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,849
There was a mem...?

123
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:21,642
Spike, oh my God!
This is, like, a real emergency!

124
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:25,207
I need a hideout so bad.

125
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,602
You're my only hope.

126
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,481
We're just gonna have to rise above
our petty differences...

127
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,970
Listen, Spike... I'm desperate.

128
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:40,288
Desperate, are you?

129
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:44,685
Come on, Spike. Pretty please?

130
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:46,491
I'll do anything!

131
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,321
Anything? Will you?

132
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:51,802
Yeah! I said I'll do anything.

133
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,728
You mean will I have sex with you?

134
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:02,169
Well, yeah.

135
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:16,921
Taking up smoking, are you?

136
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:19,811
I am a villain, Spike. Hello-o!

137
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:25,764
I guess you are at that.
What with the Slayer on your tail and all.

138
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:31,967
She's not the type to give up, either.
She'll hunt you down, day and night,

139
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:35,363
till you're too tired
and too hungry to run any more.

140
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:36,852
And then...

141
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:41,442
Then... that is you.

142
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:45,681
I guess you're gonna have to kill her.

143
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:49,368
I tried! It was all hard and stuff!

144
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:53,011
- You do it.
- I'd love to.

145
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,288
But I can't. Remember?

146
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:58,967
I've got this cute
government chip in my head.

147
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:05,526
Right. Guess it'll have to be me after all.
Can you help with the thinking?

148
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,526
Yeah. I suppose I could do that.

149
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,568
Mm, that was relaxing.

150
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:23,170
You... wanna relax some more?

151
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:26,245
Again? Right away again?

152
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,363
- Maybe you're too tired.
- Hey!

153
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:32,251
I have the endurance of ten men.

154
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,291
Let's make it women, OK?
Just for the imagery.

155
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:38,968
Whatever. You know,
it takes a lot to wear me out.

156
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:41,044
Oh, I love a challenge.

157
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:45,122
Well, wouldn't you?

158
00:12:45,453 --> 00:12:47,762
Every kid tries to make the substitute cry.

159
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:51,528
- It's like a rite of passage.
- I certainly would not.

160
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:55,208
Being a substitute
is an extremely difficultjob. Besides...

161
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:59,562
Honestly, Dawn, how many bowls of cereal
are you planning on eating?

162
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:04,044
These aren't for eating. I'm trying to get
the extra out of the way so I could...

163
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:07,045
get this!

164
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:09,971
Anyway, I want eggs.

165
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:14,285
You want the cereal prize, but not the cereal.
You are growing up.

166
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:17,763
All righty. Half an omelette coming up.

167
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:21,011
Oh, with ketchup, if you please?

168
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:28,132
What is the...? Who are you?

169
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,601
Hey. How's Mom? Are you OK?

170
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:52,924
- I'm OK.
- And your mom's doing just fine.

171
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:59,004
- This is Ben. He gave me his stethoscope.
- Lent you his stethoscope.

172
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:02,172
Buffy, right? I'm Ben. I'm an intern here.

173
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:06,212
I'm hanging out with the renowned Dr Dawn
while your mom's being tested.

174
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:08,284
So what's going on? What happened?

175
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:11,365
She's doing OK. The doctors
don't know why she collapsed.

176
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:14,251
It could've been a dizzy spell,
low blood sugar...

177
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:18,566
- But it's nothing bad. It's not serious, right?
- Very unlikely.

178
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:22,965
- She doesn't have a history of fainting?
- No, not that I know of.

179
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:31,765
It doesn't look too serious.

180
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,006
Thank God. I was freaking out.

181
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:47,841
I know I'm repeating myself here,
but I don't know how else to convince you.

182
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:53,963
I have never let a patient with tachycardia
this severe leave a hospital.

183
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:58,763
- You said you couldn't keep me.
- Legally, no. I can't force you.

184
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:03,529
But with that pulse I'd get on my knees and
beg, if I thought I could change your mind.

185
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:07,447
- You can't. I'm going home.
- And your friend can't convince you to...

186
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,046
I'm going.

187
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:14,046
All right then, but you're leaving
against my recommendation.

188
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,521
What's going on? What are you doing?

189
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:23,411
- What if you have a heart attack?
- Listen. Calm down.

190
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:26,929
Me calm down?
I'm not the one with a pulse of 150.

191
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:31,404
My heart's different than yours.
It works differently now, but it's OK.

192
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:34,565
You're still a human.
You could still have a heart attack.

193
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:37,531
I'm a human who was used
as a lab rat for months.

194
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:41,322
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you?

195
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:46,605
Oh, embarrassed, mostly.
I'm sorry to put you through this.

196
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:49,685
But no more tests,
so you can take this pincushion home.

197
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:53,368
Yes. Let's... get outta here.

198
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:05,526
What about a crossword?
Some people say feed a cold. I say puzzle it.

199
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:07,205
No, thanks, Willow.

200
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:09,523
I like chicken fingers
with mustard when I'm sick.

201
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:11,968
I know you do. I can make us some later.

202
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:15,125
Uh-uh. You are sitting
right here on this couch today.

203
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:17,443
I feel silly lying here like a lump.

204
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:21,890
You could make a game out of it.
A very quiet game, about being a lump.

205
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:26,569
I feel fine. Honestly, I'm more concerned
about Riley than I am about me.

206
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:31,363
You shouldn't even be thinking about that.
He's not worried, so we shouldn't be.

207
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:34,763
I don't get what he's thinking.
Why isn't he worried?

208
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:39,369
Maybe he thinks his body can handle it.
He is in really good shape.

209
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:42,047
Nobody's body can handle a heart attack.

210
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:45,842
I know. I'm sorry, Buffy.
I'm trying too hard to make it OK.

211
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,967
I just keep coming back to the Initiative.

212
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:51,772
It does have that icky government feel to it.

213
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:55,971
Did you know that the CIA tried to kill
Fidel Castro with a poisonous aspirin?

214
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:58,123
Dawn, please.

215
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:01,206
I know I have to do something.
I just don't know what.

216
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:03,443
- Another time the CIA...
- Dawn!

217
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,330
It's important.

218
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:10,241
..tried to make Castro go crazy
by putting itching powder in his beard.

219
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,924
It's about the government!

220
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:17,243
Call the Initiative.
If they know what's wrong, they have to help.

221
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,484
Yeah, but call how?
First of all, they don't exist any more,

222
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:24,248
and, secondly,
they never claimed to exist in the first place.

223
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:28,572
It's so unfair. It's like Big Brother
can spy on you all the time,

224
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:31,884
and the second I have something to say
no one will listen.

225
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:35,124
- Sounds more like Big Sister.
- There has to be a way.

226
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:38,762
Like what? Take a tour of the White House
and pretend to get lost, and...

227
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:42,528
Iook for a door with a sign that says
"Secret Government Monster Hunters"?

228
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:46,288
If they're really spying all the time,
say something so they'll hear you.

229
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:50,207
Like, sometimes,
I write fake things in my diary in case...

230
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:53,413
I gotta go. See you guys later.

231
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,681
What'd I say?

232
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:01,445
Riley?

233
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,527
Riley's in trouble. He needs help.

234
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:34,445
Oh, you're kidding!

235
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:45,044
No way, man!

236
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:47,444
I'm out.

237
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,604
- Graham.
- Riley.

238
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:56,284
Can we talk?

239
00:18:57,893 --> 00:18:59,884
Agent Goodman, Agent Brown.

240
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:02,922
- So talk.
- What's going on, man?

241
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:07,328
We gotta get this taken care of.
We gotta get you into an operating room.

242
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:12,130
Very convincing. Makes me completely
wanna put myself under government control.

243
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:15,046
Take me to where they can make me
unconscious and naked.

244
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:20,127
- You think I'd pull something on you?
- I don't know what orders you're following.

245
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:25,685
You know Walsh pumped all those chemicals
and crap into us. You got more than anyone.

246
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,843
She messed us up bad.

247
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,050
And now the government
wants to kiss it and make it better.

248
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:35,411
Riley, I'm telling you, you need help.
I'm not saying it to trick you.

249
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:38,287
- Maybe you even believe it.
- I know it.

250
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,885
You don't want this.

251
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:47,491
- You're sure you got the fix for it?
- Yeah. We got a guy. A doctor.

252
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,643
He's gonna take care of you,
and we're going to him now.

253
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:54,887
I'm not giving you a choice.

254
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:57,564
I guess you're not.

255
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:13,968
So you messed up and now he's gone.
What's wrong with him?

256
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,442
- I'm not permitted to say.
- Say.

257
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,966
Hyperadrenal overload
and stuff that sounds worse.

258
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,170
He's way stronger than he oughta be
and feeling no pain.

259
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:26,848
His heart can't take it.
We've been at him for weeks about it.

260
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:31,689
There's a specialist waiting
at Sunnydale General, Neurology.

261
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,685
- Get Riley there. If you don't...
- I'll get him there.

262
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,284
I'll tell the doc.

263
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:40,971
And Buffy?

264
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,851
If you tell me to hurry, I'll kick your ass.

265
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:08,202
- Poor Riley.
- Could he have gone back to his apartment?

266
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:11,683
No, he's not at his apartment,
he's not at the gym or the library.

267
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:15,448
- He's gone somewhere he can't be found.
- Basically, he's gone AWOL.

268
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,205
Basically exactly.

269
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:20,603
- Poor Buffy.
- Maybe he just needs some time alone.

270
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:23,844
I had this friend once
who really liked this girl, and...

271
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:26,367
he got all worried
that she didn't like him back,

272
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:32,085
and maybe that made him act like a total jerk.
Maybe Riley reminds me of that friend.

273
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:34,644
What are you talking about?

274
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,847
Then again, maybe he just wants attention.

275
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:42,051
Here's a hot tip, if you want attention.
Be there so people can give it to you.

276
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,124
I care about you, Xander.

277
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,891
- Thanks.
- Don't be insecure.

278
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:51,044
Thanks. I won't.

279
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:56,046
Cos I also have this "friend",
and I have it on really good authority

280
00:21:56,133 --> 00:22:00,126
that she really likes that guy, your "friend".
And, by the by, my friend...

281
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:03,603
You guys, enough!
OK, Riley is in real danger here.

282
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:08,447
Anya, Xander,
why don't you check the docks.

283
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,205
Aye aye.

284
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:12,761
Tara and I can scope out
the burned-out school.

285
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:16,732
Riley hid there once.
Maybe he feels it's homey or something.

286
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:20,206
Homey. You know what else
he might find homey

287
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:23,046
in a dank, unpleasant, evil sort of way?

288
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:27,329
The Initiative caves.
But I don't know them too well.

289
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:31,850
I had an associate who knows those caves
like the back of his melanin-deprived hand.

290
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,846
I so don't wanna deal with Spike right now.
He's really starting to bug me,

291
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:39,209
in that "I wanna shove something wooden
through his heart" way.

292
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:44,287
He does seem extra twitchy lately.
Maybe the whole not killing is getting to him.

293
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:49,083
Plus, hanging out in that mouldy crypt,
you just know he's doing something nasty.

294
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,971
OK, is it bigger than a breadbox?

295
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:54,683
No. Four left.

296
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,766
- So it's smaller than a breadbox.
- No! Only three!

297
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:04,844
- Harmony, is it a sodding breadbox?
- Yes! Oh, my God!

298
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:07,891
Someone's Blondie Bear's
a 20-question genius!

299
00:23:08,693 --> 00:23:10,684
She's found me!

300
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:21,245
I've got a proposition for you.

301
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,689
Funny. I've got a proposition for you.
What about knocking?

302
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:28,049
Seems only fair since we vamps
can't enter your flat without...

303
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,771
Look at those pieces of paper.

304
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:33,129
Riley's sick with some Initiative thing
and he's missing.

305
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:37,525
Find him. Bring him to the fourth floor of
the hospital. Their doctors get to him in time,

306
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:39,046
you get the cash.

307
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:43,524
Oh, dear, is the enormous hall monitor sick?
Tell me, is he gonna die?

308
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:47,970
He is not the only person that can die.

309
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:53,605
Hey. I'm just saying, if it's really that
important to you, I think I'll get half now.

310
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:08,241
So? What'd she say about me?

311
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:21,207
- Any word?
- They'll be here any minute.

312
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:25,490
That's soon enough, right?
I mean, if we bring him in now?

313
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:30,444
I'll be honest. I'm not sure it's soon enough
if you brought him in yesterday.

314
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,724
Finally.

315
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:52,642
You got yourself a new patient, Doc.

316
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:17,364
Look, you don't understand.

317
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:22,447
This is a complicated neurological procedure
and I've never performed it before.

318
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:26,525
Little performance anxiety, eh, Doc?

319
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:29,207
Butterflies in the old belly?

320
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,042
Harm, do us a favour.

321
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,525
Shoot the nasty butterflies
for the good doctor.

322
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:40,765
There you go, Doc. It's not so complicated.

323
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:44,209
Just do what those Initiative
lab monkeys did, only backwards.

324
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:49,128
This is a medical school, not a proper
operating facility. And these instruments...

325
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,607
They look pointy enough. They'll do.

326
00:25:54,693 --> 00:26:00,165
You're not listening. That chip is deeply
embedded in your cerebral cortex.

327
00:26:00,253 --> 00:26:04,405
- Removing it could leave you a vegetable.
- That's not gonna happen, mate.

328
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:07,291
See, I have faith in your survival instinct.

329
00:26:12,493 --> 00:26:16,247
Yeah. You'll have me up and killing
before the night's over.

330
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:19,566
Come on, Doc!

331
00:26:20,853 --> 00:26:23,651
You do me right,
nothing bad'll happen to you.

332
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:29,851
Oops! String was slippy.

333
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,284
Riley!

334
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:38,443
This place kinda creeps me out.

335
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:41,525
You shoulda been here when it was a school.

336
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:43,604
Riley!

337
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:48,967
- Darkness.
- Piles of it.

338
00:26:49,773 --> 00:26:53,129
- We should've brought a flashlight.
- Ooh! I know!

339
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:56,569
Better to light a candle
than curse the damn darkness.

340
00:26:56,653 --> 00:26:58,644
A little spell.

341
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:01,091
Fiat lux!

342
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,646
There, that's better.

343
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:09,241
Riley! Come on out!

344
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:14,726
- How'd you do that? With the light?
- Oh, you know. You taught me.

345
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,127
I taught you teeny Tinkerbell light.

346
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:22,001
OK, so I tinkered with the Tinkerbell.
It was easy.

347
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:27,402
And besides, isn't this better than using
a flashlight like some kind of doofus?

348
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:29,485
Riley?

349
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:33,443
Riley, answer me. Please.

350
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:39,404
Riley?

351
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:48,367
You know, this doesn't even hurt.

352
00:27:48,773 --> 00:27:51,765
- Your hand is bleeding.
- Don't feel a thing.

353
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:55,810
This stops now. I'm taking you to the doctor.

354
00:27:55,893 --> 00:28:00,250
The one from the government? Like the ones
who did this to me in the first place?

355
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:04,482
He understands what's wrong with you.
He's the only one that can help.

356
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:07,451
What's wrong with me?
I'm more powerful than ever.

357
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:11,970
- Most people would kill to feel this way.
- Yeah, and this feeling is going to kill you.

358
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:15,966
- Your body won't take this kind of stress...
- I can handle it.

359
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:19,045
This is my deal, Buffy. Just... back off.

360
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,124
What is this?

361
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:27,770
What's happening to you?

362
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:32,973
I go back, let the government get whimsical
with my innards. They could do anything...

363
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:36,841
Best-case scenario,
they turn me into Joe Normal. Just...

364
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:39,444
Just another guy.

365
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,408
And that's not enough for you?

366
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:45,163
It's not enough for you.

367
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:48,967
- Why would you say that?
- Come on.

368
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:52,170
Your last boyfriend wasn't exactly a civilian.

369
00:28:52,253 --> 00:28:54,483
So that's what this is about?

370
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:57,770
You're going to die,
all over some macho pissing contest?

371
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:59,923
It's not about him. It's about us.

372
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:06,369
You're getting stronger every day,
more powerful. I can't touch you.

373
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,332
Every day you're just
a little further out of my reach.

374
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:14,091
You wanna touch me? I'm right here.

375
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:18,449
- I'm not the one running away.
- Not yet.

376
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,242
So you have us all figured out?

377
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:25,530
I'm bailing because
you're not in the superclub.

378
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:29,325
- It's human nature.
- Don't Psych 101 me.

379
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:34,047
Not now. Not after everything that...

380
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:41,604
Nobody has ever known me the way you do.

381
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,843
Nobody.

382
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:47,323
I've opened up to you
in ways that I've never opened up to...

383
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:53,368
God, you're just sitting back there thinking
that none of this means anything to me.

384
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:57,844
- I never said that.
- It obviously doesn't mean anything to you.

385
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:00,208
- Do you think so little of me...
- Buffy.

386
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:01,851
No!

387
00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:04,365
No.

388
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:09,243
Do you think that I spent the last year
with you because you had superpowers?

389
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:12,530
If that's what I wanted,
then I'd be dating Spike.

390
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:17,448
Riley, I need you.

391
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,244
I need you with me.

392
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:26,044
And I need you healthy.

393
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:31,571
But if you wanna throw it all away
because you don't trust me, then...

394
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:37,125
then I am still gonna
make you go to that doctor.

395
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:50,802
Take me to him.

396
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:55,284
We have to hurry.

397
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:03,768
Loving you is the scariest thing
I've ever done, Buffy.

398
00:31:05,293 --> 00:31:07,284
I don't know why.

399
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:14,371
The doctor said we didn't have much time.

400
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:28,483
I read in a magazine that some women
think a man's real sex organ is his brain.

401
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:33,172
Yuck! No contest. I mean, look at it.

402
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:36,450
It's so pink and wriggly-Iooking.

403
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:40,442
- Can I touch it?
- No!

404
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:44,287
- Oh, my God, you're awake?
- Local anaesthetic.

405
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:47,092
Wow, Spikey. How does it feel?

406
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:51,132
Like someone's cutting into my brain
with a knife, you silly bint.

407
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:56,445
You know what it means
that he can't hurt any living thing?

408
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:59,684
- It means he can't even pick flowers.
- What? Yes, I can!

409
00:31:59,773 --> 00:32:01,764
Please be quiet.

410
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:07,366
- Is it supposed to do that?
- Please.

411
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:11,765
- For God's sake, please be quiet.
- Listen, buster.

412
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:14,606
I don't see a crossbow in your hands, OK?

413
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:18,288
Harmony, if your incessant prattling
bollockses up this operation,

414
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:22,366
I'm gonna personally
yank out your pink and wriggly tongue.

415
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:24,764
What are you looking at?

416
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:30,328
- Uh-oh.
- Graham.

417
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:31,812
Graham.

418
00:32:33,853 --> 00:32:36,447
- How many fingers I got up?
- 17.

419
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:42,245
- Hostile 17 and a blonde girl.
- Spike and Harmony, together again.

420
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:49,006
- Where's Dr Overheiser?
- Spike must have taken him.

421
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:52,770
What would Spike want with...? The chip.

422
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:56,243
He's gonna force the doctor
to remove the chip from his brain.

423
00:32:57,173 --> 00:33:00,563
- Riley?
- I'm OK. OK.

424
00:33:01,573 --> 00:33:05,805
We're running out of time. We don't find
the medic soon, he's not gonna make it.

425
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:13,762
OK. OK, brain surgery. He's gonna need a
medical facility, he's gonna need equipment...

426
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:18,165
- It's a big hospital.
- No, he wouldn't do it here. It's too risky.

427
00:33:18,253 --> 00:33:22,132
We'll split up. Graham, get on the horn,
or the pipe, or whatever you guys get on.

428
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:25,603
I want you to check animal hospitals,
doctors' offices...

429
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:28,044
Hey, about before...

430
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:31,125
Forget it. Apologise later, if you're not dead.

431
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:37,845
- You are not going to die.
- Bet you say that to all the boys.

432
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:41,448
No. There is one peroxided pest
whose number's up.

433
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:44,252
I'm gonna rip Spike's head off. I'm gonna...

434
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,688
Bathe in the Slayer's blood.

435
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:49,685
I'm gonna dive in it. Swim in it.

436
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:52,162
I'm gonna do the bloody backstroke.

437
00:33:57,373 --> 00:33:59,568
I see it, Spikey! I see the chip!

438
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:06,766
It's nestled like a pretty Easter egg with your
brain around it, like that plastic grassy stuff...

439
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:08,411
Only this is more of a beige...

440
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:11,929
Would you please put out that cigarette?
It's really not allowed.

441
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:14,004
Oh, yeah? Says who?

442
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:20,091
Oh, God, sorry! Didn't see the sign.

443
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:26,844
The chip's out.
I didn't think I could do it.

444
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:30,369
Itjust... It's out.

445
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:33,047
Yay! Yay for Spikey!

446
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,969
Right, then. Stitch me up, Doc.

447
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:40,408
Got places to go.

448
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:42,961
And slayers to kill.

449
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,363
Listen to me.

450
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:58,251
My stomach's growling, I'm so starved.

451
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:02,443
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to have me a little snack.

452
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:10,846
Oh, don't worry. I won't fill up on the bread.

453
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:15,403
I'll still have plenty of room
for the main course.

454
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:22,405
Slayer!

455
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:34,411
Suit up, Harm.

456
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,971
Stay here. We're gonna need you.

457
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:46,173
Buffy, I swear I was just thinking of you.
I wanted to tell you the great news.

458
00:35:46,253 --> 00:35:49,450
My head's all clear now.
No more bug-zapper in my noggin.

459
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:52,889
- Means I get to kill you.
- You get to try.

460
00:36:00,773 --> 00:36:01,922
Oops!

461
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,248
At long... last.

462
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:48,611
Riley!

463
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:55,969
Riley.

464
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:04,648
- A penny?
- I told you I couldn't do it.

465
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:08,328
Oh, God. Doctor! Doctor, we need you now!

466
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:20,690
Buffy, Buffy, Buffy!
Everywhere I turn, she's there!

467
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:22,729
That nasty little face.

468
00:37:22,813 --> 00:37:28,445
That bouncing shampoo-commercial hair.
That whole sodding holier-than-thou attitude.

469
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:30,171
She follows me, tracks me down.

470
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:35,850
I'm her pet project. Drive Spike round the
bend. Makes every day a fresh bout of torture.

471
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:42,243
- Spike?!
- You don't understand.

472
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:47,123
I can't get rid of her. She's everywhere.
She's haunting me, Harmony.

473
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,052
This... has got to end.

474
00:37:57,973 --> 00:37:59,964
All patched up.

475
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:16,923
- How's it going in there?
- Good.

476
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,764
Back to normal.

477
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:26,125
Yep.

478
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:30,649
And see?

479
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:33,684
I'm still touchable.

480
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:38,846
Give me a week or so to heal
and I'll take full advantage of that fact.

481
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:46,841
Are you gonna be OK?
Cos I should really go check on my mom.

482
00:38:48,853 --> 00:38:52,289
Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. I'll be fine.

483
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:56,124
I'll talk to you later.

484
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:17,686
It's good Buffy found you when she did,
cos you were about to detonate big time.

485
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:22,893
- I've always said she's pretty impressive.
- You know, she really is.

486
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:27,561
But you know you don't belong here.
This town? You're nothing here.

487
00:39:27,653 --> 00:39:29,132
Hey.

488
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:34,003
- What are you saying?
- Come on, man. You know it's true.

489
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:36,687
There's nothing for you here.

490
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:40,652
- There's her.
- OK, right, there's her. And?

491
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:44,328
You used to have a mission.
Now you're what? The mission's boyfriend?

492
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:47,484
The mission's true love?

493
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:55,644
You belong with us.

494
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:07,207
I should have known it was you.
Been nearly six hours.

495
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:09,648
I've been busy cleaning up your mess.

496
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:13,612
My mess? I just borrowed the doc.

497
00:40:13,693 --> 00:40:16,571
The mess is yours, Slayer.
Yours and the boy's.

498
00:40:18,213 --> 00:40:20,204
I'm done.

499
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:25,732
Spike, you're a killer.
And I should've done this years ago.

500
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:30,287
You know what? Do it.

501
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:33,330
Bloody just do it.

502
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:36,849
- What?
- End my torment.

503
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:41,848
Seeing you every day, everywhere I go,
every time I turn around.

504
00:40:41,933 --> 00:40:45,403
Take me out of a world that has you in it.

505
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:48,404
Kill me!

506
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:28,166
Spike, I want you.

507
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:31,768
Buffy, I love you.
God, I love you so much.

508
00:41:37,053 --> 00:41:38,691
Oh, God, no!

509
00:41:40,253 --> 00:41:42,369
Please, no.
