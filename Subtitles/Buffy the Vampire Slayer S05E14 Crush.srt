1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:05,011
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
- Look at you.

2
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:07,653
- All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
- Because you are.

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,406
"They had to be certain
the Slayer would protect it,

4
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:13,326
so they sent the Key to her
in the form of a sister."

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,802
- I'm not real.
- You're the Key.

6
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:19,450
Go! Before she finds you. Don't...
She's here!

7
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:24,482
Ben. He was trying to help me. He might have
left before Glory came. I can't remember.

9
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,283
 I'm amused

10
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:39,933
 By the overwhelming choices

11
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:42,129
 I guess the hardest part

12
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,408
 Is knowing when to stop

13
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:46,927
 Yeah, I'm confused

14
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,527
 And I think I'm hearing voices

15
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:51,808
 Things are happening so fast

16
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,407
 Do I save the best for last?

17
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:57,967
Bleeding crime is what it is.

18
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:03,209
Jacking up the bar price
to pay for fixing up this sinkhole.

19
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:06,330
Not my fault the insurance
doesn't cover "act of troll".

20
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:09,803
Gee, maybe it's time
you found a new place to patronise.

21
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:14,967
I've half a mind to, since the flowering onion
got remodelled right off the sodding menu.

22
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:18,045
It's the only thing
this place had going for it.

23
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:22,172
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean, "What am I..."?

24
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:28,205
Here. At this table. Talking to me.
Like we're some kind of talking buddies.

25
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:33,204
Well, I saw you sitting here alone.

26
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:37,923
Thought, I don't know, you could,
maybe do with a bit of, you know, company.

27
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:44,049
Suit yourself.

28
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:51,769
Well... we took on that Glory chippy together.
I was right there with you, fighting the fight.

29
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:54,287
Or sleeping the sleep
of the knocked unconscious.

30
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:58,685
Still, points for intent. You'd think that
would be enough to cut me a sliver of slack.

31
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:03,688
- Earn me a little consideration, respect.
- Hey, Evil Dead, you're in my seat.

32
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:07,764
Bugger it.

33
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,808
Xander, I think you hurt his feelings.

34
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:19,602
And you should never
hurt the feelings of a brutal killer.

35
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:23,288
You know, that's actually
some pretty good advice.

36
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:27,924
Who's up for more liquid refreshments?
I'm buying, for I am Payday Man.

37
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:29,446
I could use a water.

38
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:33,242
Water poses no challenge
for Payday Man, for I have...

39
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,008
Hey, where's my change?

40
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,924
Spike, you diabolical fiend.

41
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:45,528
Poor Will. Still getting those headaches?

42
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:49,925
Fewer and further between, but they're
still exercising their visitation rights.

43
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:54,928
Honey, in case you didn't hear me the first
6,000 times, no more teleportation spells.

44
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:57,732
We have squat in the way of
Glory-fighting arsenal.

45
00:02:57,813 --> 00:03:02,967
Another run-in with her, and headaches and
nosebleeds will be the least of our problems.

46
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:08,252
This is my first R and R in weeks. Can we go
one night without saying the name Glory?

47
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,531
I'm down with that. Let's call She Who Will
Not Be Named another name. Let's call her...

48
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:14,569
- Ben!
- For example.

49
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,083
I'll be right back.

50
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:19,289
- Ben! Hey!
- Buffy, hi.

51
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:22,885
I barely recognised you
without your hospital scrubs.

52
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:26,682
Oh, you'd be surprised
at the extent of my wardrobe.

53
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,607
- Really?
- I have entire outfits that aren't blue pyjamas.

54
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:37,969
My sister told me what happened
at the hospital before I got there.

55
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:41,841
- Uh-huh.
- And I just wanted to say... thanks.

56
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,528
For looking after her.

57
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:49,366
That's OK. I'm glad Dawn's all right.

58
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:53,082
- The point is, I work hard for that money.
- And you're saying I didn't?

59
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:56,563
- You stole it.
- And you're making it into very hard work.

60
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,247
Listen, Bleach Boy,
I don't have a chip in my head.

61
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,450
I can do far more damage to you
than you can ever do to me.

62
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,524
Yeah?

63
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,682
Like you could ever hurt me.

64
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:42,245
Sunnydale Station! Last stop this line!

65
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:06,041
Oh, God! Oh, please! Help me!

66
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,488
Somebody, please! Help me!

67
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:09,368
Buffy?

68
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,923
- I'm back by popular demand.
- Did you have a nice time?

69
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:16,926
You know, I think I did. Much needed fun.

70
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:20,210
Apart from Willow's headaches
and Spike's cameo appearance.

71
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:22,011
- Spike was there?
- Unfortunately.

72
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:24,084
Well, I'm relieved that you're home.

73
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:28,166
Because, to be honest,
I wasn't feeling all that safe with you gone.

74
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:31,005
At first.

75
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:35,211
And then I remembered that Rupert was here
and I felt much, much safer.

76
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:38,808
Yes, well, thank you for the little back-pedal,
but I'm forced to agree

77
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:43,489
that I'm barely an adequate substitute
for a slayer in the house. Good night.

78
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:45,564
Good night.

79
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:50,611
- So how is Dawn?
- She's coping very well.

80
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:55,972
Extremely well, really, considering
the extraordinary circumstances of her origin.

81
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:59,011
Then let me ask you something.

82
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:02,881
We've been going easy on her
the last week, letting things slide.

83
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,441
- I don't think that's at all wise.
- You don't?

84
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:09,048
The best thing you can do now
is behave exactly as you always have.

85
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:13,285
Any special treatment at this stage
will undermine Dawn's sense of normality.

86
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:16,012
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

87
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,970
Thanks. Dawn!

88
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:21,725
- What?
- What did I say about borrowing my clothes?

89
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,292
- I didn't.
- Bull!

90
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:27,332
- I never touched your stuff.
- Then what happened to my blue sweater?

91
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:31,163
Spikey?

92
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:34,689
- Aren't you coming to bed?
- I'm not tired.

93
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,404
Me neither.

94
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:42,208
Don't you wanna come in and...

95
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:44,688
tire me out?

96
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:48,288
Harm, I'm really not in the mood right now.

97
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,848
You're never in the mood.

98
00:07:55,453 --> 00:08:00,846
- We could do something different tonight.
- Like you stop yammering for two seconds?

99
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,003
Well, we could...

100
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,004
I don't know...

101
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:08,163
maybe play a game?

102
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,607
Oh, I'm gonna stake you!

103
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:19,163
I'm coming after you,
you bad, evil vampire,

104
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,892
and I'm gonna slay you!

105
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:27,090
I'm sneaking up,
and I'm gonna stake you so much

106
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,928
with my slaying powers
that I have because I'm the Chosen...

107
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:35,727
Oh, Spike!

108
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,851
I don't see why
he couldn't end up with Esmeralda.

109
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:42,687
They could have the wedding right there,
beneath the very bell tower

110
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,731
where he laboured thanklessly
for all those years.

111
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:50,091
No, it can't end like that, cos Quasimodo's
actions were selfishly motivated.

112
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:53,051
He had no moral compass,
no understanding of right.

113
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,728
Everything he did was out of love
for a woman who would never love him.

114
00:08:56,813 --> 00:09:01,933
Also, you can tell it's not gonna have a happy
ending when the main guy's all bumpy.

115
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:08,248
- What do you think, Buffy?
- The test isn't till tomorrow, right?

116
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:12,292
- I don't have an opinion till then.
- But you read it, right?

117
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:14,762
Kinda not. I rented the movie.

118
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,606
Oh, with Charles Laughton?

119
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:21,603
- I dunno. He one of the singing gargoyles?
- Oh, boy.

120
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,888
What? I'm kidding!

121
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:29,526
- You're done with this?
- Yeah, hi, kind of reading that...

122
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,725
"Six found murdered on train
at Sunnydale Station."

123
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:35,690
Glory?

124
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:40,483
"Unconfirmed reports of severe trauma
to the throats of one or more of the victims."

125
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:44,245
Survey says... vampire.

126
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:52,651
Oh, it's you.
What are you doing here, lurking about?

127
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,490
I'm not lurking. I'm looking.

128
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:59,041
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

129
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:03,243
So is that how you
get around town in the daytime?

130
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,370
I mean, does that lead
into the sewers or something?

131
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:09,047
- Can you show me?
- No.

132
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:11,884
Why are you...?

133
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:15,123
Does Buffy know you're here?

134
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:16,566
Yeah, right.

135
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:22,091
Nothing would make her happier than to
find out I'm hanging out in a vampire's lair.

136
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:26,086
- Especially yours.
- Go home, then.

137
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:29,366
- I don't feel like it.
- You can't bloody well stay here.

138
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:31,887
- Why not?
- Because I've got things to do.

139
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,052
Bad, evil things!

140
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:39,201
That are not for a child's eyes.

141
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,282
I'm not a child.

142
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:44,728
I'm not even human.

143
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,804
Not originally.

144
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:51,323
Yeah, well, originally I was. I got over it.

145
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:55,845
Doesn't seem to me
it matters very much how you start out.

146
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:58,891
That's smart. I get that.

147
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:05,250
I like how you talk to me
like I can understand things.

148
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,769
Everyone else is being
all twitchy and secretive.

149
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:11,765
They're just trying to keep you safe, I expect.

150
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:14,208
I feel safe with you.

151
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:19,327
- Take that back!
- I mean, you have the superpower thing.

152
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:23,450
You're just as tough as Buffy is,
maybe tougher.

153
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:27,286
- Buffy thinks so too.
- She does?

154
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:32,763
Well, she's always worried about what she'll
do if you ever get that chip out of your head.

155
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:35,287
Is that right?

156
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:40,322
So, what else does Buffy say about me?

157
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:43,811
- Hey!
- Dawn?

158
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:46,248
No, it's me.

159
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,131
- Is Dawn with you?
- Isn't she here?

160
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:53,445
No, she didn't come home from school. The
news said something about people murdered.

161
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:58,448
It's not Glory. It has nothing to do
with Dawn, I promise. Look, she probably...

162
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,728
I'll find her.

163
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:04,848
And the lady just invited you in?

164
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,322
Well, I had hubby by the throat, didn't I?

165
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:10,564
Promised her he'd live if she did the invite.

166
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:13,008
And did you? Let him live?

167
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:15,409
What do you think?

168
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:19,092
- Too much for you?
- No. Keep going.

169
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:23,972
And I kill 'em. Right quick, the whole lot.

170
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:27,324
But there's someone missing.

171
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,850
There's supposed to be this little girl.

172
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,331
So I get real quiet,

173
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:41,411
and I hear this tiny noise
coming from the coal bin.

174
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,244
This little sigh.

175
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:50,409
So I listened harder. It's very, very quiet...

176
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:56,323
- Bloody hell!
- Spike, I need your help. Dawn is...

177
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,890
here.

178
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:02,170
Spike was telling a story,
and he was at this really cool part...

179
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,892
What the hell is this?
What is she doing here?

180
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,801
- Just hanging out.
- Here?

181
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:12,850
Can you please let him finish the story?
Then you could do the lecture?

182
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:17,764
Yeah. OK.

183
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:22,607
Let's hear the story
that Spike is telling my little sister.

184
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:24,481
Right.

185
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,446
Yeah.

186
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:29,730
So, I knew the girl was in the coal bin,

187
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:33,726
and rip it open, very violent,
haul her out of there...

188
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,691
and then I give her
to a good family in a nice home,

189
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:40,652
where they're never ever mean to her,
and didn't lock her in the coal bin.

190
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,008
What? That's so lame!

191
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:46,688
I was just about to send her home.
I knew you'd be fretting.

192
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:51,645
Dawn, get your stuff.
We're getting out of here.

193
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:57,525
Why doesn't that register with you?
Crypt plus vampire equals bad.

194
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:59,922
Cos it was Spike!

195
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:02,891
Hanging out with Spike
is not cool, Dawn. OK?

196
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:05,771
It is dangerous, and... icky.

197
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:11,211
- I don't think Spike's icky.
- Yeah, well, think again, sister.

198
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:17,246
- You have a crush on him.
- No, I don't!

199
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:23,128
It's just, he's got cool hair,
and he wears cool leather coats and stuff.

200
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:27,449
- And he doesn't treat me like an alien.
- He's a killer, Dawn.

201
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,731
You cannot have a crush on something
that is dead, and evil, and a vampire.

202
00:14:31,813 --> 00:14:35,203
Right, that's why you were
never with Angel for three years.

203
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:37,409
Angel's different. He has a soul.

204
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:39,563
Spike has a chip. Same diff.

205
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:42,087
I can't listen to this!

206
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:48,522
Spike is a monster, OK?
And plus you are only 14 years old.

207
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:51,411
I like hanging out with him is all.

208
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:56,843
And even if I had a crush, he wouldn't notice
in a million years. Not with you around.

209
00:14:57,253 --> 00:15:00,529
- What does that mean?
- Spike's totally into you.

210
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,887
Oh, come on. You didn't notice?

211
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:09,045
Buffy, Spike's completely in love with you.

212
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:20,886
- So tell me again what we're looking for?
- Clues.

213
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:22,372
OK.

214
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,603
Could you give me a clue
about what kind of clues?

215
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,608
Something. Anything.

216
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:35,882
Just wanna know if this was a vamp attack.
And if it was, how many we're talking about.

217
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:39,522
Well, Sunnydale's finest
didn't leave us a lot of stuff to examine,

218
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:43,083
and who knows how many people
have traipsed through here.

219
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,845
- Xander?
- What?

220
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,004
Never mind.

221
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:55,365
It's just that... Dawn said that...

222
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:59,727
- Yeah?
- Forget it.

223
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,642
Buffy.

224
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,410
She thinks that... She said that...

225
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,922
Spike's in love with me.

226
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:19,368
- I'm notjoking.
- Oh, I hope not. It's funnier if it's true.

227
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:22,650
I'm serious. Xander, this is serious!

228
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:25,005
All right.

229
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,372
- It's creepy.
- No.

230
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:34,684
Not creepy. Cos it's not real!

231
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:40,006
How upset can you get over one of Spike's
fevered daydreams that's not gonna happen?

232
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:43,529
- I guess.
- So, where did Dawn...?

233
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:47,731
How did she come to this
extremely entertaining conclusion?

234
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:52,892
She was hanging out with Spike.
I think she has a crush on him.

235
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:58,651
- What?
- I knew he had a weird fixation with me...

236
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:01,293
I'm the one she has a crush on! Me!

237
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:04,570
- There's nothing here. Let's go.
- It's always been me!

238
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:08,532
Big funny Xander! What, she just suddenly
decides I'm not the cool one any more?

239
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:11,002
Why is that OK?

240
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:17,212
But what they didn't get
was that it was a copy of the bill of lading.

241
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:19,682
So they thought it was another order form.

242
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:23,607
So now I've got two shipments
of Greek amphorae on my hands!

243
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:27,368
That's funny. And, really,
how many do you need? Amphorae?

244
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,811
Oh, Buffy. Spike came by
to apologise for yesterday.

245
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:33,929
Our missing-child drama.

246
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,846
And he just decided to hang out for a while?

247
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:40,289
Well, I got talking about the gallery.
See, there was this...

248
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:44,651
Don't get us all laughing again, Joyce.
Anyhow, I really need to talk to your eldest.

249
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,405
What about?

250
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,167
I got a bit of info
you might be keen on knowing.

251
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:55,246
Sorry, all out of cash.
Why don't you hit on Giles... hit up Giles?

252
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:59,332
I got a bead on the guy who killed
those people. The ones on the train.

253
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,132
- Do tell.
- I'll do better than that. I'll show.

254
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:06,411
What's the matter?

255
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:08,484
Nothing. Just...

256
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:13,211
Two vamps holed up
in a warehouse downtown.

257
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:17,809
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Grab your coat and your pointy sticks.

258
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,047
Hey!

259
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,487
It's not blood, it's bourbon.

260
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:46,284
Suit yourself.

261
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,289
 I wanna be sedated

262
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:02,808
Do you like the Ramones?

263
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,805
So if you're not doing this
for the money, why are y...?

264
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,764
Slayer.

265
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:34,126
Well... that was sad.

266
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:38,007
I'm embarrassed for our kind.

267
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:44,003
So should we chase after 'em, then?
They couldn't have gone far.

268
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:47,802
These vamps have been here for a while.
They've nested.

269
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:50,965
So, you're saying
they're a couple of poofters?

270
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:55,569
No. I'm saying they had nothing
to do with last night's murders.

271
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,325
How do you figure?

272
00:19:57,413 --> 00:20:00,723
Whoever did it only arrived in town last night.

273
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:03,281
Looks like you've wasted my time.

274
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:13,521
What are you doing?

275
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:18,968
I wasn't thinking.

276
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:22,649
- What is this?
- Oh, don't get your knickers twisted. I was...

277
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:25,293
What is this?

278
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:29,566
The late-night stakeout?
The bogus suspects? The flask?

279
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:33,530
- Is this a date?
- A d...?

280
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:36,685
Please! A date?

281
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:41,722
You are completely off your bird!
I mean... Do you want it to be?

282
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,523
Oh, my God.

283
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:53,290
Oh, no.

284
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:57,090
- Are you out of your mind?
- It's not so unusual.

285
00:20:59,173 --> 00:21:02,085
Two people in the workplace...

286
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:04,607
- Feelings develop.
- No! No.

287
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:07,253
No, feelings do not develop. No feelings.

288
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,962
You can't deny it.
There's something between us.

289
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:12,850
Loathing. Disgust.

290
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,651
Heat. Desire.

291
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:18,089
- Please! Spike, you're a vampire.
- Angel was a vampire.

292
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:23,203
- Angel was good.
- And I can be too. I've changed, Buffy.

293
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:26,969
What, that chip in your head?
That's not change.

294
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:30,602
That's just holding you back.
You're like a serial killer in prison!

295
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:32,968
Women marry 'em all the time!

296
00:21:33,653 --> 00:21:38,852
But I'm not like that. Something's happening
to me. I can't stop thinking about you.

297
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,608
And if that means turning my back on evil...

298
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:45,288
You don't know what you mean!
You don't know what feelings are!

299
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:48,604
I damn well do! I lie awake every night!

300
00:21:48,693 --> 00:21:52,208
- You sleep during the day!
- Yeah, but...

301
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:55,524
You are missing the point. This is real here.

302
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,210
- I love...
- Don't!

303
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:01,284
Don't say it.

304
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:06,962
- I'm going.
- Oh, come on, we need to talk...

305
00:22:07,053 --> 00:22:11,683
We don't need to do anything!
OK? There is no "we"!

306
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:14,244
Understand?

307
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:18,242
Buffy...

308
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:41,127
Who's there?

309
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:44,091
A happy memory, pretty Spike.

310
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,770
Look who's come
to make everything right again.

311
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,086
So, let me get this straight.

312
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:06,687
Darla got mojoed back from the beyond,
you vamped her,

313
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:11,369
and now she and you are working on
turning Angel into his own bad self again.

314
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:16,368
- Sounds fun.
- It is. Like lollipops at the circus.

315
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,366
Although...

316
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:21,843
didn't care for Angelus setting us on fire.

317
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,642
And this has got you, what,
all nostalgic now, has it?

318
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:28,884
I want us to be a family again, my William.

319
00:23:32,973 --> 00:23:35,168
Come back with me.

320
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:39,329
To Los Angeles?

321
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:43,683
I've done the whole LA scene, Dru.
Didn't agree with me.

322
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:49,692
Besides, I've got a sweet
little setup here in Sunny D.

323
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:52,209
Decent digs...

324
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:55,205
not to mention all the tasty townies I can eat.

325
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:57,887
Naughty.

326
00:23:57,973 --> 00:24:00,646
You needn't make up stories.

327
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:03,327
I already know why you're not coming.

328
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:06,288
Poor boy.

329
00:24:06,373 --> 00:24:09,843
Tin soldiers put funny little
knick-knacks in your brain.

330
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:12,925
Can't hunt. Can't hurt. Can't kill.

331
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:18,642
You've got a chip.

332
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:21,327
Right, so you've heard.

333
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,090
Poor Spike's become
a cautionary tale for vampires, right?

334
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:29,963
"You better be good, kiddies,
or else they might wire you up someday!"

335
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:33,003
I don't believe in science.

336
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:36,483
All those bits and molecules
no one's ever seen.

337
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:39,041
I trust eyes and heart alone.

338
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:44,212
And do you know what mine
is singing out right now?

339
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:49,043
You're a killer.

340
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:50,930
Born to slash...

341
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:53,481
and bash... and...

342
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:58,731
bleed, like beautiful poetry.

343
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,689
No little Tinkertoy
could ever stop you from flowing.

344
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:07,764
Yeah.

345
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:15,770
But the pain... Love, you don't understand.

346
00:25:17,613 --> 00:25:20,605
It's searing. It's blinding.

347
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:25,961
All in your head.

348
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:27,805
I can see it.

349
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,202
Little bit of plastic,

350
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:33,091
spider-webbing out nasty blue shocks.

351
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,407
And every one is a lie.

352
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,801
Electricity lies, Spike.

353
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:43,681
It tells you you're not a bad dog, but you are.

354
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:53,009
- What the heck is this?
- Oh, bloody hell.

355
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,924
Who is...?

356
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:59,165
Oh, wait. I get it.
Our little sex game was just the beginning.

357
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:04,486
Now you pick up some cheap queen of the
damned to dress as your precious Droodzilla.

358
00:26:04,573 --> 00:26:05,164
Harm...

359
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:09,883
You better not be thinking what I think you're
thinking. My answer is the same as always.

360
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:14,364
No threesomes unless it's boy,
boy, girl. Or Charlize Theron.

361
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:18,128
Harm, you moron, this is Drusilla.

362
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:26,081
Well. You've got some nerve
showing up here like this.

363
00:26:26,173 --> 00:26:30,132
After all this time.
After breaking my sweet boo-boo's heart.

364
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:35,612
Do you have any idea how hard it's been to
break down the walls he put up after you left?

365
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:38,127
- I mean, serious trust issues.
- Harm...

366
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:43,890
So it's no use crawling back to him, cos
he don't play that game any more, Morticia.

367
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:53,249
It's been fun while it lasted, Harm, but
I think it'd be best now if you hit the road.

368
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:01,811
Why? Because she's back?

369
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,847
No.

370
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,969
Because I am.

371
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:16,165
And there you are, my darling, deadly boy.

372
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:24,964
Well, he actually told you?
He said "I love you"?

373
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:29,645
Well, I didn't let him get that far,
but I could see the words coming.

374
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:34,761
Honey, did you... somehow,
unintentionally, lead him on in any way?

375
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,571
Send him signals?

376
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:39,645
Well, I do beat him up a lot.

377
00:27:41,013 --> 00:27:43,481
For Spike that's like third base.

378
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:47,292
Buffy, I'm really worried.

379
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,887
So am I. He could become dangerous.

380
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:54,922
Not really. As long as it's still chips ahoy in
Spike's head, he can't hurt me, or any of us.

381
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,771
Besides, this'll probably
just blow over. You know?

382
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:04,246
It's just a weird Spike thing. He'll have the
hots for some gak demon before we know it.

383
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:08,611
I don't know. These things
can become pretty twisted.

384
00:28:08,693 --> 00:28:12,129
- Yeah, and Spike, I mean, he's...
- Pretty twisted.

385
00:28:12,213 --> 00:28:13,532
Yeah.

386
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:16,730
Well, you made it clear, right?
That it could never happen.

387
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:20,601
- That there's no possible way. Ever.
- Yeah!

388
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:25,972
I think so. I don't know. I was just so thrown.

389
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:31,286
- Well, Buffy, you have to talk to him again.
- What? No. No, no, I have to avoid him again.

390
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:33,887
Not until you shut him down completely.

391
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:38,728
If he thinks there's even a little chance
with you, there's no telling what he'll do.

392
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:43,653
 And this time

393
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:46,770
 I'm staying

394
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:53,005
 To bury the trail that you left

395
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:55,482
 You left

396
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:13,207
 And if I was cold

397
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:17,605
 Well, then you would

398
00:29:17,693 --> 00:29:21,322
 Stay inside me

399
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:24,132
 Warm me

400
00:29:31,693 --> 00:29:34,924
 Here I stay...

401
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:40,044
I know this is hard, but you made the right
decision. Better to nip this in the bud before...

402
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:42,442
- The bud nips me?
- Exactly.

403
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:46,446
If you want, Buffy, I can go with.
Back you up with some scowling.

404
00:29:46,773 --> 00:29:50,891
Thanks, but I think
this is something I have to do myself.

405
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:56,206
Besides, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this whole
thing's just been blown way out of proportion

406
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:58,727
and he's already gone back
to wanting me dead.

407
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:00,804
Here's hoping.

408
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:07,642
You know what, though? There is one thing
you can do for me while I'm gone.

409
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,810
 I told you

410
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:14,205
 Just like I told everyone

411
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:17,808
 I still have some doubts

412
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:21,363
 That you are the reason

413
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:25,088
 Still this is just so hard

414
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:28,370
 Cos I know that I'll be left

415
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:31,445
 Like always

416
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,324
 Always

417
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:39,731
 Here I'm safe

418
00:30:39,813 --> 00:30:43,408
 So here I stay

419
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:47,529
 Lift me out

420
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,411
 Lift the doubt

421
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:16,044
Spike?

422
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:20,724
Are you here?

423
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:32,164
Spike?

424
00:32:49,373 --> 00:32:52,012
See anything interesting?

425
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:55,088
Spike... I...

426
00:32:56,853 --> 00:32:58,844
What...

427
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:02,287
- What happened?
- Me.

428
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:07,405
You remember my ex, don't you, Slayer?

429
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,770
Come back, she did.
Couldn't live without me.

430
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:17,851
My boy's been feeding again.
But I know what he really wants to eat.

431
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:26,203
Shall we tie her up?
Play with her a teensy bit first?

432
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:30,450
I'm through playing.

433
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:34,845
I like it when you're all dour
and straight-to-business, like.

434
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:46,967
Bloody well through playing.

435
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,608
There she is.

436
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:02,129
I was beginning to think
you'd sleep the night away.

437
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:07,251
Dru... Drusilla?

438
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:14,203
Not nice to change the game
in mid-play, Spike.

439
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:17,888
You've taken my chair
and the music hasn't stopped.

440
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,964
Sorry, pet. My house, my rules.

441
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:22,851
I think I shall be very cross with you
when I'm free again.

442
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:25,811
- What's going on?
- Simple.

443
00:34:25,893 --> 00:34:28,282
I'm gonna prove something.

444
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:32,929
I love you.

445
00:34:33,013 --> 00:34:35,925
- Oh, my God.
- No, look at me.

446
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:38,648
I... love you.

447
00:34:40,853 --> 00:34:43,572
You're all I bloody think about.

448
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,012
Dream about.

449
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:50,085
You're in my gut, in my throat.

450
00:34:52,493 --> 00:34:55,053
I'm drowning in you, Summers,
I'm drowning in you.

451
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,972
I can do without the laugh track, Dru.

452
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:03,613
But it's so funny.

453
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:07,045
I knew... before you did.

454
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:12,646
I knew you loved the Slayer.
The pixies in my head whispered it to me...

455
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:17,124
You can't tell me there isn't anything between
you and me. I know you feel something.

456
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:21,764
It's called revulsion. And whatever
you think you're feeling, it's not love.

457
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,003
You can't love without a soul.

458
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:26,288
Oh, we can, you know.

459
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:30,525
We can love quite well... if not wisely.

460
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:35,482
You still don't believe. You still
don't think I mean it. You want proof?

461
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:39,408
How's this?

462
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:48,649
I'm gonna kill Drusilla for you.

463
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:55,602
It doesn't prove anything. Except that you're
a sick vampire I should have dusted long ago.

464
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:58,605
- And hey, already there.
- Don't mock this.

465
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:02,322
- Go mock yourself.
- This is Drusilla, girl!

466
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:07,043
Do you have the slightest idea what she
means to me? It's the face of my salvation!

467
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:13,929
She delivered me from mediocrity. For over
a century we cut a swath through continents.

468
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:17,210
A hundred years,
she never stopped surprising me.

469
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:20,731
Never stopped taking me to new depths.

470
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:25,092
I was a lucky bloke.

471
00:36:25,173 --> 00:36:28,051
Just to touch such a black beauty.

472
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:37,011
So you see, it means something.

473
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:39,653
Not to me. Kill her. Why do I care?

474
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:43,004
Here's why.

475
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:47,764
If you don't admit
that there's something there...

476
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:55,083
some tiny feeling for me...
then I'll untie Dru and let her kill you instead.

477
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:57,211
Yes, please.

478
00:36:57,293 --> 00:36:59,443
I like that game much more.

479
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:01,603
Just...

480
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:04,563
give me something.

481
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:07,645
A crumb. The barest smidgen.

482
00:37:09,653 --> 00:37:12,565
Tell me... maybe,

483
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:15,847
someday, there's a chance.

484
00:37:25,853 --> 00:37:27,844
Spike...

485
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:33,967
The only chance you had with me
was when I was unconscious.

486
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:47,890
What the bleeding hell is wrong
with you bloody women?

487
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,963
What the hell does it take?

488
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:54,284
Why do you bitches torture me?

489
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:58,446
- Which question shall I answer first?
- I'm at the end of my bleeding tether.

490
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:01,001
I don't even know why I even bother.

491
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:04,051
It's your fault.
You're the one to blame for all this.

492
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:06,601
- Am I?
- Bloody right you are!

493
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:10,925
If you hadn't left me for that chaos demon,
I never would have come back here!

494
00:38:11,013 --> 00:38:16,041
Never would have had a sodding chip in my
skull! And you wouldn't be able to touch me.

495
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:18,966
Because this, with you, is wrong.

496
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:20,884
I know it.

497
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:23,487
I'm not a complete idiot.

498
00:38:23,573 --> 00:38:25,768
You think I like having you in here?

499
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:30,165
Destroying everything that was me,
until all that's left is you, in a dead shell.

500
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:32,892
You say you hate it, but you won't leave.

501
00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:37,330
You know, what I should just do
is get rid of both of you. Burn you.

502
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:42,806
Cut you into little pieces, so there won't be
any more bints to cock up things for Spi...

503
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,325
- Oh, great.
- What about me, Spike?

504
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:52,167
You forget about me again?
The actual girlfriend?

505
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:57,122
I gave you the best...
bunch of months of my life!

506
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:02,767
That's right, little girl.
Teach our naughty boy a lesson.

507
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:07,483
- Oh, so now you're all ganging up?
- I thought I could change you, Spike.

508
00:39:07,573 --> 00:39:10,770
I thought maybe if I gave and I gave and gave,

509
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:13,731
maybe you'd come around.

510
00:39:13,813 --> 00:39:17,806
Maybe be a little nicer.
Stop treating me like your dog.

511
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:21,042
But now I see it's you.

512
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:24,045
You're the dog, who needs to be put...

513
00:39:49,173 --> 00:39:51,164
You're on my hair.

514
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:28,002
Poor Spike.

515
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,483
So lost. Even I can't help you now.

516
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:38,564
Oh, Spikey.

517
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,405
And you can say goodbye to this.

518
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:45,610
Because you're not gonna see it any more.

519
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:51,006
Unless you run into me somewhere
and it's me walking away from you.

520
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:56,087
But even then, I'll probably just,
you know, back away.

521
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:18,486
Buffy? Come on now, stop!
You can'tjust walk away from this.

522
00:41:18,573 --> 00:41:23,169
- What part did you not understand?
- We had a fight. It doesn't change anything.

523
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:26,962
It changes everything, Spike! I want you out.

524
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:30,090
I want you out of this town,
I want you off this planet!

525
00:41:30,173 --> 00:41:35,167
You don't come near me, my friends
or my family again, ever! Understand?

526
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:40,609
No. It's not that easy. We have something,
Buffy. It's not pretty, but it's real.

527
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:46,404
And there's nothing we can do about it.
I'm in your life. You can'tjust shut me out...

528
00:42:17,653 --> 00:42:19,689
