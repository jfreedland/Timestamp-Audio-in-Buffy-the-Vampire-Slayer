1
00:00:02,062 --> 00:00:04,462
In every generation there is a Chosen One.

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:10,093
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness.

3
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,621
She is the Slayer.

4
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:31,661
May I cut in?

5
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:43,676
- You all right?
- Oh, thanks to you.

6
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:49,266
You hurt your hand.
Will you still be able to...

7
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,687
Finish my solo and kiss you
like you've never been kissed before?

8
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,942
You're drooling.

9
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:35,071
Xander!

10
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:37,031
You've got a little...

11
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:40,286
Their ancestors were here
long before we were.

12
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,372
Their progeny will be here
long after we are gone.

13
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:46,585
The simple and ubiquitous ant.

14
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:54,505
Now, if you read the homework,
you should know the two ways

15
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:57,470
that ants communicate.

16
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:01,352
Miss Summers?

17
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:03,521
Ways that ants communicate?

18
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:06,817
With other ants?

19
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,655
From the homework,
ants are communicating...

20
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,370
Touch

21
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:19,373
and, um...

22
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:23,504
BO?

23
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:26,341
Thank God someone finally
found the courage to mention that.

24
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:31,222
That would be touch and smell,
Miss Summers?

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,893
Is there anything else Miss Rosenberg
would like to tell you?

26
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:41,526
All right. Chapters six through eight
by tomorrow, people!

27
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,903
Can I see you for a moment?

28
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:47,908
I gather you had a few problems
at your last school.

29
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:50,077
Well, what teenager doesn't?

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,580
Cut school, get in fights,

31
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:54,749
burn down the gymnasium.

32
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,003
Principal Flutie showed me
your permanent record.

33
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:02,300
Well, that fire, there was
major extenuating circumstances.

34
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:06,304
- Actually, it's kind of funny.
- I can't wait to see what you'll do here.

35
00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:09,892
Destructo Girl, that's me.

36
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:14,565
- But I suspect it's gonna be great.
- You mean "great" in a bad way.

37
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,393
You have a first-rate mind
and can think on your feet.

38
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:21,897
Imagine what you could accomplish
if you actually did the...

39
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:23,617
The homework thing?

40
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:25,828
The homework thing.

41
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:29,332
I understand you probably have
a good excuse for not doing it.

42
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,585
Amazingly enough, I don't care.

43
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:36,791
I know you can excel in this class
and so I expect no less.

44
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:39,113
Is that clear?

45
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:40,929
Yeah.

46
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,725
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Be smart.

47
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,364
And please don't listen to

48
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:51,007
the Principal or anyone else's
negative opinion about you.

49
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,360
Let's make him eat that permanent record.

50
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:56,615
What do you say?

51
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,658
OK.

52
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:00,828
Thanks.

53
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:04,917
Chapters six through eight.

54
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,934
Seven, including Cheryl.

55
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:38,148
I tell you though, her sister
was lookin' to make it eight.

56
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,686
Ooh! Cheryl's sister? The one in college?

57
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:43,730
Home for the holidays and looking for love.

58
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:47,569
She's not my type, though. A girl's really
gotta have something to go with me.

59
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:49,946
Something like a lobotomy?

60
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:53,033
Xander, how many times've you scored?

61
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:56,746
- Well, uh...
- It's just a question.

62
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,958
Are we talking today or the whole week?

63
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:05,131
Ooh! Duty calls.

64
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:08,760
Babes!

65
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,099
- What are you doing?
- Work with me here.

66
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,121
Blayne had the nerve
to question my manliness.

67
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:19,288
- I'm just gonna give him a visual.
- We'll show him!

68
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:25,614
- I don't believe it.
- I know. And after all my conquests.

69
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:30,086
- Who's that?
- That must be Angel... I think.

70
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:32,485
That weird guy that warned her
about all the vampires?

71
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,329
That's him, I'll bet you.

72
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:38,046
Well, he's buff. She never said
anything about him being buff.

73
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,417
You think he's buff?

74
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,774
He's a very attractive man.
How come that never came up?

75
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,430
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi.

76
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:50,101
I'd say it's nice to see you,
but then we'd both know that's a big fib.

77
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,937
I won't be long.

78
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,643
No, you'll just give me a cryptic warning
about some exciting new catastrophe,

79
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:57,983
and then disappear into the night. Right?

80
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:00,531
- You're cold.
- You can take it.

81
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,743
I mean... you look cold.

82
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,624
Oh, right. Give her your jacket.

83
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:11,627
It's a balmy night. No one needs
to be trading clothing out there!

84
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:13,964
It's a little big on me.

85
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,512
- What happened?
- I didn't pay attention.

86
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:22,473
- To somebody with a big fork?
- He's coming.

87
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:26,186
- The fork guy?
- Don't let him corner you.

88
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,594
Don't give him a moment's mercy.
He'll rip your throat out.

89
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:33,570
OK. I'll give you
improved marks for that one.

90
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:37,616
Ripping a throat out
is a strong visual. It's not cryptic.

91
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:40,328
I have to go.

92
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:44,667
Sweet dreams to you, too.

93
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:52,384
That's all he said? "Fork guy"?

94
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,971
That's all Cryptic Guy said - "fork guy".

95
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:59,184
There are too many guys in your life!
I'll see what I can find out.

96
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:03,063
God, every day here is the same.

97
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:06,610
Bright, sunny, beautiful.
How ever can we escape this torment?

98
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:09,196
- Really! Morning.
- Morning.

99
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,283
Guess what I just heard in the office.
No Dr Gregory today.

100
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:15,871
Ergo, those of us who blew off
our homework aren't as dumb as we look.

101
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:18,717
- What happened? Is he sick?
- They didn't say anything about sick.

102
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:20,863
Something about... missing.

103
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:23,087
- He's missing?
- Well, let me think.

104
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:26,931
The cheerleaders were modelling
their new short skirts. I kinda got...

105
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:29,602
Yeah. Yeah, they said: "missing."

106
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:34,726
- Which is bad?
- If something's wrong, yeah.

107
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:38,564
He's one of the only teachers
that doesn't think Buffy's a felon.

108
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,777
I'm really sorry. I'm sure he'II...

109
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,394
Could you help me?

110
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:13,648
Uh... yes.

111
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:16,276
I'm looking for Science 109.

112
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:18,821
Oh, it's um...

113
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:23,034
I go there every day.

114
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:26,746
Oh, God, where is it?

115
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,835
Hi. Blayne Mall.
I'm goin' there right now.

116
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:34,381
It's not far from the varsity field
where I took all-city.

117
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:36,550
Oh, thank you, Blayne.

118
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:47,973
It's funny how the earth never opens up
and swallows you when you want it to.

119
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,367
What's wrong?

120
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:02,623
If Dr Gregory dropped his glasses,
why wouldn't he pick them up?

121
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,633
My name is Natalie French.
I'll be substituting for Dr Gregory.

122
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:14,638
- Do you know when he's coming back?
- No, I don't, um... Buffy.

123
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:19,184
- They just tell me where they want me.
- I'll tell you where I want you.

124
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,021
Excuse me, Blayne?

125
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:26,193
Uh, I was just wondering if you were
gonna pick up where Dr Gregory left off.

126
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:32,367
Yes. His notes tell me
you were right in the middle of insect life.

127
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:37,957
The praying mantis is a fascinating creature,
forced to live alone.

128
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,335
Who can tell me why?

129
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:41,878
Buffy?

130
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:45,868
Well, the words "bug-ugly"
kind of spring to mind.

131
00:11:45,925 --> 00:11:49,220
There is nothing ugly
about these unique creatures.

132
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:52,816
The reason they live alone is because they're cannibals.

133
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:57,355
Well, it's hardly their fault.
It's the way nature designed them.

134
00:11:57,438 --> 00:12:01,235
Noble, solitary and prolific.

135
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,821
Over 1800 species worldwide.

136
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:08,952
And in nearly all of them the female is larger
and more aggressive than the male.

137
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:11,747
Nothing wrong with an aggressive female.

138
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:20,549
"The California mantis lays her eggs
and then finds a mate to fertilise them."

139
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:25,930
Once he's played his part,
she covers the eggs in a protective sac

140
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:29,268
and attaches it to a leaf or twig out of danger.

141
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,645
Now, if she's done her job correctly,

142
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:35,233
in a few months
she'll have several hundred offspring.

143
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:40,072
You know, we should make
some model egg sacs for the science fair.

144
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:42,885
Who would like to help me
do that after school?

145
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:48,666
Good.

146
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:54,882
Hot Dog Surprise. Be still, my heart.

147
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:58,637
Call me old-fashioned.
I want no more surprises in my hot dogs.

148
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,597
I wonder what she sees in me.

149
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,144
It's probably the quiet good looks,
coupled with a certain smoky magnetism.

150
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:06,573
Miss French.

151
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,297
You two are probably
a little too young to understand

152
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:10,208
what an older woman
would see in a younger man.

153
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:13,153
- Oh, I understand.
- Good.

154
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:16,783
A younger man is too dumb to wonder why an
older woman can't find someone her own age

155
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:19,495
and too deperate to care about
the surgical improvements.

156
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:22,957
- What surgical improvements?
- Well, he is young.

157
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,168
And so terribly innocent.

158
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:27,582
Hey, those that can, do.

159
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,690
Those that can't,
laugh at those who... can do.

160
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:35,459
Gotta carb up for my one-on-one
with Miss French today. When's yours?

161
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:39,811
Oh, right. Tomorrow.
You came in second. I came in first.

162
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:43,606
Guess that's
what they call natural selection.

163
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,314
Guess it's what they call a rehearsal.
Rehearsal.

164
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,117
Excuse you!

165
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,243
Medically prescribed lunch.
My doctor ships it daily...

166
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:58,187
I'll only be here
as long as I can hold my breath.

167
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:05,758
His head! His head!
Oh, my God! Where's his head?!

168
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,898
Here.

169
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,191
Drink this.

170
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,361
No, thank you.

171
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,979
I've never seen...
I mean... I've never seen anything like...

172
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,328
That was new.

173
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:32,498
Who would want to hurt Dr Gregory?

174
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:35,717
He didn't have any enemies
on the staff that I'm aware of.

175
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:39,569
He was a... civilised man.
I liked him.

176
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,135
So did I.

177
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:46,598
We're gonna find out who did this.
We'll find them and we'll stop them.

178
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:49,477
- Count on it.
- What do we know?

179
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,982
Not a lot. He was killed on campus,
I'm guessing the last day we saw him.

180
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:57,728
- How do you work that out?
- He didn't change his clothing.

181
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,782
This is a question that
no one particularly wants to hear.

182
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,701
But... Where did they put his head?

183
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:06,080
Good point. I didn't want to hear that.

184
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:09,406
Angel. He warned me
that something was coming.

185
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,964
Yes. Yes, he did, didn't he?
I wish I knew what he meant.

186
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:16,402
I've been trying to gather
more information about the Master, our...

187
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:18,320
local vampire king.

188
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:21,487
There was one oblique reference to
a, a, a vampire who...

189
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,968
displeased the Master
and cut his hand off in penance.

190
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,367
Cut off his hand
and replaced it with a fork?

191
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:27,830
I don't know what he replaced it with.

192
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:31,443
- So why would he come after a teacher?
- I'm not certain he did.

193
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:34,990
There was an incident two nights ago

194
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:38,201
involving a homeless person
in Weatherly Park.

195
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:42,790
He was practically shredded,
but... nothing like Dr Gregory.

196
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:46,044
- Fork Guy doesn't do heads?
- Not historically.

197
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,097
And Dr Gregory's blood wasn't drained.

198
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:51,676
So there's something else out there
besides Silverware Man?

199
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,221
Oh, this is fun. We're on Monster Island.

200
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:58,434
We're on a Hellmouth.
It's a centre of mystical convergence.

201
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:00,395
Guess it's the same thing.

202
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:02,981
Unpleasant things
do gravitate here, it's true.

203
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:05,669
But we don't know there's anything
besides this chap.

204
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,723
He's still our likely suspect.

205
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,816
Where was that guy killed?
Weatherly Park?

206
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:12,117
Buffy, I know you're upset,

207
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:15,072
but this is no time to go hunting.
Not until we know more.

208
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:17,665
Please, promise me
you won't do anything rash.

209
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,722
Cross my heart.

210
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,886
Shouldn't be out here at night,
little lady.

211
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:01,175
It's dangerous.

212
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:17,600
Hold it! Police!

213
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:24,776
- I heard it. Spread out!
- Let's go over here. This way.

214
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:12,666
- You went hunting last night?
- Yes.

215
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:14,130
When you assured me you wouldn't?

216
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:17,231
Yes, I lied. I'm a bad person.
Let's move on.

217
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:22,358
- Did you see someone with a fork?
- More like a jumbo claw.

218
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:24,805
Oh.

219
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:28,033
- At least you're not hurt.
- And I saw something else.

220
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:31,773
Something much more interesting than your
average run-of-the-mill killer vampire.

221
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:32,900
Oh?

222
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:35,397
Do you know Miss French, the teacher
that's subbing for Dr Gregory?

223
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,166
Yes. Yes, she's lovely.

224
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:40,657
In a common,
extremely well-proportioned way.

225
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:44,871
Well, I'm chasing Claw Guy last night and
Miss Well-Proportioned is heading home.

226
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:48,000
The Claw Guy takes one look at her
and runs screaming for cover.

227
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,670
- He what? Ran away?
- He was petrified.

228
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:53,632
- Of Miss French?
- Uh-huh.

229
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:57,659
So, I'm an undead monster
that can shave with my hand.

230
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,430
How many things am I afraid of?

231
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,183
Not many, and not
substitute teachers, as a rule.

232
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,411
So what's her deal?

233
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:07,122
I think perhaps it would be a good idea
if we kept an eye on her.

234
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:09,108
Then I'd better get to class.

235
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:16,200
You were there.
You saw Dr Gregory, didn't you?

236
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:19,496
Um... You mean yesterday,
in the cafeteria, when we found him...

237
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:22,213
Don't say "dead" or "decapitated",
or "decomposing".

238
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:23,668
I'd stay away from D-words altogether.

239
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:25,666
But you witnessed the event,
so this way, please.

240
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,710
- No, I'm gonna be late for biology.
- Extremely late.

241
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:32,212
You have to see a counsellor. Everyone who
saw the body must see a crisis counselor.

242
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:35,026
-  I really don't need...
- We all need help with our feelings

243
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:38,809
otherwise we bottle them up and before you
know it powerful laxatives are involved.

244
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:42,940
I really believe if we all reach out
to one another, we can beat this thing.

245
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:44,256
I'm always here if you need a hug.

246
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:46,777
But not a real hug,
because there's no touching.

247
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,468
This school is sensitive to wrong touching.

248
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:50,384
-  But I really, really...
- No!

249
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:53,511
You have to talk to a counsellor
and start the healing. You have to heal.

250
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:56,769
- But, Mr Flutie, I don't...
- Heal!

251
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:02,660
I don't know what to say.
It was really... I mean...

252
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,641
One minute you're in your normal life,
and then who's in the fridge?

253
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:09,054
It really gets to you, a thing like that.

254
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:11,356
It was...

255
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:14,470
Let's just say I haven't been able
to eat a thing since yesterday.

256
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:17,252
I think I lost like
seven and a half ounces.

257
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:20,673
Way swifter than that so-called diet
that quack put me on.

258
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:23,531
Oh, I'm not saying that we should
kill a teacher every day

259
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,889
just so I can lose weight.
I'm just saying

260
00:21:25,924 --> 00:21:29,537
when tragedy strikes, we have to
look on the bright side. You know?

261
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,584
Like how even used Mercedes
still have leather seats.

262
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,214
Keep your eyes straight ahead
on your own test.

263
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:49,353
I think you meant "pollination"
for number 14.

264
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:55,693
I'll see you here after school.

265
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,015
Oh, great. A pop quiz.

266
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:18,346
No, I'm not saying she craned her neck.
We are talking full-on "Exorcist" twist.

267
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:20,904
- Ouch.
- Which reminds me...

268
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,186
How come Blayne, who worked with her
one-on-one yesterday, isn't here today?

269
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:26,146
Inquiring minds wanna know.

270
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,899
Any luck?

271
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:31,987
I've not found a creature as yet
that strikes terror in a vampire's heart.

272
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,158
Try looking under "Things That Can
Turn Their Heads All The Way Around".

273
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:39,705
- Nothing human can do that.
- No, nothing human.

274
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:42,666
But there are some insects that can.

275
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:45,712
Whatever she is,
I'm gonna be ready for her.

276
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,327
What are you going to do?

277
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:51,477
My homework.

278
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:58,101
Where are the books on bugs?

279
00:23:03,691 --> 00:23:05,694
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

280
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:08,613
I was just grabbing a snack.
Can I fix you something?

281
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:12,577
No, thanks. I never eat
when I'm making egg sacs.

282
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,581
- If this were real, the bugs would be...
- As big as you.

283
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:18,751
Yeah. So, where do we start?

284
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:23,715
Oh, Xander,
I've done something really stupid.

285
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:27,136
- I hope you can forgive me.
- Forgiveness is my middle name.

286
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:32,351
Actually, it's LaVelle, and I'd appreciate it
if you'd guard that secret with your life.

287
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:34,585
I have a teachers' conference
in half an hour

288
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:38,781
and... I left
the paint and paper-mâché at home.

289
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:43,184
I don't suppose you'd like to come
to my place tonight to work on it there?

290
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:47,327
Come to, uh... your place?

291
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,374
Seven thirty?

292
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:53,542
Here's my address.

293
00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:00,008
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

294
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:07,601
Ooh, yes!

295
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,149
Dig this. "The praying mantis can

296
00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:35,710
rotate its head 180 degrees while waiting
for its next meal to walk by." Huh!

297
00:24:37,595 --> 00:24:40,015
Well, come on, guys. Hah!

298
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:43,352
Well, Miss French is sort of big for a bug.

299
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:46,313
And she is, by and large, woman-shaped.

300
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:51,194
OK. Factoid one: only the praying mantis
can rotate its head like that.

301
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,615
Factoid two: a pretty whacked-out vampire
is scared to death of her.

302
00:24:54,699 --> 00:24:57,827
Factoid three:
her fashion sense screams predator.

303
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,080
- It's the shoulder pads!
- Exactly.

304
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:04,002
If you're right, then she'd have to be
a shape-shifter or a perception-distorter.

305
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,380
Half a mo. I had a chum at Oxford. Carlyle.

306
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,176
Advanced degrees
in entomology and mythology.

307
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,012
- Entomo... who?
- Bugs and fairy tales.

308
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,348
I knew that.

309
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,394
If I recall correctly, poor old Carlyle,
just before he went mad,

310
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:20,164
claimed there was some beast...

311
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,856
Buffy, 911.

312
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,581
Blayne's mom called the school.
He never came home last night.

313
00:25:24,616 --> 00:25:26,352
The boy who
worked with Miss French yesterday?

314
00:25:26,387 --> 00:25:28,752
Yeah. If Miss French is responsible for...

315
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:31,368
Xander's supposed
to be helping her right now!

316
00:25:31,451 --> 00:25:33,536
He's got a crush on a giant insect!

317
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,418
OK, don't panic.  I'll warn him.

318
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:37,594
But I need you to hack on
to the Coroner's Office for me.

319
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,921
- Whoa. What are we looking for?
- Autopsy on Dr Gregory.

320
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:43,336
I've been trying to figure out
these marks that I saw on his corpse.

321
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:45,839
I'm thinking they were teeth. And...

322
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:49,305
these cuddlies should
definitely be brushing after every meal.

323
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:52,680
And you were saying something about a beast?

324
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:57,691
Oh, yeah. I just need to make
one transatlantic telephone call.

325
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:00,538
Um...This computer invasion

326
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,963
Willow's performing on the Coroner's Office
One assumes is entirely legal?

327
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:05,376
- Of course.
- Entirely.

328
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:10,288
Right. Wasn't here, didn't see it,
couldn't have stopped you.

329
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:12,834
Good idea.

330
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:17,673
- Hey.
- Hey.

331
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:20,175
So how'd it go with Miss French?

332
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,735
Oh, it's a bit demanding being her
absolute favourite guy in the universe,

333
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:24,939
but I'll muddle through.

334
00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:29,020
- Xander, she's not what she seems.
- I know. She's so much more.

335
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:31,853
OK, um... I'm gonna have to
tell you something about her and

336
00:26:31,854 --> 00:26:35,082
I'm gonna need you to really listen, OK?

337
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:36,821
OK?

338
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:38,867
I don't think she's human.

339
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:41,719
I see. So if she's not human, she's...

340
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:44,574
Technically? A big bug.

341
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:46,386
This sounds really weird.
I'm aware of that.

342
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:48,639
It doesn't sound weird at all.
I completely understand.

343
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:51,254
- I've met someone and you're jealous.
- What?

344
00:26:51,337 --> 00:26:52,661
Look, there's nothing I can do about it.

345
00:26:52,662 --> 00:26:54,921
There's just this certain chemical thing
between Miss French and me.

346
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:58,145
I know. I read all about it.
It's called a... um... a pheromone.

347
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,781
It's a chemical attractant
insects give off.

348
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:03,394
She's not an insect! She's a woman, OK?

349
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:05,071
And, hard as that may be
for you to conceive,

350
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:07,842
an actual woman finds me attractive.

351
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,581
I realise, it's no mystery guy
handing out leather jackets.

352
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:14,240
And while we're on the subject,
what kind of a girly name is Angel, anyway?

353
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:17,660
- What does that have to do...
- Nothing! It just kinda bugs me.

354
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:19,830
Look, I really gotta...

355
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:43,108
Hi. Come on in.

356
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:46,362
Should I change? Is this too...

357
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:51,034
No! No. It's the most beautiful chest...
dress I've ever seen.

358
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:54,037
Thank you. That's sweet.

359
00:27:54,622 --> 00:27:56,499
Martini?

360
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:01,714
Oh, I'm sorry.
Would you like something else?

361
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:06,594
I just need to relax a little.
I'm kind of nervous around you.

362
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:09,807
You're probably cool as a cucumber.

363
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:13,936
I like cucumbers,
like in that Greek salad with yoghurt.

364
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:16,405
Do you like Greek food?
I'm exempting Schwarma, of course,

365
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:19,332
I mean, what's that all about?
It's a big meat hive.

366
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:27,953
Hello!

367
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:30,372
Cheers.

368
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,461
Can I ask you a personal question?

369
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,846
Have you ever been with a woman before?

370
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,059
You mean like in, uh... the same room?

371
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,770
You know what I mean.

372
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:52,608
Oh, that. Well, let me think.

373
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:55,569
Yeah, there was several.

374
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:59,699
I mean, and... uh, quite a few times.

375
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:05,421
And then there was...
Oh, she was incredibly...

376
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:08,543
- No. Uh-uh.
- I know.

377
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:11,338
- I can tell.
- You can?

378
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:13,299
Oh, I like it.

379
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:16,511
You might say I need it.

380
00:29:16,594 --> 00:29:20,147
<i>- Oh, well, needs should, you know,
- Somebody help me!</i>

381
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:21,471
needs should definitely
be met as long as

382
00:29:21,472 --> 00:29:22,616
<i>-  it doesn't require ointments
- I'm down here!</i>

383
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:26,648
- the next day or... Do you hear?
- No.

384
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:30,194
- It sounds like someone cry...
- I don't hear anything.

385
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:33,490
Your hands are so hot!

386
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,076
Oh, you hurt your hand.

387
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:42,959
Buffy.

388
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:45,129
I love Buffy.

389
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:49,718
- Wow. So that's a martini, huh?
- Mm-hm.

390
00:29:50,385 --> 00:29:52,470
Do you hear?

391
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:55,516
Would you like to touch me
with those hands?

392
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,355
Your hands are s...

393
00:30:01,189 --> 00:30:03,735
really serrated.

394
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,654
Oh, wow, that martini. I...

395
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,324
really think I have to...

396
00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:00,676
Miss French?

397
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:03,806
Please, call me Natalie.

398
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:08,937
Frankly, madam, I haven't the faintest idea
what time it is, nor do I care!

399
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,046
Now, unlock his cell, unstrap him
and bring him to the telephone immediately!

400
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:14,675
This is a matter of life and death!

401
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:20,367
Got it. Coroner's report
complete with - yuck - colour pictures.

402
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:22,303
They are teeth marks,

403
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:25,790
which match perfectly
the one insect that nips off its prey's head.

404
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:27,730
OK, I don't like this.

405
00:31:27,765 --> 00:31:31,004
That's the way they feed. Head first.
It's also the way they mate.

406
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:33,152
The female bites off the male's head
while they're...

407
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:37,430
No, no, no! See, Xander's...
I like his head.

408
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:41,142
It's where you find his eyes
and his hair and his adorable smile.

409
00:31:41,225 --> 00:31:45,147
Hey, hey, take it easy, Will.
Xander is not in any immediate danger.

410
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,110
I saw him leave school.
He's probably safe at home right now.

411
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:58,288
- Blayne!
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

412
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:00,206
Are you all right?

413
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,086
You gotta get me outta here. You gotta.
She... she... she gets you and...

414
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,714
- What? What does she do?
- She... she...

415
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:09,259
Oh, God. Oh, no.

416
00:32:09,342 --> 00:32:12,846
- Blayne, what does she do?
- She... she...

417
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,475
She... she takes you out of the cage,
and... she ties you up

418
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:22,566
and... and she starts movin' and throbbin'
and these eggs come shootin' out of her.

419
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,694
- And then... and then...
- What? Then what?

420
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,655
she mates with you.

421
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,626
- She...?
- That's not the worst part.

422
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:33,004
- That's not?
- You seen her teeth?

423
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,999
While she's... you know,
right in the middle of...

424
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,319
I saw her do it!

425
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:42,381
- I don't wanna die like that.
- Blayne. Blayne, chill.

426
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:45,803
That's good. It's gonna be OK.
We'll get out of this.

427
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:48,597
You got a plan? What is it?

428
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:52,560
- Just, uh, let me perfect it.
- Oh, God.

429
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:55,147
Oh, God. Oh, God.

430
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,734
I understand, Carlyle.

431
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:01,822
Yes, I'll take every precaution.

432
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:05,827
Absolutely. It sounds exactly
like the creature you described.

433
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,913
You were right all along, about everything.

434
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,461
No, you weren't right about your mother
coming back as a Pekinese, but...

435
00:33:14,545 --> 00:33:18,216
Try to rest, old man. Yes. Ta-ta.

436
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,260
Bye now.

437
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:25,141
Dr Ferris Carlyle spent years
transcribing a lost pre-Germanic language.

438
00:33:25,224 --> 00:33:29,412
What he discovered he kept to himself,
until several teenage boys were

439
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:32,476
murdered in the Cotswolds.
Then he went hunting for it.

440
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:36,363
- "It" being...?
- He calls her a She-Mantis.

441
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:41,703
This type of creature, the kleptes-virgo
or virgin-thief, appears in many cultures.

442
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,089
The Greek sirens,
the Celtic sea maidens who

443
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,874
tore the living flesh from the bones of...

444
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:48,627
Giles, while we're young.

445
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:52,883
Well, basically the She-Mantis
assumes the form of a beautiful woman...

446
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:56,038
and then lures
innocent virgins back to her nest.

447
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,703
Virgins?

448
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:01,976
Well, Xander's not a... a...

449
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:05,856
- I mean, he's probably...
- Gonna die.

450
00:34:07,901 --> 00:34:12,448
OK, OK. So this thing is breeding
and we need to find it and snuff it.

451
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:14,617
Any tips on the snuffing part?

452
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,016
Carlyle recommends cleaving
all body parts with a sharp blade.

453
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:21,116
- Slice and dice.
- Whatever you do, it'd better be

454
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:23,843
sudden and swift. This beast is
extremely dangerous.

455
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:26,523
Well, your buddy, Carlyle, faced it
and he's still around.

456
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:29,968
Yes, in a straitjacket,
howling his innards out day and night.

457
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:33,106
- OK, Admiral, way to inspire the troops.
- Sorry.

458
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,570
Xander's not home.

459
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:36,885
He told his mom he was
going to his teacher's house

460
00:34:36,886 --> 00:34:39,463
to work on a science project.
He didn't tell her where.

461
00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:42,399
See if you can get her address
off the substitute rolls.

462
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:44,986
And you need to record bat sonar, and fast.

463
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,814
Bat sonar. Right. What?

464
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:51,077
Bats eat them. A mantis hears sonar,
its entire nervous system goes kaplooie.

465
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,106
- Where am I gonna find...
- In the vid library.

466
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:58,418
There're no books, but it's dark and musty.
You'll feel right at home. Go!

467
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:02,549
I guess I'll handle the armoury.

468
00:35:03,758 --> 00:35:06,162
Don't do anything to make her mad.

469
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,756
Hey, all right! Now I can get out of my cage!

470
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:18,019
- Into yours. What'd you do that for?
- A weapon.

471
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,438
I think you're gonna need it.

472
00:35:28,697 --> 00:35:31,909
- Getting the address.
- Great. Giles?

473
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:36,339
Recording bat sonar is something soothingly
akin to having one's teeth drilled.

474
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:38,508
Let's roll.

475
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:42,088
According to Miss French's
personnel records, she was born in 1907.

476
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:46,518
- She's, like, 90 years old.
- And extremely well-preserved.

477
00:35:46,754 --> 00:35:49,021
Oh, God!

478
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,902
He did that. He broke the cage.
Take him, not me. Take him!

479
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:08,211
What now?
We can't just kick the door down.

480
00:36:08,294 --> 00:36:10,588
Yeah, that would be wrong!

481
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,717
Hello, dear. I thought I heard...

482
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:19,265
Are you selling something?
Because I'd like to help you out,

483
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:22,436
but, you see, I'm on a fixed income.

484
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,731
- I'm looking for Miss French.
- I'm Miss French.

485
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:28,902
Natalie French,
the substitute biology teacher?

486
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:31,613
Goodness, that's me!

487
00:36:31,696 --> 00:36:34,617
I taught for over 30 years.

488
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,711
I retired in 1972.

489
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:40,013
I can't believe this!
She used Miss French's records

490
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:42,149
to get into the school.
She could be anywhere.

491
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:46,005
No, dear. I'm right here.

492
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:48,175
What's she doing?

493
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:50,344
I think it's

494
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,559
eeny, meany, miney

495
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:00,314
Mo?

496
00:37:17,426 --> 00:37:19,713
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

497
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:41,493
What do we do now?

498
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:43,983
Abject prayer and supplication
would spring to mind.

499
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:46,090
I saw her walking past this park
with her grocery bags.

500
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:47,671
She lives in this neighborhood.

501
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:50,958
- I'm gonna bang on doors.
- Wait! No. We do not have time for that.

502
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:53,961
- We have to do something!
- We will.

503
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:03,890
I won't be long.

504
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,436
Buffy?

505
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:16,305
- Oh, yeah, here it comes.
- What's happening?

506
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,783
How do you like your eggs, bro,
over easy or sunny-side up?

507
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:21,578
Eggs? She's gonna lay some...

508
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:26,043
"The Californian mantis lays her eggs

509
00:38:26,044 --> 00:38:30,482
and then finds a mate to fertilise them."

510
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:33,467
Come on, Buffy!

511
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:42,603
- You!
- Me.

512
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,423
Come on! Come on! Where is she?

513
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:49,486
Which house is it?
I know you're afraid of her. I saw you!

514
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,655
Come on, come on.

515
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:56,044
What? What is it?
This is her, isn't it? This is her house.

516
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,165
This is it! Better than radar!

517
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,293
Buffy!

518
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:19,439
Kiss me.

519
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:22,534
- Kiss me.
- Can I say one thing?

520
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,395
Help!

521
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,363
Help!

522
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,662
Uh, hey! O-over here!
Hello! In the cage!

523
00:39:33,113 --> 00:39:35,124
Let him go!

524
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,603
- Help me!
- Get them out of here.

525
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:56,858
Help me! Help me!

526
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:01,124
Remember Dr Gregory?
You scarfed his head.

527
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:04,468
Yeah, well, he taught me:
you do your homework, you learn stuff.

528
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,579
Like what happens to your nervous system
when you hear this.

529
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,175
"Extremely important to file
not simply alphabetically..."

530
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,978
- Giles!
- It's the wrong side!

531
00:40:41,537 --> 00:40:45,457
Bat sonar. Makes your
whole nervous system go to hell.

532
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,419
You can go there with it.

533
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:14,847
Well, I'd say it's deceased.

534
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:16,399
And dissected.

535
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:19,290
- You OK?
- Yeah.

536
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:21,648
Just for the record, you were right.

537
00:41:21,649 --> 00:41:25,286
I'm an idiot, and God bless you.

538
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:29,127
- And thank you guys, too.
- Yeah, really.

539
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:31,922
- Pleasure.
- I'm really glad you're OK.

540
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:35,764
It's so unfair
how she only went after virgins.

541
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:38,719
What?

542
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:40,958
I mean, here you guys are,
doing the right thing,

543
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:43,770
the smart thing,
when a lot of other boys your age...

544
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:46,005
Flag down on that play, babe.
I am not...

545
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,691
Well, you see,
that's the She-Mantis' modus operandi.

546
00:41:48,692 --> 00:41:50,628
Uh, she only preys on the pure.

547
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:53,715
Well, isn't this a perfect ending
to a wonderful day!

548
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,915
My dad's a lawyer.

549
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:56,489
If anybody repeats this to anybody,

550
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,737
they're gonna find themselves
facing a lawsuit.

551
00:41:58,772 --> 00:42:01,207
Blayne, shut up!

552
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:05,471
I don't think it's bad.
I think it's really... sweet.

553
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:09,141
But it's certainly nothing
I'll ever bring up again.

554
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:18,868
<i>(# Stoner Love by Superfine)</i>

555
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:27,168
<i># It's ladies choice snowball,
the guys are in line</i>

556
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,835
<i># he knows who he's waiting for</i>

557
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:34,709
<i># and she goes and picks somebody else</i>

558
00:42:34,744 --> 00:42:38,092
<i># then a stranger finds him, he says,</i>

559
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:39,693
I heard a rumour there was

560
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:44,274
one less vampire walking round,
making a nuisance of himself.

561
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:48,046
There is. I guess
I should thank you for the tip.

562
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:49,706
The pleasure's mine.

563
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:53,886
Of course, it would be easier
if I knew how to get in touch with you.

564
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:55,864
I'll be around.

565
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:58,046
Or who you were.

566
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:06,227
Well, anyway, you can
have your jacket back.

567
00:43:06,262 --> 00:43:09,524
It looks better on you.

568
00:43:15,955 --> 00:43:18,138
Oh, boy.

569
00:43:18,324 --> 00:43:22,176
All midterm papers
will be exactly six pages long.

570
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:24,557
No more, no less.

571
00:43:24,592 --> 00:43:29,200
One third of your grade
will be dependent on those papers.

572
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:33,277
No more, no less.
