1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,586
In every generation, there is a Chosen One.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,050
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness.

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,967
She is the Slayer.

4
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:24,106
Zachary didn't return
from the hunt last night.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,691
The Slayer.

6
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,694
Zachary was strong and he was careful.

7
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,404
But still the Slayer takes him,

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,616
as she has taken so many of my family.

9
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:38,328
It wears thin.

10
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:44,376
- Collin, what would you do about it?
- I'd annihilate her.

11
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:49,713
- Out of the mouths of babes...
- Let me do it, Master.

12
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:54,009
- Let me kill her for you.
- You have a personal interest in this.

13
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:57,596
- I don't get to have any fun.
- I will send the Three.

14
00:00:58,305 --> 00:00:59,848
The Three?

15
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:09,691
Let's go.

16
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:16,364
Get it. Come on, get it right there.

17
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,741
I got it.

18
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:20,702
Free drink, please.

19
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:24,706
The Fumigation Party.
It's an annual tradition.

20
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:28,417
The closing of the Bronze for a few days
to nuke the cockroaches.

21
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:34,256
It's a lot of fun.
What's it like where you are?

22
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:39,428
I'm sorry. I was just...
thinking about things.

23
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:43,373
- So, we're talking about a guy?
- Not exactly a guy.

24
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:45,273
For us to have a conversation about a guy,

25
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:48,328
there'd have to be a guy for us
to have a conversation about.

26
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:51,606
- Is that a sentence?
- You lack a guy.

27
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,651
I do. Which is fine with me
most of the time, but...

28
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:57,862
What about Angel?

29
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:00,907
Angel? I can just
see him in a relationship.

30
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,493
"Hi, honey, you're in grave danger.
I'll see ya next month."

31
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:07,545
He's not around much, it's true.

32
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:13,209
When he is around,
it's like the lights dim everywhere else.

33
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:14,868
You know how it's like that
with some guys?

34
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:17,118
- Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:21,090
Hey, Annie!

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,637
Dino! Just leaving.

37
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:35,147
Please get your extreme oafishness
off my $200 shoes.

38
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:37,131
- Sorry, I was just...
- Getting off the dance floor,

39
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,326
before Annie Vega's boyfriend
squashes you like a bug?

40
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,133
Oh, so you noticed.
Yeah, thanks for being so understanding.

41
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:44,478
- Sure.
- You know, hey, I don't know what

42
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:48,493
everyone's talking about. That outfit
doesn't make you look like a hooker.

43
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:53,242
Boy, that Cordelia's
a regular breath of vile air.

44
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,518
What are you vixens up to?

45
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:58,169
Just sitting here
watching our barren lives pass us by.

46
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:01,026
Oh, look. A cockroach.

47
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:06,326
Whoa! Let's stop this
crazy whirligig of fun. I'm dizzy.

48
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:10,664
All right. Now I'm infecting those nearest
and dear to me. I'm gonna call it a night.

49
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:14,309
- Oh, don't go.
- Yeah, it's early. We could, um... dance.

50
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:17,958
Rain check? Good night.

51
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,650
Want a free drink?

52
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:03,163
It's late, I'm tired
and I don't wanna play games.

53
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:05,238
Show yourself.

54
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:13,574
OK. OK. Nice.

55
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:18,245
OK. OK. Look, I really don't wanna
fight all three of you unless I have to.

56
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:26,384
<b>"Angel"</b>

57
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:34,693
Good dogs don't... bite.

58
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,377
Look out!

59
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,447
Run!

60
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:15,064
Get in! Come on! No!

61
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:28,471
It's all right. A vampire
can't come in unless it's invited.

62
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:31,755
I've heard that before,
but I've never put it to the test.

63
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:38,044
I'll go get some bandages. Just...

64
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:41,120
take your jacket and your shirt off.

65
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,024
Nice tattoo.

66
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:06,385
I was lucky you came along.

67
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:08,850
How did you happen to come along?

68
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,843
I live nearby. I was just out walking.

69
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:16,248
So, you weren't following me?

70
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:21,154
- I just had this feeling you were.
- Why would I do that?

71
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:24,582
You tell me.

72
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:27,258
You're the mystery guy
that appears out of nowhere.

73
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:30,669
I'm not saying
I'm not happy about it tonight, but...

74
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:33,748
if you are hanging around,
I'd like to know why.

75
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:36,683
- Maybe I like you.
- Maybe?

76
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,671
Honey, what are you doing?

77
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,272
There's a lot of weird people
outside at night. I just...

78
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:50,536
feel better with you safe and sound inside.

79
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,686
You must be beat.

80
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:55,107
I am. We're a little gallery.
You have no idea how much...

81
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,141
Then why don't you go upstairs and get
into bed and I can bring you some hot tea.

82
00:07:58,142 --> 00:08:00,814
That's sweet. What'd you do?

83
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:04,751
Can't a daughter just be concerned
about her mother?

84
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:06,882
- Hi.
- Hi.

85
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:09,214
Oh. OK.

86
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:12,885
Angel, this is my mom.

87
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,969
Mom, this is Angel.

88
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:17,787
We ran into each other on the way home.

89
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,868
Nice to meet you.

90
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:23,728
- What do you do, Angel?
- He's a student.

91
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:27,857
Uh, first year... community college.
Angel's been helping me with my history.

92
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,278
- You know I've been toiling there.
- It's a little late for tutoring.

93
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,697
I'm gonna go to bed. And Buffy?

94
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,116
I'll say good night and do the same.

95
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:41,953
It was nice to meet you.

96
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:46,171
Good night.

97
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:50,134
We'll hook up soon
and do that study thing!

98
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,958
Look, I don't wanna
get you in any more trouble.

99
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,001
And I don't wanna get you dead.

100
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:08,979
They could still be out there.

101
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:11,148
So...

102
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:15,485
Two of us. One bed.
That doesn't work.

103
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:18,863
Um... Why don't you take the bed?
You know, you're wounded.

104
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:20,698
- I'll take the floor.
- No, that's not...

105
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:23,322
Believe me, I've had worse.

106
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:25,061
OK.

107
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:28,790
Um, then... Why don't you check and see
if the Fang Gang is still loitering

108
00:09:28,873 --> 00:09:33,201
and, um... keep your back turned
while I change?

109
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:39,883
I don't see them.

110
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:44,513
You know, I'm the Chosen One.
It's my job to fight guys like that.

111
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:48,348
- What's your excuse?
- Uh, somebody has to.

112
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:51,919
Well, what does your family
think of your career choice?

113
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:54,105
They're dead.

114
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,945
Was it vampires?

115
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:04,973
It-it was.

116
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,548
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:10,565
It was a long while ago.

118
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,951
So, this is a vengeance gig for you?

119
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,430
You even look pretty when you go to sleep.

120
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:22,883
Well, when I wake up,
it's an entirely different story.

121
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:29,514
Here.

122
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,852
Sleep tight.

123
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,434
Angel?

124
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,247
Hmm?

125
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:56,789
Do you snore?

126
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,292
I don't know.

127
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:04,464
It's been a long time since anybody's
been in a position to let me know.

128
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,514
He spent the night?
In your room? In your bed?

129
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:17,643
- Not in my bed. By my bed.
- That is so romantic.

130
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:20,354
Did you, uh...?
I mean, did he, uh...?

131
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:22,076
Perfect gentleman.

132
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,663
Buffy! Come on.
Wake up and smell the seduction.

133
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:26,699
- It's the oldest trick in the book.
- What?

134
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:29,345
Saving my life?
Getting slashed in the ribs?

135
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,073
Duh! I mean, guys'll do anything
to impress a girl.

136
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:35,629
I-I once drank an entire gallon of Gatorade
without taking a breath.

137
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:39,614
It was pretty impressive.
Although later there was an ick factor.

138
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,753
Can we steer this riveting conversation

139
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:44,710
back to the events that
happened earlier in the evening?

140
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:49,923
You left the Bronze and were set upon
by three unusually virile vampires.

141
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:53,712
- Did they look like this?
- Yeah. What's with the uniforms?

142
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,929
It seems you encountered the Three.

143
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:58,611
Warrior vampires.
Very proud and very strong.

144
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,892
How is it you always know this stuff?

145
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:04,020
You always know what's going on.
I never know what's going on.

146
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:07,135
You weren't here from midnight
until six researching it.

147
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:08,899
No. I was sleeping.

148
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:11,610
Obviously you're hurting
the Master very much.

149
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:14,764
He wouldn't send the Three
for just anyone.

150
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,812
We must step up
our training with weapons.

151
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,618
Buffy, you should stay at my house
until these Samurai guys are history.

152
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:21,641
- What?
- Ah-ah-ah, don't worry about Angel.

153
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:24,498
Willow can run to your house
and tell him to get out of town fast.

154
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:27,313
Angel and Buffy are,
are not in any immediate jeopardy.

155
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:29,694
Eventually the Master will send
someone else, but, in the meantime,

156
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:33,973
the Three having failed
will offer their own lives in penance.

157
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:39,652
We failed in our duty,
and now our lives belong to you.

158
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,583
Pay attention, child.
You are the Anointed

159
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:47,086
and there is much you must learn.

160
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:50,230
With power comes responsibility.

161
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:53,984
True, they did fail.
But also true,

162
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:57,971
we who walk at night share a common bond.

163
00:12:58,006 --> 00:13:02,736
The taking of a life -
I'm not talking about humans, of course -

164
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:05,686
is a serious matter.

165
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,289
So, you would spare them?

166
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,125
I am weary,

167
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,712
and their deaths will bring me little joy.

168
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,897
Of course sometimes a little is enough.

169
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,978
Cool. Crossbow.

170
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,440
Check out these babies.

171
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:40,153
Goodbye, stakes. Hello, flying fatality.

172
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,909
- What can I shoot?
- Nothing.

173
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,949
The crossbow comes later.

174
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:48,911
You must first become proficient
with the basic tools of combat.

175
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,415
Now, let's begin...
with the quarterstaff,

176
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,795
which incidentally will require
countless hours of vigorous training.

177
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,965
- I speak from experience.
- Giles, 20th century?

178
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,309
I'm not gonna be fighting Friar Tuck.

179
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,918
You never know with whom or what
you'll be fighting.

180
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:08,913
These traditions have been handed down
through the ages.

181
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,308
Now, you show me good, steady
progress with the quarterstaff

182
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:16,437
and in due course we'll discuss
the crossbow. Put on your pads.

183
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:19,649
I'm... not gonna need pads to fight you.

184
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:21,901
We'll see about that. En garde!

185
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:43,254
Good. Let's move on to the crossbow.

186
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:53,814
- Angel?
- Hey.

187
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:02,939
I brought you some dinner.
It's a little plateless. Sorry.

188
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,446
So. What did you do all day?

189
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:14,951
I read a little. And just thought about
a lot of things. Buffy, I...

190
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:18,246
My diary? You read my diary?

191
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,874
That is not OK. A diary is like
a person's most private place.

192
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:23,941
You don't even know
what I was writing about!

193
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:26,253
Hunk can mean a lot of things. Bad things.

194
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:29,049
And, and when it says that your eyes
are 'penetrating', I meant to write...

195
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,391
- 'bulgy'.
- Buffy...

196
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:33,252
And 'A' doesn't even stand for
'Angel' for that matter, it stands for...

197
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:34,920
'Ahmed', a charming
foreign exchange student

198
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:37,258
so that whole fantasy part has nothing
to even do with you at all...

199
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:39,650
Your mother moved your diary
when she came in to straighten up.

200
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,756
I watched her from the closet.

201
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:45,239
I didn't read it. I swear.

202
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,351
Oh.

203
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,449
Oh.

204
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:53,238
I did a lot of thinking today.
I really can't be around you.

205
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:58,368
- Because when I am...
- Hey, no big. Water... over the bridge.

206
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:01,078
all I can think about
is how badly I wanna kiss you.

207
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,330
Kiss me?

208
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:06,458
I'm older than you, and this can't ever...

209
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,587
I better go.

210
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:13,172
How much older?

211
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:17,094
- I should...
- Go.

212
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,263
You said...

213
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,494
What? What's wrong?

214
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:00,176
Buffy, what happened?

215
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,890
Nothing. I saw a shadow.

216
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:14,231
- Angel's a vampire?
- I can't believe this is happening.

217
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:18,067
One minute we were kissing
and the next minute...

218
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:20,464
Can a vampire ever be a good person?
Couldn't it happen?

219
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:24,260
A vampire isn't a person at all.
It may have the movements, memories,

220
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:26,768
even the personality of the person
that it took over, but it-

221
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:29,621
it's still a demon at the core.
There is no halfway.

222
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:32,040
So that'd be a no, huh?

223
00:17:32,123 --> 00:17:35,293
Well, then what was he doing?
Why was he good to me?

224
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:39,671
Was it all some part of the Master's plan?
It doesn't make sense!

225
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:43,300
All right, uh, you have a problem
and it's not a small one.

226
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:47,763
Let's take a breath
and look at this calmly and objectively.

227
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:51,767
Angel's a vampire. You're a slayer.

228
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,728
I think it's obvious what you have to do.

229
00:17:56,813 --> 00:18:00,191
- It is a slayer's duty.
- I know you have feelings for this guy.

230
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:02,819
But you're not in love with him, right?

231
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:06,364
In love with a vampire?
Are you out of your mind?

232
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:08,282
What?

233
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:10,201
Not vampire.

234
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:13,538
How could you love an umpire?
Everyone hates 'em.

235
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:17,415
Where did you get that dress?
This is a one-of-a-kind Todd Oldham.

236
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:20,703
Do you know how much this dress cost?
Is this a knockoff?

237
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:23,030
This is a knockoff, isn't it?!
Some cheesy knockoff!

238
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:26,391
This is exactly what happens
when you sign these free trade agreements.

239
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:28,677
You think we have problems.

240
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:55,379
Who's here?

241
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,908
A friend.

242
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,820
Hi. It's been a while.

243
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:06,588
- A lifetime.
- Or two, but who's counting?

244
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:11,176
What's with the Catholic schoolgirl look?
Last time I saw you, it was kimonos.

245
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:15,429
And last time I saw you,
it wasn't high-school girls.

246
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:18,098
Don't you like?

247
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,728
Remember Budapest?
Turn of the century?

248
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:25,377
You were a bad boy during that earthquake.

249
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:26,909
You did some damage yourself.

250
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:30,986
Is there anything better
than a natural disaster?

251
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:35,448
The panic. The people lost in the streets.

252
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:38,367
It's like picking fruit off the vine.

253
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:45,625
Nice. You're living above ground.
Like one of them.

254
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,961
You and your new friend are attacking us.

255
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:51,130
Like one of them.

256
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:55,801
But guess what, precious?
You're not one of them.

257
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:02,140
- Are you?
- No.

258
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:04,601
But I'm not exactly one of you, either.

259
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:13,451
Is that what you tell yourself these days?

260
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:16,153
You're not exactly living off quiche.

261
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:21,667
You and I both know what you hunger for,
what you need.

262
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:24,954
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's who we are.

263
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:28,040
It's what makes eternal life worth living.

264
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,544
You can only suppress your real nature
for so long.

265
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:35,880
I can feel it brewing inside of you.

266
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:38,174
I hope I'm around when it explodes.

267
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:42,929
- Maybe you don't wanna be.
- I'm not afraid of you.

268
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:46,182
I bet she is, though.

269
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:49,978
Or... maybe I'm underestimating her.

270
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:54,731
Talk to her. Tell her about the curse.
Maybe she'll come around.

271
00:20:55,524 --> 00:21:00,154
And if she still doesn't trust you,
you know where I'll be.

272
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:14,542
Here's something at last.

273
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,690
Can you, please,
warn us before you do that?

274
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:19,832
There's nothing about Angel in the text,
but it suddenly occurred to me that

275
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:23,626
it's been ages since I've read the diaries
of any of the watchers before me.

276
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,866
That must've been so embarrassing
when you thought

277
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,247
he had read your diary,
but then it turned out he hadn't

278
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:30,921
but then he felt the same way...

279
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:35,061
- I'm listening.
- There's mention some 200 years ago

280
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:38,398
in Ireland of-of Angelus,
the one with the angelic face.

281
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:41,026
They got that right.

282
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:44,738
I'm not saying anything.
I have nothing to say.

283
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:49,201
Does this, uh, Angel have, um,
a tattoo behind his right shoulder?

284
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:51,552
Yeah. It's a bird or something.

285
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:54,180
Now I'm saying something.
You saw him naked?

286
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:58,876
- So Angel's been around for a while.
- Not long for a vampire. 240 years or so.

287
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:02,713
240. Well, he said he was older.

288
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:05,466
Angelus leaves Ireland,

289
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:08,968
wreaks havoc in Europe for several decades

290
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:13,348
and then about 80 years ago
the most curious thing happens.

291
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:19,562
He comes to America,
shuns other vampires and lives alone.

292
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:22,774
There's-there's no...
no record of him hunting here.

293
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:27,320
So he is a good vampire.
I mean, on a scale of one to ten.

294
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:30,656
Ten being someone
who's killing and maiming every night

295
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:33,367
and one being someone who's... not.

296
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,799
I say that there's no record. But...

297
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,605
Vampires hunt and kill.
It's what they do.

298
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,295
- Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly.
- He could've fed on me. He didn't.

299
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:45,967
Question: a hundred years or so
before he came to our shores,

300
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:48,065
what was he like then?

301
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:53,137
Like all of them.
A vicious, violent animal.

302
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:57,223
Don't think I'm not grateful,
you letting me kill the Three.

303
00:22:57,306 --> 00:23:00,935
How can my children learn
if I do everything for them?

304
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:03,481
But you've gotta let me
take care of the Slayer.

305
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,523
You're giving me orders now.

306
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,161
OK. We'll just do nothing
while she takes us out one by one.

307
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:13,438
Do I sense a plan, Darla?

308
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:16,215
Share.

309
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:19,005
Angel kills her
and comes back to the fold.

310
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,458
Angel. He was
the most vicious creature I ever met.

311
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:28,522
- I miss him.
- So do I.

312
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:32,612
Why would he kill her
if he feels for her?

313
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:35,758
To keep her from killing him.

314
00:23:36,886 --> 00:23:40,973
You see? How we all work together
for the common good?

315
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,435
That's how a family is
supposed to function.

316
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:48,021
OK, so let's review.
Reconstruction began when?

317
00:23:49,481 --> 00:23:51,107
Buffy?

318
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:54,944
Reconstruction.

319
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:58,406
Reconstruction began
after the... construction,

320
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,743
which was shoddy,
so they had to reconstruct.

321
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:04,579
After the destruction of the Civil War.

322
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:11,335
Right. Civil War. During which Angel
was already 100 and change.

323
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:16,048
Are we gonna talk about boys
or are we gonna help you pass history?

324
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:20,922
Sometimes I have this fantasy

325
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:24,455
that Xander's just gonna grab me
and kiss me right on the lips.

326
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,163
If you want Xander,
you've gotta speak up, girl.

327
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:29,852
No, no, no, no. No speaking up.

328
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:32,980
That way leads
to madness and sweaty palms.

329
00:24:33,064 --> 00:24:36,234
OK, so here's something I gotta know.

330
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:40,278
When Angel kissed you...
I mean, before he turned into...

331
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:42,733
How was it?

332
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:45,370
Unbelievable.

333
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:50,539
Wow. And it is kinda novel how
he'll stay young and handsome forever.

334
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,708
Although you'll still get wrinkly
and die and...

335
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:57,379
Oh, what about the children?

336
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,757
- I'll be quiet now.
- No, it's OK.

337
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:04,844
I need to hear this.
I need to get over him, so I can...

338
00:25:04,927 --> 00:25:07,012
So that you can...

339
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:14,687
Like Xander said, I'm the Slayer
and he's a... vampire. God, I can't.

340
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:19,316
He's never done anything to hurt me.
OK, I need to stop thinking about this.

341
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,111
OK, let's give it another half an hour
and maybe something will sink in.

342
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:25,530
Then I'm going home
for some major moping.

343
00:25:25,613 --> 00:25:30,827
OK. The era of the Congressional
Reconstruction, usually called Radical...

344
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:38,183
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm Darla.

345
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:42,436
- A friend of Buffy's.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

346
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:48,400
She didn't mention anything about me
coming over for a study date, did she?

347
00:26:48,484 --> 00:26:51,153
No, I thought she was studying
with Willow at the library.

348
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:53,748
She is. Willow's the Civil War expert.

349
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:57,172
But then I was supposed to help her
with the War of Independence.

350
00:26:57,207 --> 00:27:00,203
My family kinda goes back to those days.

351
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:05,450
Well, I, I know she's supposed to be home
soon. Would you like to come in and wait?

352
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:09,254
It's very nice of you
to invite me into your home.

353
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:13,591
You're welcome.
I've been wrestling with the IRS all night.

354
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:17,887
- Would you like something to eat?
- Yes. I would.

355
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,305
Let's see what we have.

356
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,851
Do you feel like something little
or something big?

357
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,437
Something big.

358
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,603
Let her go.

359
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:55,173
I just had a little. There's plenty more.

360
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:59,509
Aren't you hungry for something warm
after all this time?

361
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:02,929
Come on, Angel. Just say yes.

362
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:14,107
Welcome home.

363
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:25,701
Hey. I'm home.

364
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:41,549
You're not welcome here.

365
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:44,969
You come near us and I'll kill you.

366
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:56,355
Mom? Mom, can you hear me?

367
00:28:56,438 --> 00:29:00,526
Yes. I need an ambulance.
1630 Revello Drive.

368
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,815
My mother cut herself.
She lost a lot of blood.

369
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:05,114
Please, please hurry.

370
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:07,199
- Mom?
- Hey, Buffy.

371
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:10,202
- Oh, my God!.
- What happened?

372
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:11,328
Angel.

373
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,294
- Do you remember anything, Mom?
- Just... Your friend came over.

374
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:23,823
- I was gonna make a snack.
- My friend?

375
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:27,218
I guess I slipped and cut my neck on...

376
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:31,180
The doctor said
it looked like a barbecue fork.

377
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,724
We don't have a barbecue fork.

378
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,894
Are you another doctor?

379
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:41,815
No. Mom, this is Mr. Giles.

380
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:45,694
The librarian from your school.
What's he doing here?

381
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:50,198
I just came to pay my respects.
Wish you a speedy recovery.

382
00:29:50,282 --> 00:29:53,910
Boy, the teachers
really do care in this town.

383
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:56,078
Get some rest now.

384
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:10,509
She's gonna be OK.
They gave her some iron.

385
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:13,887
Her blood count was a little...

386
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,640
A little low.
It presents itself like mild anemia.

387
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:20,602
You were lucky you got to her
as soon as you did.

388
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,729
Lucky? Stupid.

389
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:27,400
- Buff, it's not your fault.
- No? I invited him into my home.

390
00:30:27,484 --> 00:30:30,535
Even after I knew who he was,
what he was.

391
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:32,336
And I didn't do anything about it.

392
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,925
Because I had feelings for him.
Because I cared about him.

393
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,255
If you care about somebody,
you care about them.

394
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,915
- You can't change that by...
- Killing them?

395
00:30:42,998 --> 00:30:45,959
Maybe not. But I think it's a start.

396
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:48,921
- We'll keep an eye on your mom.
- Buffy!

397
00:30:49,004 --> 00:30:51,879
You can't stop me.
The Three found me near the Bronze.

398
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,955
- And so did he. He lives nearby.
- This is no ordinary vampire.

399
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,195
If there is such a thing.

400
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,627
Now, he knows you.
He's faced the Three.

401
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:02,225
I think this is gonna
take more than a simple stake.

402
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,617
So do I.

403
00:31:09,674 --> 00:31:12,984
She's out hunting you right now.
She wants to kill you.

404
00:31:13,068 --> 00:31:16,655
- Leave me alone.
- What did you think?

405
00:31:16,738 --> 00:31:19,241
Did you think she would understand?

406
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:23,870
That she would look at your face,
your true face,

407
00:31:23,954 --> 00:31:25,831
and give you a kiss?

408
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,793
For 100 years you've not had
a moment's peace because

409
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:35,381
you will not accept who you are.
That's all you have to do. Accept it.

410
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,491
Don't let her hunt you down.

411
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:41,720
Don't whimper
and mewl like a mangy human.

412
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:43,389
Kill.

413
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:46,142
Feed. Live.

414
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,687
All right.

415
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,230
- What do you want?
- I want it finished.

416
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:54,315
That's good.

417
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,693
You're hurting me.

418
00:31:56,776 --> 00:31:59,112
That's good, too.

419
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:38,183
She talks about you all the time.

420
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:40,401
It's important to have teachers
who make an impression.

421
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:42,820
She makes quite an impression herself.

422
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:45,656
I know she's having trouble with history.

423
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,418
Is it too difficult for her,
or is she not applying herself?

424
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:51,703
She lives very much in the now. And-and...

425
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:56,147
history, of course, is very much
about the... the then.

426
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:57,542
B-but there's-there's no reason...

427
00:32:57,577 --> 00:32:59,968
She's studying with Willow.
She's studying with Darla.

428
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:02,339
I-I mean, she's trying.

429
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:04,883
Darla? I don't believe I know...

430
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:07,010
Her friend who came over tonight.

431
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:10,215
Darla came to your house tonight. She's
the friend that you mentioned earlier?

432
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,891
Poor thing. I must've frightened
her half to death when I fainted.

433
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:16,349
Someone should really check
and make sure she's all right.

434
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:20,439
Yes, someone should.
Right away. I'll do it.

435
00:33:20,474 --> 00:33:22,608
That school is amazing.

436
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:24,652
We have a problem.

437
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,132
I know you're there.
And I know what you are.

438
00:33:48,215 --> 00:33:51,381
Do you? I'm just an animal, right?

439
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:53,747
You're not an animal.

440
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,248
Animals I like.

441
00:33:59,852 --> 00:34:01,979
Let's get it done.

442
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,348
Come on. Don't go soft on me now.

443
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:46,562
- A little wide.
- Why?

444
00:34:47,772 --> 00:34:51,144
Why didn't you just attack me
when you had the chance?

445
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,921
Was it a joke?

446
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:56,781
To make me feel for you and then...

447
00:34:56,816 --> 00:35:00,626
I've killed a lot of vampires.
I've never hated one before.

448
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:03,370
Feels good, doesn't it?
It feels simple.

449
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:06,331
I invited you into my home
and then you attacked my family.

450
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:09,209
Why not? I killed mine.

451
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,754
I killed their friends.

452
00:35:12,837 --> 00:35:14,923
And their friends' children.

453
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:18,927
For 100 years, I offered an ugly death
to everyone I met.

454
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,888
And I did it with a song in my heart.

455
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:26,141
- What changed?
- I fed on a girl about your age.

456
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:31,563
Beautiful. Dumb as a post,
but a favorite among her clan.

457
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:34,525
- Her clan?
- The Romany.

458
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:39,992
Gypsies. The elders conjured
the perfect punishment for me.

459
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:41,824
They restored my soul.

460
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:43,883
What, they were all out of
boils and blinding torment?

461
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,069
When you become a vampire,

462
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,038
the demon takes your body
but it doesn't get your soul.

463
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:54,544
That's gone. No conscience, no remorse.
It's an easy way to live.

464
00:35:55,336 --> 00:36:00,341
You have no idea what it's like
to have done the things I've done,

465
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,635
and to care.

466
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:06,721
I haven't fed on a living human being
since that day.

467
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:08,765
So, you started with my mom?

468
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:11,118
- I didn't bite her.
- Then why didn't you say something?

469
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:13,895
But I wanted to.

470
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:18,114
I can walk like a man,
but I'm not one.

471
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:21,688
I wanted to kill you tonight.

472
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:41,255
Go ahead.

473
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:51,556
Not as easy as it looks.

474
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:54,392
Sure it is.

475
00:36:56,352 --> 00:36:59,314
- We're near the Bronze. What now?
- Keep looking for her.

476
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:00,717
I have a question.

477
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,267
what if we find her and she's fighting
Angel and some of his friends?

478
00:37:03,302 --> 00:37:05,444
What the heck
are we gonna do about it?

479
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:08,197
Do you know
what the saddest thing in the world is?

480
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,868
- Bad hair on top of that outfit?
- To love someone who used to love you.

481
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:16,180
You guys... were involved?

482
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:18,693
For several generations.

483
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:23,219
Well, you've been around since Columbus.
You are bound to pile up a few ex's.

484
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:24,709
You're older than him, right?

485
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,717
Just between us girls, you are
looking a little worn around the eyes.

486
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:31,569
I made him.

487
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,681
There was a time when we shared
everything. Wasn't there, Angelus?

488
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:37,623
You had a chance to come home,

489
00:37:37,624 --> 00:37:40,460
to rule with me in the Master's court
for a thousand years.

490
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:45,941
But you threw that away because of her.
You love someone who hates us.

491
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:50,237
You're sick. And you'll always be sick.

492
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,907
And you'll always remember
what it was like to watch her die.

493
00:37:56,576 --> 00:38:00,204
- You don't think I came alone, do you?
- I know I didn't.

494
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:04,959
Scary.

495
00:38:05,793 --> 00:38:06,961
Scarier.

496
00:38:09,922 --> 00:38:14,927
Don't worry. Bullets can't kill vampires.
It can hurt them like hell, but...

497
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,642
Did you just hear...?

498
00:38:22,726 --> 00:38:25,770
So many body parts. So few bullets.

499
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:30,734
Let's begin with the kneecaps.
No fun dancing without them.

500
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,828
Close, but no heart.

501
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:49,626
We need to distract her. Fast.

502
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,421
Buffy, it wasn't Angel who
attacked your mom. It was Darla!

503
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:33,043
Come on, Buffy.

504
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:35,504
Take it like a man.

505
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,676
Angel?

506
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,467
Forget her.

507
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:29,680
How dare you. She was my favorite.

508
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,808
For 400 years.

509
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:36,602
She was weak. You don't need her.

510
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:39,397
I'll bring you the Slayer.

511
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,150
But to lose her to Angel.

512
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:45,862
He was to have sat at my right hand,
come the day.

513
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:48,990
- And now...
- They're all against you.

514
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:53,035
But soon you shall rise,
and when you do,

515
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,290
we'll kill them all.

516
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,886
Ah, the post-fumigation party.

517
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,221
Okay, so what's the difference between
this and the pre-fumigation party?

518
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,515
Much hardier cockroaches.

519
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,759
So, no word from Angel?

520
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,106
Nah.

521
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:28,194
It's weird, though. In his way
I feel like he's still watching me.

522
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:31,262
Well, in a way he sort of is.

523
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:34,033
In the way of that he's right over there.

524
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:35,551

00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:38,796

Is it yours or is it mine?</i>

526
00:41:40,472 --> 00:41:42,707
<i># I look at your lips
I know how soft they can be </i>

527
00:41:42,742 --> 00:41:46,411
And I don't need to watch
because I'm not threatened.

528
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:48,556
I'm just gonna look this way.

529
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:52,885
<i># Did they know what they wanted</i>

530
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:57,597

<i># And your hands
I held in mine</i>

532
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:08,315
I just wanted to see if you were OK
and your mother.

533
00:42:09,983 --> 00:42:12,568
We're both good. You?

534
00:42:13,528 --> 00:42:17,989
If I can go a little while without
getting shot or stabbed I'll be alright.

535
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:20,494
<i># I'll remember you</i>

536
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:26,016
- Look, this can't...
- Ever be anything. I know.

537
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:31,601
For one thing, you're like
224 years older than I am.

<i># But that is all that I can do</i>

539
00:42:33,915 --> 00:42:35,966
I just gotta...

540
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:38,719
I gotta walk away from this.

541
00:42:39,594 --> 00:42:42,305
I know. Me, too.

542
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:48,895
One of us has to go here.

543
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:52,064
I know.

<i># Now they are closed</i>

547
00:43:06,146 --> 00:43:10,815
<i># They just sometimes twitch a little</i>

548
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,585
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

549
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:15,706
Well, as long as they're not kissing.

550
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:18,314

554
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:34,313
- It's just...
- Painful.

555
00:43:34,396 --> 00:43:36,482
I know.

556
00:43:38,734 --> 00:43:40,819
