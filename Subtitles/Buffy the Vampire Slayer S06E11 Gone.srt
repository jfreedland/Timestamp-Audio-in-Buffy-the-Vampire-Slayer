00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,956
Previously:

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,229
Last night changed things.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,079
The only thing different
is that I'm disgusted with myself.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,428
Is this the way to the movies?

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,309
What is this place?

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,759
I'll just be a minute.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,916
Willow and Dawn
have been missing for hours.

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,474
- Do you know how long I've been here?
- Let's get outta here.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,595
Dawnie, I'm sorry!

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,756
- You could have killed her!
- I need help.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,591
No more spells. I'm finished.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,919
- Got it.
- It's beautiful.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,871
Phase one of the plan is now complete.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,358
Candles? We can't have candles?

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,916
Dawn, it's a magic clearance.
Everything must go.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,474
But they're just candles.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,198
Well, to you and me they're just candles,

19
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,915
but to witches they're like bongs.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,072
So, no candles, no charms, no...

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,634
- Bird.
- No bird?

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,835
The peacock on the table.
It has two crystals in it.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,230
Tara left them.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,274
I'll make sure she gets them.

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,710
Dawn, can you grab the fertility god statue
on the desk over there?

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,752
Kokopelli? No! I love him.

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,996
And he was Mom's.

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,193
Why do we have to get rid of
so many things I like?

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,598
Dawn, I explained this to you.
Willow has a problem.

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,429
The next few weeks are gonna be
crazy hard on her as it is.

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,394
Any reminder of what it is
that she's trying to stay away from

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,273
could cause her to give in to temptation.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,675
And that would be bad.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,669
OK, that's it. It's finally done.
It still needs a trial run, but it's...

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,597
- Kinda clunky-lookin'.
- What?

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,190
I pictured something cooler.
More ILM, less Ed Wood.

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,278
You wanna see cool? I'll show you cool.

38
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,911
Mama!

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,394
Did it...? Is it...?

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,078
Yeah.

41
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,550
- I'd call that a successful test.
- Well, that's just half the test.

42
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,159
Hey!

43
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,035
- You penis!
- Cheer up, Frodo.

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,438
Thanks to my brains and our mystical gem,
we got an invisibility ray.

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,552
And I'd say that makes us
pretty much unstoppable.

46
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,351
Dawn, come on. You gotta eat breakfast.
Xander's gonna be here any second.

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,074
She's gonna be late for school again.

48
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,716
- How are you doing?
- I'm OK.

49
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,960
Not "ready to head back to classes,
face the world" OK,

50
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,640
but the shakiness is only semi now.

51
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,153
I thought I'd spend the day fishing the Net
for more poop on the stolen diamond.

52
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,555
I called you before.

53
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,989
Didn't hear you.

54
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,157
Dawnie, I'm making you a nice omelette.

55
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,191
Not hungry.

56
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,356
Dawn, you need to eat something.

57
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,789
Thanks for your concern.

58
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,277
OK, I deserve the wrath of Dawn,
but why is she taking it out on you?

59
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,995
Because I let it happen.

60
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,432
- Buffy, I was the one who...
- Who was drowning. My best friend.

61
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,956
I was too wrapped up
in my own dumb life to even notice.

62
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,035
Morning.

63
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,792
What are you doing? And here?

64
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,995
Just took a stroll.
Found myself in your neck of the woods.

65
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,957
Couldn't find a less flammable
time of day to take a stroll?

66
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,548
Well, the fact is my lighter's gone missing.

67
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,830
Thought I might've dropped it here.

68
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,951
Haven't seen it.

69
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,036
I'm gonna head back
to my room, get dressed.

70
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,312
- Lame.
- What?

71
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,510
You. Making up excuses.

72
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,918
Don't flatter yourself, love.
Bloody fond of that lighter.

73
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,237
Stop trying to see me.
And stop calling me that.

74
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,556
So, what should I call you then?

75
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,398
Pet?

76
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,468
Sweetheart?

77
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,989
My little Goldilocks?

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,390
I love this hair.
The way it bounces around when...

79
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,676
This flapjack's not ready to be flipped.

80
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,473
What the hell is that supposed to...?

81
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,230
Stop that.

82
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,191
Good Godfrey Cambridge, Spike!

83
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,833
Still trying to mack on Buffy?
Wake up already. Never gonna happen!

84
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,349
Only a complete loser
would hook up with you.

85
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,712
Unless she's a simpleton like Harmony,
or a nut sack like Drusilla...

86
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,355
You really need to get Dawn
off to school. Let's go fetch her, OK?

87
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,074
You can let yourself out, right, Spike?

88
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,634
- Dawn! Xander's here!
- I'm here.

89
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,069
You have everything?
And after school, you...

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,431
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go, Xander.
- You will come straight home?

91
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,315
Sure. Maybe we can find some time
for you to get me into another car accident.

92
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,476
- Good morning. You must be Dawn.
- May I help you?

93
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,639
I'm Doris Kroger, from Social Services.
We had an appointment?

94
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,957
- For Wednesday.
- This is Wednesday.

95
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,789
Right. Well, Dawn, you better...

96
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,075
- And, Xander, you'll drive safely?
- Yes, ma'am.

97
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,790
Little bit on the tardy side, isn't she?

98
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,435
Yeah, well, it's been
one of those mornings, you know?

99
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,357
Come on in.

100
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,511
Sorry about the mess.
We're doing a little house-clean.

101
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
So, we gonna chat this out, or what?

102
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,230
Now's really not a good time.
I have company.

103
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,590
No worries. I'll wait.

104
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,393
Ms Summers, if you
and your boyfriend would like...

105
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,829
He's not...

106
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,793
Not my boyfriend. He's just a...

107
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,792
Spike, this nice woman
is from Social Services.

108
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,396
Right.

109
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,310
Buffy's a great mom.
She takes good care of her little sis.

110
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,953
Like, when Dawn was hanging out too much
in my crypt, Buffy put a right stop to it.

111
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,912
- I'm sorry, did you say...
- Crib. Crib. He said crib.

112
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,635
You know kids today
and their buggin' street slang.

113
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,230
Spike, didn't you have to go now,
because of that thing?

114
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,510
Thing, yeah. My blanket.

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,795
He sleeps here?

116
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,036
What? No! No.

117
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,469
Oh, the blanket.

118
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,592
That's a security thing.

119
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,790
He has issues.

120
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,480
Nope, just me and Dawn living here.

121
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,513
Buffy, I'm not feeling hot,
so I'm gonna take a quick nap, OK?

122
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,915
OK, Will!

123
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,990
That's Willow.
She kinda lives here too, actually.

124
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,839
So you live with another woman?

125
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,270
It's not a gay thing, you know.

126
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,198
Well, she's gay, but we don't... gay.

127
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,754
Not that there's anything wrong with...

128
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,078
I know what that looks like,
but I swear it's not what it looks like.

129
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,236
It's magic weed.

130
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,316
It's not mine.

131
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,236
I think I've seen enough.

132
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,999
No, actually,
I really don't think that you have.

133
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,275
It's been kind of a bad time.

134
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,597
It's been a bad time now for a while,
hasn't it, Ms Summers?

135
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,678
Your sister's grades
have fallen sharply in the last year,

136
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,236
due in large part
to her frequent absences and lateness.

137
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,673
- But there are good reasons.
- I'm sure there are.

138
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,679
But my interest is in Dawn's welfare
and the stability of her home life -

139
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,237
something I'm just not convinced that an
unemployed young woman can provide.

140
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,430
I can. I do.

141
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,438
We'll just have to see
about that then, won't we?

142
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,951
I'm going to recommend
immediate probation in my report.

143
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,115
What does that mean?

144
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,312
It means that I'll be monitoring you
very closely, Ms Summers.

145
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,715
And if I don't see
that things are improving,

146
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,355
I'll be forced to recommend that
you be stripped of your guardianship.

147
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,550
You can't do that.

148
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,230
I do what is in Dawn's best interest,
as should you.

149
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,475
Have a nice day.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,275
Didn't go well, huh?

151
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,440
Why won't you go?

152
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,711
- I just thought you'd want...
- Get out of here!

153
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,029
Just getting what I came for, love.

154
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,476
So long, Goldilocks.

155
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,512
Well, I think I can work with this.

156
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,518
What exactly would you like me to do?

157
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,518
Just make me different.

158
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,199
- What if we get caught?
- No way. We'll be invisible.

159
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,108
- Plus their security's gotten lax.
- You should know. You've cased it enough.

160
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,675
OK, this is it.

161
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,678
Remember, we're professionals.

162
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,037
- Slayer!
- What? Where?

163
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,196
There. Headed this way.

164
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,837
- Give it!
- I need to be invisible!

165
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,394
I need it more! Buffy can't see me!

166
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,080
Watch it! Don't touch the...

167
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,709
Oopsie.

168
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,989
What happened to Buffy? She's gone.

169
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,351
She's right here.
Table four. I put her with your family.

170
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,755
Great. Except we don't hate Buffy.

171
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,916
Let's put her back at table one.

172
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,476
- Where do I put D'Hoffryn?
- We're not inviting D'Hoffryn.

173
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,229
I have to, he's my ex-boss.
You're inviting your work buddies.

174
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,113
- She's got a point.
- Hey, Buffy...

175
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,429
Where are you?

176
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,676
At table four, apparently.

177
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,471
Well, that remains to be seen. Like you.

178
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,479
Don't strain yourself looking, Xander.
I'm Invisible Girl.

179
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,955
- Xander?
- Sorry!

180
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,799
Her clothes are invisible too.

181
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,276
Buffy, how did this hap...

182
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,680
Wait a sec.
Have you been feeling ignored lately?

183
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,793
Yeah, ignored - I wish.
No, this isn't a Marcie deal.

184
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,753
I left Main Street
after getting my hair cut...

185
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,474
- You cut your hair?
- Yeah.

186
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,238
Really? How short?

187
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,955
About up to here. If you could see my hand,
it's kind of above my shoulders.

188
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,958
Sounds adorable!
I was thinking of getting my hair cut...

189
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,470
Can we get back to freaking out
about no-show Buffy? This is serious.

190
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,478
I know. It kinda fits the day I've had.

191
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,034
Willow's still a wreck,
Dawn's mad at both of us,

192
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,915
and the social services lady put me through
a wringer. Says she's gonna "watch" me.

193
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,591
Like to see her try now. You know,
there may be an upside to no-see me.

194
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,232
Buff, did you see anyone
or anything suspicious...

195
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:50,195
before you cleared up?

196
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,996
Nope, didn't see nothin'.
See what I did there, with the eyeballs?

197
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,554
Why would anyone
make her invisible anyway?

198
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,878
An invisible slayer's gotta be way more
effective than the standard variety.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,355
I'm less with the why
and more with the how.

200
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,519
We get the how, then we got how to make
her unseen sight seen again, right?

201
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,278
'S all right!

202
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,277
Buffy, could you focus, please?

203
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,278
I am. This is kinda fun.

204
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,394
Well, it would help if we had a little bit
more to go on. Or anything to go on.

205
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,392
I could go check the spot
where Buffy disappeared, snoop for clues.

206
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,231
Yeah, right.

207
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,318
You know what? I'm just gonna go for a walk.

208
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,352
- A walk?
- Yeah. Clear my head.

209
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,315
You guys keep working
on the whats and hows.

210
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,238
- Clear my head!
- Buffy!

211
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,311
Well, seems pretty obvious it's some
kind of spell that's done this to her.

212
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,668
A spell from who?

213
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,998
You said it yourself, it makes no sense for
one of her enemies to make her invisible.

214
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,271
- Maybe it's a mistake.
- A magical mistake.

215
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,868
Who'd be messing with that kind of pow...

216
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,999
- Willow.
- Xander.

217
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,634
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

218
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,435
I found out some stuff about
the diamond stolen from the museum.

219
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,111
It's called the llluminata. There's rumours
it has quasi-mystical quantum properties.

220
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,879
Willow, we need to talk.

221
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,037
We are. Well, I'm talking
and you're looking at me funny.

222
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,594
Is there something you wanna tell me?

223
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,354
It was nothing. I didn't slip.

224
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,393
Will, nobody's mad. Relapse is
a part of recovery, we understand that.

225
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,353
We just have to figure a way to fix it.

226
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,835
- Fix what?
- Fix Buffy.

227
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,357
- Buffy's broken?
- Will, you know what I'm talkin'...

228
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,395
You don't know.

229
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,515
Rhymes with blinvisible?

230
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,955
What?

231
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,799
Buffy was leaving the haircutting place
when she...

232
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,118
- Buffy got her hair cut?
- Yeah! Adorable, apparently.

233
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,232
I personally couldn't tell,
since she's all blinvisible.

234
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,828
And you think I have
something to do with this?

235
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,598
No.

236
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,916
Will, your spells have caused weird stuff to
happen to each of us at one time or another.

237
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,101
And let's not forget the recent forgetting.

238
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,910
I see.

239
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,589
So now when anything nasty happens,
I get conveniently blamed for it?

240
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,392
No one's blaming.

241
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,593
So I guess it wouldn't matter
if I just jump off the wagon completely,

242
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,154
since you already think
I'm making pit stops.

243
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,669
If you say you didn't do it...

244
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,075
- Willow, where you going?
- For a walk.

245
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,150
Couple of circuits are burned out
and the wiring's all fried.

246
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,157
But we had so many plans.

247
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,034
Naked women, and all...
well, all the naked women.

248
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,030
It's your fault. If you hadn't grabbed it...

249
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:07,358
We got bigger problems, bonehead.

250
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,516
The Slayer's invisible now?

251
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,953
He's right. She could be anywhere.
Even here, right now.

252
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,396
Watching, listening to every word we say.

253
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,512
For all we know, she could be one of us.

254
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,035
No, wait, guys, that isn't true.

255
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,435
I wouldn't sweat the Slayer too much.

256
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,156
Says you. In my book, an invisible slayer
means a whole world of trouble.

257
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,550
I am the ghost of fashion victims past.

258
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,069
Studded caps? Not a good idea.

259
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,955
I'm doing you a favour!

260
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,156
Nah. Too easy.

261
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,958
So long, copper!

262
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,436
That's mine! Stop!

263
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,956
Hello, Mrs Kroger.

264
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,475
What? Where's my...

265
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,791
Losing my mind.

266
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,556
OK, who's the...

267
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,314
Kill. Kill. Kill.

268
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,190
What?

269
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,628
- I didn't say anything.
- Not you. The mug.

270
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,908
But I heard something.

271
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,599
Kill, Doris. Kill everybody.

272
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,235
- You know you want to.
- Shut up, shut up! Just shut up!

273
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,837
OK. No... No...

274
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,516
Yahtzee!

275
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,118
Doris.

276
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,949
I've got a few, so if you wanna
discuss that case file now.

277
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,473
What? Oh, yes, the Summers file.
It's right over here.

278
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,297
It's a 15-year-old girl, living
under her sister's guardianship.

279
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:17,039
The house is a complete...

280
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,789
What is this? "All work and no play
make Doris a dull girl"?

281
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,673
- What?
- "All work and no play make Doris... "

282
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,439
The pages are filled with it.

283
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,630
I didn't do this.

284
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,357
- It was the voice.
- Excuse me?

285
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,758
There was a voice before.
It made my coffee dance.

286
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,953
- It told me to...
- To what?

287
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,757
Nothing.

288
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,791
Doris, take the rest of the day off.

289
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,593
- See your doctor.
- What about my cases?

290
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,995
We'll put someone else on them.

291
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,157
And have them redo the Summers interview.

292
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,875
I'm not crazy. I am not crazy.

293
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,680
Hey, Will. Whatcha doin'?

294
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,389
I figured out this was where Buffy
disappeared from what you told me,

295
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,239
so don't start jumpin' to any conclusions.

296
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,749
No jumpin'. Look, feet firmly planted.

297
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,678
I'm not feeling like myself right now.
Sorry.

298
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,756
Me too. Sorry.

299
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,676
So, what have we found out so far?

300
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,279
Take a look at that!

301
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,359
Something sped outta here pretty damn quick
to make that kind of tread mark.

302
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,553
- This could have been made any time.
- Yeah, but this wasn't.

303
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,755
What is it?

304
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,156
- Paint that I scraped off the fire hydrant.
- What fire hydrant?

305
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,035
That one.

306
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,277
Whatever hit this hydrant
hit it after it was made invisible.

307
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,157
Betcha by golly wow that something was the
same something that shot out of that alley.

308
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,953
Black paint? Buffy's phantom van.

309
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,716
We need to let Buffy...

310
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,673
There's something there.

311
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,870
It's a pylon -
one of those orange traffic cones.

312
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,956
You should take it to the Magic Box.

313
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,878
It might help you and Anya
figure out what spell was used.

314
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,154
- What about you?
- I got paint scrapings and the tyre mark.

315
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,397
I'm gonna find this van
that's been stalking Buffy.

316
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,670
By the way, where is Buffy?

317
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,516
Oh, my God, the blood!
Look at all the blood!

318
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,552
Whatever beastie you are,
I know you're here. And I hurt beasties.

319
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,593
Watch it.

320
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,072
A ghost, is it?
Go and haunt the living, like a good spook.

321
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,630
- Buffy?
- I told you, stop trying to see me.

322
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,871
- I got it!
- Really?

323
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,230
We'll put D'Hoffryn at your parents' table

324
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,069
and move your Uncle Rory
to a table five near the bar.

325
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,151
An, honey, we're looking
for invisibility spells here.

326
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,714
Obviously I haven't found anything yet.

327
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,072
At least, nothing that would explain
why things near Buffy become invisible.

328
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,197
- Xander.
- What happened?

329
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,518
An unpleasant tactile experience,
like putting my hand in pudding.

330
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,915
Like pudding, am I right?
Rice or tapioca - lumpy like that.

331
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,235
We have to find Buffy. She's gotta know.

332
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,715
I don't think Buffy will be
broken up over a pylon.

333
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,799
Anya, whatever's happening to the pylon
will probably happen to her.

334
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,357
If we don't find Buffy... I mean, if we
don't figure out how this was done...

335
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,596
She's pudding?

336
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,636
What do you mean, she'll fade away?

337
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,479
The Slayer got slammed
with a big-ass dose of radiation.

338
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,318
Her cells are mutating.

339
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,479
Eventually her molecular make-up
will lose its integrity and then...

340
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,718
- But wouldn't that kill her?
- Let me think. Yeah.

341
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,958
Wait a minute. We're not killing anybody.
Especially not Buffy.

342
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,558
You guys are so immature. We're villains!

343
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:14,312
When will you get that
into your thick skulls?

344
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,319
- We're not killers, we're crime lords!
- Yeah. Like Lex Luthor.

345
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,512
He tries to take over Metropolis,
but he doesn't kill Superman.

346
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,200
Because it's Superman's book, you moron!

347
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,834
But Lex doesn't kill him, does he?

348
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,308
Listen, Warren, you get that ray working...

349
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,870
and the first thing we're gonna do
is find Buffy and re-visible her...

350
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,682
before it's too late.

351
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,434
You got me?

352
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,312
Fine.

353
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,550
Whatever you guys say.

354
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,791
Spike?

355
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,510
Spike?

356
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,556
What are you doing?

357
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,554
What does it look like I'm doing, you nit?
I'm exercising, aren't I?

358
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,191
Exercising.

359
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,673
Naked.

360
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,756
In bed.

361
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,513
A man shouldn't use immortality
as an excuse to let himself go.

362
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,279
You gotta keep fit for the killing.

363
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,275
Looks like you had a little trouble
upstairs. Mini disaster area.

364
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,073
You come here
to criticise my housekeeping?

365
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,189
- No, no. I'm looking for Buffy.
- Haven't seen her.

366
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,108
You wouldn't. She's come down
with a slight case of invisibility.

367
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,356
Yeah? How did...?

368
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,550
We don't know yet.

369
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,635
Anyway, she's not at the house,
and I really, really need to find her.

370
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,833
Tell you what, I'll take a peek around
first chance I get,

371
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,191
and if we bump into each other,
I'll clue her that you're on the lookout.

372
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,191
After your exercises.

373
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,869
Yeah, right.

374
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,874
You know, kidding aside, Spike,
you really should get a girlfriend.

375
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,477
That was bloody stupid.

376
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,592
What's the matter?
Ashamed to be seen with me?

377
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,713
Come on. He had no idea I was here.
This is perfect.

378
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,437
Perfect for you.

379
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,076
Well, picture me confused.
I thought this is what you wanted.

380
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,156
What I want...

381
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,796
This vanishing act's
right liberating for you, innit?

382
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,718
Go anywhere you want.
Do anything you want.

383
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,120
- Or anyone.
- What are you talking about?

384
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,913
The only reason you're here
is that you're not here.

385
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,112
Of course. As usual,
there's something wrong with Buffy.

386
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,949
She came back all wrong. You know,
I didn't ask for this to happen to me.

387
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,150
Not too put off by it though, are you?

388
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,637
No! Maybe cos for the first time since...
I'm free.

389
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,115
Free of rules and reports.

390
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,192
- Free of this life.
- Free of life.

391
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,595
Got another name for that - dead.

392
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,439
Why do you always have to...
I thought we were having fun.

393
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,359
Yeah. Now.

394
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,076
But sooner or later your chums will work out
a way to bring you back to living colour.

395
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,633
You need to go. Get dressed if you can
find your clothes, and push off.

396
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,354
If I can't have all of you, I'd rather...

397
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,435
That's cheating.

398
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,999
I don't believe this.
He threw me out? He threw me.

399
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,438
Did I fall into some
backward dimension here?

400
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,994
Is this Bizarro World?

401
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,035
And after he's always going on and on about
being the only one that understands me.

402
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,836
"We're alike, you and me.
Birds of a bloody feather. "

403
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,229
I'm walking here!

404
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,830
Insensitive. That's what he is.

405
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,070
Willow? Willow?

406
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,114
Dawn?

407
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,596
Dawn, come here.
You wanna see somethin' neat?

408
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,438
- There you are!
- Buffy? Where are you?

409
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,993
I'm invisible. Check this out.

410
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,156
Unidentified flying pizza,
comin' in for a landing.

411
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,512
- What are you talking...
- OK, not the most clever ad lib.

412
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,076
- But, come on, points for spontaneity!
- Stop it! Just stop.

413
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,159
Sorry, Dawn. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to freak you out.

414
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,113
What did you think would happen?
You're invisible, Buffy.

415
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,437
I know. Xander and Anya are on it.
Muldering out what happened.

416
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,358
What about you?
Shouldn't you be working on it?

417
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,040
- Of course I...
- Do you even care who did this to you?

418
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,153
Or if you're gonna be stuck this way?
You're making jokes and flying pizzas.

419
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,120
I don't think that's...

420
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:15,159
I can't talk to you like
this. I can't see you!

421
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,955
- How can I talk to you if I can't see you?
- Dawn! Dawn!

422
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,199
Buffy, it's Xander. Where are you?
We got a new problem here.

423
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,799
- Tell her.
- I'm trying.

424
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,388
We think whatever made you invisible
is killing you.

425
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,556
- Tell her about the pudding.
- Anya!

426
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,696
Buff, if this isn't reversed,
you're gonna...

427
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:44,712
well, dissolve, or fade into nothing.

428
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,914
Now!

429
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,191
- Let go of me!
- Congratulations. You're our first hostage.

430
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,114
Dawn, I'm going out to find Xander.
If he calls...

431
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,356
Xander?

432
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,597
Just listen, Slayer.
You don't have a lot of time.

433
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,950
Who is this? You sound familiar.

434
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,631
I'm nobody. No one you know.
We've got your friend Willow,

435
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,515
and if you don't want anything nasty to
happen to her, you'd better meet us. Alone.

436
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,039
Where?

437
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,870
Stay still and you won't get hurt.

438
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,797
- You OK, Will?
- Buffy?

439
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,261
Where are the bad guys?

440
00:35:14,303 --> 00:35:16,515
All round you, Slayer,
so don't try anything.

441
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,632
He's bluffing, Buffy.
There's just three of them, I think.

442
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,070
More than enough to cause
serious carnage, right, guys?

443
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,033
- Guys? Guys!
- Kick! Use the kick!

444
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,391
I tried. He blocks it
with his drunken-monkey fist!

445
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,476
Scary video carnage.

446
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,194
- Slayer's here.
- Sorry. Didn't see her.

447
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,630
Let's continue in a less crowded area.
Like over there.

448
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,069
- Where?
- Follow me.

449
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,879
I'm gonna guess,
you're the ones that did this to me?

450
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,797
- It was an accident!
- Who's that?

451
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,356
- Nobody you know.
- They're the ones from your mystery van.

452
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,758
You. So what annoying thing
are you gonna do to me now?

453
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,952
- Save your life. Make you visible.
- I'm meant to believe that?

454
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,595
They told me everything, Buffy.
Something's happening, you're...

455
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,871
- Fading away. I know.
- I can fix that.

456
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,560
- Pick up that air-hockey mallet.
- What for?

457
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,716
It'll give me a target to aim at.

458
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,513
Now hold still
and all your troubles will soon be gone.

459
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,870
- You're on the wrong setting.
- What?

460
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,276
The gun - it's not set
for reversing the particle ionisation.

461
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,119
It'll accelerate her molecular dissolution!

462
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,198
- Mind your own business.
- What's she saying?

463
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,992
Buffy, he's trying to kill you!

464
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,439
Willow!

465
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,038
- OK, playtime's over.
- You haven't won yet, Slayer.

466
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,355
No. That comes
after I beat the snot out of you.

467
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,075
You'll have to find me first. There's
three of us, against just one of you.

468
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,270
- You lied to us.
- Fight her yourself.

469
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,234
- I go down, we all go down!
- I promise, you're all going down.

470
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,115
We may not have your powers, Slayer,
but you'll find we are not so easy to...

471
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,275
Get her!

472
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,469
Wait a minute! Who's biting my leg?

473
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,273
- Sorry! Where is she?
- Here.

474
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,158
She can't find us if we split up.

475
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,793
- You go that way.
- Which way?

476
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,876
That way! Over...

477
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,830
Just keep talking, boys.

478
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,037
- Watch the chest hair!
- I know that voice. You're...

479
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,988
Jonathan?

480
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,270
You have chest hair?

481
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,551
Warren?

482
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,714
- Who are you?
- Andrew.

483
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,278
I summoned the flying monkeys
that attacked the high school?

484
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,913
- During the school play?
- He's Tucker's brother.

485
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,395
Yeah, he's Tucker's brother.

486
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,632
So you three have, what,
banded together to be pains in my ass?

487
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,793
We're your arch-nemesises... ses.

488
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,238
You may have beaten us this time, Slayer,
but next time...

489
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,196
Maybe not!

490
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,293
It's locked? You were supposed to check it!

491
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,273
I forgot.

492
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,870
I give you my arch-nemesises... ses.

493
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,630
What's goin' on in here? I got a bunch of
scared kids saying this place is haunted!

494
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,072
Oh, my God, Buffy!

495
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,953
I know. They're gone.
I guess we should chase them.

496
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,117
No, your hair! It is adorable.

497
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,714
Pretty neat, you finding the van.

498
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,433
So, how did you manage to do it exactly?
I mean, to locate it?

499
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,632
The hard way. The spell-free way.

500
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,914
The "oh, my God, my head's gonna fall off,
my feet are killing me" way.

501
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,877
I don't know how I got through this day.

502
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,513
The important thing is that you did.
It's a good first step.

503
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,993
How are you doing, post-invisibleness?

504
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,038
OK. I still have to do
some damage control from my giddy-fest.

505
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,639
Dawn was pretty freaked out.

506
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,072
The whole "taking a vacation from me"
thing didn't work out too well.

507
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,156
Tell me about it.

508
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,232
Except, when I got Xander's message -

509
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,238
you know, that I was fading away -

510
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,632
I actually got scared.

511
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,194
Yeah. Who wouldn't?

512
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,312
Me. I wouldn't.

513
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,350
Not too long ago
I probably would have welcomed it.

514
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,476
But I realise...

515
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,472
I'm not saying that I'm doing
backflips about my life, but...

516
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,635
I didn't... I don't wanna die.

517
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,633
That's something, right?

518
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,115
It's something.

519
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,469
So I guess we both made good first steps.

520
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,396
I guess.

521
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,836
- Yay for us.
- Yay.

522
00:40:53,305 --> 00:40:59,531
