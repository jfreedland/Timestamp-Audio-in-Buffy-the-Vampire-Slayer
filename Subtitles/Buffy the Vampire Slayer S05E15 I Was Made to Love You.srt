00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,169
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:08,644
- What kind of demon am I fighting?
- Glory isn't a demon. She's a god.

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:11,645
Tell me where the Key is.

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,805
We had to hide the Key. Made it human.

5
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:17,283
- Sent it to you.
- Dawn.

6
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:23,410
I know you got a lot on your mind. You
wanna let me in on any of it, let me know.

7
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:28,526
Buffy's like nobody else in the world.
But she doesn't love me.

8
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:31,323
- They want me back.
- Are you going?

9
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:35,247
- I don't know. If we can't work this out...
- This is goodbye?

10
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,325
Riley!

11
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,727
There's something
you need to know about Dawn.

12
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:48,281
Why does everybody act
all weird when I'm around?

13
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:51,844
"They had to be certain
the Slayer would protect it,

14
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:55,323
so they sent the Key to her
in the form of a sister."

15
00:00:57,613 --> 00:00:59,524
- Is this blood?
- What did you do?

16
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:00,966
I'm not a key.

17
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:03,123
- I'm not real.
- You're the Key.

18
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,844
Go. Before she finds you. She's here!

19
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,127
I love you.

20
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:11,649
The only chance you had with me
was when I was unconscious.

21
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:16,284
I want you out. I want you out of this town,
I want you off this planet.

22
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:21,083
You don't come near me, my friends,
or my family again, ever. Understand?

23
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:31,331
Spike!

24
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:34,366
Spike wants me. How obscene is that?

25
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:38,287
Well, it is very strange.
I can't imagine what he's thinking.

26
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:41,331
Not that you're not attractive...

27
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:45,043
I feel gross, you know, like, dirty.

28
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:49,123
That's ridiculous. You can't be
responsible for what Spike feels.

29
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:53,729
Aren't I responsible? Something about me
had to make him feel that, right?

30
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:57,806
Something that made him say
"Woof! That's the one for me!"

31
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:02,531
- I think you should perhaps calm down.
- Me too.

32
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:09,242
Puffy Xander, I'm sorry. I guess
I got carried away. Are you OK?

33
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:13,404
I'm alive. I can tell cos of the pain.

34
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:18,166
- Do you wanna sit down?
- I'm not that bendy. I could lean.

35
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:21,282
I'll get some ice.

36
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:23,725
Here.

37
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,925
- Comfy?
- Yeah. This leaning, this is the stuff.

38
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:35,963
That's my secret to attracting men.
It's simple really.

39
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:38,806
Slap 'em around, torture 'em,
make their lives hell...

40
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:41,088
- Buff...
- Sure, the nice guys run away,

41
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:45,803
but every now and then you meet a real
prince of a guy like Spike who gets off on it.

42
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,802
Buffy. Stand me up.

43
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:59,046
The problem is not you.
Don't do this to yourself, please.

44
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:04,044
I just wanna know
that there's gonna be another good one.

45
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:06,722
One that I won't chase away.

46
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:10,567
There will be. Promise. He's out there.
He can come along any minute.

47
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:15,847
And the minute after that I can terrify him
with my strength and self-involvement.

48
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:19,084
What? I don't think you're like that.

49
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:22,802
Maybe I could change.
You know, I could work harder.

50
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:28,013
I could spend less time slaying, and laugh at
his jokes. Men like that, the joke-laughing-at.

51
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:33,965
Or maybe you can just be Buffy, he'll see
your amazing heart, and fall in love with you.

52
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,044
Xander, that's...

53
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:45,133
This is the day you choose to hug me?

54
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:48,685
Buffy?

55
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:53,048
You ever think you haven't found
a great relationship on the Hellmouth

56
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,124
because it's a Hellmouth?

57
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:59,126
Seems to me it's a pretty terrible place
to try to build anything.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

59
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,292
Thank you for picking me up.
I'm grateful for the ride.

60
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:26,332
You sure you wanna get out here?
I mean, this place is kinda...

61
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:29,405
What are you looking for
in Sunnydale, anyway?

62
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:31,484
True love.

63
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:31,762
I might like it more than the others.
Can you spin around again?

64
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,448
I'm not sure. Once more.

65
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:40,082
Now could you go the other way?

66
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:45,121
You're messing with me.

67
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:48,967
- We were seeing how many times you'd do it.
- Was it five, or four and a half?

68
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:51,851
- So is anyone gonna talk about my dress?
- I like it.

69
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,527
You sure? I mean, it's not too mom-ish?

70
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:57,524
- That was why I liked it.
- You're both crazy.

71
00:05:57,613 --> 00:06:00,127
It's not mom-ish at all. It's sexy.

72
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:04,331
It screams "Randy sex kitten.
Buy me one drink and I'II..."

73
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,847
Wait, that's not good either.

74
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,003
Oh, God. What time is it?

75
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:14,047
4.23. You have lots of time until seven.

76
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:18,809
Vast acres of time, in which you could plant
crops. Tell me about Brian and his intentions.

77
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:22,363
- Maybe he's a gigolo. Was his shirt all shiny?
- No.

78
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:25,923
He works for a publishing house.
He's a nice, normal guy, OK?

79
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:29,926
- I think I've heard of those.
- He came to the gallery, my first day back,

80
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:33,050
when I was, you know,
kinda shaky, starting over.

81
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:36,808
And he asked a question about
these antique cameos, and I was so lost,

82
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:40,283
because Carol had been doing
the ordering while I was sick.

83
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:45,128
It turned out he didn't know anything about
them either, so we had a lot to talk about.

84
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:49,206
- So what's the plan for tonight?
- Dinner and then a movie.

85
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:53,163
Or maybe it was a movie and then dinner.

86
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:58,043
Which might be better, because, you know,
then we could talk about the movie.

87
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,046
Or maybe a movie isn't a good idea at all,
because you can't talk during,

88
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:06,684
and then, you know, what's the point
of any of it? And about the restaurant.

89
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:12,928
Do you think it should be one with candles
and romantic music, or is that pushing it?

90
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:19,009
What do you think? Should I try to make
things romantic, or let him set the pace?

91
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:24,573
No. Love Doctor Buffy is not in.
I'm not qualified to give dating advice.

92
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:30,046
I've had exactly two boyfriends,
and they both left. Really left. "Left town" left.

93
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:33,531
Honey, you just had some bad luck.

94
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:37,090
You're going to that party.
Maybe you'll find someone there.

95
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:42,008
Or maybe Brian has a son, and Mom and I can
go on unspeakably awkward double dates.

96
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:45,644
Oh, God... Brian. What time is it now?

97
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:48,650
4.24.

98
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:53,684
- You sure the dress is OK?
- Spin again. Real fast this time.

99
00:07:55,133 --> 00:08:00,526
Willow's good with computers, but me not
so much. Do you really understand all that?

100
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,365
At first it was confusing.

101
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:06,002
Just the idea of computers was, like,
"Whoa, I'm 1100 years old."

102
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,411
I had trouble adjusting
to the idea of Lutherans.

103
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:13,691
I go online sometimes, but everyone's
spelling is really bad. It's depressing.

104
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,492
But you have to try online trading, it's great.

105
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:20,009
The secret is avoiding the tech companies
everyone was jumping on,

106
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:23,688
and going with the smaller firms
that supply the basic components.

107
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:29,207
Anyway, I took the money from
working for Giles, and I tripled it.

108
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:32,410
Tripled? Like, first money,
then money money money?

109
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:36,532
Yes. I'm thinking about buying something
very expensive. Maybe an antelope.

110
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,012
Hi.

111
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,121
- Hi.
- Do you know where Warren is?

112
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:47,446
- And if you do, could you tell me?
- I don't think we know a Warren.

113
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:50,605
Well, all righty. No harm in asking. Thanks.

114
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:55,763
- Hi, do you know Warren? I need to find him.
- Sorry.

115
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:58,731
You can do all this stuff
with a regular computer?

116
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:04,410
I'll show you. You can also see the website
I designed for the shop. Huge photo of me.

117
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:19,085
- How ya doin'? Havin' o' the fun?
- You know, I am.

118
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:23,371
Dancing with you is better than trying
to hook up with some good-Iooking guy.

119
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:27,082
I think I liked it better when
you were kicking me in my puffy groin.

120
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:31,892
I let them do that.
Dance together. That was me.

121
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,726
- Very nice of you.
- A good deed.

122
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:38,522
Yes. I'm expecting a big karmic reward
any second now.

123
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:45,484
Thank you.

124
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,725
Buffy.

125
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:13,533
Ben. Hey. I didn't even know you were here.
And again with the nonmedical clothing.

126
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,923
Actually, these are orthopaedic pants.

127
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:19,652
Man, that sounded so funny in my head.

128
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:27,163
It's very, very funny.
It's funny in my head, too.

129
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:30,568
- Havin' a good time?
- Yeah, I am.

130
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:36,171
I was dancing earlier, and my friends are
here, so... But not that it's all about me.

131
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:39,404
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- I am now.

132
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:45,727
So, do you maybe wanna dance?

133
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,881
I'm not really good at rhythm.

134
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:53,448
Sure. I'd love to.

135
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,730
- Let me just dump this. I'll be right back.
- OK.

136
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:05,963
Look at these tiny grain patties.
They're woven.

137
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:08,886
That's craftsmanship.

138
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:12,602
They aren't handwoven, you know.

139
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:16,890
- Then how?
- Well, it's a machine,

140
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:20,761
and it sorta... it presses.

141
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:25,003
And there may be a mould of some sort...

142
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,890
Who's that?

143
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:31,005
Warren?

144
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:34,368
That girl. Tara and I met her.

145
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:38,841
She speaks with a strange evenness
and selects her words too precisely.

146
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,811
Well, some of us
like that kind of thing in a girl.

147
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:43,485
Warren?

148
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:48,486
- Did you get me a drink?
- Gotta go, she'll see me.

149
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:52,566
- She who? What's up, Warren?
- It doesn't matter. Come on.

150
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,884
- Is Warren here?
- Thought you were gettin' the crunchies.

151
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:02,205
Xander got hypnotised by the strange girl.
I am remaining calm, however.

152
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:07,321
No, I'm right with you. You don't know
what you're talking about. Here she comes.

153
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:12,170
- I heard Warren was here. Is Warren here?
- Warren who?

154
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:15,605
He's Warren. And he's looking for me.

155
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,684
He lost me.

156
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,772
- Is Warren here?
- It's that girl again.

157
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:29,131
Is she still looking for Warren?
Weird, it's been, like, all day.

158
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:32,762
There's something strange about her.
She talks funny.

159
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,128
Some men find that appealing.

160
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:38,763
- Have you guys seen Warren?
- Let's hope she finds him.

161
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:42,084
I don't think a girl
that looks like that'll be Ionely for long.

162
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:44,084
Definitely not.

163
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:48,766
Not me. I was just saying,
a pretty girl like that,

164
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:53,404
there's always someone lurkin' around,
lookin' for some action.

165
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:04,324
Small world.

166
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,771
Oh, dear. If looks could stake.

167
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:12,841
You havin' fun, pet?
Trollin' for your next ex?

168
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:16,691
I gotta say, you could do better.

169
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:20,770
- I told you, I wa...
- Thought I was gonna leave town?

170
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:23,526
It's a free country.

171
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,564
Free party.

172
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:31,171
If you want me to leave, you can put your
hands on my hot, tight body and make me.

173
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:35,128
Get away from me.

174
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:54,810
Was that guy botherin' you? Should I offer
to get inappropriately violent or somethin'?

175
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:59,332
- No.
- Good, cos, honestly, I don't wanna.

176
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,567
So, are you ready to dance?

177
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:08,768
- First...
- What's that?

178
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:11,048
Oh, yeah, my phone number.

179
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:15,604
I was gonna try to subtly work it into
the conversation, but it didn't pan out,

180
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:20,323
and I thought I should try
to give it to you before you see me dance.

181
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:27,012
You know, in case you wanna get coffee.

182
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,291
Thank you.

183
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:34,283
I just... I think you should know

184
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:40,448
that I kinda have this bad history
in which, you know, we go get coffee,

185
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:44,651
and it all ends with you leaving town,
and you just got here and everything...

186
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:50,729
Apparently we'd be riskin' a tragic chain
reaction, but I just really like coffee.

187
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:54,167
I think coffee might be worth it.

188
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:58,169
And I would like to get to know coffee better.

189
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,203
Then I'll call you.

190
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:12,448
- Have you seen Warren?
- No, sorry.

191
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:15,001
And who are you, darlin'?

192
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:17,084
I'm April.

193
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:20,683
- I'm looking for my fella.
- Maybe you just found him.

194
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:22,843
Really? Where?

195
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,530
That would be wrong!
You are not my boyfriend!

196
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:48,371
Bloody hell!
You threw me through a window!

197
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:53,092
- What's that about?
- You cannot say that to me.

198
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:56,051
I have a boyfriend. Warren is my boyfriend.

199
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:59,444
You know what?
My bleeding sympathies to Warren.

200
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:04,928
No one but Warren can touch me.

201
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:10,047
Excuse me. Hi.
Maybe you and I could talk, you know,

202
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:14,729
cos throwing Spike through
a window, that's really good.

203
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:18,886
- But, you know, generally speaking...
- Do you know my boyfriend?

204
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:22,932
OK, I think you need to take a second
and stop looking for your boyfriend.

205
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:26,563
I have to find him.

206
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:33,246
If I hurt you just now, I am sorry.

207
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,088
And I hope that your boyfriend
will take good care of you.

208
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,172
I dunno about you, but I've had it
with superstrong women who aren't me.

209
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:51,485
- At least she didn't do too much damage.
- Double-glazed glass ain't cheap.

210
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:54,565
And the jamb needs
to be completely repaired.

211
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,804
Dear God, I'm the grown-up
who sees the world through my job.

212
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,851
I'm like my uncle Dave, the plumber,
and I must be shunned.

213
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:04,410
- OK.
- So, what do you guys think she is?

214
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:07,963
This may sound nuts, but I kinda
got the impression she was a...

215
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:10,647
- Robot.
- Yeah, robot.

216
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,327
I was gonna say robot.
What do you think she wants?

217
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:16,485
- Warren, whoever that is.
- It must be the guy that built her.

218
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:22,250
It's an unusual name. There's hardly any,
except Warren Beatty and President Harding.

219
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:25,088
It's probably not either of them.

220
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:27,727
Can you track down this guy
with only a first name?

221
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,011
Given enough time. I can get a list of the
Sunnydale students named Warren tonight,

222
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,927
but then we'll have to call them
or go to their dorms,

223
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,085
so we probably can't start
narrowing it down till tomorrow.

224
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:41,289
She could do a lot of damage by then.

225
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:44,604
To who, Spike?
See how vigorously I don't care.

226
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:48,652
It didn't sound like she wanted to hurt
Warren. She said he's her boyfriend.

227
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:54,046
I agree. I'm not sure this is a code red.
Is there a code pink? We need more codes.

228
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,727
OK. We'll track down Warren tomorrow.

229
00:17:56,813 --> 00:18:01,364
I'd better rescue Giles. He's been watching
Dawn while my mom's out on her date,

230
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:03,967
and I think there's only so much he can take.

231
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:07,011
Giles and Dawnie?
I bet they ended up having a blast.

232
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:11,325
Dear God, there's only so much I can take.
We'll have to change the system.

233
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:15,372
A 14-year-old's too old to be baby-sat,
and it's not fair on her.

234
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:19,048
- What'd she make you do?
- We listened to aggressively cheerful music

235
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:23,809
by people chosen for their ability to dance,
we ate cookie dough and talked about boys.

236
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:29,806
I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry,
but if it makes you feel any better,

237
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:34,489
my "fun Buffy party night" involved watching
a robot throw Spike through a window,

238
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,963
so if you wanna trade... No, wait.

239
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:42,445
- I won't give that memory up for anything.
- Robot? Sounds interesting.

240
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:45,809
We're gonna work on it tomorrow.
Unless you wanna stay and...

241
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,202
Who wants to hear everything?

242
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:50,848
..listen to my mom talk about boys.

243
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:54,721
- Must go. See you tomorrow. Bye, Joyce.
- Bye, Rupert.

244
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,972
Gosh, I'd forgotten
how much fun dating can be.

245
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:03,728
I don't know. I was right here.
I didn't see Prince Charming.

246
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:07,567
I didn't even see a good-night kiss.
It looked pretty tame to me.

247
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:11,566
I suppose by your standards
it could seem pretty...

248
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:13,848
- Oh, dear.
- What?

249
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,322
I left my bra in his car.

250
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:18,608
- Mother!
- I'm joking.

251
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:24,332
- Good God, that's horrible. Don't do that.
- I left it in the restaurant.

252
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,608
No more. No more. No more!

253
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:29,082
- On the dessert cart.
- I can't hear you.

254
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,363
Yeah? What?

255
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,569
Hi. Does Warren live here?

256
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,852
What the hell...? What are you doin'? It's 3.30!

257
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,322
Yes, it is. Does Warren live here?

258
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:51,844
OK, then. Bye.

259
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,687
- You're certain she was a robot?
- Absolutely.

260
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:15,164
She practically had "Genuine
Moulded Plastic" stamped on her ass.

261
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,928
Just tryin' a little spicy talk.

262
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:20,322
She was looking for someone named Warren.

263
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:23,291
- Will checked the Sunnydale enrolment.
- And got nothin'.

264
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:28,128
I found one Warren, but he left the country
a year ago. I'm checking nearby schools.

265
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,647
Whoever he is, he knows his stuff.

266
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:34,692
That girl, well...
That was a nice-Iookin' girl.

267
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:40,851
It's OK for him to say that,
cos I know that he really loves me only.

268
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:44,608
- Is there something we can be doing?
- What can we do?

269
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,287
- Do you have any books on robots?
- Yes, dozens.

270
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:50,445
There's a lot of research
we should do... No, I'm lying.

271
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:53,923
I haven't got squat.
I just like to see Xander squirm.

272
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:57,562
Funny. Charming and funny.

273
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,811
I think I found him.

274
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:04,444
A Warren Meers. He went to Sunnydale High
with us for a semester,

275
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:09,653
then he went to the tech college in Dutton.
I've got a local address where his folks live.

276
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:13,010
- He's probably home for spring break.
- I'll go talk to him.

277
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:15,653
No, wait. We don't know
what you're walking into.

278
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,248
We have no idea what his motive is
for building this thing.

279
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,722
Don't you think she's just...?

280
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,288
Yeah, she's just sort of a...

281
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:29,651
She's a sexbot.
I mean, what guy doesn't dream about that?

282
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:33,408
Beautiful girl with
no other thought but to please you,

283
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,688
willing to do anything...

284
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:46,529
Too many girls. I miss Oz. He'd get it.
He wouldn't say anything, but he'd get it.

285
00:21:47,093 --> 00:21:50,085
Why would anyone do that
if they could have a real person?

286
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:53,085
Maybe he couldn't - find a real person.

287
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:56,768
Come on. The guy's just a big sleaze.
Don't make excuses for him.

288
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:59,970
I'm not. I'm just saying people get Ionely,

289
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:06,606
and maybe having someone around, even
someone you made up, maybe it's easier.

290
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:11,808
But it's so weird. I mean, everyone wants
a nice, normal person to share with.

291
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:14,930
But this guy, if he couldn't find that,

292
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:17,732
I guess it's kinda sad.

293
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,372
- Hello?
- Hey. Ben, it's Buffy.

294
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,683
Is this a bad time? I know it's kinda early.

295
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:59,048
No, I just got in, is all. Night shift
at the hospital. I'm glad you called.

296
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:04,682
I found your number and figured I'd pick up
the phone a couple of times, then hang up,

297
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:08,846
and then finally call, and see if
you wanted to get that coffee, or...

298
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:13,605
Yeah. Yes. Coffee would be great.

299
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:17,121
Tomorrow night. Sure.

300
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:18,805
Bye.

301
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:26,371
Fine.

302
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:38,363
We just got here. Why didn't we just stay in
Dutton? Or we could've gone to my sister's.

303
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:41,729
I don't wanna hear about your sister's again.
Pack your stuff.

304
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:45,692
Why the rush? It's real early. Are we
even gonna say goodbye to your mom?

305
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:49,732
- You can call her.
- Is there something you're hiding from me?

306
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:55,206
Katrina, if you don't wanna pack, that's fine.
We can buy new stuff. Now let's just go.

307
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:00,889
I have to talk to you.

308
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,123
- Who's this?
- Is this about her?

309
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:06,769
- Yes.
- Her who? Something's going on here.

310
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:10,243
- Strange girls...
- Please, be quiet. OK? This is important.

311
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,086
- Wait in the kitchen.
- And I'm not important?

312
00:24:13,173 --> 00:24:15,562
- Warren, just tell her to go away.
- I can't.

313
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:18,811
You're keeping secrets.
Other girls, who knows what else.

314
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:21,088
Trina, shut up.

315
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,528
That's it. Forget it, Warren. I'm gone.

316
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,604
No. Katrina!

317
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:31,125
We were at Sunnydale High together.
Do you know who I am?

318
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:34,285
Yes, I know.
April, did she hurt someone?

319
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:37,201
Not yet. Well, no one that matters.

320
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:40,012
She's looking for me. She followed me here.

321
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:42,812
- OK. Kinda figured that out.
- No, there's more.

322
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:45,282
- There's something you need to know.
- I know.

323
00:24:45,373 --> 00:24:48,683
- No, wait. This is important.
- Believe me, I worked it out.

324
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:52,482
No, this is something
that you can't possibly know.

325
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:57,763
She's a robot.

326
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:06,763
A robot? Was it Ted? Cos I always said
there could've been more than one of him.

327
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:09,367
Nope, whole new robot. This one was a girl.

328
00:25:09,453 --> 00:25:13,571
Buffy's trackin' down the guy that made her,
so I'll drop you off, and then...

329
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:16,372
Comin' through! Comin' through.

330
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:20,809
Fire! Fire!

331
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:25,807
Hello, all. What's goin' on, then?

332
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:29,767
Spike, you're not welcome here.

333
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:35,644
Yeah, and we're working on a way to de-invite
you from here. Even if it is a public place.

334
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:39,965
Nah, forget it. Letting him in is good,
cos then we get to toss him out.

335
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:43,887
Can we throw him out the window
like the robot did? Cos that was neat.

336
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:46,533
Robot? That's what she was?

337
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,922
I knew somethin' wasn't right.

338
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:53,562
Hey. Someone's glad to see me.
Aren't you, little bit?

339
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,128
Stay away from me.

340
00:25:56,213 --> 00:26:00,411
- I think you'd better go.
- OK. Now, I was afraid of this.

341
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:06,608
Misrepresentations,
misunderstandings, slurs and allegations.

342
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:09,571
I don't know what Buffy told you,
but the thing is,

343
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:14,807
the Slayer and I worked together to get rid
of Dru, who was up to no good, and I don't...

344
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:19,171
- Spike. Listen to me.
- It's just, I'm trying to explain.

345
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:24,405
She might have said some things that
sounded like I expressed some kind of...

346
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,929
We are not your friends.
We are not your way to Buffy.

347
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:37,487
There is no way to Buffy.

348
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:42,209
Clear out of here.

349
00:26:42,293 --> 00:26:45,524
And, Spike, this thing. Get over it.

350
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:50,611
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

351
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:53,643
Move the hell on.

352
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:15,564
- I'm looking for my boyfriend Warren.
- What?

353
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:17,928
He comes from here and I need him.

354
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:23,133
But it's confusing, and I've already walked
a really long way. I'm sure he's nearby.

355
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:25,929
Warren. You're lookin' for Warren?

356
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:28,766
Yes. Do you know him?
Do you know where he is?

357
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:31,606
- Man, let me think...
- Please think.

358
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,446
Jeez! This is too bad - you just missed him.

359
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,803
Yes? Where did he go?

360
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:41,649
Warren? He headed out.
That way. Hurry, you might catch him.

361
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:46,281
Thank you.
I was getting very tired. Thank you.

362
00:27:48,453 --> 00:27:50,762
- Who's Warren?
- Hell if I know.

363
00:27:52,813 --> 00:27:56,806
So you have girl troubles.
You're not gettin' dates.

364
00:27:56,893 --> 00:27:59,453
You start thinking "This isn't fair."

365
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:03,811
I felt like I deserved to have someone.
Everyone deserves to have someone.

366
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,932
- So, naturally, you turned to manufacturing.
- Kinda.

367
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:12,291
- How long did it take to build your little toy?
- No, she's not a toy.

368
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:14,933
I know what you think,
but she's more than that.

369
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:17,925
I'm sure she has many
labour-saving attachments.

370
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:21,050
No, I made her to love me.

371
00:28:21,293 --> 00:28:25,047
I mean, she cares about what I care about,
and she wants to be with me.

372
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:30,491
She listens to me and supports me.
I didn't make a toy. I made a girlfriend.

373
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,562
A girlfriend.

374
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:37,328
Are you saying...?
Are you in love with her?

375
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:40,849
I really thought I would be.
I mean, she's perfect.

376
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:45,843
I don't know, I guess it was
too easy, and predictable.

377
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:52,088
She got boring. She was exactly
what I wanted, and I didn't want her.

378
00:28:52,173 --> 00:28:54,641
- I thought I was going crazy.
- Really? You?

379
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,088
Then something happened.

380
00:28:57,173 --> 00:29:01,928
Katrina was in my engineering seminar,
and she was really funny and cool.

381
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:05,722
She was always giving me a hard time -
real unpredictable.

382
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:09,931
She builds these little model monorails
that run with magnets, and...

383
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:13,289
Anyway, I fell in love with Katrina.

384
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:16,723
Swell. Romance and magnetic trains.

385
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:21,489
But first you decided to play with April
for five minutes, and then what?

386
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:25,452
You got bored, decided to dump her,
tell her to go away?

387
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:28,730
- Kinda.
- And she got mad. She didn't go, huh?

388
00:29:28,813 --> 00:29:33,125
OK. I didn't really dump her, as much as
I went out and didn't come back.

389
00:29:33,893 --> 00:29:39,604
- I left her. I left her in my dorm room.
- You left her in your dorm room?

390
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:44,847
I figured I'd just get away until her batteries
gave up, which should've been days ago.

391
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:49,165
Did you even tell her? Did you even
give her a chance to fix what was wrong?

392
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:54,725
I didn't need to. Her batteries were supposed
to run down. They should be dead by now.

393
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:57,646
- So why aren't they?
- I don't know.

394
00:29:57,733 --> 00:30:00,770
I mean, maybe...
she must be recharging them somehow.

395
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:03,925
Warren, this is important. Is she dangerous?

396
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:07,007
She's only programmed to be in love.

397
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:10,051
Then she's dangerous.
Do you have any idea how to find her?

398
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:13,284
She's looking for me.
My guess is she's pretty close.

399
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:19,762
Hi.

400
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:24,653
Do you know where Warren is?
I need to get to Warren.

401
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:28,043
This is getting insane.
How many of you are there?

402
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:30,647
There's only me. April.

403
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:33,725
April. Fine. Listen up, April.

404
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:38,682
Warren is my boyfriend. Mine. And you
others probably ought to figure that out.

405
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:42,084
- Let go.
- Don't go.

406
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,646
- You have to stay and tell the truth.
- What?

407
00:30:47,173 --> 00:30:48,447
Stop!

408
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:54,044
You're lying. He cannot be your boyfriend.
Say that he's my boyfriend.

409
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,572
I can't breathe.

410
00:30:57,653 --> 00:30:59,644
Let go!

411
00:31:00,613 --> 00:31:02,888
You have to stop lying.

412
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:16,083
All right, I'll move on.

413
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,971
April! April, are you there?

414
00:31:19,453 --> 00:31:23,969
- If she hears my voice, then she'll answer.
- She's voice-activated?

415
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:27,762
I made it so that if she heard me
and didn't answer, it causes feedback.

416
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:33,450
If you call her and she doesn't answer,
it hurts her? You're one creepy little dweeb.

417
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:35,046
April!

418
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,725
Warren!

419
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:40,332
- April.
- Where have you been?

420
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:45,168
I couldn't find you, and this girl kept
lying to me, and then she went to sleep.

421
00:31:51,373 --> 00:31:53,568
April, what did you do?

422
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:59,004
Please don't be angry, Warren.
I'm trying very hard to make you happy.

423
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:01,766
April, I want you to put the girl down.

424
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,321
Warren? What should I do?

425
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,641
- Talk to her.
- Put her down.

426
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:11,172
This is Buffy. Give Katrina to Buffy.

427
00:32:14,613 --> 00:32:16,763
Is she broken?

428
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:23,123
- She's alive.
- Thank God.

429
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:28,445
Warren, honey, what's going on?
Why did you go away? Is it a game?

430
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:32,128
- No. No, this isn't a game.
- Did I do something wrong?

431
00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:35,842
I waited a long time
and you never came back. A long time.

432
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:38,766
- I made you five sweaters.
- Great. Go and get them.

433
00:32:38,853 --> 00:32:43,369
- You could wait there, and...
- Warren. You have to tell her. And do it right.

434
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:49,243
What is she saying, Warren?
What do you need to tell me?

435
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:55,207
April, I made a mistake.

436
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:58,683
- You can't make mistakes.
- No, I did.

437
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:05,164
I thought that I made you everything that
I wanted, but it wasn't what I really wanted.

438
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:10,727
I'm sorry, but it's over.

439
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:17,210
But I can be whatever you want. I love you.
I'll do whatever you want. Like a neck rub?

440
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:22,242
No. No. See, I know that you love me,
but the truth is, I can't love you.

441
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:24,929
It's not your fault, but I don't love you.

442
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:30,244
I love her.

443
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:36,090
She growls? You made her so she growls?

444
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:38,164
Well...

445
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:59,722
- What's going on?
- No, no, Trina... Get away.

446
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:11,046
What is...? That's a robot.

447
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:15,445
- She wasn'tjust for sex.
- Is that your ex-girlfriend?

448
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:20,487
- No, get the hell away from me!
- No, no. Trina, no. Trina, wait...

449
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:41,491
You took my man. I'm going to kill you.

450
00:34:42,053 --> 00:34:44,442
I'm going to...

451
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:47,127
I can't crush!

452
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,723
So tired.

453
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:55,562
Warren? Where are you?

454
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,203
What's happening to me?

455
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:10,686
Can you cry? Sometimes I feel better
when I cry. But there might be rust issues.

456
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:14,561
Crying is blackmail.
Good girlfriends don't cry.

457
00:35:17,053 --> 00:35:23,367
I've rechecked everything. I did everything
I was supposed to do. I was a good girlfriend.

458
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:25,843
I'm sure you were.

459
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:28,841
I'm only supposed to love him.

460
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:33,484
If I can't do that, what am I for?
What do I exist for?

461
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:39,688
I don't know.
It isn't fair. He wasn't fair to you.

462
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:44,887
It's getting dark.

463
00:35:44,973 --> 00:35:47,362
It's so early to be dark.

464
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,241
Yeah.

465
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:54,931
What if he comes back
and he can't find me in the dark?

466
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:57,971
I'm here. I'll make sure that he finds you.

467
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,287
Maybe this is a girlfriend test.

468
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:07,922
If I wait here patiently this time,
he'll come back.

469
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:14,126
I'm sure he will.
And he'll tell you how sorry he is.

470
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:20,007
You know, he told me
how proud he was of you and...

471
00:36:20,093 --> 00:36:25,042
how impressed he was with how much you
loved him and how you tried to help him.

472
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,522
He didn't mean to hurt you.

473
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:32,247
He's going to take me home,
and things will be right again.

474
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:35,203
They'll be fine.

475
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:39,802
When things are sad,
you just have to be patient.

476
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:42,965
Because...

477
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:48,048
because every cloud has a silver lining.

478
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:56,082
And when life gives you lemons,
make lemonade.

479
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:00,083
Clouds and lemonade, huh?

480
00:37:00,173 --> 00:37:01,765
Yes.

481
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,289
And...

482
00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:05,806
and...

483
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:11,650
things are always darkest before....

484
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:48,610
You construct the wood jamb
and frame the glass into it,

485
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:52,083
- and that's what you set into the opening.
- Yeah?

486
00:37:52,613 --> 00:37:54,968
One of the cool things about that

487
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:59,763
is the jamb can be shimmed to be square,
even if the opening isn't.

488
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:04,968
Shimmed? Is that even a real word? Do you
have any idea what you're talking about?

489
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:07,521
Yeah, I do. Scary, isn't it?

490
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:12,608
I've turned into someone
you want around after a crazed robot attack.

491
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:17,330
And if you ever start your own business,
you have your slogan right there.

492
00:38:18,013 --> 00:38:20,402
And she wasn't crazed.

493
00:38:20,493 --> 00:38:22,085
Yeah?

494
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:26,926
She devoted everything
to making this one person happy.

495
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:32,645
And then it was, like, with him gone, there
was just no reason for her to exist any more.

496
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:35,122
Robots are the strangest people.

497
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:39,210
No. People are the strangest people.

498
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:43,450
I mean, look at me
obsessing about being with someone.

499
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:46,684
It's like I don't need a guy right now.

500
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:49,769
I need me.

501
00:38:49,853 --> 00:38:53,004
I need to get comfortable
being alone with Buffy.

502
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:58,164
Well, I'll say this,
she's a pretty cool person to be alone with.

503
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,244
Thank you.

504
00:39:12,613 --> 00:39:14,604
Hi, it's Buffy.

505
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:17,810
I hope this is your machine.
There wasn't a message.

506
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:20,885
Anyway, about coffee.

507
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:22,452
I...

508
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:25,923
I just... I don't think this is the best time

509
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:29,323
for me to be drinking coffee.

510
00:39:30,693 --> 00:39:31,887
I'm sorry.

511
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,964
And bye.

512
00:39:36,213 --> 00:39:40,126
- What the hell?
- If I may, Your Inconceivableness.

513
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:45,765
It sounds to these humble ears like our Ben
tried to make a date with the Slayer.

514
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,848
A date with the Slayer?

515
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:56,249
No. No. No, no, no. He is planning something,
he's working against me.

516
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:02,569
She turned us down?

517
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:05,486
Trina? No, wait. Listen. Listen, I'm so sorry.

518
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:11,002
I guess I am s... No, no, just give me
a chance to explain. I... Yes.

519
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:15,052
No, but she... No, no, listen, I'll do anything.
No, don't hang up!

520
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:26,165
- How did you get in here?
- Your mum let me in.

521
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:30,810
- I'm placing an order.
- I'm not making any more girls.

522
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:33,123
Sure you are.

523
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,568
And here's your specs.

524
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:40,133
You're gonna make her real good for me.

525
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:46,244
Hey, Mom!

526
00:40:53,293 --> 00:40:56,012
Still a couple of guys gettin' it right.

527
00:40:57,813 --> 00:41:00,008
Hey! Flower-gettin' lady!

528
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:03,127
Want me to pick Dawn up from school?

529
00:41:04,293 --> 00:41:05,487
Mom?

530
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:08,803
What are you doin'?

531
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,565
Mom?

532
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:18,445
Mom?

533
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,925
Mommy?

534
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:56,842
