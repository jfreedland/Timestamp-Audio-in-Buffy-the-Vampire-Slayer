1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:04,214
Freeze! Put your hands up.
Back away from the girl, slowly.

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:06,782
- Look, I didn't do anything.
- Do it! Now.

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:10,143
- This one's dead.
- What about up there?

4
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:14,189
- Xander!
- Get her out of here!

5
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:16,682
Wait. Just see if he's OK! Please!

6
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:23,401
Please, you don't understand.

7
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:25,078
You'd do well
to keep your mouth shut, missy.

8
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:27,081
- But I didn't do anything!
- Why do I find that

9
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:28,929
- so very hard to believe?
- In there!

10
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:31,184
- You know this girl?
- Buffy Summers.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,085
If there's trouble, she's behind it.

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,675
You stupid little troll. You have no idea.

13
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:37,909
Attitude problems. Serious.

14
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,955
I just wanna know
if my friends are OK.

15
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,284
All right, that's enough.

16
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:46,246
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can...

17
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:53,282
Stop! Get down!

18
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,547
All units, we have a fugitive on foot
at the high school.

19
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:04,267
Homicide suspect. Female, blond,
approximately sixteen years old.

20
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:07,067
Suspect is very dangerous.

21
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:03,466
<b>"Becoming"
Part 2</b>

22
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:07,092
<i>Dr. Michaels,
report to 9-1, please.</i>

23
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:38,635
Xander! Oh!

24
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:42,678
I was so worried. I didn't know
if you were OK. The... The cops were...

25
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:46,939
Yeah... I heard 'em chase you out.
I was just comin' out of it.

26
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:50,119
- Souvenir.
- What about the others?

27
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:53,290
Are they OK?

28
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,141
OK. That was about
equal parts protecting me

29
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,445
and copping a feel, right?

30
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:13,051
What is it?

31
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,879
The doctor said it was head trauma.

32
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,144
She can wake up any time, but, um...

33
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,848
the longer it lasts, the...

34
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:33,289
less likely it is.

35
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:37,635
I never should have let her
try to do that curse.

36
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:41,200
Angel must have known.

37
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:52,996
- Where are her parents?
- With relatives in Phoenix.

38
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,403
I gave them a call. They're...

39
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:59,080
- They're getting on a plane back.
- Does Oz know?

40
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:00,999
Oh, man...!

41
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:05,941
I didn't even think. I'll...
I'll call him.

42
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,840
- Hey!
- Hey.

43
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,596
How is she?

44
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:17,259
- The doctor told me that...
- Yeah. We're, uh... still waiting.

45
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:20,145
- You OK?
- I ran.

46
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,591
I think I made it through
three counties before I realized

47
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:25,155
nobody was chasing me.

48
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,285
- Not too brave.
- It was the right thing to do.

49
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:32,080
- Did Giles keep up with you?
- I didn't see Giles.

50
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:35,643
- You mean he's not in the hospital?
- No.

51
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:51,281
Hi, Rupert. I wasn't sure
you were gonna wake up.

52
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:53,657
You had me worried.

53
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:55,391
What do you want?

54
00:04:56,388 --> 00:04:58,806
I wanna torture you.

55
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,495
I used to love it
and it's been a long time.

56
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:04,228
I mean,
the last time I tortured somebody,

57
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:07,867
they didn't even have chain saws.

58
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,543
Oh, yeah. Acathla.

59
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:19,444
He's an even harder guy
to wake up than you are.

60
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:22,935
I mean, I performed the ritual,
said all the right phrases...

61
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,015
Blood on my hand. Got nothing.
Big doughnut hole for my troubles.

62
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:30,261
I figure you know the ritual.
You're pretty up on these things.

63
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,805
You could probably...

64
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:34,395
tell me what I'm doing wrong.

65
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:37,827
But honestly,
I sort of hope you don't.

66
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:42,996
'Cause I really wanna torture you.

67
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:48,452
No. I-i-it's impossible. There...
There's been some terrible mistake.

68
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,542
And you have no idea
where your daughter is?

69
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:54,316
She said was going to her friend,
Willow's house. Maybe she slept over.

70
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,897
- Is that Willow Rosenberg?
- Yes.

71
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:59,985
- Second victim.
- What?

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,435
Your daughter has
a history of violence,

73
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,512
doesn't she, Ms Summers?

74
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:06,741
Well...

75
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:10,571
You call us, OK?

76
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,123
If she decides to stop by.

77
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:16,085
Be best if she just comes in.

78
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:24,357
Giles! Giles?

79
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:26,937
I don't think he's here.

80
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,907
- Who are you?
- Whistler.

81
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,819
- What are you doing here?
- Waitin' for you.

82
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,762
- Why?
- 'Cause I...

83
00:06:35,787 --> 00:06:38,213
I need a date to the prom.

84
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,119
I have had a really bad day, OK?

85
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:45,598
If you have information worth hearing,
then I am grateful for it.

86
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,719
If you're gonna crack jokes,
then I'm gonna pull out your ribcage

87
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:51,640
- and wear it as a hat.
- Hello to the imagery! Very nice.

88
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:56,095
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

89
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,829
Nobody saw you coming.
I figured this for Angel's big day.

90
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,165
But I thought
he was here to stop Acathla.

91
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,726
Not to bring him forth.

92
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:09,071
Then you two made with the smoochies,

93
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,245
and now he's a creep again.

94
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:13,749
And what are you gonna do?

95
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:17,612
- Or what are you prepared to do?
- Whatever I have to.

96
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,371
Maybe I should ask
what are you... prepared to give up?

97
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,785
You don't have anything useful
to tell me, do you?

98
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:25,406
What are you,
just some immortal demon

99
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:27,720
sent down to even the score
between good and evil?

100
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:30,617
Wow! Good guess.

101
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,010
Well, why don't you try
getting off your immortal ass

102
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,938
and fighting evil once in a while? 'Cause
I'm sick and tired of doing it myself.

103
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,385
In the end, you're always by yourself.

104
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,666
You're all you've got.
That's the point.

105
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,273
- Spare me.
- The sword isn't enough!

106
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,376
You gotta be ready.
You gotta know how to use it!

107
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:07,724
Hold it right there!
Put your hands on your head! Do it!

108
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,548
Hello, cutie.

109
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:29,520
Ugh! Will you hold on a second?!

110
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,641
Hey! White flag here. I quit.

111
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,593
Let me clear this up for you.
We're mortal enemies.

112
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:37,498
- We don't get time-outs.
- You wanna go a round, pet,

113
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,750
I'll have a gay old time of it.
You want to stop Angel...

114
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:43,138
we're gonna have to play this
a bit differently.

115
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:45,436
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about your ex, pet.

116
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:49,108
I'm talking about putting him
in the bloody ground.

117
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:53,924
This has gotta be the lamest trick
you, guys, have ever thought up!

118
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:56,349
He's got your watcher.

119
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:59,073
Right now,
he's probably torturing him.

120
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:01,689
- What do you want?
- I told you.

121
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:03,536
I want to stop Angel.

122
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:06,406
I want to save the world.

123
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:08,762
OK, you do remember
that you're a vampire, right?

124
00:09:08,812 --> 00:09:12,283
We like to talk big. Vampires do.

125
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,920
"I'm going to destroy the world."

126
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:17,136
It's just tough-guy talk.

127
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:20,724
Struttin' around with your friends
over a... pint of blood.

128
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,428
The truth is, I like this world.

129
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:25,009
You've got...

130
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:28,441
dog racing, Manchester United...

131
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,361
and you've got people.

132
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:35,928
Billions of people walking around
like Happy Meals with legs.

133
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:38,410
It's all right here.

134
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:45,374
But then, someone
comes along with the vision.

135
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:47,580
With a real...

136
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:50,241
passion for destruction.

137
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:54,156
Angel could pull it off.

138
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:57,242
Goodbye Piccadilly,
farewell Leicester bloody Square.

139
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:58,963
You know what I'm saying?

140
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:03,505
OK, fine. You're not down with Angel.

141
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,961
Why would you ever come to me?

142
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:09,589
I want Dru back.

143
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:13,116
I want it like it was
before he came back.

144
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:16,748
- The way she acts around him...
- You're pathetic.

145
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:19,702
I lost a friend tonight!

146
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:21,713
- I wasn't in on that raiding party!
- And I may lose more!

147
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,346
The whole Earth
may be sucked into Hell,

148
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,174
and you want my help
'cause your girlfriend's a big ho?

149
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:28,552
Well, let me take this opportunity
to not care.

150
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,582
I can't fight them both alone
and neither can you!

151
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:39,075
- I hate you.
- And I'm all you've got.

152
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,607
All right. Talk.

153
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,114
- I just need to kill this guy.
- Ahem!

154
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:51,966
- Oh, right.
- Let's get inside.

155
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,764
- Do you want some coffee?
- I don't wanna leave.

156
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,346
She might, uh...

157
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,333
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.

158
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:24,164
Come on, Will.

159
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,002
Look, you don't have a choice here.

160
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,030
You gotta wake up.

161
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,399
I need you, Will.

162
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,378
I mean, how am I gonna
pass trig, you know?

163
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:43,264
And who am I gonna call every night...

164
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,443
and talk about
everything we did all day?

165
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:52,165
You're my best friend.

166
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:54,925
You've always...

167
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:04,243
I love you.

168
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,648
Willow?

169
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:17,607
Oz?

170
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:20,389
Oz?

171
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:22,920
I'm here.

172
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,956
She's just starting to wake up.

173
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:30,596
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

174
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,194
I'm gonna go get a doctor.

175
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,642
How're you feelin'?

176
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:40,920
My head... feels big.

177
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:43,557
Is it big?

178
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,794
No, it's head-sized.

179
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:58,046
Is everybody else OK?

180
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:17,641
Rupert, buddy...

181
00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:23,073
I'm here to tell you, I'm impressed.

182
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:29,784
Hey. Uh...

183
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:32,156
How you holdin' up?

184
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:37,161
Never... better!

185
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:40,131
Glad to hear it.

186
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:47,671
Now...

187
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:52,243
Tell me when it hurts.

188
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:05,298
Buffy?

189
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:11,029
Where have you been? Are you OK?

190
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:13,049
The police were here!
I've been looking for you!

191
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:15,008
You know, Mom, let's,
let's go inside and I can explain.

192
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,603
Who is this man? Who are you?

193
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,381
- Are you OK?
- Mom! I'm, I'm OK.

194
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,850
Buffy, terrible things have happened.
What were you doing?!

195
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:24,803
- What? Your mom doesn't know?
- Know what?

196
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,976
That I'm, uh... in a band.

197
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,846
A-a rock band with Spike here.

198
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:33,948
- Right. She plays the, the triangle.
- Drums.

199
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,477
Drums, yeah. She's, uh,
hell on the old skins, you know.

200
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:40,265
- Mm. And, uh, what do you do?
- Well, I sing.

201
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:44,615
You know what? Why don't we go inside,
and, and we can talk about this?

202
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:48,061
I'm, I'm not sure
how I feel about this.

203
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:07,960
- One of Angel's boys.
- Yeah, probably watching me. Or you.

204
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:11,081
Yeah, he won't get a chance
to tattle on us now.

205
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,752
Buffy...

206
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:15,653
What is going on?

207
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,878
Mom...

208
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:30,323
I'm a vampire slayer.

209
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,781
I'm OK, Buffy. Really.

210
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:41,945
I mean, I don't feel good, but...

211
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,473
I'm awake and I know my name, and
who's President, and how many fingers.

212
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:51,369
So, they don't think my brain
got mushed at all.

213
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,947
Thank God.
I'm so sorry I can't be there.

214
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:56,530
I know.

215
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:58,859
I'm sorry I didn't get to cure Angel.

216
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,114
Don't be. It just wasn't meant to be.

217
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:05,401
I know I'm never gonna get him back
the way he was.

218
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:08,225
- It just makes it easier.
- I guess.

219
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:11,198
- Any luck finding Giles?
- Yep.

220
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:13,775
- I got a lucky break.
- What?

221
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,697
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

222
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,486
Xander, Angel and the others
are holed up outside town.

223
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:34,421
You remember that funky-looking mansion
you showed me that time?

224
00:16:34,436 --> 00:16:37,817
On Crawford Street, sure.
That makes sense. What's the drill?

225
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:41,007
- I'm gonna hit it come daybreak.
- You'll need backup.

226
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,427
No. You stay there. I'm covered.

227
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:45,640
Do you, um...

228
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:49,393
Do you think Giles is still alive?

229
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:51,753
I think he is.

230
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:54,678
I just wish he was here
to tell me what to do.

231
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:04,924
Have we met?

232
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:08,224
Er... You hit me with an axe one time.

233
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,833
Remember, uh,
"Get the hell away from my daughter"?

234
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:13,704
Oh.

235
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,615
So, do you, uh... live here in town?

236
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:26,382
- Is Willow all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

237
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,142
- All right, talk. What's the deal?
- Simple.

238
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:34,222
You let me and Dru skip town,
I help you kill Angel.

239
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:36,713
- Angel, your boyfriend?
- Forget about Drusilla.

240
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:39,266
- She doesn't walk.
- There's no deal without Dru.

241
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:43,022
- She killed Kendra.
- Dru bagged a slayer?!

242
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,972
She didn't tell me! Hey, good for her.

243
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:50,531
Though not from your perspective,
I suppose.

244
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:52,563
I can't believe
I invited you into my house.

245
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:56,234
- So, you didn't kill that girl?
- Of course not.

246
00:17:56,294 --> 00:17:58,639
Did she explode
like that man out there?

247
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:00,432
She was a slayer, Mom.

248
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,336
Like what you are?

249
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:08,642
Look... this deal works only one way.
Full stop. Me and Dru, for Angel.

250
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:11,953
Honey, are you sure
you're a vampire slayer?

251
00:18:11,978 --> 00:18:13,746
I'll take her out of the country.

252
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:17,329
You'll never hear from us again,
I bloody well hope.

253
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:21,067
Fine. Get back to the mansion,
make sure Giles is all right.

254
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,347
I, I mean, have you tried
not being a slayer?

255
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:24,957
Mom!

256
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,712
Be ready to back me up
when I make my move.

257
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:30,912
If Giles dies...

258
00:18:31,755 --> 00:18:33,965
she dies.

259
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:39,275
It's because you didn't have
a strong father figure, isn't it?

260
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:43,017
It's just fate, Mom.
I'm the Slayer. Accept it.

261
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:46,390
- We should call the police.
- No! We're not calling the police.

262
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:48,161
Well, now that we know
that you're innocent,

263
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:50,068
- it's...
- What? You thought I was guilty?

264
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:54,217
- Jeez, feelin' the love in this room.
- No, I didn't think that. It's just...

265
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:58,374
- now we have proof.
- We have my word, Mom, not proof.

266
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:01,332
Look, I am sure
that they will understand.

267
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,199
Get them involved,
you'll get them killed.

268
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:05,297
Well, you're not gonna
hurt them, are you?

269
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:07,556
I'm a slayer, not a postal worker.

270
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:10,643
Cops can't fight demons.
I have to do it.

271
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:15,364
- Do what? Buffy, what is happening?
- Just have another drink.

272
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:17,304
Don't you talk to me that way!

273
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:20,476
You don't get to just dump something
like this on me and pretend it's nothing!

274
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:22,659
I'm sorry, mum,
but I don't have time for this.

275
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:25,097
No, I am tired of
"I don't have time" or...

276
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:28,109
"You wouldn't understand".
I am your mother

277
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:31,149
and you will make time to explain yourself.

278
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:36,185
- I told you. I'm a vampire slayer.
- Well, I just don't accept that!

279
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:41,079
Open your eyes, Mom. What do you think
has been going on for the past two years?

280
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,637
The fights, the weird occurrences.
How many times have you

281
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:47,095
washed blood out of my clothing,
and you still haven't figured it out?

282
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,427
- Well, it stops now!
- No, it doesn't stop! It never stops!

283
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:54,006
Do... do you think
I chose to be like this?

284
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:57,508
Do you have any idea how lonely it is?
How dangerous?

285
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:02,640
I would love to be upstairs watching TV,
or gossiping about boys, or...

286
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:07,778
God, even studying!
But I have to save the world. Again!

287
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,087
No, this is insane.
Buffy, you need help.

288
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:12,110
I'm not crazy!

289
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:15,779
What I need is for you to chill.
I have to go!

290
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:17,881
No. I am not letting you
out of this house.

291
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:20,943
- You can't stop me.
- Oh yes, I...

292
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:27,489
You walk out of this house,
don't even think about coming back!

293
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:45,104
So, Buffy's going
for the big showdown, huh?

294
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:48,171
Wish we could help.
You know, without dying.

295
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:51,043
- I don't see how.
- I wanna try again.

296
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:54,477
- Try what?
- The curse. We never got to finish it.

297
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,534
- Maybe we can restore Angel's soul.
- I don't like it.

298
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:00,712
You're talking about messing
with powerful magic, and you're weak.

299
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:04,534
- I'm OK.
- You don't look OK. Does she?

300
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:08,789
You should listen to him.
The hair, it's so flat. And the lips...

301
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:11,704
- Could we stay on topic here, honey?
- What?

302
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:15,254
- Look, it's not a good idea.
- There's no use arguing with me.

303
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:17,591
Do you see my resolve face?

304
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:20,167
You've seen it before -
you know what it means.

305
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,489
This can help Buffy.
If we turn Angel back soon enough,

306
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:27,263
we can stop him
from ever awakening Acathla.

307
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:30,528
OK, I pretty much missed out
on some stuff, didn't I? Because...

308
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:33,781
this is all making a kind of sense
that's... not.

309
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,549
Go with Cordy to the library
and get my things. She'll fill you in.

310
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:39,769
Sure.

311
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:42,195
I'll drive.

312
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,966
Xander, go to Buffy.
Tell her what we're doing.

313
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:47,283
- Maybe she can stall.
- But I...

314
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:49,780
Resolve face.

315
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,992
Be careful.

316
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,013
You know, I can stop the pain.

317
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:01,180
You've been very brave...

318
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:03,163
but it's over.

319
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,602
You've given enough.

320
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:10,030
Now let me make it stop.

321
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:14,800
Please.

322
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:20,800
Just tell me what I need to know.

323
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:28,002
In order to...

324
00:22:28,283 --> 00:22:30,577
to be worthy...

325
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:33,866
you must perform the ritual...

326
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:37,075
in a tutu.

327
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:39,695
Pillock!

328
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:42,976
All right. Someone get the chain saw.

329
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:45,175
Now, now, don't let's lose our temper.

330
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:47,319
Keep out of it, Sit 'n' Spin.

331
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,204
Look, you cut him up,
you'll never get your answers.

332
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,077
Since when did you become
so level-headed?

333
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:55,332
Right about the time
you became so pig-headed.

334
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:58,070
You have your way with him,
you'll never get to destroy the world

335
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:02,170
and I don't fancy spending the next month
trying to get librarian out of the carpet.

336
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:05,218
- There are other ways.
- Enlighten me.

337
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:08,839
Drusilla? Sweetheart?

338
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:17,912
Do you want to play a game?

339
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:49,356
You do know this is a crime scene,
don't you?

340
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:54,935
But then, you're a criminal,
so that pretty much works out.

341
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:59,207
You know I didn't do it.
The police will figure it out.

342
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:02,074
In case you haven't noticed,
the police of Sunnydale

343
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,278
are deeply stupid.

344
00:24:06,248 --> 00:24:09,805
It doesn't matter anyway.
Whatever they find...

345
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:13,724
you've proved too much
of a liability for this school.

346
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:16,789
These are the moments you savor.

347
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:19,039
You wish time would stop,
so that you could live them

348
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:21,540
over and over again.

349
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:24,660
You're expelled.

350
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:35,026
You never ever got a single date
in high school, did you?

351
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:37,618
Your point being?

352
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:54,978
It's Snyder.

353
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:58,837
Tell the mayor I have good news.

354
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:06,933
Is that better?

355
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:14,617
Poor thing.

356
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:19,396
Let's see what's inside.

357
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:26,352
Of course.

358
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:32,409
Look at me.

359
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:42,146
Be... in me.

360
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:48,916
Mmm... See with your heart.

361
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:04,741
Jenny!

362
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,657
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Shhh

363
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,174
I'll never leave you.

364
00:26:14,793 --> 00:26:18,968
- We have to get out of here.
- No, no, no, no, no. Slowly.

365
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,220
It can't be you.

366
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:36,237
Did you tell Angel?

367
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:38,524
About the ritual?

368
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,402
No.

369
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,614
We have to get...
him away from Acathla.

370
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,017
- Why? Is he close to figuring it out?
- Later.

371
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:54,536
Tell me what to do.

372
00:26:57,632 --> 00:26:59,827
It's all right.

373
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:03,867
We'll be together.

374
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:06,252
Finally.

375
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,461
We'll have everything
we never got to have.

376
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:16,112
Never got to feel.

377
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:20,799
Just tell me what to do.

378
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:24,886
We have to get Angel
away from Acathla.

379
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,734
Angel himself?

380
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:35,424
- He's the key?
- His... his blood.

381
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:38,540
- He... he mustn't...
- Shhh.

382
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:56,870
Blood. Of course! The blood
on my hands must be my own.

383
00:27:56,905 --> 00:28:02,095
I am the key that will open up the door.
My blood. My life.

384
00:28:03,977 --> 00:28:07,801
- OK, kill him.
- But what if he's lying?

385
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:11,403
Yeah. Good point.
All right, don't kill him.

386
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:14,575
You know?
I kinda like having you watch my back.

387
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:16,884
It's kinda like old times.

388
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:21,127
Uh, Drusilla?

389
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,349
- Honey?
- We are finished here, ducks.

390
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,149
Sorry.

391
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:38,311
I was in the moment.

392
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,165
Whistler.

393
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,407
What did you mean,
"The sword isn't enough?"

394
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,562
You know, raidin' an Englishman's fridge
is like dating a nun.

395
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,541
You're never gonna get the good stuff.

396
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,522
Tell me how to use it.

397
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:06,756
Angel's the key.

398
00:29:09,426 --> 00:29:11,678
His blood will open the door to Hell.

399
00:29:11,928 --> 00:29:16,099
Acathla opens his big mouth,
creates a vortex.

400
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:18,613
Then only Angel's blood will close it.

401
00:29:18,614 --> 00:29:22,178
One blow'll
send 'em both back to Hell.

402
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:25,692
But I strongly suggest that
you get there before that happens.

403
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:28,507
'Cause the faster you kill Angel,
the easier it's gonna be on you.

404
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:30,071
Don't worry about me.

405
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:33,764
- It's all on the line here, kid.
- I can deal.

406
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:37,098
I got nothin' left to lose.

407
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:41,934
Wrong, kid.

408
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:44,769
You got one more thing.

409
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:15,214
- Xander?
- The cavalry's here.

410
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:18,292
The cavalry's a frightened guy
with a rock, but it's here.

411
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,530
- That's better.
- You're not here to fight.

412
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:25,706
You get Giles out and run like hell.
Understood?

413
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:28,537
I can't protect you.
I'm gonna be too busy killing.

414
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:32,077
- You know, that's a new look for you.
- It's a present for Angel.

415
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:35,934
Willow, uh...
She... told me to tell you...

416
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,180
Tell me what?

417
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:43,005
Kick his ass.

418
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:52,834
<i>Acathla, mundatus sum.
(Acathla, I am cleansed)</i>

419
00:30:53,303 --> 00:30:55,180
<i>Pro te necavi.
(Before you, I have killed)</i>

420
00:30:55,215 --> 00:31:00,058
<i>Sanguinem meum pro te effundam...
(My blood flowing before you)</i>

421
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:05,146
<i>quo me dignum... esse demonstram.
(which shows I am worthy)</i>

422
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:09,023
- Are we ready?
- Stinky herbs are go!

423
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,587
Did I mention I didn't take Latin?

424
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:14,602
Y-you don't have to understand it.
You just have to say it.

425
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:17,251
- I hope.
- Right.

426
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:22,530
Now, Acathla...

427
00:31:22,874 --> 00:31:25,802
you will be free.

428
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:30,478
And so will we all.

429
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:43,171
- Hello, lover.
- I don't have time for you.

430
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:45,265
You don't have a lot of time left.

431
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:47,219
Coming on kinda strong,
don't you think?

432
00:31:47,254 --> 00:31:49,720
You're playing some deep odds here.
Do you really think

433
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:53,175
- you can take us all on?
- No. I don't.

434
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:10,588
Painful, isn't it?

435
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:32,068
I don't wanna hurt you, baby.

436
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:36,656
Doesn't mean I won't.

437
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,202
<i>Quod perditum est...
(What is lost...)</i>

438
00:32:41,703 --> 00:32:43,370
<i>invenietur!
(let it be restored!)</i>

439
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:46,398
Not dead, nor not of the living.

440
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:49,721
Spirits of the interregnum, I call.

441
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:53,914
Giles! Giles!

442
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:56,034
Xander?

443
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:59,422
- Can you walk?
- You're not real.

444
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:02,348
- Sure I'm real.
- It's a trick.

445
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:06,241
They get inside my head,
make me see things I want.

446
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:10,039
Then why would they make you see me?

447
00:33:10,582 --> 00:33:12,542
You're right. Let's go.

448
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:16,036
Come on.

449
00:33:42,914 --> 00:33:45,884
Ooh! Here he comes.

450
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:51,886
Gods, bind him, cast his heart...

451
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,648
from the...

452
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:55,421
evil...

453
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:57,010
realm.

454
00:33:58,755 --> 00:34:01,794
- You almost made it, Buff.
- It's not over yet.

455
00:34:01,883 --> 00:34:06,317
My boy, Acathla here, is about to wake up.
You're going to Hell.

456
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:09,471
Save me a seat.

457
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:52,973
In return...

458
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,185
I call on...

459
00:34:57,564 --> 00:35:00,149
- Willow?
- Are you OK?

460
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:03,941
<i>Te implor Doamne,
(I call on you, Gods,)</i>

461
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:07,270
<i>nu ignora accasta rugaminte!
(do not ignore this supplication!)</i>

462
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:11,447
- Is this a good thing?
<i>- Nici mort, nici al fiintei...</i>

463
00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:13,466
- Hey... speak English!
<i>- Lasa orbita sa fie vasul care-i</i>

464
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:17,547
<i>va transporta, sufletul la el.
(...carry his soul to him.)</i>

465
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,403
Sorry, baby.
I wish there was another way.

466
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:50,097
God, he's gonna kill her.

467
00:35:56,798 --> 00:35:59,340
That's everything, huh?

468
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:01,358
No weapons...

469
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,662
no friends...

470
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:05,691
no hope.

471
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:08,592
Take all that away...

472
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:10,826
and what's left?

473
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,399
Me.

474
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,951
<i>Asa sa fie! Asa sa fie! Acum!
(So shall it be! So shall it be! Now!)</i>

475
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,768
<i>Acum! (Now!)</i>

476
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:24,676
Buffy?

477
00:37:29,391 --> 00:37:32,045
What's going on?

478
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:45,060
Where are we?
I... I don't remember.

479
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,860
Angel?

480
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,078
You're hurt.

481
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:05,860
Oh, Buffy! God...

482
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:10,045
I... feel like
I haven't seen you in months.

483
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:12,889
Oh, God, everything's so muddled, I...

484
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:18,433
Oh, Buffy.

485
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,475
- What's happening?
- Shh.

486
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:40,490
Don't worry about it.

487
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:06,120
- I love you.
- I love you.

488
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,152
Close your eyes.

489
00:39:39,195 --> 00:39:41,239
Buffy?

490
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:02,042

505
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:12,249
are you sure
you should be out of bed?

506
00:41:12,322 --> 00:41:14,952
- Look who's talking.
- Yes.

507
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:18,498
- Any word?
- You guys haven't seen her, either?

508
00:41:18,578 --> 00:41:21,144
- No.
- But we know the world didn't end,

509
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,696
'cause... check it out.

510
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,299
Well, we, uh...

511
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,970
we went back to the mansion.
It... it was empty.

512
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:30,737
Um... and Acathla was, was dormant.

513
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:32,899
I think the spell worked.

514
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,644
I felt something... go through me.

515
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,825
Plus, the orb did that...
cool glow thing.

516
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,534
Well, maybe it wasn't in time.

517
00:41:40,535 --> 00:41:42,904
Maybe she had to kill him
before the cure could work.

518
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:44,625
Well, then, she'd wanna be alone,
I guess.

519
00:41:44,754 --> 00:41:48,527
Or maybe Angel was saved
and they want to be alone together.

520
00:41:48,608 --> 00:41:50,695
- Perhaps.
- Well,

521
00:41:50,696 --> 00:41:52,485
she's gotta show up sooner or later.

522
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,384
- We still have school.
- Yeah.

523
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,425
She'll be here in a while.

524
00:41:57,493 --> 00:42:01,402

00:42:01,746 --> 00:42:05,805
