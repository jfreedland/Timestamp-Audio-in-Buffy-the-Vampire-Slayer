<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:06,273
You seem determined
to put an end to all my fun,

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:08,673
just like you always did when we were dating.

4
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:11,723
- You dated a troll?
- Well, he wasn't a troll then!

5
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:13,233
He was just a big, dumb guy.

6
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:15,553
- Where is everyone?
- At the new high school.

7
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:18,953
Buffy's got some job there.
Spike's insane in the basement.

8
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:20,943
- Willow?
- There you are!

9
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:23,633
But we're really glad you're back.

10
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:27,033
Did you turn this nice lady's ex
into a giant worm monster?

11
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,533
<i>(laughs)</i> Yes.

12
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:32,653
I got the impression
that you enjoyed inflicting.

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,113
Causing pain sounds really cool, but...

14
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:38,063
turns out it's really upsetting.
Didn't use to be.

15
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:41,513
It's the talk of the Order.
They're calling you Miss Soft Serve.

16
00:00:41,513 --> 00:00:44,113
- Excuse me?
- No deaths. No eviscerations.

17
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:47,093
You're not goading women
into anything inventive.

18
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:50,203
It was a glitch.
I am so back in the vengeance fold.

19
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:57,673
My advice is: do exactly
what everyone else does all the time.

20
00:00:57,673 --> 00:00:58,523
Got it.

21
00:00:58,753 --> 00:01:02,553
Do what everyone else does,
wear what they wear, say what they say.

22
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:03,243
OK.

23
00:01:03,993 --> 00:01:06,353
People may say things you don't understand.

24
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:09,753
Don't be afraid to keep your mouth shut
and pretend you do.

25
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:12,233
Dawn, I've been to college before.

26
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:15,333
People may say
"My protein window closes in an hour."

27
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,353
Just nod and smile. Mm-hm.

28
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:20,953
It has something to do with fitness.

29
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:24,633
- <i>(Buffy)</i> Have you talked to her?
- Not since the Gnarl demon night.

30
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:28,033
And that wasn't exactly
the "How have you been?" kind of talking.

31
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:31,753
More of the "Pierce its eye
with something sharp" kind of talking.

32
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:35,903
- I'm thinking I should call her.
- I don't want you to get your hopes up.

33
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:37,713
Hopes? Oh, no, no, no, no.

34
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:40,893
There are no hopes. Anya and I are done.

35
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:43,993
I love being single.
I'm a strong, successful male

36
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:48,033
who's giddy at the thought of all the women
I will be dating in the near future.

37
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,383
Strong, successful males say "giddy"?

38
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:54,333
- I just worry about her, that's all.
- Anya?

39
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:57,043
Yeah, she seems so sad.

40
00:01:57,273 --> 00:01:59,953
She should try acting
like everybody else more.

41
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,833
Apparently it's what all the kids
are doing nowadays.

42
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,953
Not sure I get the sad vibe, but there is
a vengeance vibe worth worrying about.

43
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:09,603
Oh, that? No, no. I don't worry about that.

44
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:13,723
She was hurt and she just turned back
to what she knew when I...

45
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:16,753
You know. But that's not her any more.

46
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:19,573
I hope you're right.

47
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:23,873
She turned that worm guy back
before any real damage happened, right?

48
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:27,423
lt'll just take some time.
I really think she's coming around.

What have I done?

51
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:49,903
<i>(Spike) I don't trust what I see any more.</i>

52
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:52,853
I don't know how to explain it, exactly.

53
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,783
Like I've been seeing things.

54
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,743
Dru used to see things, you know?

55
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:06,403
She'd always be staring at the sky
watching cherubs burn

56
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,833
or the heavens bleed or some nonsense.

57
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:14,193
I used to stare at her and think
she'd gone completely sack of hammers.

58
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:18,663
But she'd see the sky when we were inside

59
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:21,563
and it'd make her so happy.

60
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:23,843
She'd see showers, she'd see stars.

61
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:29,703
- Now I see <i>her.</i>
- <i>(whispers)</i> Spike.

62
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:32,503
- I'm in trouble, Buffy.
- I can help you.

63
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,243
I could never ask. Not after...

64
00:07:44,553 --> 00:07:46,703
It's different. You're different.

65
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:49,873
I could never ask.

66
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:52,603
Spike, it's me.

67
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:56,133
It's you and it's me,
and we'll get through this.

68
00:07:58,753 --> 00:07:59,553
Never.

69
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,883
We'll get through this.

70
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:16,513
Spike.

71
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:19,743
This basement is killing you.

72
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:23,643
This is the Hellmouth.
There is something bad down here.

73
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,693
Possibly everything bad.

74
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,323
<i>(laughs)</i>

75
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:34,033
- Can't hear you. Can't hear you.
- You have a soul? Fine. Show me.

76
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:37,283
Scream Montresor all you like, pet.

77
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:40,333
Get up and get out of this basement.

78
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:46,663
I don't have anywhere else to go.

79
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:54,833
I've not been gone for that long. I've
already done all the reading I missed...

80
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:57,753
Willow, it's OK.
We'll get you caught up in no time.

81
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:59,803
- Really?
- What am I gonna say?

82
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,593
"No, I don't want my best student
back in my class"?

83
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:06,093
I noticed a drop-off in your grades
at mid-terms last year...

84
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,713
- Yeah...
- But then voilá. You turned it around.

85
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:12,613
- Aced all your finals, like, boom. Magic.
- Yeah, similar to, but...

86
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:15,393
Come see me during office hours tomorrow

87
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:18,873
and we'll see what we need to do
to get you caught up, all right?

88
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:20,473
OK. Thanks, Professor.

89
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:23,703
Anya!

90
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:25,383
Anya!

91
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,213
Willow, hi! What are you doing here?

92
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:32,543
Oh, I'm starting back up at school again!

93
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:36,153
Yeah, I can't believe
how great everyone's been.

94
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:39,153
I was worried, but I already
have books and homework

95
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:43,803
and they'll give me periodic surprise quizzes
just to make up for the ones I missed.

96
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,933
What... What are you doing here,

97
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:52,613
walking out of the fraternity house
in the middle of the day?

98
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,183
Um...

99
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,513
I have a new boyfriend now. He lives here.

100
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:01,893
- That's great!
- Yeah, we just had lots and lots of sex.

101
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:03,443
OK.

102
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,603
This is so great.
I am so happy to see you've...

103
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:12,873
- moved on.
- Yes, we're tremendously happy together.

104
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:16,423
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for something... important.

105
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:18,753
OK. See you later.

106
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:31,353
Hello?

107
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:34,463
Is anybody...

108
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:02,583
<i>(girl sobbing)</i> I take it back. I take it back.

109
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,483
I take it back. I take it back.

110
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,803
I take it back. I take it back.

111
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,803
I take it back. I take it back.

112
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,883
I take it back. I take it back.

113
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:20,923
I take it back.

114
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:23,963
I take it back. I take it back.

115
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:27,673
- I take it back.
- It's OK. You're OK.

116
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,133
- I take it back.
- What do you take back? What happened?

117
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,833
It was gonna be a party.
Everyone's gonna be there.

118
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:40,073
Everyone's bringing a date.
I'll have a great time.

119
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,283
But it was just me.

120
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:45,063
And them.

121
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,023
He broke up with me in front of them.

122
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,783
It was a game. It was all a game.

123
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:58,413
- It's OK. You're OK now.
- They laughed.

124
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:02,313
And they laughed and I cried.
And they laughed.

125
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,473
And I yelled "Just once...

126
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:12,613
I wish you could all feel what it's like
to have your hearts ripped out!"

127
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:14,413
"Just once, I wish."

128
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,303
And then it came.

129
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:23,163
OK. Come on, what came?

130
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,083
- What did this?
- A spider.

131
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:30,493
Where did it go?

132
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:35,613
- What do you mean?
- The spider.

133
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:37,853
Where is it now?

134
00:12:48,713 --> 00:12:49,613
Protect!

135
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:56,073
For God's sake,
shut your whimpering mouth!

136
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:10,753
I'm sorry.

137
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:42,923
<i>(angry shouting)</i>

138
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:00,703
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

139
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:05,363
What is that,
a Woodlow Transmogrific spell?

140
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:08,653
- Thornton's Hope.
- Thornton's Hope?

141
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:11,913
But how did you get the troll element?

142
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:14,153
- Eelsbane.
- Eelsbane.

143
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:16,953
Brilliant!

144
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:20,093
- What'd he do?
- Bar matron.

145
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:25,633
- A load-bearing bar matron.
- Is there any other kind?

146
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,963
I'm sorry. How rude of me.
Allow me to introduce myself.

147
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,103
My name is D'Hoffryn.

148
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,383
- I am Aud.
- Are you?

149
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,413
I'm afraid you don't see your true self.

150
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:44,493
You are Anyanka.

151
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,183
I'm a patron of a family of sorts.
We're vengeance demons.

152
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:52,153
- I'm sure you've heard of us.
- No, I'm sorry.

153
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:55,093
- Well, that's quite...
- No, don't feel bad.

154
00:14:56,193 --> 00:15:00,193
I don't talk to people much.
I talk to them, but they don't talk to me.

155
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:03,353
Except to say "Your questions are irksome"

156
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:07,803
and "Take your furs and literal interpretations
to the other side of the river."

157
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:17,903
I sense that your talents are not appreciated
here, Anyanka. We'd like you to join us.

158
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:20,633
Why do you keep calling me that?
My name is Aud.

159
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,933
Perhaps, but Anyanka is who you are.

160
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:27,053
What would I have to do?

161
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:30,733
What you do best.
Help wronged women punish evil men.

162
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,243
- Vengeance.
- But only to those who deserve it.

163
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:43,223
- They all deserve it.
- That's where I was going with that, yeah.

00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:10,243
No, no, no, no, no. It's all good.
I'll get Xander to go. But seriously, you just...

170
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:13,903
Ripped out the heart? My God.

171
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:17,593
Hey, did you get
that physics class you wanted?

172
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:19,693
This is just wonderful, Anyanka!

173
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:23,303
There's even talk of having
some sort of ceremony.

174
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:28,333
I can't tell you how many times today I've
heard "Anyanka is back to her old self again!"

175
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:31,013
Honey, what is it? What's wrong?

176
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:34,323
It's nothing. I just...

177
00:16:36,753 --> 00:16:39,603
There was just so much screaming,
so much blood.

178
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:43,193
I'd forgotten the damage
a Crimslaw demon could do.

179
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:47,893
Oh, tell me about it. They can be feisty
little guys - and impossible to house-train.

180
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,153
Once they start nesting, forget...

181
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:52,903
Are you OK? Oh, did something happen?

182
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:58,583
I guess I'm just a little rusty.
I didn't think it would hit me like this.

183
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:02,433
Oh, sweetie. This is perfectly normal.

184
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:07,513
It's a reflex.
You'll get over it in no time, trust me.

185
00:17:07,913 --> 00:17:10,713
Oh, Hallie! I can't tell you how good it is...

186
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:15,313
- Thank goodness you're here.
- Oh, sweetie. Of course.

187
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:20,033
Lately, with everything that's been going on,
I've had trouble even remembering...

188
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,083
<i>- (door opens)</i>
- Get out.

189
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:25,903
- Lemon drop, if you think I'm gonna...
- Get out.

190
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:29,253
It's OK.

191
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:32,103
Well, OK.

192
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:35,263
If you need anything, you holler.

193
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,333
Anya, you have to stop this.

194
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:47,303
Do you know what they did to her? Do you?

195
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:51,863
It was a game. They were humiliating her.

196
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:55,513
Anya, listen to me.
You're in trouble. You know it.

197
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:59,103
I'm here to help you.

198
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,313
You're here to...? Well, that's great, Willow.

199
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:06,893
Flayed anybody lately, have you?
How quickly they forget!

200
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:09,623
I haven't forgotten one second of it.

201
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:14,153
- What do you want?
- I wanna help you.

202
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:16,803
- They got what they deserved.
- No, they...

203
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:20,063
I'm a vengeance demon.
Do you understand that?

204
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:21,643
- No.
- Try!

205
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,253
They got what they deserved.

206
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:30,873
Thanks. I didn't wanna trouble Willow.

207
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:33,833
Figure she's got enough to do,
first day back and all.

208
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,273
Are you kidding? We're doing vent work.

209
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:39,353
Anything's better
than breathing Freon for eight hours.

210
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:42,873
- She say what this thing is?
- A sort of spider demony thingy.

211
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:46,423
She had to go quickly.
I think she had to sign up for classes.

212
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:50,753
Little can distract the Willow
when she's on the hunt for the mighty syllabi.

213
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:55,053
I don't know. I think she's a little more
nervous than she was letting... on.

214
00:18:56,873 --> 00:18:59,123
How big did she say this thing was?

215
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:03,413
She didn't. But I can't imagine
she'd send us out if it wasn't...

216
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:07,153
The heart's completely ripped out.
This is our guy.

217
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:08,953
Or a copycat spider demon.

218
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:13,023
- So, what's this black stuff?
- I don't know.

219
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,063
- Oh, sticky!
- Willow said it was a spider demon.

220
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:21,873
- Maybe it's its webbing.
- This isn't springy, high-flying fun.

221
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,773
<i>- (rustling)</i>
- Xander.

222
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:30,453
- Is that it?
- I can't tell.

223
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:35,973
- But something's definitely moving up there.
- Maybe we can somehow lure it.

224
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:37,163
Xander!

225
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:47,843
No!

226
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:52,603
You OK?

227
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:57,223
Buffy, where'd it go?

228
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:01,803
- I think we need more swords.
- Uh-huh.

229
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,833
We go home, pick up more swords,
and a spidery-demon protection amulet,

230
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:07,733
we come back, and...

231
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,263
Or...

232
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:17,233
I'm more concerned with where it came from.

233
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:20,183
If there are more running around,
we need to know.

234
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:22,793
We should hit the research, find out if...

235
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,233
I know where it came from.

236
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:28,103
How many?

237
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:32,183
- Ten, twelve.
- When were you planning on telling us?

238
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,823
- I'm telling you now.
- Great. Thank you.

239
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:41,073
Willow, it's Anya. How could you let us...

240
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:43,603
How could you not have told us?

241
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:47,153
- Xander...
- How could you not have told me?

242
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:48,453
Xander. It's OK.

243
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:52,333
She didn't tell us for a reason.

244
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:57,113
She didn't tell us
because she knows what I have to do.

245
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:01,453
I have to kill Anya.

246
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:09,553
<i>(woman giggles)</i>

247
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,673
I swear I'm in awe of you.

248
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,733
- Oh, stop.
- Oh, I will not.

249
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:23,933
I grant wishes. It's all inside the girl.
I just... bring it out.

250
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:28,673
- Yes. I'm sure this is what she had in mind.
- <i>(cannons firing)</i>

251
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:32,153
Well, I don't know about her mind,
but it was in her heart.

252
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:36,033
Besides, Russia was ready to explode.
We just gave it a little push.

253
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:40,033
What should we do now? I hear
they're going to raze the Winter Mansion.

254
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:45,203
We could head down to Madame Dubasov's.
No better spot for vengeance than a brothel.

255
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,633
It's always work, work, work with you.

256
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:50,873
- What else is there?
<i>- (man screaming)</i>

257
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:53,823
What else is there?
Why, the whole world, for one.

258
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:56,983
Darling, take a look around.
There's a lot to see.

259
00:21:57,033 --> 00:22:01,283
There's a revolution going on outside
that you are somewhat responsible for.

260
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:03,963
Aren't you the teeniest bit interested?

261
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:08,073
What is there to be interested in?
The worker will overthrow absolutism

262
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:11,433
and lead the proletariat
to a victorious communist revolution,

263
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:15,533
resulting in socio-economic paradise
on earth. It's common sense, really.

264
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:18,213
I have better things to worry about.

265
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,533
But there's a whole world out there.

266
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:23,433
Yes. Filled with wronged women
who need my help.

267
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:26,583
- You're talking about work.
- I'm talking about life.

268
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:30,123
Vengeance is what I do, Halfrek.
I don't need anything else.

269
00:22:32,193 --> 00:22:33,843
Vengeance is what I am.

270
00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:38,633
She's not the Anya you knew, Xander.
She's a demon.

271
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:42,633
- That doesn't mean you have to kill her.
- Don't act like this is easy for me.

272
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:45,433
- You know it's not.
- There are other options.

273
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,623
I've considered them.

274
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:49,203
When? Just now?

275
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:53,833
Took you all of ten seconds to decide
to kill one of your best friends?

276
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:57,533
The thought that it might come to this
has occurred to me before.

277
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,633
It's occurred to you, too.

278
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:02,363
But we can change what she did. Fix it.

279
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:06,513
These are mystical deaths.
There has to be something.

280
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:10,913
I don't have anywhere near that power.
I didn't have that kind of power when...

281
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:14,753
And I don't think I trust the power I do have.

282
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:15,773
It's OK.

283
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:21,483
Xander, I know this is hard for you to hear,
but it's what I have to do.

284
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:25,803
Hard for me to hear?
Buffy, you wanna kill Anya!

285
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:28,363
- I don't want to.
- Then don't!

286
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:33,403
This isn't new ground. When our friends go
crazy and start killing people, we help them.

287
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:35,663
- Sitting right here.
- I'm sorry.

288
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:37,993
- But it's true.
- It's different.

289
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:40,993
Because you don't care about her
the same way I do.

290
00:23:41,793 --> 00:23:44,043
- Buffy, I still love her.
- I know.

291
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:49,363
And that's why you can't see this
for what it really is.

292
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:52,053
Willow was different. She's a human.

293
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:55,463
- Anya's a demon.
- And you're the Slayer.

294
00:23:57,713 --> 00:23:59,963
I see now how it's all very simple.

295
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:02,203
It is never simple.

296
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,233
No, of course not.

297
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:06,663
You know,

298
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:12,003
if there's a mass-murdering demon that
you're, oh, say, boning, then it's all grey area.

299
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:15,533
- Spike was harmless. He was helping.
- He had no choice.

300
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:18,703
And Anya did!
She chose to become a demon - twice.

301
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:23,683
- You have no idea what she's going through.
- I don't care!

302
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:27,333
No, of course not.
You think we haven't all seen this before?

303
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:29,473
The part where you cut us all out.

304
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:33,173
Just step away from everything human
and act like you're the law.

305
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:35,943
- If you knew what I felt...
- I killed Angel.

306
00:24:39,593 --> 00:24:41,393
Do you even remember that?

307
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:45,603
I would have given up
everything I had to be with...

308
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:51,093
I loved him more than
I will ever love anything in this life.

309
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:55,213
And I put a sword through his heart
because I had to.

310
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:58,003
And that all worked out OK.

311
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,483
Do you remember cheering me on?
Both of you.

312
00:25:03,353 --> 00:25:06,403
Remember giving me Willow's message:
"Kick his ass"?

313
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,873
- I never said that!
- This is different.

314
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:11,773
It is always different! It's always complicated.

315
00:25:13,193 --> 00:25:17,743
And at some point someone has to draw
the line, and that is always going to be me.

316
00:25:18,953 --> 00:25:23,753
You get down on me for cutting myself off,
but in the end the Slayer is always cut off.

317
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:28,983
There's no mystical guidebook.
No all-knowing council.

318
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,493
Human rules don't apply.

319
00:25:33,353 --> 00:25:34,653
There's only me.

320
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:36,863
I am the law.

321
00:25:40,353 --> 00:25:43,453
- There has to be another way.
- Then please find it.

322
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:10,603
I can't. I'm sorry.

323
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:36,053
<i>Beatum sit in nomine D'Hoffrynis.</i>

324
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,233
<i>Fiat hoc spatium...</i>

325
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:47,663
<i>porta ad mundum...</i>

326
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:50,133
<i>Arashmaharis.</i>

327
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:56,753
Behold, D'Hoffryn. Lord of Arashmahar.

328
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,483
He that turns the air to blood and rains...

329
00:27:01,793 --> 00:27:03,043
Miss Rosenberg.

330
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:07,523
How lovely to see you again.
Have you done something with your hair?

331
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:11,213
- Hello, D'Hoffryn.
- I figured I'd be hearing from you soon.

332
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:14,123
The flaying of Warren Meers?
Truly inspired.

333
00:27:15,353 --> 00:27:19,303
That was water-cooler vengeance.
Lloyd has a sketch of it on his wall.

334
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:22,303
- That's not me any more.
- Is that right?

335
00:27:23,313 --> 00:27:26,113
So, I didn't feel your presence earlier today?

336
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:29,043
I didn't feel a bit of the old you?

337
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:31,803
We need to talk about Anya.

338
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:33,803
<i>(groans)</i>

339
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:37,733
Very well. Let's talk about Anyanka.

340
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:49,403
- <i>(door opens)</i>
- <i>(Xander)</i> I thought I might find you here.

341
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:52,673
Have you forced yourself
to look at the bodies yet?

342
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:55,233
- What do you want?
- I wanna help you.

343
00:27:56,153 --> 00:28:00,353
Everyone is so considerate today.
I should've slaughtered people weeks ago.

344
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:06,873
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything
I did to you, everything I put you through.

345
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:10,613
Thank you. All better!
Thank goodness you got here in time(!)

346
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:15,493
You don't understand. This isn't
an intervention. Buffy's coming to kill you.

347
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:21,153
- She's coming to try.
- Did everyone have their crazy flakes today?

348
00:28:21,153 --> 00:28:26,003
- You're friends. How could you talk like this?
- I have a job to do. And so does Buffy.

349
00:28:26,993 --> 00:28:29,743
Xander, you've always seen
what you wanted to.

350
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:33,773
But she knew, sooner or later,
it would come to this.

351
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,753
- Buffy, get out of here.
- Get out of my way, Xander.

352
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:41,953
- No.
- Get out of her way, Xander.

353
00:28:47,313 --> 00:28:52,513
This is getting to be a pattern. Are there any
friends of yours left you haven't tried to kill?

354
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:03,103
Come on, Buffy.
Don't you have a clever retort for me?

355
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:35,223
- Anya, I'm sorry.
- You're apologising to me?

356
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,283
What fight are <i>you</i> watching?

357
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:44,603
Or is this one of your little pop-culture
references I don't get, cos I'm a vengeance...

358
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:00,403
I just want... happy...

359
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:03,763
ending.

360
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:06,753
Honey?

361
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:09,413
- Honey?
- Wha...

362
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,353
I'm awake. I'm OK.

363
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:15,713
Honey, was that weird?

364
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:20,133
That thing earlier with the singing.

365
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,353
- The coconuts.
- What?

366
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,233
No. It's fine.

367

Anya!

417
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:37,813
Forgotten how much
swords through the chest hurt.

418
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,283
Aarghh!

419
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:49,423
You know better than that, Buffy.

420
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:53,233
It takes a lot more to kill a vengeance demon.

421
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,183
Oh, I'm just getting started.

422
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:17,243
Stop trying to save me, Xander!

423
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:27,443
Please, don't mind me. Continue
with whatever it was you were doing.

424
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,503
Oh! Breathtaking.

425
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:39,083
It's like somebody slaughtered
an Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue.

426
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:42,023
Easy, now.
I'd be gone before you could swing.

427
00:34:44,953 --> 00:34:46,903
Isn't that just like a slayer?

428
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:51,113
Solving all her problems
by sticking things with sharp objects.

429
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:57,023
I talked to your friend Miss Rosenberg.
She's a firebrand.

430
00:34:57,993 --> 00:35:01,093
- I have high hopes for her.
- Stay away from Willow.

431
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:03,203
Oh, he's gallant, isn't he?

432
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:05,583
I understand what you saw in him.

433
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:10,883
Miss Rosenberg thinks Anyanka would be
better suited outside the vengeance fold.

434
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:14,613
I think we already know
what Lady "Hacks-Away" wants.

435
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:17,773
And the young man,
he sees with the eyeballs of love.

436
00:35:18,593 --> 00:35:23,243
But I'm not sure if anyone's bothered
to find out what Anyanka herself really wants.

437
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:27,053
- Her name is Anya.
- Actually, funny historical sidebar:

438
00:35:27,513 --> 00:35:31,163
- her original name was...
- <i>(Anya)</i> I wanna take it back.

439
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:33,623
I'm sorry. What was that?

440
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,143
I wanna take it back.

441
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:41,373
I wanna undo what I did.

442
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:45,073
Hmm. You want to take it back.

443
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,803
Must be 12 bodies in there.
Such a thing... not easily done.

444
00:35:53,513 --> 00:35:54,963
But not impossible.

445
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,073
You're a big girl, Anyanka.
You understand how this works.

446
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,323
The proverbial scales must balance.

447
00:36:01,553 --> 00:36:05,803
In order to restore the lives of the victims,
the Fates require a sacrifice.

448
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:09,163
The life and soul of a vengeance demon.

449
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:13,963
- Do it.
- Wait!

450
00:36:14,193 --> 00:36:16,643
- Stay out of this, Xander.
- OK, right.

451
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:20,683
That seems smart -
he just said you have to die!

452
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:24,383
Perhaps there's some sort of alternate price?

453
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:26,953
Xander, you can't help me.

454
00:36:30,953 --> 00:36:33,403
I'm not even sure there's a me to help.

455
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:39,353
I understand the price. Do it.

456
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:43,203
You're sure? This is your wish?

457
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,133
This is my wish.

458
00:36:49,553 --> 00:36:50,853
Undo what I did.

459
00:36:53,193 --> 00:36:54,193
Very well.

460
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:55,683
No!

461
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:02,223
Anya.

462
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:06,743
- Hallie?
- Aargh!

463
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:20,953
Who did you think you were dealing with?
Did you think it'd be that easy to get away?

464
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:22,103
- Why?
- Why?!

465
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:25,453
- Because you wished it!
- But she was yours.

466
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:27,783
The way <i>you</i> were mine?

467
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:30,373
Haven't I taught you anything, Anya?

468
00:37:30,473 --> 00:37:33,473
Never go for the kill
when you can go for the pain.

469
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:37,163
Hold him back, Slayer.
Wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.

470
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:42,243
I've got plenty of girls.
There will always be vengeance demons.

471
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:44,633
But now you, Anya, you're out.

472
00:37:45,993 --> 00:37:48,393
Congratulations. Your wish is granted.

473
00:37:48,953 --> 00:37:50,653
You should've killed me.

474
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:54,293
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

475
00:37:55,193 --> 00:37:57,143
From beneath you, it devours.

476
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,453
Be patient. All good things in time.

477
00:38:19,953 --> 00:38:21,803
Go. I'll check on the boys.

478
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:31,323
Anya, wait.

479
00:38:32,873 --> 00:38:34,823
Xander, please, just go away.

480
00:38:36,793 --> 00:38:39,443
Whatever's between us... it doesn't matter.

481
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,483
You shouldn't be alone in this.

482
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:46,393
Yes, I should.

483
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:50,413
My whole life...

484
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,603
I've just clung to whatever came along.

485
00:38:56,353 --> 00:38:59,353
Well, speaking as a clingee...
I kinda didn't mind.

486
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,683
Thanks. For everything.

487
00:39:24,873 --> 00:39:25,723
Xander?

488
00:39:30,793 --> 00:39:32,593
What if I'm really nobody?

489
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:36,613
Don't be a dope.

490
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:39,683
I'm a dope.

491
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:43,753
Sometimes.

492
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:47,603
That's a start.
