1
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,797
I can't believe this loser look.

2
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:14,167
I lobbied so hard for the teal.

3
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:18,971
No one ever listens to me,
lone fashionable wolf.

4
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:22,035
I like the maroon. Has more dignity.

5
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:24,445
Dignity? You?
In relation to clothes?

6
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:26,005
I'm awash in a sea of confusion.

7
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,881
I just want to look
respectable in this...

8
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:30,978
considering I'm probably
gonna die in it.

9
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:34,388
- Excuse me?
- I woke up the other day

10
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,551
with this feeling
in my gut. I just know.

11
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:40,620
There is no way I'm getting
out of this school alive.

12
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:43,667
Well, you've really mastered the power
of positive giving up.

13
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,599
I've been lucky too many times.

14
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:48,536
My number's comin' up. And I was short.

15
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:51,734
One more rotation,
and I'm shipping stateside.

16
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,176
- You know what I mean?
- Seldom if ever.

17
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:02,675
Bye. We'll keep in touch.

18
00:01:02,753 --> 00:01:04,687
Willow, will you sign my yearbook?

19
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:06,188
Yeah. You have
to sign mine, too.

20
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:15,190
You know, I really wish we would
have got to know each other better.

21
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:17,063
Me, too.

22
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:19,159
I mean, you're so smart.

23
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:20,703
I always wanted to be like that.

24
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,001
Thanks. You're so sweet.

25
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,708
- I hope we don't lose touch.
- No, we'll hang out.

26
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:29,871
- Bye.
- Bye.

27
00:01:29,947 --> 00:01:31,938
Oh, I'm gonna miss her.

28
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:33,210
Don't you hate her?

29
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:35,275
Yes, with a fiery vengeance.

30
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,377
She picked on me for 10 years...

31
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:39,980
the vacuous tramp.

32
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,786
It's like a sickness, Buffy.

33
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:45,818
I'm just missing everything.
I miss P.E.

34
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,659
I think it's contagious.

35
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:53,901
The whole senior class
has turned into the sixties.

36
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,836
Or what I would have imagined
the sixties would have been like,

37
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:58,534
you know, without the war
and the hairy armpits.

38
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:02,067
- You don't feel it?
- No, I don't.

39
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:04,740
I mean, I guess
I'll miss stuff,

40
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:08,410
but I just don't get
the whole graduation thing.

41
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:10,454
I mean, you get a piece of paper
and nothing changes.

42
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:14,217
I don't even think I'm gonna go.

43
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,088
Oh, trusty soda machine...

44
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,288
I push you for root beer,
you give me Coke.

45
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,296
What do you mean not go? Why not?

46
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:27,428
Ascension, mayor becoming a demon,

47
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:29,837
snacking upon populace.

48
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:31,306
I was planning on fighting him.

49
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,672
We can't do both?

50
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:35,234
Both what?

51
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:37,337
Go to graduation and fight the mayor.

52
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:39,974
The mayor?

53
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,177
- What, you guys didn't hear?
- Hear what?

54
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:44,244
Guess who our commencement speaker is?

55
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:45,788
- Siegfried?
- No.

56
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,016
- Roy?
- No.

57
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:50,618
- One of the tigers?
- Come out of the fantasy, Wil.

58
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:52,423
I don't believe this.

59
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:55,659
Lends credence to my whole
"I'm gonna die" theorem, doesn't it?

60
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,223
The mayor at graduation?

61
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,929
A hundred helpless kids to feed on.

62
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:02,063
Got any other surprises for us?

63
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,175
[Knock On Door]

64
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,769
Just a moment.

65
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:17,112
Hi. I'm looking for Professor Worth.

66
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:18,518
Oh, that's me.

67
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:21,149
But I should ask you to come back
during office hours.

68
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,989
- Students generally make appoint...
- Uh, I'm not from the college.

69
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:26,894
I work for Mayor Wilkins. I'm Faith.

70
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:30,627
Oh, well, come in, please.

71
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,465
I was so surprised when he called.

72
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:36,097
Didn't expect a politician

73
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,368
to be interested in my research.

74
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:41,934
- He's a big fan, Professor.
- Oh, oh, Lester's fine.

75
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,004
We alone here, Lester?

76
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:49,212
Well... yes.

77
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:51,754
Lifelong bachelor.

78
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:53,551
Like my space.

79
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:57,390
I hear that. You want to turn
and face the wall, Lester?

80
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,928
What are you doing?

81
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:01,487
I'll make it quick.

82
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:03,032
Put that away.

83
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:07,335
- I'll scream!
- Who wouldn't?

84
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:09,736
Oh, oh, please!

85
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:12,401
Sorry, friend.
The boss wants you dead.

86
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:14,376
Why?

87
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:17,539
You know, I never thought to ask.

88
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:21,107
[Lester Groans]
Oh! Ohhhh!

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

90
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,772
And everything went smoothly
with Mr. Worth?

91
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:25,474
- Faith: Not if you're Mr. Worth.
- [Chuckles]

92
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:27,881
Well, that's swell.

93
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:31,443
You know how I feel
about loose ends.

94
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:36,858
And the big day is so close.
You can smell the excitement in the air.

95
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,458
Say, are you ever coming out of there?

96
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:43,523
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

97
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:55,438
Well... aren't you a vision.

98
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:58,121
I feel wicked stupid in this.

99
00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:02,315
You look lovely.
Perfect for the ascension.

100
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:04,860
Any boys that manage to survive

101
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:06,725
will be lining up to ask you out.

102
00:06:06,796 --> 00:06:11,028
- It just isn't me, though.
- Not you?

103
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:15,094
Let me tell you something.

104
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,036
Nobody knows what you are.

105
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:21,133
Not even you,
little Miss Seen-It-All.

106
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:25,042
The ascension isn't just my day.

107
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:27,743
It's yours, too.
Your day to blossom,

108
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:30,308
show the world what
a powerful girl you are.

109
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:33,679
I think of what you've done,

110
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:36,191
what I know you will do.

111
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:41,889
No father could be prouder.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,834
- I hope I don't let you down.
- Impossible.

113
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:50,702
Now, come on, change back into your
street clothes. I'll buy you an Icee.

114
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:07,946
- Hey, Rosenberg.
- Hey, Percy.

115
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:11,687
Check it out. History final.

116
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:13,251
"B-minus." That's great.

117
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:15,194
I'm a scholar. I'm like a scholar.

118
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,062
Congratulations.

119
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:20,899
Hey, listen, thank you.
I mean, for helping me,

120
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,029
being so patient.

121
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:27,042
And also, for not kicking my ass
like you did in the bronze.

122
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,375
You know, Percy,
that was actually...

123
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:32,414
for your own good.

124
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:34,507
I know. I know.

125
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,984
- Hey.
- Hey.

126
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:38,486
History's important, you know.

127
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:40,887
No, I totally get that now.

128
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:42,254
And I got the grades,

129
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:43,485
I'm graduating tomorrow.

130
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,925
I can forget all this crap.

131
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:49,928
Well, on the bright side,
after graduation,

132
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:52,399
he may not have the chance
to forget it all.

133
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,299
Ha ha.

134
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,167
I'm just trying
to keep things light.

135
00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:00,539
But things aren't light. I mean, it's
bad enough we have to fight the mayor.

136
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,909
I don't want him eating Percy
and the whole class.

137
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,916
We have to find a spell or something
to stop the ascension.

138
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:09,383
Then we will.

139
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:20,690
Thank you for
joining us, Mr. Harris.

140
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:23,561
Look, I realize that you've all
finished your finals

141
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,430
and you're ready to move on.

142
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:28,937
But you haven't graduated yet.

143
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:33,772
This is still a class,
and everyone will participate.

144
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:36,277
Mr. Harris,
would you care to begin?

145
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:39,247
Um...

146
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,981
"E."

147
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:46,249
No, there's no "E."

148
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:50,317
They always go for the "E."

149
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:55,023
- Mr. Miller: Next.
- Hi.

150
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:56,656
Mr. Miller: Steven.

151
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,633
Hey.

152
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,168
Um, so I was wondering...

153
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,295
uh, maybe if you're
free this weekend,

154
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:04,499
maybe we could do some...

155
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:07,008
entertaining thing.

156
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:10,045
Would that be along the lines
of you telling me

157
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:12,104
about all the men you destroyed back
in your demon days?

158
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,615
'Cause pencil me in.

159
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:19,483
Well, we could do
something else you like.

160
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:22,319
We could, um...

161
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:25,555
watch sports of some kind.

162
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:28,654
Uh, I don't know.

163
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:31,199
Men like sports. I'm sure of it.

164
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:35,332
Yes, men like sports.

165
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:36,895
Men watch the action movie.

166
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:40,101
They eat of the beef
and enjoy to look at the bosoms.

167
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:43,009
A thousand years of avenging our wrongs
and that's all you've learned?

168
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,980
Hey, I'm trying, OK? You don't need
to take my head off.

169
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,150
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,681
Look...

171
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:57,783
I don't even know if I'm
gonna make it to next weekend.

172
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,420
I'll tell you what,
I survive the ascension,

173
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:03,488
and then maybe you and I could do
some sports-related...

174
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:07,130
what?

175
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:10,400
- Faith.
- Wesley: You're sure?

176
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:12,407
It's one of her pieces.

177
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,136
I recognize the brushwork.

178
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:18,907
"Brutally stabbed...

179
00:10:18,982 --> 00:10:23,146
Lester Worth, visiting
professor of geology."

180
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:26,382
There's nothing in here
that bellows "motive."

181
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,447
Random killing, perhaps? Fit of rage?

182
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:31,084
Everybody does seem to be
going a bit mad lately.

183
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,594
Faith has something
of a head start.

184
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:35,893
Doesn't read.
I think it's homework.

185
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:38,900
The mayor wanted
the good professor out of the way.

186
00:10:38,968 --> 00:10:40,993
Which leads
to the question, "How come?"

187
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,401
I'm gonna destroy the entire city,

188
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:44,997
but I take the time
to kill harmless Lester first?

189
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:49,568
Tying up loose ends?
Lester had something or knew something.

190
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:50,942
Then I want to know, too.

191
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:54,006
If the mayor's trying to hide,
I say we go seek.

192
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,382
Ah, by attempting
to keep a valuable clue from us,

193
00:10:57,453 --> 00:11:01,048
the mayor may have inadvertently
led us right to it.

194
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,320
What page are you on, Wes?
'Cause we already got there.

195
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:10,560
Yes, well, you will go tonight,
look over his apartment,

196
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,692
anything of note,
report back here.

197
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:15,431
I just love it when
you take charge, you man, you.

198
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:18,133
Yeah, but that...
was that a yes?

199
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:20,471
I'm having trouble keeping track.

200
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:22,738
I'll go.

201
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,245
Be careful.

202
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:25,371
If Faith should show up...

203
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:27,143
I don't think she'll show.

204
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:28,513
Been there, killed that.

205
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,017
She's not much for follow-up.

206
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,951
Nonetheless, keep watch.

207
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,886
Faith has you at
a disadvantage, Buffy.

208
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:36,720
'Cause I'm not crazy or
'cause I don't kill people?

209
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:38,488
Both, actually.

210
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:41,496
I hear you.

211
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:45,091
I can't kill her. Fun as it may sound.

212
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:47,295
I can make her cry uncle,
though, and I mean to.

213
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,771
Don't let your feelings
about Faith interfere with your work.

214
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,142
Stopping Faith is my work.

215
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,644
Take a beat to love the synergy.

216
00:11:56,712 --> 00:12:01,081
Faith is a footnote.
Our priority is stopping the ascension.

217
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,345
Easier said than done,
Monarchy Boy.

218
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:06,183
Xander, if you don't have
something constructive to add...

219
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:08,348
You guys want to know
about the ascension?

220
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:12,827
Well, meet the only living person
who's ever been to one.

221
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:15,728
About 800 years ago, in
the Kaskov valleys above the Urals,

222
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:19,427
there was a sorcerer
there who achieved ascension.

223
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:22,596
Became the embodiment
of the demon Lohesh.

224
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:25,698
I was there cursing a shepherd
who'd been unfaithful.

225
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:27,538
His wife had wished
that all his sheep would lie...

226
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,077
Can we cut back to the chase?

227
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:32,044
Sorry. Um...

228
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:33,480
Lohesh was...

229
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:38,552
It... It decimated
the village within hours.

230
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:41,055
Maybe 3 people got out.

231
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:44,025
I've seen some horrible things
in my time and life.

232
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:46,186
I've been the cause of
most of them, actually, but this...

233
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:50,255
Ahem. I'm sorry. Lohesh was a 4-winged
soul killer, am I right?

234
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,736
I was given to understand
that they're not that fierce.

235
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:58,365
- Of all the demons we've faced...
- You've never seen a demon.

236
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:00,739
Uh, excuse me.

237
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,710
Killing them professionally
4 years running.

238
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:05,747
All the demons
that walk the earth are tainted,

239
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:07,339
are human hybrids, like vampires.

240
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:11,580
The ascension means that a human
becomes pure demon.

241
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:13,144
They're different.

242
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:15,053
- Different?
- How?

243
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:18,651
Well, for one thing...
they're bigger.

244
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:23,665
The kids are here,
the parents off to the side there.

245
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:27,499
We'll go up, they'll
play the processional,

246
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,299
and then you'll
give the address.

247
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:30,771
It all looks wonderful.

248
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,364
As long as nobody
makes any trouble.

249
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:35,239
Oh, stop worrying.
You just make sure the kids show up.

250
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:37,074
Anybody who doesn't feel
like coming to graduation,

251
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:40,115
well, they'll just have
to live without a diploma.

252
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:41,275
They'll be here, sir.

253
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,749
Call me Richard.

254
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:47,250
You've done a great job here.

255
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:49,291
I know things are, um...

256
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:51,485
well, different here in Sunnydale.

257
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:53,358
We've both seen all sorts of things.

258
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:56,415
What's important is we keep it under
control, and that's what you've done.

259
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:57,404
What's important is we keep it under
control, and that's what you've done.

260
00:13:57,483 --> 00:14:01,214
- I believe in order.
- Sunnydale owes you a debt.

261
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:02,844
It will be repaid.

262
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:07,914
Yes, sir, we'll
mark that invoice "Paid in full."

263
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:13,229
It doesn't sound like Lohesh.
The rituals are all different.

264
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:16,461
- I wish that was a relief.
- Oz: What's going on?

265
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:18,560
How come evil girl's in the mix?

266
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:20,867
Anya witnessed an ascension.

267
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:23,908
OK, then.

268
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:27,468
What about the spiders? The mayor had
a box of spiders that he had to eat.

269
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:30,174
The box of...
I want to say gravlax.

270
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:33,480
- Gavrok.
- It doesn't ring a bell.

271
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,986
There must be something you can remember
that would be helpful.

272
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,147
Mayor: So...

273
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,422
this is the inner sanctum.

274
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:48,024
Faith tells me this is where
you folks like to hang out

275
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,068
and concoct your little schemes.

276
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:52,501
I'll tell you, you know,
it's just nice to see

277
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:56,439
that young people are still interested
in reading in this modern era.

278
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:59,773
[Chuckles]

279
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:01,836
So what are kids
reading nowadays?

280
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:08,282
"The beast will walk upon the earth
and darkness will follow.

281
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:12,449
The several races of man will be as one
in their terror and destruction."

282
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:14,219
Oh, that's kind of sweet.

283
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,784
Different races coming together.

284
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:19,353
You never get even a little tired
of hearing yourself speak, do you?

285
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,392
That's one spunky little
girl you've raised.

286
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:28,999
I'm gonna eat her.

287
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:34,409
Oh.

288
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:36,571
Whoa!

289
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,111
Now, that was a little thoughtless.

290
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:45,148
Violent outbursts like that...

291
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,714
in front of the children.

292
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:50,284
You know, Mr. Giles, they look to you
to see how to behave.

293
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:51,522
Get out.

294
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,027
I smell fear. That's smart.

295
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:04,067
But some of your deaths will be quick,
if that's worth anything.

296
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:08,136
Well, see you all at graduation.

297
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:11,282
You don't want to miss
my commencement address.

298
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:16,517
It's going to be
one heck of a speech.

299
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,864
Anya, wait!

300
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:34,167
- Where you going?
- Anywhere. If there's a lunar shuttle

301
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:36,298
going up anytime
soon, I'm on it.

302
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,503
We need you here.
You might be able to help.

303
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:41,842
Or I might be able to live.

304
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:43,711
You can't stop the ascension, Xander.

305
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:45,079
You were right the first time.

306
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:49,376
The only thing any sane person
can do now is run.

307
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:53,956
- What's her saga?
- She's freaking.

308
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:58,258
- About what?
- The mayor is gonna kill us all.

309
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,855
Oh. Are you gonna go
to fifth period?

310
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:04,096
- I'm thinking I might skip it.
- Yeah, me, too.

311
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:10,205
Buffy, I'm home.
Do you want to go to...

312
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,644
What are you doing?

313
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:17,576
You're running away again?

314
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:20,516
And you're taking my clothes.

315
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,713
Mom, I need you
to leave town... tonight.

316
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,779
Buffy, I'd miss your graduation.

317
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:27,825
- Yeah, that's sort of the idea.
- There's no way. I wouldn't dream of it.

318
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:30,157
Mom, graduation is a pointless ceremony

319
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:32,663
where you sit around and listen to
a bunch of boring speeches

320
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:34,892
till someone hands you a piece of paper
that says you graduated,

321
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:37,731
which you already know, and
maroon does nothing for my complexion,

322
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,464
so don't argue, OK?

323
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:43,235
What, is some terrible demon going
to attack the school?

324
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,512
Oh, I see.

325
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:51,446
Oh, you know, Buffy,

326
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:54,747
looking back at everything
that's happened,

327
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,220
maybe I should have sent you
to a different school.

328
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,120
Just promise me you'll be
far away from here.

329
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,489
I am not leaving you to
face an awful monster.

330
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,256
- If I go anywhere, you're going with me.
- You know that I can't.

331
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:06,126
Well, then I can't either.

332
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:11,994
- I know you wish I were different.
- Buffy, no...

333
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,300
I wish I could be
a lot of things for you...

334
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:17,467
A great student, a star athlete,

335
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:21,034
remotely normal... I'm not.

336
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:26,346
But there is something I do I can do
better than anybody else in the world.

337
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:27,976
I'm gonna fight this thing.

338
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:30,214
But I can't do it
and worry about you.

339
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:31,756
Oh, Buffy, I just can't...

340
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:34,291
If you stay, you'll get me killed.

341
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,726
You have to trust me on this.

342
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:40,264
Can you do that?

343
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,901
Oh, this is so frustrating.

344
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,875
Nothing useful?

345
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:58,472
No, it's great...

346
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,417
if we want to make ferns invisible

347
00:19:01,486 --> 00:19:03,113
or communicate with shrimp,

348
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:06,624
I've got the goods right here.

349
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,388
Our lives are different
than other people's.

350
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,326
Oh, who am I kidding?

351
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:14,331
I'm not gonna find a spell
to stop the ascension.

352
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:15,991
I'm no witch.

353
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:19,469
I can't even change poor
Amy back to a person.

354
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:24,869
But you got the
swinging habitrail goin'.

355
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:27,173
I think Amy's in
a good place emotionally.

356
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:31,573
- Oz...
- What?

357
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,019
Could you just pretend to care
about what's happening, please?

358
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:38,579
You think I don't care?

359
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,557
I think we could be dead
in 2 days' time,

360
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,083
and you're being
ironic detachment guy.

361
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:45,629
Would it help you if I panicked?

362
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:48,097
Yes! It'd be swell.

363
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,657
Panic is a thing people can share
in times of crisis,

364
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,534
and... and everything is
really scary now, you know?

365
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:55,596
And I don't know
what's gonna happen.

366
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,198
And... And there's
all sorts of things

367
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,209
that you're supposed to get
to do after high school,

368
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:01,507
and I was really looking
forward to doing them.

369
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,639
And... And now we're
probably just gonna die,

370
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:05,876
and I'd like to feel
that maybe you would...

371
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:14,658
- What are you doing?
- Panicking.

372
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,533
Ow!

373
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,691
Stealthy.

374
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,465
Not my best entrance.

375
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,006
I think they were
moppin' in the halls.

376
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:57,771
What are you doing here?

377
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:02,444
I checked in with Giles.
He asked me to back you up.

378
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:05,416
- He's afraid I'll run into Faith.
- You're not?

379
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:08,476
It's gonna happen sooner or later.

380
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:10,454
What's that?

381
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:15,392
A report, excavation
of some old lava bed.

382
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:18,624
The guy was a volcanologist
or something.

383
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:20,790
Anything in there that connects
him to the mayor?

384
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:24,563
I looked through it, but the only thing
I understood were the commas.

385
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:28,232
- I'm gonna bring it to Giles.
- I'll give you a hand.

386
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:44,446
You know what? Thank you, but I can
take it from here.

387
00:21:44,523 --> 00:21:46,923
It's all right.
I'll walk you there.

388
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,857
Look, I don't need an escort.

389
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,591
I'm a big girl.
Superpowers, remember?

390
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:55,065
I don't need you crowding me.

391
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:57,125
I didn't think I was.

392
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:59,034
No, of course you don't.

393
00:21:59,104 --> 00:22:02,164
You just show up at the prom,
and then you disappear into the ozone.

394
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:04,573
For all I know, you left town.

395
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:07,771
Are you mad at me for being around too
much or for not being around enough?

396
00:22:07,846 --> 00:22:09,507
Duh, yes.

397
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:11,516
- Which?
- What?

398
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,279
I don't get you.

399
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:15,343
No, you don't. Not anymore.

400
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:18,049
Are you just making this harder
to make this easier on yourself?

401
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:21,718
Can we stop with
the brainteasers?

402
00:22:21,794 --> 00:22:24,354
I just wish it was over. Done.

403
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,523
It's not that simple.
Once the mayor...

404
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,693
I know. World in peril
and we have to work together.

405
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:32,532
This is my last office romance,
I'll tell you that.

406
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:34,095
You want me out of your face?

407
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:37,504
Isn't it even a little hard for you?

408
00:22:37,576 --> 00:22:40,443
How can you ask me that?
Just 'cause I'm not acting like a brat

409
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:43,037
- doesn't mean I don't feel anything.
- Nice to know what you think of me.

410
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:44,912
What do you expect me to say
when you just attack?

411
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:46,884
I just can't do this anymore.

412
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:50,649
I can't have you in my life
when I'm trying to move on...

413
00:22:55,027 --> 00:22:56,153
Angel!

414
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:04,825
Missed the heart.

415
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:06,871
Meant to.

416
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:11,207
Unh!

417
00:23:11,277 --> 00:23:14,644
- OK, ready?
- Yeah.

418
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:16,340
On 3.

419
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:18,815
- 1...
- Unh!

420
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:20,283
I knew you were
gonna do that.

421
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:21,785
Giles: Not too much blood here.

422
00:23:21,854 --> 00:23:23,913
I heal pretty fast.
I should be all right.

423
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:26,890
I'm just glad Faith
is such a suck shot.

424
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:31,293
- We're sure it was her?
- I've narrowed my list of one suspect.

425
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:35,163
- Fascinating.
- What?

426
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,395
It seems our Mr. Worth

427
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:38,868
headed an expedition in Kauai,

428
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:43,067
digging through old
lava beds near a dormant volcano.

429
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:46,441
- I'm not fascinated yet.
- He found something underneath.

430
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:50,278
- A carcass, buried by an eruption.
- Giles: A carcass?

431
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:51,873
A very large one.

432
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,319
Mr. Worth posits that it might be
some heretofore undiscovered dinosaur.

433
00:23:57,723 --> 00:23:59,657
A demon?

434
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:02,159
Yes, that would be something
the mayor would want to keep a secret.

435
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:05,253
If it's the same kind of demon he's
turning into and it's dead, it means...

436
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:09,859
well, he's only impervious to harm
until the ascension.

437
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:11,766
In its demon form,
he can be killed.

438
00:24:11,837 --> 00:24:15,830
Great. So all we need is a million tons
of burning lava. We're saved.

439
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:18,308
Well, it's a start anyway...

440
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:20,004
OK, you have been
a real klutz today.

441
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,013
You need to...

442
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:24,345
Damn.

443
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:32,054
We'll have to run some tests.

444
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:34,058
Angel: My shoulder's
completely numb.

445
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:38,790
- You're burning up.
- It's poison. I can feel it.

446
00:24:38,864 --> 00:24:41,992
I'll call the others, get them here.

447
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:47,198
We'll need to move him to the safety
of his own bed before the sun comes up.

448
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:49,331
Will you be able to
find out what this is?

449
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,774
The Council has all
the known toxins on file,

450
00:24:51,844 --> 00:24:54,506
mystical or otherwise.
I'll contact them immediately.

451
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,842
Thanks.

452
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:04,218
You're going to be OK.

453
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:35,248
I feel different, you know?

454
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,982
But I guess that makes sense.

455
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:41,583
Do you feel different?
Oh, no, you've already...

456
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,424
Probably no big change for you.

457
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:46,930
I-I-It was nice.

458
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:49,331
Was it nice?

459
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:51,494
Should this be a quiet moment?

460
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,505
I know exactly what you mean.

461
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:58,777
Which part?

462
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:01,904
Everything feels different.

463
00:26:10,622 --> 00:26:12,613
[Telephone Rings]

464
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:17,427
Hello?

465
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:21,962
We gotta go.

466
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:26,627
- He's dropped, boss.
- Applause, applause.

467
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:29,469
Right in the back. He pitches over
and Buffy's freaking,

468
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,736
looking around, all panicked...
it was a good time.

469
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,402
Well, that should
keep her occupied for a spell.

470
00:26:35,535 --> 00:26:39,062
- What next?
- [Sighs] The ritual of Gavrok.

471
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,768
I have to ingest several
of the inhabitants of this box.

472
00:26:42,843 --> 00:26:45,607
- Ingest?
- Eat.

473
00:26:47,614 --> 00:26:50,048
- You're wicked gross.
- [Laughs]

474
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:52,711
Well, you don't have to watch.
Go home, take it easy.

475
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:54,219
It's a big day tomorrow.

476
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,448
You gotta give me something to do.
There's no way I'm sleeping.

477
00:26:56,523 --> 00:26:59,686
Don't you need anyone... dead or maimed?
I could settle for maimed.

478
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,489
You little firecracker.

479
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:04,359
My mom used to call me that.

480
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:06,695
When I was little.

481
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:08,098
I was always running around.

482
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,373
Tomorrow. The ascension and all that.
Am I gonna get to fight?

483
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:18,308
If everything goes smoothly,
you won't have to.

484
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:21,211
But how often do things go smoothly?

485
00:27:21,281 --> 00:27:25,081
- So you'll still need me in there.
- Always.

486
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:27,586
When I was a kid,

487
00:27:27,654 --> 00:27:30,487
a couple of miles outside of Boston
there was this quarry,

488
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:33,924
and all the kids used to swim there
and jump off the rocks.

489
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:36,428
And there was this one rock,
like, 40 feet up.

490
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:38,896
I was the only one
that would jump off of it.

491
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:41,433
All the older kids were too scared.

492
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:42,934
Not you, though.

493
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:45,972
Nah. I could do it easy.

494
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,974
Get some rest.

495
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:56,312
Good luck with your spiders there.

496
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,693
They should have all
this at the Magic Shop.

497
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:10,924
I can run a trace analysis,
see if it's a mystical poison.

498
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:13,090
I'm a little short on cash.

499
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,067
- Just tell them it's for me.
- Right.

500
00:28:23,977 --> 00:28:25,103
Anya: Xander.

501
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:29,482
What are you doing here?

502
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:31,312
I thought you'd be in Aruba by now.

503
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:34,547
Hey, I'm packed.
My car's right outside.

504
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:37,215
I... I just, um...

505
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,952
I, uh, I had to, uh...

506
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:41,960
What?

507
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:43,928
[Sighs]

508
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:45,862
That you could come with me.

509
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,991
Come with you?

510
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:50,059
You mean that?

511
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:52,105
Why not?

512
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:55,369
We could just get
in the car and drive.

513
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,411
No one would miss us. We could...

514
00:28:58,478 --> 00:29:00,844
take turns driving,

515
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:03,212
keep each other awake.

516
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,878
You're going to die if you stay here.

517
00:29:09,222 --> 00:29:10,849
I guess I might.

518
00:29:10,924 --> 00:29:13,415
When I think that something
could happen to you,

519
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:14,960
it feels bad inside,

520
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:16,996
like I might vomit.

521
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,532
Welcome to the world of romance.

522
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,431
It's horrible!

523
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:24,094
No wonder I used
to get so much work.

524
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:27,072
Well, I'm sorry I give you
barfy feelings.

525
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,110
Come with me.

00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,547
I can't.

527
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:37,674
Why not?

528
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:40,811
I got friends on the line.

529
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:42,354
So?

That humanity thing's
still a work in progress, isn't it?

531
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:48,593
Are you really gonna be
that much help to them?

532
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,630
I mean, you'll probably
just get in the way.

533
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:53,564
Your stock's plummeting
here, sweetheart.

534
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:55,965
Fine. You know what?
I hope you die.

535
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:01,638
Aren't we gonna kiss?

537
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,565
It'll be OK.

00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,468
You'll be OK.

[Door Opens, Footsteps]

540
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:52,625
Did you reach the Council?

541
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:54,284
Wesley: Yes.

542
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:58,689
They, uh...

543
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:00,528
They couldn't help.

544
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,625
Couldn't?

545
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:05,569
Wouldn't.

546
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:08,574
It's not Council policy
to cure vampires.

547
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:10,075
Did you explain that these were
special circumstances?

548
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:13,135
Not under any circumstances, and
yes, I did try to convince them.

549
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:14,373
Try again.

550
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,239
Buffy, they're very firm.

551
00:31:17,317 --> 00:31:20,480
We're talking about laws which have
existed longer than civilization.

552
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:24,011
I'm talking about
watching my lover die.

553
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,556
I don't have a clue what
you're talking about, and I don't care.

00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:32,029
Buffy, we'll find a cure.

555
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:36,159
- The orders are to concentrate on...
- Orders?

556
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:43,739
I don't think I'm going to be
taking any more orders.

Not from them.

which way my back is facing.

Don't you see what's happening?

00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:19,170
Faith poisoned Angel to distract you,

568
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:21,941
to... to keep you out
of the mayor's way, and it's working.

- We need a strategy.
- I have a strategy.

570
00:32:25,385 --> 00:32:26,943
You're not in it.

571
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,188
This is mutiny.

572
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,029
I like to think
of it as graduation.

Giles, I can't
stay here any longer.

Finding the poison
wasn't that hard.

It's a mystical compound.

582
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:22,206
The Latin name translates roughly to
"killer of the dead."

00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:25,250
- Used on vampires.
- And the cure?

584
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:28,980
There aren't a lot of instances
of it being cured.

585
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:32,387
- But there are some?
- One or 2.

00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:36,087
Pretty vague accounts. How is he?

00:33:37,863 --> 00:33:40,229
- Hold it.
- You got something?

- I'm not sure.
- Be sure.

OK. "Killer of the dead."
That's our boy.

walked away from it.

reversed the effects..."

- What?
- The suspense is killing Angel.

598

The only way to cure this thing...

599
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:10,327
is to drain the blood of a slayer.

600
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:20,329

00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:22,499
Good. What did I miss?

602
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:28,472
No, it's perfect. Angel needs to drain
a slayer, then I'll bring him one.

603
00:34:28,547 --> 00:34:32,108
Buffy, if Angel drains Faith's blood,
it'll kill her.

604
00:34:32,184 --> 00:34:34,709
Not if she's already dead.

605
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,760
A leasing agreement,
should be recent.

606
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:46,161
Won't be in her name, but if the mayor's
putting her up, it might be in his.

607
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:48,893
Maybe he's charging it to the city.

608
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:51,629
Right. Cross-reference realty
with municipal funds.

devil's advocate here,
