2
00:00:02,946 --> 00:00:03,662
Anya!

3
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:06,624
I thought you were with Giles
studying how to not kill people.

4
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:07,456
I just got back.

5
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:09,935
Are you asking me to be a counsellor?

6
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:13,701
Spike's insane in the basement,
Xander's there doing construction.

7
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:16,425
- I was wondering why I...
- Have this job?

8
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:18,064
I still haven't finished college.

9
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:20,865
These students need someone
who understands them.

10
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:23,619
I need someone
who understands these students.

00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:37,584
- You did good work on her. She looks good.
- Thanks.

13
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:41,261
- She's all set for the service tomorrow.
- Good.

14
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:46,379
- All right then. I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night.

15
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,816
- Hey!
- Sorry.

16
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:16,422
33 minutes. Since when do we go to
all this trouble for one lousy vampire?

17
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:19,100
Excuse me, one lousy <i>potential</i> vampire.

18
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:21,905
Vampire by vampire.
It's the only way I know.

19
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:23,385
<i>(knocking)</i>

20
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,420
I think this thing has
a freakin' child lock on it.

21
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:36,340
- Shh!
- I'm not the shortest one here.

22
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:39,577
- I don't know why I had the kid coffin.
- I know it's my job...

23
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,863
No. I'm sorry. I wanna help.

24
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:46,018
I've been stressed lately.
I'm sorry I took it out on you.

25
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,745
No big. Been kinda stressed myself.

26
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,545
The whole Willow sitch is not unstressifying.

27
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:54,015
She's here, but not "part of the gang" here,

28
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:57,940
and hopefully not "under my feet here
in another time dimension" here.

29
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:03,100
There is Willow. There's the looming
humungo bad. And it's a school night.

30
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:07,498
I should be cuddling up to my insomnia,
worrying about how I'll mess up tomorrow.

31
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,656
You'll be fine. A great counsellor.

32
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:14,376
It's my first week talking to the kids.
What if their problems are weird and tricky?

33
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:18,744
I think you underestimate your familiarity
with the world of weird and tricky.

34
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:22,421
- This job's perfect for you.
- Check out perfect me.

35
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:25,464
Taking my sister
on an educational outing to the...

36
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,695
Dead body.

37
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:29,823
I don't know. Amateur opinion here,
but she looks dead.

38
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:32,500
I mean like natural-causes dead.

39
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,339
The paper said she had
unusual cuts on her neck.

40
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:40,500
Maybe she cut herself shaving
and then died naturally of embarrassment.

41
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:42,702
- She looks...
- <i>(Buffy)</i> Peaceful.

42
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:45,581
I am not peaceful.

43
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,783
That I can help with.

44
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:55,217
I always thought closed caskets
were more tasteful anyway.

45
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,460
Hello?

46
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:12,537
Come in!

47
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,059
Hi.

48
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,704
Mr Miller sent me here.

49
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,059
- Do you know why?
- I'm not sure.

50
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:27,143
Maybe cos this guy was picking on me.

51
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:32,294
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- OK. That's fine.

52
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:36,015
- I'm serious. I don't wanna talk.
- OK.

53
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:40,543
You know, I hate to miss bio, but
I thought it was best I come speak with you.

54
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:43,902
- So, what's on your mind?
- On my mind?

55
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:46,580
Are you worried about school?

56
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:52,376
- Friends, girls, your parents?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it. My parents.

57
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,900
- So, what about them?
- Um...

58
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,181
Issues of divorce.

59
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,735
You know, it's awful being teased.

60
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:03,738
But the thing is, with bullies, they're just...

61
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:05,703
Insecure?

62
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,822
Yeah, everyone says that.

63
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:11,819
You know, I'm really tired
of everyone being so insecure.

64
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:25,816
Divorce is terrible.
My parents got divorced when I was a kid.

65
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:28,704
Yeah, my parents are happily married.

66
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,504
It's hard.

67
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:32,781
I feel left out.

68
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:35,660
But I'm also concerned about girls.

69
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:39,936
OK, I'm just bored.

70
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:45,696
Maybe I should get back to bio?

71
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,018
Stick up for yourself.

72
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:54,384
You need to show this bully that you're not
gonna take any more of his sh... guff.

73
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:57,538
- Any guff.
- Cos that's what I did.

74
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:03,258
I stuck up for myself. The other day after
class, I jumped him in the parking lot,

75
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:06,861
and slammed his stupid-ass insecure face
right into the pavement.

76
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:08,425
You what?

77
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:12,499
I guess that's another reason
Mr Miller wanted me to see you.

78
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:14,542
Do you think
I should pound on him some more?

79
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:18,778
- I bet she's giving them great advice.
- Absolutely.

80
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:24,304
Those kids are lucky to have Buffy looking
out for them. I just wish she believed it.

81
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:29,904
She's still stressing over the whole "dropped
out of college, not actually qualified" thing.

82
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:33,262
Plus the salivating Hellmouth
under her feet and the whole...

83
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,702
"From beneath you, it devours."
Not the friendliest jingle.

84
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:40,984
It's no "I like lke" or
"Milk: it does a body good."

85
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,217
I know. It's gonna be bad.

86
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:48,185
It's gonna be real bad.
And I wonder, will I...

87
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:53,135
Well, if it comes, when it comes,
will I be able to help?

88
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,419
- I think so.
- I don't know.

89
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:59,145
I don't know what I can do.

90
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:03,936
- Frankly, I'm scared of what I might do.
- Yeah, I get that.

91
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:09,384
Figuring out how to control your magic
seems a lot like hammering a nail.

92
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,503
Fine, hear me out.
So you're hammering, right?

93
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:15,544
If you hold the end,
you have the power, but no control.

94
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:18,982
It takes two strokes to hit the nail in,
or you could hit your thumb.

95
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,943
- Ouch.
- So you choke up.

96
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:25,781
Control, but no power. It could take
like ten strokes to knock the nail in.

97
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:28,903
Power, control. It's a trade-off.

98
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:32,422
- That's actually not a bad analogy.
- Thanks.

99
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:35,339
Except I'm less worried
about hitting my thumb,

100
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:38,623
and more worried about
going all black-eyed baddie

101
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:43,143
and bewitching that hammer into cracking
my friends' skulls open like coconuts.

102
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:45,217
Right. Ouch.

103
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:47,943
Sorry.

104
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:52,336
Xander, being back here. I don't know...

105
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,097
It'll take time.

106
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,784
Are you sure you're ready for this?

107
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,343
Hey.

108
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:56,217
It's me.

109
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,580
I'm scared.

110
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:12,865
I don't wanna be left all alone.
My brother's joining up with the marines.

111
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:20,938
You know, if he knew I was making
a fool of myself, he'd smack me in my head.

112
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:24,462
- I'm being stupid.
- Sounds like your brother's pretty tough.

113
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:28,664
Yeah, you know, he's a man.
I'm just all messed up right now.

114
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:32,864
You are not messed up. It's not
messed up to worry about your brother.

115
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:38,259
What if he doesn't come back?
What if he gets blown up?

116
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:41,656
Have you talked to him?
Have you told him how you feel?

117
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:44,021
No. No, I don't wanna talk to him.

118
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:46,859
I don't wanna do that.
I don't wanna talk to him.

119
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:48,937
- OK.
- D'you understand?

120
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:54,536
- So, Josh, what's on your mind?
- Well, I'm worried that I'm gay.

121
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:59,256
OK, first of all, I think it's great that
you would come and talk to me about this.

122
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:04,978
And second of all, you should know there is
nothing shameful about being gay. Nothing.

123
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,261
I know. It's just...

124
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:11,180
I'm not positive,
so I was thinking that...

125
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:15,817
Why don't you go on a date with me
so I can be sure?

126
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:25,018
It sounds like it's difficult for you.

127
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:29,384
Like maybe your sister makes it hard
for you to establish your own identity.

128
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:34,096
You said she's controlling, she doesn't
let you make your own decisions...

129
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:40,341
- And she borrows my clothes without asking.
- I understand. That must be hard.

130
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:43,941
- So, you're not doing your homework?
- I guess not.

131
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:49,862
It all just... seems kind of... whatever.

132
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:51,902
High school can seem frustrating.

133
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,944
But if you just get through it,
you can go to college,

134
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:58,780
or you can join the French foreign legion,
or anything you want.

135
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,302
Yeah, well,
I'm not gonna do all that stuff.

136
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:05,025
OK, no foreign legion. I get that.

137
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:10,817
Changing your name, and being indentured
for all those years, and occupying Algeria...

138
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:13,181
I'm not graduating from high school.

139
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:17,100
- Why not?
- I really like that shirt. Where'd you get it?

140
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:22,055
Cassie, don't change the subject.
Why won't you graduate?

141
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:25,540
Because next Friday I'm gonna die.

142
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,662
- What?
- Can we talk about something else?

143
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:38,943
- No, we have to talk about this.
- Just...

144
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,974
- Never mind.
- What makes you feel like this?

145
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:46,304
- Feel like what?
- Like you wanna hurt yourself.

146
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:51,904
Oh, I'm not gonna commit suicide
if that's what you're saying. No way.

147
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:54,659
OK. Then what are you saying?

148
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:58,534
I don't mean to be a pain. You seem nice.
I know you're just trying to help.

149
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:02,665
- But I'm wasting your time.
- No, you're not. This is why I'm here.

150
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:04,941
Why do you think you're gonna die?

151
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:08,655
I don't think it, I know it. I just know.

152
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:12,705
What do you mean, you know? Are you
saying that someone's going to hurt you?

153
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:14,936
- Has someone threatened you?
- No.

154
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,143
No, I just know that next Friday I'm gonna die.

155
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:21,821
Some things I just know.
I don't know how, I just do.

156
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,385
- Like I know there will be coins.
- Coins?

157
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:29,503
Mm-hm. Lots of coins.

158
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:31,577
Weird ones.

159
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:36,694
And I know that you'll go someplace
dark underground. I don't know.

160
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:40,017
- What do you mean, "underground"?
- I know you'll try to help...

161
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:44,304
- I don't understand what you're saying.
- But you can't, OK?

162
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:50,101
I gotta go. Trig. I don't want Mr Corrigan
sending me to Principal Wood again.

163
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,495
- Please...
- Thanks for being so nice.

164
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:56,784
I do like that shirt. You should put a sweater
on so it doesn't get stained. I gotta go.

165
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,336
- Cassie, wait, please...
- Gotta go.

166
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:01,781
- What am I supposed to do?
- You did it.

167
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:04,539
- You reported the situation to me.
- And?

168
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:09,575
Listen, it's hard. Kids this age, they're hurting,
they're pissed off, and they say things.

169
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,100
Sometimes they say awful things.

170
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:16,782
When I was in high school, I had a thing
with this guy, right? Real bully.

171
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:22,304
I told everyone that he'd better sleep with
one eye open cos I was gonna bust his ass.

172
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:27,585
Well, I got suspended. Talk like that is taken
pretty seriously where I come from.

173
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,896
The hood?

174
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:32,454
Beverly Hills.

175
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,344
Which is <i>a hood.

176
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:39,502
Listen, the point is,
I was talking big because I was scared.

177
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,817
I couldn't bust a move,
let alone someone's ass.

178
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:47,263
Most of the time, that's what it is
when these students act out. Fear, pain.

179
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:50,418
But sometimes it's not just talk, right?

180
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:55,580
Every time there's a threat like this, we do the
same dance. Inform teachers, search lockers.

181
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,784
But we can't know what's gonna happen.
We can't search their brains.

182
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:03,142
We just... We just do what we can.

183
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:08,505
It's not enough. I need to fix this. I don't
usually get a heads-up before somebody dies.

184
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:12,261
- What do you mean, "usually"?
- No. Not since...

185
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:18,021
I mean, I'm sure it's not usual
to get a chance to stop something like...

186
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:20,779
I need to do something.
I have to make this better.

187
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,299
Oh! Oh.

188
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:24,183
Shoot.

189
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:37,618
I have a job for you.

190
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,904
What are you drawing?

191
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:43,705
Don't you have a history test to study for?

192
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:46,823
When are you gonna design me a tattoo?

193
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:50,455
A tattoo? Oh, right. I can imagine that.

194
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:54,698
Come on. Design something
and maybe we can get matching tattoos.

195
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:58,257
How about like a snake
with some fire coming out of its mouth?

196
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,701
Or a sexy hula girl
that wiggles when you flex?

197
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:04,699
Yeah, now you're talking. Sexy hula girl.
But a sexy snake hula girl.

198
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:05,980
<i>(Cassie laughs)</i>

199
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,819
You are so ridiculous.

200
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:13,818
So, I was thinking...
maybe we should go to that dance after all.

201
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:16,939
What do you mean?
I told you I don't wanna go.

202
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:19,859
I assumed you were kidding.

203
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:24,178
- It'll probably be lame anyways.
- Well, yeah, but lame is funny.

204
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:28,054
And, you know, maybe fun if,
you know, we're hanging out together.

205
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:31,661
- We hang out together all the time.
- Right.

206
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:36,058
And therefore we should hang out
together at the winter formal.

207
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,501
Hey. Um...

208
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:43,216
I'm in ceramics class with you.
I'm Dawn Summers.

209
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:46,696
I forgot if we had
an assignment last week. I spaced.

210
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:48,697
Right. Um...

211
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:52,825
Hey, Dawn. Yeah, we did have an assignment,
but I didn't write it down.

212
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:55,374
I think something to do with glazes.

213
00:15:55,466 --> 00:16:00,779
As scintillating as the pottery talk is,
I'd better actually go study.

214
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:04,254
- I'm Mike, by the way.
- Hi.

215
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:07,383
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Don't worry about it.

216
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,459
I better go hit the books if I'm gonna
ace this test. Nice meeting you.

217
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:14,344
- Cass, I'll see you later?
- Yep.

218
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:21,017
- Hey, Mike, you're gonna get a B.
- Oh, A-plus, baby, A-plus.

219
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,783
So, is that any good?

220
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:29,336
- Yeah. Actually, yeah.
- What do you have to read it for?

221
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:32,099
Oh, just for me, I guess.

222
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:35,656
I stopped reading homework assignments.
I just read what I want.

223
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,864
That's so cool. I'd do that, but my sister
would be down my neck in a second.

224
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:41,902
Summers.

225
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:45,103
Hey, are you the counsellor's little sister?

226
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:46,539
No.

227
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:49,982
She's <i>my</i> sister. Lucky me, huh?

228
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:53,536
No, no, she's really nice.
I actually just saw her this morning.

229
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,856
Oh, really? What about?

230
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:00,941
I'm sorry, that's none of my business.

231
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:03,586
No, I don't care.

232
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,578
So, Mike's a cutie.
Are you guys going to that dance?

233
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,703
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh.

234
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:13,984
- I mean, didn't he ask you?
- Only like 105 times.

235
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,945
- And you said no?
- 106 times.

236
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:21,860
No, I can't go.
I'm not gonna be around that night.

237
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,256
Cassie's records all show the same thing.

238
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:30,225
Good grades, good kid,
then, all of a sudden, not-so-good grades,

239
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:34,219
absenteeism, comments
about apathy and depression.

240
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:36,615
- So the question is, what changed?
- Right.

241
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,345
If she did have psychic vision,
that would explain it.

242
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:42,099
Do you really think this girl
is some kind of precog?

243
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,576
I don't know.
I told you about the shirt, right?

244
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:50,535
You spilled coffee. I'm not saying you don't
have Slayer grace, but it's not the first time.

245
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:56,383
Maybe you're trying so hard to help you're
seeing paranormal when there's just normal.

246
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,740
Maybe. But maybe not.

247
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:05,378
- You want me to check her medical records?
- Her doctor already sent them.

248
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:11,540
Strep throat. Ear infections.
Yeast infections. None of my business.

249
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,617
No real info here.

250
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:16,539
- Have you Googled her yet?
- Willow, she's 17.

251
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:19,857
It's a search engine. Look.

252
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:22,665
OK, let's see what Cassie Newton pulls up.

253
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:26,144
Hey, look. Check this.
She's got her own site.

254
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:29,616
A day and a half of researching,
and we finally try looking up her.

255
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,424
Wow, that's a lot of poems.

256
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:34,862
Poems. Always a sign
of pretentious inner turmoil.

257
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:40,061
"The sheets above me cool my skin,
like dirt on a madwoman's grave."

258
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:44,936
"I rise into the moonlight white
and watch the mirror stare."

259
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:47,586
"The pale fish looks back at me."

260
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,816
"Pale fish will never swim."

261
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:52,374
"My skin is milk for no man to drink."

262
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,344
"My thighs unused, unclenched."

263
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,860
"This body is not ready yet."

264
00:18:57,946 --> 00:19:02,098
"But dirt waits for no woman,
and coins will buy no time."

265
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:07,617
"I hear the chatter of the bugs.
It's they alone will feast."

266
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:08,900
OK.

267
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:12,376
- Death really is on her brain.
- We all deal with death.

268
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:16,095
This girl isn't dealing.
She's giving death a long, sloppy word-kiss.

269
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:18,939
- She has a yen for the big dirt-nap.
- I don't know.

270
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:22,814
I mean, a lot of teens post some
pretty angsty poetry on the web.

271
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:27,855
I even posted a melodramatic love poem
or two back in the day.

272
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:29,618
Love poems?

273
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:32,743
- I'm over you now, sweetie.
- Love poems.

274
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:36,421
Look, all I'm saying
is that this is normal teen stuff.

275
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:40,977
You join chat rooms, you write poetry,
you post Doogie Howser fanfic.

276
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:45,415
It's all normal, right?
Let's see what other sites there are.

277
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:47,861
You guys are way off track.
I got a hunch.

278
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:51,222
Oh, wait, no. Here's something.
No, that's Phillip Newton.

279
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,456
No, that's her dad. Open it.

280
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:57,505
Guys, I'm telling you.
I got this case cracked wide open.

281
00:19:57,586 --> 00:20:00,817
I got the perp fingered.
I told you about Mike Helgenburg?

282
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:03,136
- The guy that asked her to the dance?
- Right.

283
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:07,504
The one that keeps asking her to the dance.
I'm thinking, who likes to be rejected?

284
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:11,295
Nobody. I'm thinking,
some people can't handle the rejection.

285
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:14,219
- I'm thinking that...
- Hey, I got something.

286
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:19,903
Whoa, drunk and disorderly, disturbing
the peace. There's a lot of charges here.

287
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,546
- Her dad's a drunk?
- A violent drunk?

288
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:28,019
We'd better find out. I have his address
right here. You got your keys?

289
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:30,666
- Yeah.
- Guys, I'm telling you.

290
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:35,740
I'm liking Mike Helgenburg for the perp.
Let's collar him before he... lawyers up.

291
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:42,019
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
would break down this door.

292
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:44,859
And Buffy the counsellor?

293
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:46,618
Waits.

294
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:54,935
- Mr Newton?
- That's right.

295
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:57,335
I work at your daughter's school.

296
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:00,065
I need to talk to you.

297
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:03,297
So, is she screwing up her grades again?

298
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:07,857
Because she's not
the sharpest apple in the barrel.

299
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:11,336
She's got some problems. But it's...

300
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:14,065
- It's you we wanted to talk about.
- What about?

301
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:16,740
We know you've been picked up by the police.

302
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:21,377
We wanted to know if you still... drink a lot.

303
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:23,616
What's that got to do with Cassie?

304
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:29,064
Frankly, we were worried that you might
drink too much and hurt Cassie.

305
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,655
- That's all.
- Oh.

306
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:36,938
I see. That's all.

307
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,175
You just come in here
in the middle of the night, into my home,

308
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:45,942
and start accusing me
of beating on my daughter? That's all?

309
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:49,541
- We just wanna make sure that Cassie's...
- Well, that's a lie!

310
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:55,496
Who told you this? Did Cassie's mother
put you up to this, cos I pay my support, OK?

311
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:57,383
To the dime.

312
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:03,462
She just wants to take away the one weekend
a month I get to be with my girl.

313
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,980
- Which is when?
- What?

314
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:08,057
Which weekend is it?

315
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,584
I just had her last weekend.

316
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:13,978
Look.

317
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:22,060
I may not be the greatest dad in the world,
but I don't beat up my daughter.

318
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:25,980
So, you won't be seeing her this Friday, then?

319
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:30,215
Not unless my ex-wife
gets a personality transplant.

320
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:32,501
- OK.
- OK, what?

321
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:35,666
OK now you'll get out of my house?

322
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:38,214
Yeah, we will.

323
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:47,417
It's not him.

324
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,864
He's not the one who does it.

325
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:56,575
Thank you for trying, but I probably
shouldn't have told you anything.

326
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:00,375
You're making such a big deal out of it,
and I want it to all just go away.

327
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:03,822
- Are you talking about killing yourself?
- No, of course not.

328
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:07,103
- Then fight. Try.
- There's no point. I told you...

329
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,495
Doesn't sound like someone
who wants to live.

330
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,658
You think I want this? You think I don't care?

331
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:17,456
Believe me, I want to... be here, do things.

332
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:23,817
I wanna graduate from high school,
and I wanna go to the stupid winter formal.

333
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:30,105
I have this friend, and...
it would be fun to go with him.

334
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:35,375
Just to dance and hear lame music.

335
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:39,900
To wear a silly dress and laugh and stuff.

336
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,975
I'd like to go.

337
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:47,422
There's a lot of stuff I'd like to do.

338
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:51,385
I'd love to ice-skate at Rockefeller Center.

339
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:54,060
I'd love to see my cousins grow up,

340
00:23:54,146 --> 00:23:57,980
cos they're really mean
and I think they're gonna be fat.

341
00:23:58,066 --> 00:24:01,263
I'd love to backpack across the country or...

342
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:05,184
I don't know, fall in love.

343
00:24:08,186 --> 00:24:11,861
But I won't. I just never will.

344
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:16,383
You will. Cassie, you will.
You just have to tell us what you know.

345
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:19,299
You have to tell us everything.
Please, help us.

346
00:24:19,386 --> 00:24:21,456
I can't. I just know it's gonna happen.

347
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:26,745
I don't know why and I don't know how,
but something out there is gonna kill me.

- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
- No, it's OK.

351
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:23,383

- It's been a long week, huh?

I can't believe I just said that.

Spike, what are you doing?

367
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,463
Nothing.

368
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:03,582
If I don't move, if I don't think,
if I don't listen to the voices,

369
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,499
then I won't hurt... much.

370
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,899
- I need to ask you something.
- Don't.

371
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:14,184
There's a girl. She's in danger,
and she needs your help. Now.

372
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:19,824
Time is running out. It's Friday,
the day Cassie said she's going to die.

373
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:22,215
I can't. I can't hear you.

374
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:25,457
Is there something evil in the school?
Down here, maybe.

375
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:28,424
Spike, please, do you know anything?

Yes.

378
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:36,976
There's evil.

379
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:40,502
Down here.

380
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:42,577
Right here.

381
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:47,055
I'm a bad man.

382
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:50,820
William is a bad man.

383
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,855
I hurt the girl.

384
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:03,416
Spike, stop it! What did you do?

385
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:06,145
I hurt you, Buffy, and I will pay.

386
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,581
I am paying because I hurt the girl.

387
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:12,016
Spike. No.

388
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:16,503
It's not me. It's a different girl, OK?

389
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:23,414
Her name is Cassie Newton.
Please, do you know anything specific?

390
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:34,661
Don't... don't leave me.
Stay here, and help me be quiet.

391
00:28:41,226 --> 00:28:44,024
I think it's worse when I'm here.

392
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:50,340
Don't let 'em hurt the girl.

393
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:53,984
Well, there's nothing in this one.

394
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,057
What've you got?

395
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:03,621
- Where's your hall pass?
- Free period.

396
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:06,174
You seem kind of upset.
Something on your mind?

397
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:10,145
No, not really.
Well, I got a lousy B in Egyptian history.

398
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:12,786
Knew this stuff cold,
so that pisses me off.

399
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:15,903
- You get pissed off a lot?
- No, I...

400
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:19,820
Let me cut to the chase. I hear you can't
get a date for the winter formal.

401
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:23,694
Whoa, look. I know it's your job
to talk to kids with problems,

402
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:26,903
but honestly, I don't have any. I'm fine.

403
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:31,059
All right, it's really no big deal.
I have a friend that I really wanted to take.

404
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:34,698
I don't know. I guess
she doesn't see me that way.

405
00:29:34,786 --> 00:29:37,095
- She makes me crazy.
- Crazy?

406
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:40,098
Yeah, sometimes I just...

407
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:45,615
That's... that's funny.
You're Dawn's sister, right?

408
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:46,775
Uh...

409
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:49,175
That's right. Dawn is <i>my</i> sister.

410
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:52,303
Oh, that's so weird.
I was just thinkin' about her.

411
00:29:52,746 --> 00:29:57,103
I was thinkin' if, you know,
Cassie won't budge, maybe I'll ask Dawn.

412
00:29:57,186 --> 00:30:01,896
You aren't mad at Cassie,
with her rejecting you like that?

413
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:03,135
Nah.

414
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:07,458
She's a girl right? Making boys crazy
is like your job description.

415
00:30:09,826 --> 00:30:14,946
You're asking my sister to the dance,
and she's your <i>second</i> choice?

416
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:18,624
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

417
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:27,339
Seems like someone's
got quite a coin collection, huh?

418
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:34,095
You wanted to see me?

419
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:36,222
You have locker number 281?

420
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:38,820
Yeah, why?

421
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:43,821
I want you to tell me what this is,
and what this has to do with Cassie Newton.

422
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:47,262
- I don't know. It's late. I'll miss my bus.
- I know it's late.

423
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:51,783
That's why I don't have time to mess around.
So you need to talk to me. Now.

424
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,460
Believe me, if I knew anything, I'd tell you.

425
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:57,060
I just... don't.

426
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,256
You know why I came back
to Sunnydale High?

427
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,940
- To creep me out?
- To help.

428
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:09,024
I'm a counsellor here because I wanna help.

429
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:12,985
I know what it's like to walk these halls
and feel lost, alone.

430
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:16,820
I just wanna make things better. Connect.

431
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:23,783
And I'll connect with your face if you don't
stop wasting my time and help me do my job.

432
00:31:24,346 --> 00:31:25,620
I...

433
00:31:25,706 --> 00:31:28,539
- Please...
- A girl could die.

434
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:35,339
I know who you're talking about.
She's some weirdo suicidal poet girl.

435
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:39,214
These guys I know wanna mess with her.
They've got this plan...

436
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:43,221
- <i>(Cassie)</i> Well, I guess this is goodbye.
- No. I mean, let me walk you home.

437
00:31:43,306 --> 00:31:45,945

I'm going to my Mom's. It's kinda far.

438
00:31:46,026 --> 00:31:49,735
- Far is good.
- Dawn, I know what's going on here.

439
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:53,136
- What?
- Buffy told you about me, right?

440
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:56,536
- She told you to pretend to be my friend?
- No.

441
00:31:56,626 --> 00:32:00,665
Maybe. Cassie, she was scared.
She wanted to help you.

442
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:03,021
- Well, she can't.
- Maybe she can.

443
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:07,975
She's not like you think.
She's got powers... of helping. And...

444
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:11,900
Look, she was worried and now I'm worried
and I wasn't pretending at all.

445
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:14,784
I really wanted to be your friend.

446
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:18,983
- You are my friend.
- I am?

447
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:22,582
Yeah. Just remember,
I'm not as dumb as I look.

448
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:25,421
I'm glad.

449
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:27,497
Hey, Summers!

450
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:32,305
Listen, Dawn, whatever happens now,
it's not your fault, OK?

451
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:35,216
- Summers.
- What's up, Peter?

452
00:32:35,306 --> 00:32:38,742
I was just wondering
if anyone had asked you to winter formal.

453
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:39,975
What?

454
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,579
Oh.

455
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,975
No. Not exactly.

456
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,864
Well, I was just doing a poll.

death-kick suicidal vibe goin'.

I figure if you disappear, everybody'll assume
you threw yourself in a river somewhere.

479
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:23,784
Extinguish.

please accept our sacrifice.

OK, that is going on your permanent record.

00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:53,020
The counsellor!
What the hell is she doing here?

487
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:55,222
It was his idea!

488
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:57,695
Back off. Get back!

489
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:02,220
Get back, you stupid bitch.

490
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:05,822
You're gonna die!

491
00:35:07,426 --> 00:35:09,496
Do you know how lame this is?

492
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:14,262
Bored teenage boys trying to raise up
a demon. Sorry it didn't show.

493
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:20,296
I bet it's cos you forgot the boom box playing
some heavy-metal thing, like Blue Clam Cult.

494
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:25,344
I think that's the key
to the raising of lame demons.

495
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,420
That lame demon?

496
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:48,537
Dude, help!

497
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:02,660
No!

498
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:17,099
- Spike?
- Here to help. No hurting the girl.

499
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:19,746
Untie her. I'll take care of this.

500
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:27,864
Ah!

501
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:31,264
Uh!

502
00:36:31,746 --> 00:36:34,544
- Who are you?
- I'm a bad man.

503
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:42,095
No, no, please...

504
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:08,703
She'll tell you.
Someday she'll tell you.

505
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:16,258
You OK?

506
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,421
Ow. Ow.

507
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,460
You can't be dead.

508
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:32,140
Where are my infinite riches?

509
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:35,460
Ow! It bit me!

510
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,537
Come on.

511
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:48,617
- Help! Help me, please! I'm bleeding.
- Sorry.

512
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:51,300
My office hours are ten to four.

513
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,897
It's all OK now.

514
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,978
I hope you're not too disappointed.

515
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:07,658
See?

516
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:11,938
You can make a difference.

517
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,417
And you will.

518
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,179
Cassie?

519
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:24,977
Cassie. Cassie.

520
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,735
No, come on. Cassie.

521
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:30,418
Cassie.

522
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:45,298
How was her mom?

523
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:46,978
OK.

524
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:51,497
As OK as...

525
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:58,495
She told me their family
had a history of heart irregularities.

526
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:02,775
But she never told Cassie.

527
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:05,417
Cassie didn't know?

528
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:08,855
Then it was fate?

529
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:12,222
I think she was gonna die,
no matter what, wasn't she?

530
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:15,582
- It didn't matter what you did.
- She just knew.

531
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:19,977
She was special.

532
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:23,016
I failed her.

533
00:39:23,106 --> 00:39:25,256
Uh-uh. No.

534
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:30,024
You didn't, cos you tried.

535
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:33,064
You listened, and you tried.

536
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:36,775
She died cos of her heart, not cos of you.

537
00:39:38,706 --> 00:39:41,300
She was my friend cos of you.

538
00:39:44,186 --> 00:39:47,223
I guess sometimes you can't help.

539
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:50,457
So what then?

540
00:39:52,026 --> 00:39:54,699
What do you do when you know that?

541
00:39:57,066 --> 00:40:01,582
When you know that maybe you can't help?

542
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:47,781
