00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:05,555
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake.

3
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:07,715
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

4
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:10,553
- Tell me you want me.
- I always want you.

5
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:13,635
Do you even like me?

6
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:16,364
- It's over.
- I've memorised this tune, love.

7
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:18,163
I'm using you.

8
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:20,520
And it's killing me.

9
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:22,243
We're getting married.

10
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:24,441
What do you mean, Xander's missing?

11
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,562
When you were a vengeance demon,
you crushed men like him.

12
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:30,796
I wish we could just go back
to the way things were before.

13
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,160
And I wish you were never born!

14
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:36,203
- I'm gonna make you feel it!
- Stop!

15
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:38,954
Ask me again why I could never love you.

16
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:44,364
Tara? Oh, God.

17
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,037
Somebody!

18
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:52,038
I love you.

19
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,913
- Make me what I was.
- We will return... your soul.

<i>I thought it was to kill me.</i>

22
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:03,804
- Instead, you go all Dumbledore on me.
- Do you want to be punished?

23
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,558
- I killed people, Giles.
- I've not forgotten.

24
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:11,435
Something's rising. Something older than the
Old Ones, and everybody's tail is twitching.

25
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:14,119
This is a bad time to be a good guy.

26
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:18,164
It is my great pleasure and privilege
to announce the official opening -

27
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:23,558
on the very ground that it first stood upon -
of the brand-new Sunnydale High!

28
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:26,603
Are you asking me to be a counsellor?

29
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:29,558
Spike?

30
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,722
What did you do?

31
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,037
My home. I belong here.
Always been here.

32
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,922
Cheers for stopping by.

33
00:01:39,245 --> 00:01:41,236
I'll... get back to you.

No. It was...

41

Just a dream. It was just a dream, right?

There's more like her, Dawn.

You know it. I know it.

Making them understand...

53
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:37,114
is a totally different matter.

54
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,596
No manners is the problem.

55
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:43,477
Proper breeding.

56
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:47,359
Lack of etiquette. All of it lacking.

57
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:53,003
- All of it lost on 'em.

Stop. Please don't!

60
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:06,719
Begging now! Make it stop!

Could you die?

64

Cos, speaking for everybody who are me
in the car right now, we're very excited.

65
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:24,242
- I'm glad for all of you then.
- I mean, it's just so cool.

66
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:28,398
You're coming to school with me.
You'll be, like, there the whole time.

67
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:32,239
You understand you cannot talk to me,
or hang out with my friends, right?

68
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:36,841
I doubt we'll see each other, assuming
I half understand my fuzzy job description.

69
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:39,644
It's not fuzzy.
You're dealing with troubled kids?

70
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,034
At a spanking-new Hellmouth High.

71
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:47,279
Please, outside of drugs and violence
and unwanted pregnancy, and...

72
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:51,836
unleashing of hordes of Armageddon that
comes out of the school every now and then,

73
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:55,235
- what trouble could these kids have?
- Guess I'll find out.

74
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:58,920
Those kids are lucky having a slayer
and a friend on campus there for 'em.

75
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:00,996
I hope they appreciate it.

76
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:03,201
I know I did.

77
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:08,315
- Days gone by, huh?
<i>- (Dawn)</i> I thought you hated Sunnydale.

78
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:13,604
Yes, and no, with an emphasis on the yes.
But, at least then I was dating.

79
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:15,198
You could be dating now.

80
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:20,200
- I don't know what's not clicking for me.
- There's that thing with Anya.

81
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:23,004
- The leaving her at the altar thing?
- Yeah, that one.

82
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,963
- It's not something you bounce back from.
- Sure it is.

83
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,879
She bounced back to a vengeance demon,
I bounced back to a dateless nerd.

84
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:31,842
Do you guys talk at all?

85
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:34,314
I've seen her at the Bronze a couple of times.

86
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:38,193
There's scorned women there,
making vengeance wishes on their exes.

87
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:40,196
It's where I go to get my scorn on.

88
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:44,083
You need to ease up
with the whole dating demons thing.

89
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:48,681
I'm sorry, didn't you have a smooch-a-thon
with Teen Vampire last Halloween?

90
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:53,122
See, this is why I don't want you
talking to my friends.

91
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:55,401
We'll sort of feel our way around.

92
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:59,922
Some students will be sent to you, and
others will start to come in on their own.

93
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:03,315
- What if they don't? Should I panic?
- You'll be surprised.

94
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:07,637
You're the youngest,
and least stuffy member of this faculty.

95
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:12,241
The students will wanna talk to you.
And when they do, don't evaluate them.

96
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,758
Just listen.

97
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:18,441
They need to feel like there's someone
around here who actually understands them.

98
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:21,196
- Can I give detention?
- OK by me.

99
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:23,116
Authority can be a wonderful thing.

100
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:26,959
Remember while you are here to help,
you're not here to be their friend.

101
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:30,924
Trust me, you open that door,
and these students will eat you alive.

102
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:34,437
- You heard about Principal Flutie, right?
- Hmm?

103
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:36,083
Forget it.

104
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:39,919
<i>- (class bell)</i>
- OK, then. And, Buffy, relax.

105
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:44,635
There's only three things kids understand:
the boot, the bat, and the bastinada.

106
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:52,596
It's the... it's a bad joke. It's the bastinada.
No one ever knows what that thing is.

107
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:58,279
Wooden rod used to slap the soles of the feet
in Turkish prisons, and is a great billy club.

108
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:01,440
I think you're gonna fit in just fine.

109
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:04,956
Is there something else?

110
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,716
Yeah. Just one more thing.

111
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:13,195
I was just curious, you know,
not that I'm not grateful or anything, but,

112
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:16,357
- I guess I was wondering why I...
- Have this job?

113
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,003
- I still haven't finished college.
- I know.

114
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:21,962
Was it my sparkling personality?

115
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,117
Or maybe you enjoyed my work
at the Double Meat Palace?

116
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:27,196
I'm a vegetarian.

117
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:30,038
These students need
someone who understands them.

118
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,685
I need someone
who understands these students.

119
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:36,917
Why? Is there something about you
that I don't know that maybe I should?

120
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:38,597
Nothing I can think of.

121
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:44,560
Oh, if you'll excuse me. First catch of the day.

122
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,674
- I'll be in my office if you need me.
- Thanks.

123
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:51,519
I'm just gonna have a look around.
Get to know the place.

124
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:55,994
Make sure it's all... school-like.

125
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:12,123

- The taxi's here.
- I know.

130
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:49,196
Keeping with a quaint old British tradition,
you would now be expected to get into it.

131
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:51,276
I don't know if I can.

132
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,156
Giles, I'm not done here.

133
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,116
That's your fear talking.

134
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:04,278
Yes, and my fear's
a big, obnoxious blabbermouth.

135
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:07,755
- You keep telling me to trust my instincts.
- True.

136
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:10,040
So, shouldn't we be listening?

137
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,715
I don't wanna go back home
just so I can screw up again.

138
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:19,796
Why don't I stay? Not forever.
Just long enough to...

139
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:24,035
- make my fear shut up a little, maybe?
<i>- (taxi honks)</i>

140
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:26,956
It's possible, but...

141
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:33,714
Try to be very specific.
What exactly are you afraid of?

142
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:39,115
Well, for starters, how about
the Hellmouth's getting all rumbly again.

143
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:42,442
And now I know it's got teeth.
And are those literal teeth?

144
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:46,313
Cos I don't know if I can handle it.
And what if I can handle it?

145
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:51,320
Does that mean I have to be a bigger, badder
badass than the source of all badness?

146
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:57,435
And what if I give up all this control stuff
and I go all veiny and homicidal again?

147
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:00,164
- And what if...
- They won't take you back?

148
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:01,678
Uh-huh.

149
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:09,078
Willow, we could spend another
two years here training and practising

150
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:12,521
and honing your powers
and still there'd be no way of knowing

151
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:15,836
that the friends you left behind you
are still your friends.

152
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:21,564
- Sure. If you put it that way, duh.
- I'd love to offer you some guarantee

153
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:25,433
that you'd be welcomed back to Sunnydale
with open arms, but I can't.

154

You may not be wanted,
but you will be needed.

155
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:31,479
- That all you got?
- For the moment, yes.

156
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:35,443
OK. I guess I'd better...

157
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:41,957
Trust yourself, and the others might follow.

00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:38,603
I mean, I don't know how it's possible.

168
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:43,042
You hear things living here in Sunnydale,
but nobody actually believes them.

169
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,593
You know, you'd have to be crazy, and...

170
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:49,356
- You guys think that I'm crazy, don't you?
- I don't.

171
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:53,199
- We've seen things, too, Nancy.
- We're gonna take care of this.

172
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:57,358
It's your lucky night. Considering
your dog just got all ate up and stuff.

173
00:13:57,445 --> 00:14:02,121
- Hey, can I freshen up your tea?
- No, that's OK. Thanks.

174
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:07,116
So, this thing came up out of the ground
without any warnings or signs or anything?

175
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:10,720
Just this kind of rumbling,
like just before an earthquake.

176
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:14,241
- From beneath you, it devours.
- What?

177
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:18,200
- Nothing.
- Nothing good.

178
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:21,595
- Sounding monster-ific.
- Shall we round up the gang?

179
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:24,916
Good thinking, except... this is the gang.

180
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:29,123
Look, Nancy, I promise you,
if your dog is alive, we're gonna find him.

181
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:32,720
- The only thing I need is a little...
<i>- (Spike)</i> What you need is help.

182
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,081
Fortunately, you've got me.

183
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:49,203
- Buffy.
- Spike.

184
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:53,880
- Who's that?
- He's...

185
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:56,635
- It's Buffy's...
- Ex.

186
00:14:56,725 --> 00:15:00,240
And I'm thinking it's
a little more complicated than just that.

187
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:02,475
<i>- (Xander)</i> Always is.
- You've changed.

188
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:03,759
I have.

189
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:08,202
New clothing. Better hair.
Not so much with the crazy. I like it.

190
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:10,276
- Now what do you want?
- Easy.

191
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:15,323
If you think I like being surrounded by people
who don't particularly like me,

192
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:16,554
you'd be wrong.

193
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:20,035
If you're uncomfortable,
we can make you leave.

194
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:24,243
I'll be quick. We need to talk.
You want to do that here, or privately?

195
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:27,715
I'm thinking here,
with good friends and pointy weapons.

196
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:30,000
- You said something about quick?
- I did.

197
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:35,835
Before I start, and for the record,
the last you saw me, I was a mess.

198
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,916
Out of my head. Admitted.

199
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:41,884
Last week, living in the school basement...

200
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:44,477
Well, you saw me.

201
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:49,364
You did?

202
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:53,195
- Just a second. Yes, I saw Spike. I didn't...
- What?

203
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,914
- You forgot to mention it?
- Things were insane in the basement.

204
00:15:57,005 --> 00:16:00,520
- I saved your life. We can discuss this later.
- Sure.

205
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:05,042
<i>- (Xander)</i> Whatever you want.
- Right. That's the only time you let us in.

206
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,559
- Whenever you want.
- In fairness to Buffy...

207
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:11,957
- Shut up, Spike!
- OK, guys. Give us a second.

208
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:24,401
- Do not start by saying you're sorry.
- I didn't come here to atone.

209
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,476
- What do you want?
- To help you.

210
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,318
- Help me what?
- I was hoping you'd tell me.

211
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:34,001
You're the Slayer. Connected to the visions.
Long line of worthies, right?

212
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:37,361
I'm a guy with his ear to the ground,
but even I can feel it.

213
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:41,358
Something's coming. I don't know
what exactly, but something's brewing.

214
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:47,122
And it's so big, ugly and damned, it makes
you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces.

215
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,402
And if I'm wrong, say so.
Lovely. No hard feelings.

216
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:54,398
I'll go out that door and you can lock it
behind me with any spell you like.

217
00:16:54,485 --> 00:17:00,082
- So, am I wrong?
- Everything about you is wrong, Spike.

218
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:04,916
But something is coming.

219
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,402
You're gonna need some help.

220
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:11,919
- When did you become people's champion?
- I didn't.

221
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:16,237
I'm just a guy who can lend a hand,
if you'll let me.

222
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:18,361
Ball's in your court, Slayer.

223
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:25,523
We're gonna split. Two pairs. This creature
is burrowing through solid ground.

224
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:29,359
A strength and power we don't usually
deal with, but we may have to get used to,

225
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:33,961
- now the Hellmouth is getting all perky.
- Shouldn't we call the police?

226
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:37,560
- And tell them...?
- I'll stop interrupting.

227
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:41,880
Take Nancy home. Drive, don't walk,
and don't stop till you get there.

228
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:45,241
- Understood.
- Is your girlfriend always this commanding?

229
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:47,204
Who?

230
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:49,324
Buffy?

231
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,722
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. See...

232
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:57,323
I mean, she's a girl, and she's a friend,
but she's not my girlfriend.

233
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:58,804
Xander.

234
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,680
A little drool.

235
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:04,875
Spike and I will check out the scene.

236
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:08,395
OK, in the biggest way,
I am not loving this plan.

237
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:10,763
I'm not loving Spike.

238
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:15,916
<i>- (whispering)</i> He tried to rape you.
- And he failed. I know I can take him.

239
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:18,758
Xander, take Nancy home.
Spike and I will patrol.

240
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm Command Central,
so everybody check in with me.

241
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:27,434
OK, I'll be here doing my homework,
but the other one sounded cooler.

242
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,796
Be safe. Let's go.

243
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:33,396
Righty-o, then.

244
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:35,884
Spike.

245
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,476
You sleep, right?

246
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:43,125
You. Vampires. You sleep?

247
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,400
Yeah. What's your point, niblet?

248
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:50,115
I can't take you in a fight or anything,
even with a chip in your head.

249
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:51,877
But you do sleep.

250
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,956
If you hurt my sister at all.

251
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:58,000
Touch her. You're gonna wake up on fire.

252
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,559
<i>- (Spike)</i> You're awfully quiet.
<i>- (Buffy)</i> Wouldn't know what to say.

253
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:11,433
Fine with me. I was more half-expecting
to get an earful anyway.

254
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,915
And when exactly did your sister
get unbelievably scary?

255
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:18,039
- What are you doing?
- What?

256
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,720
I told you once, straight up,
I'm here to help, and that's all.

257
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:25,277
- Think this here's our spot?
- How'd you guess?

258
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:31,319
- I don't fancy sticking my head in that.
- If something bites it off, that'd be a clue.

259
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,515
- So what happened to you?
- When you saw me,

260
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:49,598
those ghostly types in the school basement,
they were in my head.

261
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:52,279
Made me flat-out, bug-shagging crazy.

262
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,720
And I'm not bragging about it,
but they were stronger than I was.

263
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:59,797
Made me see things, do things.

264
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:07,244
- Why did you not tell anyone you saw me?
- I don't know. I guess...

265
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:12,399
- I was partly hoping you were a mirage.
- Sorry to disappoint.

266
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:16,403
- Not your fault.
- Hold the torch, would you?

267
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:29,636
Look, this...

268
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:33,843
Us working together is not a way
to get back together, if that's what you want.

269
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,722
It's not.

270
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:41,198
- Look, I can't blame you for being all skittish.
- Skittish?

271
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:43,480
That's not a word I would use for it.

272
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:45,997
You tried to rape me.

273
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,404
- I don't have the words.
- Neither do I.

274
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:55,437
I can't say sorry. Can't use forgive me.

275
00:20:57,045 --> 00:21:00,560
All I can say is, Buffy, I've changed.

276
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:04,242
- I believe you.
- Well, that's something.

277
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:07,044
I just don't know what you've changed into.

278
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:11,958
You come back to town,
you make with the big surprises. Twice.

279
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:16,197
I don't know what your game is,
but I know you're not telling me something.

280
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:18,879
You're right. There is.

281
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:24,993
But we're not best friends any more,
so too bad for me. I'm not sharing.

282
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:29,036
We've been through things.
The end of the world and back.

283
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:33,118
I can be useful cos, honestly,
I've got nothing better to do.

284
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:35,036
Make use of me if you want.

285
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:42,437
And there's nothing here. Just a bit of slime.
Mounds of displaced dirt and such.

286
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,914
Whatever our beastie is, he's gone.

287
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,117
I still can't believe that all this is happening.

288
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:10,562
Even with this town's reputation for,
you know, unexplained weirdness.

289
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:14,194
Right. Sunnydale: come for the food,
stay for the dismemberment.

290
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:16,914
There's good food?

291
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:21,156
Well, thanks. <i>(clears throat)</i>

292
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:25,515
That's a couple levels of lameness
right there, me saying,

293
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:28,517
"thanks" after everything
you've done for me tonight.

294
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:31,881
You could slip me a twenty,
but then I'd have to act offended.

295
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:34,115
Got it. So...

296
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:39,074
D'you think I might, instead,
give you a call sometime?

297
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:41,679
- To check in?
- No, actually, I'm hitting on you.

298
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:43,756
Even better. I'm very listed.

299
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:48,282
And I'm really pushy,
so that works out well, then.

300
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:53,200
- Good night.
- Um...

301
00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:58,637
<i>- (rumbling)</i>
- Nancy...

302
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:03,242
I just got a swell idea.

303
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:06,600
- Run!
- Aargh!

304
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:17,195
<i>- (screeching)</i>
- Aargh!

305
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,800
- Are you OK?
- I just...

306
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:30,325
Dumb question.
Are you injured? Are you hurt?

307
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:33,840
I don't think so. I just...

308
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:36,519
I don't think that I can take any more of this.

309
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:43,720
Two attacks in the same night.
I'm starting to think it's not coincidence.

310
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:46,603
Oh, sure. Why not?
A monster trying to kill me.

311
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:50,724
It's just the thing that was missing
to make my life absolutely perfect.

312
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,603
Urgh! Ronnie would love this. Boy!

313
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,404
Right.

314
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:59,794
- Who's Ronnie?
- Oh.

315
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:05,720
Only my psycho ex-boyfriend that I've been
trying to get rid of for the past few weeks.

316
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:10,674
I almost prefer the monster.
Ronnie was... trouble.

317
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:13,199
Uh-huh. And I'm just curious...

318
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,642
Was this Ronnie guy
a borrowing-money kind of trouble

319
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:22,196
or was he a raising-demon
trouble kind of guy?

320
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,116
Ronnie? He couldn't...

321
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:29,436
He just...

322
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:33,401
"He was an abusive bastard"
is the catchy headline.

323
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:35,874
And he'd just show up, even after...

324
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:43,802
You know the feeling you get when your ex
constantly ruins your life, and doesn't stop?

325
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:46,518
Yes.

326
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:51,998
And you get so tired of feeling helpless
that all you can do is wish that it would stop?

327
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:55,324
Wish?

328
00:24:55,805 --> 00:24:59,798
And it's not the fact that he cheated,
it's the way he cheated, you know?

329
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:03,036
I mean, we could have talked.
I could have handled it.

330
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,434
Uh-huh. Uh-huh, I get it. Go on.

331
00:25:05,525 --> 00:25:09,313
You know what he is?
He's spineless. Yeah, that's it.

332
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:12,715
He's like this spineless little pig.

333
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:16,081
- And you know what I wish?
- God, do I want to.

334
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:24,397
You were saying?

335
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:27,874
- I want more quesadillas.
- Before that.

336
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:29,956
- A Margarita.
- After that.

337
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:34,641
Oh, yeah. God, my boyfriend's spineless.
He should just...

338
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:40,482
- He should just be spineless for real.
- No spine. Got it. I can do that.

339
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:42,437
What do you mean?

340
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:47,121
See, honey, what I'm driving us towards here
is: sometimes, don't you just wish that...

341
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:48,354
Oh, penis!

342
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,763
Is this the one you talked to?

343
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:54,799
I tell you what - why don't we put a pin in it?

344
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:59,083
Why don't you get yourself a drink,
and we'll pick it up in a few, OK?

345
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:05,317
- You guys, I am working here.
- We noticed.

346
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:07,517
That's why we're here.

347
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:11,837
Right. Did you turn this nice lady's ex
into a giant worm monster?

348
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,002
- Yes.
- No way!

349
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:19,316
- Are you saying that thing was Ronnie?
- You wish it, I dish it.

350
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:22,954
I thought we were clear.
I didn't think you'd go all narc on me.

351
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:26,117
- You wished your ex was a worm?
- We were just talking.

352
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:29,713
Anya has a way of making things happen.

353
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,765
I had a quota. He had it coming.
What's the big?

354
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:34,358
I think I'm gonna be sick.

355
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:39,394
Anya, that thing you created burst through
solid pavement and ate her dog.

356
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:42,795
- Oh, puppy!
- Wait, that gets your sad noise?

357
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:47,037
People's lives are in danger,
and you give it up for the Yorkie?

358
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:50,322
- You never understood me.
- Xander, who is this woman?

359
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:52,202
Anya? She's...

360
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:55,964
Anya. My ex.

361
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:59,715
- Oh.
- Hey, nobody's bragging here.

362
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:01,433
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

363
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:05,195
Hey! Hands off the merchandise, Spike.

364
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:07,602
You don't get to go there again.

365
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:10,961
Please! I've already forgotten
about our time together.

366
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:13,764
- I thought you were Xander's ex-girlfriend.
- I am.

367
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:16,162
- But you and Spike...
- Had a thing.

368
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:18,315
- Didn't last.
- Weren't you, Buffy...

369
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,043
- Briefly.
- Never serious.

370
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:23,557
Is there anyone here
that hasn't slept together?

371
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:27,718
At least we're all bipeds, which is more
than I can say for Ronnie, the worm boy.

372
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:29,841
Guys, can we focus here for a second?

373
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:33,520
Anya, this is Ronnie, OK?
He wasn't a worm. Worms are like this big.

374
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,961
- This thing was like...
- Sluggoth demon. Am I right?

375
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:41,597
- Maybe.
- Wait, I didn't wish for that. I mean...

376
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:44,483
I don't know what this
whatchamacallit demon thing is.

377
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:49,798
Sluggoth demon. It's a large, nasty, natural
predator who died around the Crusades.

378
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,797
Same phylum.
It's not cheating. I just embellished.

379
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:54,876
Well, you can unembellish now.

380
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:59,237
Bite me, Harris. I have rules to work with.

381
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:04,956
Vengeance demon codes of conducts that
you'll never understand cos you're all so...

382
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:08,799
- human.
<i>- (Spike)</i> I'm not.

383
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:13,197
I'm a demon, just like yourself, Anya.

384
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:18,439
Now, you're gonna turn the spell around like
a good little vengeance demon or I... what?

385
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:22,080
- Oh, my God!
- What are you staring at?

386
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:26,203
- Oh, my God!
- Right. Let's go.

387
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:28,753
- How did you do it?
- What is she talking about?

388
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:31,917
- I can see you.
- Nothing. Got some worm hunting to do.

389
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:33,643
- How did you do it?
- Shut up!

390
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:35,204
- You...
- Shut your mouth!

391
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:37,845
- How did you get it?
- I said you shut up!

392
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:56,239
I am so gonna kick your ass.

393
00:28:57,005 --> 00:29:00,441
- Right, bitch. Round and round...
- You haven't changed, Spike.

394
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:09,399
Working out some personal issues, are we?

395
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:16,844
Hey, I guess this would be first contact
since, you know when.

396
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:19,393
Ooh, up for another round
on the balcony, then?

397
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:30,799
Right you are, love.
I haven't changed. Not a lick.

398
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:35,879
And watching your face trying to
figure me out was absolutely delicious.

399
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:39,036
<i>- (Xander)</i> Buffy!
- Not now Xander.

400
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:42,242
Nancy. She's gone.
And out there all alone, she's worm bait.

401
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:48,400
I'll go find her. You stay with Anya.
Get her to reverse that spell.

402
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:52,683
Hey, is that it? A little touchy-feely,
and you're off to the bat poles?

403
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:59,517
Freaks!
Why do I surround myself with freaks?

404
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:01,596
<i>(rumbling)</i>

405
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:05,877
Oh, God.

406
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:08,557
Oh, God.

407
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:25,240
Help! Somebody help me!

408
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,964
<i>(rumbling)</i>

409
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,676
<i>(rumbling stops)</i>

410
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,925
Aargh! Help me!

411
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:57,876
Help me!

412
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:07,203
- What do you want me to do?
- Reverse the spell.

413
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:09,276
- It's not that easy.
- You can do it.

414
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:14,041
Yeah, sure, the spell part. What about me?
I'm in enough trouble as it is.

415
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:18,482
Halfrek's all over my case.
D'Hoffryn is not pleased with my work.

416
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:22,922
- You don't want to see him angry. Trust me.
- Nice friends you got.

417
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:26,600
Nice friends I had.
Chums, co-workers, bridesmaids.

418
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:31,315
I had the whole package until something
fell apart. What could that be?

419
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:33,361
Are you saying this was my fault?

420
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:37,484
All I'm saying is none of this happened
until you dumped me at the altar.

421
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:41,797
And sooner or later, Anya,
that excuse just stops working.

422
00:31:46,645 --> 00:31:48,761
Aargh!

423
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:11,243
You've had your turn, love.
Leave the real violence to the demons, yeah?

424
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,593
That's right. Big bad's back.

425
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:17,802
And looking for a little death!

426
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,002
- Aargh!
- Aargh!

427
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:32,041
<i>(Ronnie)</i> Ow!

428
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:35,557
I'm sorry.

429
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,559
Right. Wrong.

430
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:46,113
Wrong manoeuvre. Not hardly helpful.

431
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:48,196
God, please help me.

432
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:50,394
Help me!

433
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:53,955
You're not the one who needs help.
He's going into shock.

434
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:56,639
No. No. Too much, too much,
too much, too much...

435
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,193
I need an ambulance.
Someone's been stabbed.

436
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:03,881
Oh, God, corner of Third and Fairview.
OK, help is coming. Try not to move.

437
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:06,479
- ..deep inside me.
- Whatever you're doing...

438
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:08,476
Get away. Get...

439
00:33:08,565 --> 00:33:11,159
Do it somewhere else. I am through with this.

440
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:15,718
Lucky girl. Call it quits.
There's an option. If only it were so easy.

441
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:17,636
If only... if only... if only...

442
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:20,876
What the hell are you screaming about?
I can hear you.

443
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:24,960
No need to <i>shout!</i>

444
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:31,523
I get it.

445
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:34,073
Joke's on me. Lots of laughs.

446
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:38,600
Yeah. Hey, bring the wife and kiddies.
Come see the show.

447
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:42,443
This is gonna be a circus. This...

448
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:49,000
is just the beginning, love. A warm-up act.

449
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:54,284
The real headliner's coming, and
when that band hits the stage, all of this...

450
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:59,881
All this will come tumbling
in death and screaming,

451
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:02,684
horror and bloodshed.

452
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:06,684
From beneath you, it devours.

453
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:10,876
From beneath...

454
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:14,244
Poor Rocky.

455
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:25,634
Buffy!

456
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:33,243
You.

457
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:35,077
You did this.

458
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:37,323
What are you?

459
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:45,153
- She's not calling me.
- OK. Help is on the way. Look after him.

460
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:47,603
Where are you going?

461
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:55,078
- You do know you did the right thing here?
- Tell him that.

462
00:34:55,165 --> 00:34:57,884
You reversed the spell. It took guts.

463
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,877
I know this is bad, but it could be worse.

464
00:35:02,085 --> 00:35:04,076
Oh, it will be.

465
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:46,715
<i>- (Spike)</i> Didn't work.
- What the hell...

466
00:35:46,805 --> 00:35:49,444
It didn't work. Costume.

467
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:51,884
Didn't help.

468
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:54,197
Couldn't hide.

469
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:00,516
- No more mind games, Spike.
- No more mind games.

470
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:02,197
No more mind.

471
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:08,794
- Tell me what happened to you.
- Hey, hey, hey! No touching.

472
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:12,203
Am I flesh? Am I flesh to you?

473
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:15,000
Feed on flesh. My flesh.

474
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,355
Nothing else. Not a spark. Oh, fine.

475
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,319
Flesh then.

476
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:23,923
Solid through.

477
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:26,200
Get it hard. Service the girl.

478
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:29,003
Stop it!

479
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:34,559
Right.

480
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:37,795
Girl doesn't wanna be serviced.

481
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,396
Because there's no spark.

482
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:43,036
Ain't we in a sodding engine?

483
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:46,639
Spike, have you completely lost your mind?

484
00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:48,875
Well, yes. Where have you been all night?

485
00:36:48,965 --> 00:36:52,196
You thought you would
come back here and... be with me?

486
00:36:52,685 --> 00:36:55,882
- First time for everything.
- This is all you get.

487
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:59,560
I'm listening. Tell me what happened.

488
00:37:01,445 --> 00:37:04,437
- I tried to find it, of course.
- Find what?

489
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:07,119
The spark. The missing...

490
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:10,724
The piece that fit.

491
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:16,156
That would make me fit.
Because you didn't want...

492
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:20,764
I can't.

493
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:23,277
Not with you looking.

494
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:31,562
I dreamed of killing you.

495
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:42,560
I think they were dreams.

496
00:37:44,645 --> 00:37:46,636
So weak.

497
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:49,241
Did you make me weak?

498
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,721
Thinking of you,

499
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:56,595
holding myself and spilling
useless buckets of salt over your...

500
00:37:58,045 --> 00:37:59,444
ending?

501
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:03,114
Angel, he should've warned me.

502
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:07,198
Makes a good show,
but forget it, it's here, in me.

503
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:09,957
All the time.

504
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:12,763
The spark.

505
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:20,680
I wanted to give you what you deserve.

506
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:24,197
And I got it.

507
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,673
They put the spark in me and now all it does...

508
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,357
is burn.

509
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:36,282
<i>(whispers)</i> Your soul.

510
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:41,154
Bit worse for lack of use.

511
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:46,076
You got your soul back.

512
00:38:47,165 --> 00:38:50,282
- How?
- It's what you wanted, right?

513
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:53,596
It's what <i>you</i> wanted, right?

514
00:38:56,885 --> 00:39:00,594
And now everybody's in here, talking.

515
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:03,434
Everything I did... everyone I...

516
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:05,404
And him.

517
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:10,083
And it. The other.

518
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:13,760
The thing beneath... beneath you.

519
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,876
It's here too. Everybody.

520
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:20,557
They all just tell me go... go...

521
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:23,723
to hell.

522
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:26,879
Why?

523
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:31,444
- Why would you do...
- Buffy, shame on you.

524
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:37,193
Why does a man do what he mustn't?
For her. To be hers.

525
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:40,753
To be the kind of man who would nev...

526
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:45,516
To be a kind of man.

527
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:52,275
And she shall look on him with forgiveness,

528
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,323
and everybody will forgive and love.

529
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:00,437
And he will be loved.

530
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:06,796
So everything's OK, right?

531
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:12,636
<i>(sizzling)</i>

532
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:14,716
Can we rest now?

533
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:18,124
Buffy?

534
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:24,402
Can we rest?
