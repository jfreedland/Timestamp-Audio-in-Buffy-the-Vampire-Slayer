1
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:21,850
Come on, Mom! She's always late.

2
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:26,729
Are you lost?

3
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:28,267
No.

4
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:31,758
My mom's just supposed
to pick me up, is all.

5
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:33,959
Do you want me to walk you home?

6
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:36,137
No, thank you.

7
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:39,969
My mummy used to sing me to sleep at night.

8
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:43,174
# Run and catch

9
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:48,843
# The lamb is caught
in the blackberry patch

10
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:53,090
She had the sweetest voice.

11
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:59,393
What will your mummy sing
when they find your body?

12
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:03,179
I'm not supposed to talk to people.

13
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:07,779
Oh. Well, I'm not a person, see?
So that's just...

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,839
Run home.

15
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,830
My Angel!

16
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:25,703
Hello, Drusilla.

17
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:31,584
Do you remember the song
Mummy used to sing me?

18
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:33,644
Pretty.

19
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:36,224
I remember.

20
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,874
- Yes, you do.
- Drusilla, leave here.

21
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,195
I'm offering you that chance.
Take Spike and get out.

22
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:46,445
Or you'll hurt me?

23
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:52,649
No. No, you can't. Not any more.

24
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:57,143
If you don't leave,
it'll go badly... for all of us.

25
00:01:57,178 --> 00:02:00,656
My dear boy's gone all away, hasn't he?

26
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:04,821
To her.

27
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,711
Who?

28
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,404
The girl. The Slayer.

29
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:21,643
Your heart stinks of her.

30
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:30,026
Poor little thing.
She has no idea what's in store.

31
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:36,831
This can't go on, Drusilla. It's gotta end.

32
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:40,727
Oh, no, my pet.

33
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,588
This is just the beginning.

34
00:03:56,007 --> 00:04:01,553
<b>"Lie to Me"</b>

35
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:04,828
- It's a secret.
- What kind of a secret?

36
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,489
Uh, the kind that's secret. You know,
where I don't actually tell you what it is.

37
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:10,955
I think it's customary that when
two people are going out on an evening

38
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:13,069
that they, they both have an idea
of where they're going.

39
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:15,600
Come on!
Where is your sense of adventure?

40
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:19,092
How will I know what to wear?

41
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,676
Do you own anything else?

42
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,733
- Er, well, not as such, no.
- Rupert, you're gonna have to trust me.

43
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:31,312
- All right. I'll put myself in your hands.
- That sounds like fun.

44
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:34,399
- OK, tomorrow night, 7:30, right?
- Yes.

45
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,056
- Hey.
- Hello. Um...

46
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,122
- Did we... hunt last night?
- I did a couple of quick sweeps downtown.

47
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:44,432
- Any encounters?
- Nothing vampirey.

48
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:49,516
I've been researching our friend Spike.
The profile is fairly unappetizing.

49
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:52,557
But I-I still haven't got a bead
on why he's here.

50
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,438
You'll figure it out.

51
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,279
You all right? You seem a little glum.

52
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:01,031
- I'm fine.
- Why don't you take the night off?

53
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:03,453
OK. That'd be nice.

54
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:06,227
Yes. You could
spend some time with Angel.

55
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:10,909
I don't know.
He... might have other plans.

56
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,192
Well, it seems like Louis XVI
was just sort of a weak king.

57
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:21,614
That's fair enough.
Uh, any other impressions?

58
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:24,710
I just don't see why everyone's
always picking on Marie Antoinette.

59
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:28,430
I can so relate to her. She worked
really hard to look that good

60
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:30,853
and people just
don't appreciate that kind of effort.

61
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:33,709
And I know the peasants were all depressed.

62
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:36,842
I think you mean "oppressed".

63
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,023
Whatever. They were cranky.

64
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:41,620
So they're like
"Let's lose some heads!"

65
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:45,244
That's fair. And-and
Marie Antoinette cared about them.

66
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,603
She was gonna let them have cake.

67
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,357
Yes, well. That's
a very interesting perspective.

68
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,297
Um... Would anyone else like to comment?

69
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,559
I don't know. I don't think so.

70
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,391
- They seemed pretty friendly.
- Who's friendly?

71
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:03,446
- No one.
- Angel and a girl.

72
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:05,920
Willow, do we have to be
in total share mode?

73
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:09,096
Hey, it's me! If Angel's doing
something wrong, I wanna know.

74
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:12,841
- 'Cause it gives me a happy.
- I'm glad someone has a happy.

75
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:16,066
Oh, you just need cheering up.
And I know just the thing.

76
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:20,179
- Crazed dance party at the Bronze!
- I don't know.

77
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,322
Very calm dance party at the Bronze?

78
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,077
Moping at the Bronze?

79
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:29,597
I'd suggest a box of Oreos
dunked in apple juice,

80
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,786
but maybe she's over that phase.

81
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:33,957
- Ford?
- Hey, Summers. How you been?

82
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:37,055
- Oh, my God! What are you doing here?
- Uh, matriculating.

83
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,163
Huh?

84
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,815
I'm finishing out
my senior year at Sunnydale High.

85
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,556
- Dad got transferred.
- This is great!

86
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:46,559
Why d'you think so?
Didn't think you'd remember me.

87
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:50,508
Remember you? Duh! We only went
to school together for seven years!

88
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,253
- You were my giant fifth-grade crush.
- So! You two know each other?

89
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:57,724
Oh, I'm sorry. Um, this is Ford. Uh...

90
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,983
- Billy Fordham, this is Xander and Willow.
- Hi.

91
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:03,115
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

92
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,670
Uh, Ford and I went to
Hemery together in LA.

93
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:09,223
- And now you're here. For real?
- Dad got the transfer and... boom!

94
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:11,970
He just dragged me out of Hemery
and put me down here.

95
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:15,371
- So you two were sweeties in fifth grade?
- Not even!

96
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:19,653
- Ford wouldn't give me the time of day.
- I was a manly sixth-grader.

97
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:21,809
Couldn't be bothered
with a girl that young.

98
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,287
It was terrible.
I moped over you for months.

99
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:29,432
Sitting in my room listening to
that Divinyls song 'I Touch Myself'.

100
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,201
Of course, I had no idea
what it was about!

101
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:37,696
Hey, are you busy tonight?
We're going to the Bronze.

102
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,950
It's the local club and you have to come.

103
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:44,606
I'd love to, but if... you guys
already had plans, would I be imposing?

104
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:47,751
- Oh, only in the literal sense.
- OK, then!

105
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:50,536
I gotta find the admissions office,
uh, get my papers in order.

106
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,286
Well, you know? I'll take you there
and I'll see you guys in French.

107
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,525
It's good to meet you.

108
00:07:57,672 --> 00:08:01,870
This is Ford,
my bestest friend of all my friends!

109
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:04,458
Jeez, doesn't she know any fat guys?

110
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,567
Oh, that's what that song is about?!

111
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,999
- Ford, you made it.
- It wasn't hard to find.

112
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:22,464
Buffy, Ford was just telling us
about the ninth grade beauty contest

113
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,580
and the, uh, swimsuit competition.

114
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:27,616
Oh, my God, Ford, stop that!

115
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:30,160
The more people you tell,
the more people I have to kill.

116
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:33,388
You can't touch me, Summers.
I know all your darkest secrets.

117
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:37,042
- Care to make a small wager on that?
- I'm gonna go get a drink.

118
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:40,104
Ford... try not to talk.

119
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:48,829
- Oh.
- Hey. I was hoping you'd show.

120
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:51,447
- That's Angel.
- He's Buffy's beau.

121
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,408
Her special friend.

122
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:56,236
He's not in school, right?
He looks older than her.

123
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:58,538
You're not wrong.

124
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,623
So...

125
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,609
- What did you do last night?
- Nothin'.

126
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,618
Nothing at all? You ceased to exist?

127
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,682
No, I mean I stayed in, read.

128
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,207
Oh.

129
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:24,064
- Didn't want that soda after all?
- Not thirsty.

130
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:27,632
- Hey, Angel.
- Hi.

131
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,043
This is Ford.
We went to school together in LA.

132
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:34,968
- Nice to meet you.
- Whoa! Cold hands.

133
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:37,261
You're not wrong.

134
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:42,079
- So, you're here visiting Buffy?
- No, I'm actually here to stay.

135
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,179
- We've just moved down.
- Hey, Angel, do you wanna play?

136
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:49,775
You know, it's getting really crowded
in here tonight. Um, I'm a little hot.

137
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,468
- You wanna take a walk?
- Um, sure. That'd be nice.

138
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:56,830
OK, then. I'll... see you tomorrow.

139
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,219
- Good night.
- Take care.

140
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,606
- OK, once more, with tension.
- He just moved here?

141
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:09,109
Yeah, and boy, does he move fast!

142
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:12,336
Well, Angel, we could still play.

143
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,572
See? You made him do
that thing where he's gone!

144
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,041
So... that was your boyfriend?

145
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:26,437
No... Uh, yeah. Maybe.

146
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,695
Could we lay off
the tough questions for a while?

147
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:30,257
Sorry.

148
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,411
So... What else
do you do for fun around here?

149
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,764
Um... My purse! I... I left my purse at
the Bronze. Uh, could you get it for me?

150
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,641
- Uh, OK.
- Good.

151
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:44,266
Run! Thanks!

152
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,488
No!

153
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,359
- What's goin' on?
- Um...

154
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:36,112
There was a... cat. A cat, here.

155
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:39,040
And, um, then there was... another cat.

156
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:43,271
And they fought. The cats.
And... then they left.

157
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,522
Oh. I thought you were
just slaying a vampire.

158
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,940
What? Whatting a what?

159
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,179
I know, Buffy. You don't have to lie.

160
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:55,832
I've been trying to figure out
the right time to... to tell you.

161
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:58,772
I know you're the Slayer.

162
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:03,143
- Just like that, he told you?
- Just like that.

163
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:05,942
Said he found out right before
I got booted from Hemery.

164
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:08,961
Wow! It's neat!
Is it neat?

165
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,147
Yeah, I guess it is.

166
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:14,993
I don't have to constantly worry
that he's gonna find out my dark secret.

167
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:19,285
And it just makes everything... easier.

- Ford? Hi, Ford.
- Hey.

170
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:03,125
- Well, how did it go?
- It went good.

171
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:06,657
Good? That's it? That's all we...?

172
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,970
- Well, when are we...?
- Soon.

173
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:12,106
Oh, soon, OK. You know, you could
give me more information here.

174
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:14,633
I'm trusting you.
I'm out on a limb here.

175
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,138
Not to mention, the lease is almost up
on this place. Who's gonna cover that?

176
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,866
- Marvin...
- Diego!

177
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,169
Come on, man, it's Diego now.

178
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:27,435
Diego. Ritalin.
Everything's gonna be fine.

179
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,928

you're ready when I say.

00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:36,185
- I can't wait.
- Right. Whatever.

182
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:38,209
I still think
I should be in on the plan.

183
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:41,378
Diego, you gotta trust me.

Oh, well...

- No! I just...

00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:52,891
I'm not supposed to have boys in my room.

200
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,051
I promise to behave myself.

201
00:14:55,086 --> 00:14:57,484
OK. Good.

202
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,540
- I guess I need help.
- Help? You mean, like, on homework?

203
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:05,369
No, 'cause you're old
and you already know stuff.

204
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,571
I want you to track someone down...
on the Net.

205
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:11,443
Oh! Great! I'm so the Net girl.

206
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:14,580
I just wanna find everything I can:
records, affiliates...

207
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,285
I'm not even sure
what I'm looking for yet.

208
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,466
- Great, what's the name?
- Billy Fordham.

209
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:24,161
Uh, Angel, if I say something
you really don't wanna hear,

210
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:27,235
do you promise not to bite me?

211
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:32,085
- Are you gonna tell me that I'm jealous?
- Well, you do sometimes get that way.

212
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:34,816
You know, I never used to.

213
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,068
Things used to be pretty simple.

214
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,912
A hundred years...
just hanging out, feeling guilty.

215
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:44,023
I really honed my brooding skills.

216
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:46,887
Then she comes along.

217
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:51,771
Yeah, I get jealous.

218
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:56,325
But I know people,
and my gut tells me this is a wrong guy.

219
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,216
OK, but if there isn't anything weird...

220
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,019
- Hey, that's weird.
- What?

221
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:07,027
I just checked the school records
and he's not in them.

222
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:09,479
I mean, usually they
transfer your grades and stuff,

223
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,752
but he's not even registered.

224
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,918
He said he was in school
with you guys, right?

225
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:16,027
- Let me just see if I can...
- Willow?

226
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,208
- Are you still up?
- Ack! Go!

227
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,236
Uh, I'm just going to bed now, Mom!

228
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,954
Come by tomorrow at sunset.
I'll keep looking.

229
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:24,875
Don't tell Buffy
what we're doing, all right?

230
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:26,908
You want me to lie to her?
It's Buffy!

231
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:29,351
Just don't bring it up
till we know what's what.

232
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,735
- OK. It's probably nothing.
- That'd be nice.

233
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:45,816
Willow!

234
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:49,320
- What's up?
- Nothing.

235
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:51,137
Do you wanna hang?
We're cafeteria bound.

236
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:54,479
I-I'm gonna do work in the computer lab...

237
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,927
on schoolwork that I have.

238
00:16:56,948 --> 00:17:01,616
- So I cannot hang just now. Hi, Ford.
- Morning.

239
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,221
- OK, Will, fess up.
- What?

240
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:08,587
Are you drinking coffee again?
'Cause we've talked about this.

241
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:14,015
It makes me jumpy.
I... have to go... away.

242
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:18,364
- Nice girl.
- There aren't two of those in the world!

243
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:21,439
Buffy! Erm... Yes, er...

244
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,990
Ms. Calendar and I are going...
somewhere tonight.

245
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:28,453
And she's given me
the number of her beeper thingy,

246
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:30,192
er, in case you need me...

247
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:34,074
for, erm, study help... suddenly.

248
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:36,521
- He knows, Giles.
- What?

249
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,073
- Ford knows I'm the Slayer.
- I know.

250
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:44,195
Oh. Er, very good, yes.

251
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,997
Buffy? Excuse me.

252
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:50,321
You're not... by any chance
betraying your... secret identity...

253
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:53,272
just to impress cute boys, are you?

254
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,865
I didn't tell him. He knew.

255
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,511
Oh. Er, right then.
Just remember, if you...

256
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:04,658
Go! Experience this thing called fun.
I'll try not to have a crisis.

257
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:11,462
And on your right, once again,
the beautiful campus.

258
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,643
I think you've now seen
everything there is to see in Sunnydale.

259
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:17,311
Well, it's really...

260
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,942
- Feel free to say "dull".
- OK. Dull is good.

261
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:25,685
Or maybe not so dull.

262
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,785
Is that more vampires?

263
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:32,584
It must be the weather.

264
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,585
Stay close to me.

265
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:54,683
- Maybe they were just passing through.
- I don't think so.

266
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,988
You got one chance to live.
Tell me what I wanna know

267
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,773
and I'll let you go.

268
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,832
- Where's the other one?
- I killed her.

269
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:26,069
I-I killed her and she just...
turned to dust. It was... amazing.

270
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:30,889
The only thing I could track down
was this address. The Sunset Club.

271
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,223
Still didn't find anything incriminating.

272
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:36,250
He leaves no paper trail, no records.
That's incriminating enough.

273
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:38,319
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go
with Dead Boy on this one.

274
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:41,137
Could you not call me that?

275
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,519
We're friends of Ford's.

276
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:57,867
Boy, we blend right in.

277
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,906
In no way do we stick out
like sore thumbs.

278
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:02,459
Let's look around.
You guys check out downstairs.

279
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,436
Sure thing, Bossy the Cow!

280
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,057
- OK, but do they really stick out?
- What?

281
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:10,090
Sore thumbs. Do they stick out?

282
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:13,934
I mean, have you ever seen a thumb
and gone "Wow! That baby is sore"?

283
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:16,409
You have too many thoughts.

00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:29,110
Are you probably noticing a theme here?

289
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,057
As in "vampires, yay"?.

- Vampires.

Oh, we usually call them
the nasty, pointy, bitey ones.

So many people have that misconception.

You don't have to be

I mean, they're children making up
bedtime stories of friendly vampires

306
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:30,832
- to comfort themselves in the dark.
- Is that so bad?

307
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:33,094
These people don't know
anything about vampires!

308
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:37,247
What they are,
how they live, how they dress.

You know, I love a good diatribe,

310
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:46,366

bestest friend of the Slayer,

311
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:48,521
is hangin' with a bunch of
vampire wannabes.

312
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:52,843
Something's up with him.
You're right about that.

00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:58,129
Sorry to beep you guys
in the middle of... stuff,

314
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:01,786
- but it seemed really weird.
- No. You did the right thing. Absolutely.

315
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:05,364
- You hated it that much?
- No, but-but, uh...

316
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:08,264
Vampires on campus
could have implications.

317
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:10,750
- Very, very grave.
- You could've just said something.

318
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,584
Uh, honestly, I, I've always, I've always
been interested in, in,

319
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:16,753
uh, monster trucks.

320
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:19,477

- I thought it would be a change.

321
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,909
- It was a change.
- Look, we could've just left.

322
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:25,477
Wha-what, and miss the nitro-burning
funny cars? No, couldn't have that.

323
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,762
OK, can we get back
on the vampire tip here?

324
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,881
These guys were here with a purpose.

325
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:34,010
Yes, yes, and, uh, we must, uh,
ascertain what that purpose is.

- Where's your friend?
- I sent him home.

327
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:40,292
Good. The less he's involved
in all this, the safer he'll be.

328
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,495
He did bag a vamp his first time out.

329
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,896
Gotta give him credit for... that.

330
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:49,599

- Erm, she's called... Drusilla.

332
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:59,977
A sometime paramour of Spike's.
She was killed by an angry mob in Prague.

333
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,025
Well, they don't make angry mobs like
they used to, 'cause this girl's alive.

334
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,727
- I saw her with Angel.
- With Angel?

335
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,186
Isn't he supposed to be a good guy?

336
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,240
Yeah. He is.

337
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:14,863
I think maybe we need to
read up on this nice lady.

338
00:23:14,898 --> 00:23:17,722
Well, some of my...
newer volumes may be more helpful.

339
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:19,926
My own research has...

340
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,204
Are you guys OK?

341
00:23:29,205 --> 00:23:32,162
A book! It took one of my books!

342
00:23:32,197 --> 00:23:34,919
Well, at least
someone in this school is reading.

343
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:37,757
He said he killed it.

344
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:41,194
That's the vampire Ford said he killed.

345
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:49,909
You sing the sweetest little song...
Won't you sing for me, hm?

346
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,811
Don't you love me any more?

347
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:56,788
Darling. I heard a funny thing just now.

348
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:03,149
Lucius tells me that you
went out on a hunt the other night.

349
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:07,890
My tummy was growly... and you were out.

350
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,911
Come on.

351
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:16,444
- I'll pout if you don't sing.
- You, um, meet anyone?

352
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:21,551
Anyone interesting? Like Angel?

353
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:25,331
- Angel...
- Yeah.

354
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,891
So...

355
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,107
What might you guys
have talked about, then?

356
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:34,423
Old times? Childhood pranks?

357
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,320
It's a little off, you two so friendly,
him being the enemy and all that.

358
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:44,679
- I'll give you a seed if you sing.
- The bird's dead, Dru.

359
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:47,046
You left it in a cage
and you didn't feed it

360
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:51,401
and now it's all dead,
just like the last one.

361
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,235
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

362
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:59,051
I'm a bad, rude man.

363
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:03,295
I just don't like you goin' out,
that's all. You are weak.

364
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:10,577
Would you like a new bird?
One that's not dead?

365
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:13,168
This is so cool!

366
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:18,413
- I would totally live here!
- Do I have anyone on watch here?

367
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:22,298
It's called security, people!
Are you all asleep?

368
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,876
Or did we finally find
a restaurant that delivers?

369
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,588
- I know who you are.
- Yeah, I know who I am too. So what?

370
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:35,142
I came looking for you... Spike.

371
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:37,800
You've got a real death wish.

372
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:41,907
It's almost interesting.

373
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,923
Oh, this is great!

374
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,281
This'll be very useful.

375
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:52,750
- So, how did you find me?
- That doesn't matter.

376
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,355
I've got something to offer you.

377
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:58,813
I'm pretty sure this is the part
where you take out a watch

378
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,422
and say I've got 30 seconds to
convince you not to kill me?

379
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:04,195
It's traditional.

380
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,990
Well, I don't go much for tradition.

381
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:10,191
Wait, love.

382
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,383
Well?

383
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:20,684
Oh, come on. Say it!
It's no fun if you don't say it.

384
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:24,058
What?! Oh...

385
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,135
You've got 30 seconds
to convince me not to kill you.

386
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:30,473
Yes! See, this is the best.

387
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:35,111
I wanna be like you. A vampire.

388
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:38,705
I've known you for two minutes
and I can't stand you.

389
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,212
I don't really feature you livin' forever.
Can I eat him now, love?

390
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:46,152
Well, feature this.
I'm offering you a trade.

391
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,439
You make me a vampire...

392
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:53,515
and I give you the Slayer.

393
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:07,694
Buffy. May I come in?

394
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,040
Sure.

395
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,756
I thought once you'd been invited,
you could always just walk in.

396
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:17,231
I can. I was just being polite.

397
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:21,515
- We need to talk.
- Do we?

398
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,444
It's about your friend, Ford.
He's not what he seems.

399
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:27,620
- Who is these days?
- Willow ran him down on the computer.

400
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:29,873
- Willow?
- We found this address,

401
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:33,269
- We checked it out with Xander and it...
- And Xander?

402
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,616
Wow! Everybody's in.
It's like a great big, exciting conspiracy.

403
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:42,794
- What are you talkin' about?
- I'm talking about the people I trust.

404
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,544
Who's Drusilla?

405
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:49,659
And don't lie to me. I'm tired of it.

406
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:51,593
- Some lies are necessary.
- For what?

407
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:55,904
Sometimes the truth is worse.
Live long enough, you find that out.

408
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:59,981
I can take it. I can take the truth.

409
00:28:01,311 --> 00:28:03,688
Do you love me?

410
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,649
What?

411
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:08,756
Do you?

412
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:16,175
I love you.

413
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:19,177
I don't know if I trust you.

414
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:23,949
- Well, maybe you shouldn't do either.
- Maybe I'm the one who should decide!

415
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:29,830
I did a lot of unconscionable things
when I became a vampire.

416
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,230
Drusilla was the worst.

417
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:41,433
She was... an obsession of mine.

418
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:47,410
She was pure and... sweet and chaste.

419
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:51,196
And you made her a vampire.

420
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:54,319
First I made her insane.

421
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:58,116
Killed everybody she loved.

422
00:28:58,151 --> 00:29:01,770
Visited every mental torture
on her I could devise.

423
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:06,205
She eventually fled to a convent.

424
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,456
And on the day
she took her holy orders...

425
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,391
I turned her into a demon.

426
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:21,373
Well...

427
00:29:21,408 --> 00:29:24,449
I asked for the truth.

428
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:29,683
Ford's part of some society
that reveres vampires.

429
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:33,105
Practically worships them.

430
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:36,043
I don't know what he wants from you.

431
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:41,123
But you can't trust him.

432
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:51,486
Buffy!

433
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:56,726
- Ford.
- I had a great time last night.

434
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,229
Well, an interesting time.

435
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:04,069
- I'm glad.
- Do you wanna go out again tonight?

436
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:06,146
- Not busy.
- I sort of had an idea.

437
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:09,175
It's, uh... it's a secret.

438
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:11,741
I kinda wanna surprise you.

439
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:15,219
- I like surprises.
- Can you meet me here?

440
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:17,967
- Sure.
- At nine?

441
00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:20,520
At nine.

442
00:30:22,377 --> 00:30:24,778
It's gonna be fun.

443
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:35,164
Buffy!

444
00:30:35,724 --> 00:30:38,310
Did, uh, Angel...

445
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:41,094
He told me everything.

446
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:44,908
When Angel came to my room,
he was just really concerned for you.

447
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,111
We didn't wanna say anything
in case we were wrong.

448
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:50,854
Did you find out what Ford is up to?

449
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,785
I will.

450
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:03,934
Angel was in your bedroom?!

451
00:31:03,969 --> 00:31:06,531
Ours is a forbidden love.

452
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:12,010
- Chanterelle, is everything ready?
- Of course! It's ready. Hi.

453
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:14,847
I took care of it.
I always take care of it.

454
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:17,015
Is it time? Tonight?

455
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,830
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

456
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:23,125
No. I'm... ready for the change.

457
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:26,207
D'you really think they'll bless us?

458
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,143
I know they will.

459
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,236
What about your friends?
Are they comin'?

460
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:34,296
- What are you talkin' about?
- Your friends. They came last night.

461
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:35,926
- Two guys and a girl.
- One was mean.

462
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:39,246
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- I have to do everything around here.

463
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:42,466
Sorry, Mr. Flawless Plan Guy.
It slipped my mind.

464
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:47,145
It's gonna be all right, isn't it?
They're not gonna let us down?

465
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,788
- It's gonna be fine.
- I need them to bless me.

466
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,005
- It's gonna be fine.
- No.

467
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,658
It's really not.

468
00:31:57,055 --> 00:31:59,675
It's kinda draughty in here.

469
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,369
I'm sorry, Ford.
I just couldn't wait till tonight.

470
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:07,691
- I'm rash and impulsive. It's a flaw.
- We all have flaws.

471
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,993
I'm... still a little fuzzy
on exactly what yours is.

472
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:14,906
I think it has to do with
being a lying scumbag.

473
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:17,701
Everybody lies.

474
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:21,262
What do you want, Ford?
What's this all about?

475
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:24,430
- I really don't think you'd understand.
- I don't need to understand.

476
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:27,020
I just need to know.

477
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:28,962
I'm gonna be one of them.

478
00:32:29,062 --> 00:32:33,142
- You wanna be a vampire?
- I'm going to.

479
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:37,658
You know, vampires are a little picky
about who they change ov...

480
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:42,626
You were gonna offer them a trade!

481
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:45,103
I don't think I wanna talk any more.

482
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:50,192
Yeah, well I still feel awfully chatty.
You were gonna give them me - tonight!

483
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:54,054
- Yes.
- You had to know I'd figure it out.

484
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:56,990
Actually, I was counting on it.

485
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,447
What's supposed to happen tonight?

486
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:12,456
This is so cool! It's just like
it played in my head.

487
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:17,886
You know the part where you ask me what's
supposed to happen? It's already happening.

488
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:30,607
Rigged up special. Once it's closed
it can only be opened from the outside.

489
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,735
As soon as the sun sets, they'll be comin'.

490
00:33:34,353 --> 00:33:36,423
Ford, if these people are still around
when they get here...

491
00:33:36,424 --> 00:33:38,506
We'll be changed. All of us.

492
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:41,381
We're going to ascend
to a new level of consciousness,

493
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:44,888
become like them -
like the lonely ones.

494
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,506
This is the end, Buffy.

495
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,748
No one gets outta here alive.

496
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,865
- There's gotta be another way out of here.
- This is a bomb shelter, Buffy.

497
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:06,453
I knew I wasn't gonna
be able to overpower you,

498
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:08,498
but this is three feet of solid concrete.

499
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:12,141
- At least let the other people go.
- Why are you fighting this?

500
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:15,331
- It's what we want.
- It's a chance for immortality.

501
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:17,736
This is a beautiful day.
Can't you see that?

502
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:20,933
What I see is that
right after the sun goes down,

503
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,102
Spike and all of his friends
are going to be pigging out

504
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,836
at the all-you-can-eat moron bar.

505
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:26,553
OK, that's it.
I think we should gag her.

506
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:29,878
- I think you should try.
- She's an unbeliever. She taints us.

507
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:33,979
I am trying to save you!
You are playing

508
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:36,741
in some serious traffic here.
Do you understand that?

509
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:40,780
You're going to die, and the only hope
you have of surviving this

510
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:46,110
is to get out of this pit right now and...
My God! Could you have a dorkier outfit?

511
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:49,986
You gotta back her up, D.
You look like a big ninny.

512
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:57,291
6:27. Sunset.

513
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:03,996
When we get there,
everybody spread out.

514
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:06,006
Two men on the door.
First priority is the Slayer.

515
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:09,201
Everything else is fair game,
but let's remember to share, people.

516
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:11,936
Are you sure you're up for this?

517
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:15,978
I want a treat. I need a treat.

518
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:20,057
And a special one you'll have.

519
00:35:20,092 --> 00:35:23,044
Lucius, bring the car around.

520
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,948
- Hey, you never give up, do you?
- No, I don't.

521
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:33,212
It's a good quality in a person.
Too many people just take it, but us...

522
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:37,633
- Us? We have something in common now?
- More than you think.

523
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,857
Yeah, well, let me explain
something to you.

524
00:35:39,858 --> 00:35:42,348
You're what we call "the bad guy".

525
00:35:42,597 --> 00:35:45,694
I guess I am.

526
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,189
These people aren't
gonna get changed, are they?

527
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,062
The rest of them, they're just fodder.

528
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:55,502
Technically, yes. But... I'm in.

529
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:57,404
I will become immortal.

530
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,686
Well, I've got a newsflash
for you, brain trust.

531
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:04,669
It's not how it works. You die and
a demon sets up shop in your old house.

532
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:09,280
And it walks and it talks and it
remembers your life, but it's not you.

533
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:13,746
- It's better than nothin'.
- And your life is nothing?

534
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:16,346
Ford, these people don't deserve to die!

535
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:18,991
Well, neither do I!

536
00:36:19,274 --> 00:36:23,963
But apparently no one took that
into consideration, 'cause I'm still dyin'.

537
00:36:26,156 --> 00:36:29,073
I look good, don't I?

538
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:33,392
Well, let me tell you somethin'.
I got maybe six months left,

539
00:36:33,463 --> 00:36:37,229
and by then, what they bury
won't even look like me.

540
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:44,739
I'm gonna be bald and
shriveled and I'll smell bad.

541
00:36:44,774 --> 00:36:47,845
Now I'm not goin' out that way.

542
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:54,735
I'm sorry, Summers.
Did I screw up your righteous-anger riff?

543
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,208
Does the nest of tumors
liquefying my brain kinda spoil the fun?

544
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:07,485
I'm sorry.

545
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:11,301
I had no idea.

546
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:14,579
But what you're doing is still very wrong.

547
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:17,315
OK, well, you try vomiting
for 24 hours straight,

548
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:20,614
because the pain in your head
is so intense, and then...

549
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:25,164
we'll discuss the concept
of right and wrong.

550
00:37:26,841 --> 00:37:29,052
These people are sheep.

551
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:32,494
They wanna be vampires
'cause they're lonely...

552
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:34,101
miserable...

553
00:37:34,102 --> 00:37:36,382
or bored.

554
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:39,469
- I don't have a choice.
- You have a choice.

555
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:42,453
You don't have a good choice,
but you have a choice.

556
00:37:42,482 --> 00:37:44,399
You're opting for mass murder here,

557
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,656
and nothing you say
is gonna make that OK!

558
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:48,680
You think
I need to justify myself to you?

559
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:52,263
I think this is all
part of your little fantasy drama!

560
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:55,416
Isn't this exactly how you imagined it?

561
00:37:55,451 --> 00:37:58,921
You tell me how you've suffered,
and I feel sorry for you.

562
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:04,448
Well, I do feel sorry for you, and if those
vampires come in here and start feeding,

563
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,952
I'll kill you myself!

564
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:12,542
You know what, Summers?

565
00:38:13,763 --> 00:38:17,303
I really did miss you.

566
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:26,770
Ford... help me stop this.

567
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:31,459
Please.

568
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:40,331
People, listen to me!

569
00:38:40,665 --> 00:38:44,913
This is not the mother ship, people!
This is ugly death come to play...

570
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,957
Take them all. Save the Slayer for me.

571
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:51,486
Spike!

572
00:39:52,612 --> 00:39:54,989
Everybody stop!

573
00:39:57,617 --> 00:40:02,622
Good idea. Now you let everybody out
or your girlfriend fits in an ashtray.

574
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:05,500
Let them go.

575
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:18,847
Down the stairs.

576
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,657
Uh, where's the doorknob?

577
00:40:53,198 --> 00:40:56,426
- You guys are just in time.
- Are there vampires?

578
00:40:56,461 --> 00:40:59,175
They're contained.
They'll... get out eventually, though.

579
00:40:59,176 --> 00:41:01,400
We should probably go.

580
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:03,933
We can come back when they're gone.

581
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:05,935
Come back for what?

582
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,342
For the body.

583
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:19,394
- What happened?
- We're stuck in a basement.

584
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,035
Buffy?

585
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:25,914
She's not stuck in the basement.

586
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:30,518
Hey, well... I delivered.
I handed her to you.

587
00:41:30,553 --> 00:41:32,837
Yes. I suppose you did.

588
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:37,918
So? What about my reward?

589
00:42:31,563 --> 00:42:34,023
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

590
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:36,790
You needn't say anything.

591
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:40,864
Be simpler if I could just hate him.

592
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:43,596
I think he wanted me to.

593
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:47,955
I think it made it easier for him
to be the villain of the piece.

594
00:42:48,455 --> 00:42:51,599
Really he was just scared.

595
00:42:51,634 --> 00:42:55,862
- Yes, I suppose he was.
- Nothing's ever simple any more.

596
00:42:55,897 --> 00:42:58,890
I'm constantly trying to work it out.

597
00:42:58,925 --> 00:43:03,296
Who to love or hate, who to trust.

598
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:07,872
It's just like the more I know,
the more confused I get.

599
00:43:07,907 --> 00:43:12,654
Well, I believe that's called growing up.

600
00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:17,184
- I'd like to stop, then. OK?
- I know the feeling.

601
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,848
Does it ever get easy?

602
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:34,501
You mean life?

603
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:38,632
Yeah. Does it get easy?

604
00:43:39,756 --> 00:43:42,417
What do you want me to say?

605
00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:48,039
Lie to me.

606
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,787
Yes, it's terribly simple.

607
00:43:52,585 --> 00:43:55,106
The good guys are always
stalwart and true.

608
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:57,393
The bad guys
are easily distinguished by

609
00:43:57,394 --> 00:43:59,646
their pointy horns or black hats.

610
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:02,478
And, uh, we always defeat them
and save the day.

611
00:44:02,513 --> 00:44:06,823
No one ever dies and...
everybody lives happily ever after.

612
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:10,341
Liar.
