1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,878
- Previously:
- Theywant me back, Buffy. The military.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,560
- This is goodbye?
- Unless you give me a reason to stay,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,035
I'm leavin' tonight.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,156
Riley!

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,476
- Are we havin' a conversation?
- What? No!

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,389
Maybe.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,591
We're getting married.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,109
Double meat is double sweet. Enjoy!

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,312
- Hey, Buffy.
- We're here to support you. Bravo.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,028
You see, Buffy,
the thing you gotta learn about the Palace,

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,515
and this takes a while,

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,519
is that job security
all boils down to one simple thing.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,553
Politics. Now, I'm not a political animal,

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,673
but you learn fast around here,
or it's - wham! - "Hello, glass ceiling. "

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,476
It's not like at Burger World or the Happy
Bun, where the power structure is simple.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,310
At the Palace, you keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,159
It's like Machiavelli says.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,670
- You know Machiavelli?
- Tall guy, bleached mullet, day shifts?

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,758
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting
you dropped out of college.

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,757
- I'm reapplying.
- Good luck.

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,838
Well, gotta motor.
Don't wanna be late for night school.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,474
- You go to night school?
- I'm working on my MBA.

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,819
Think I wanna spend my life
cleaning grease traps?

24
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,435
Don't forget to lock up before you go.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,394
And the gum under the tables? You should
give it a good scrape before you leave.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,999
- May I?
- See you tomorrow.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,758
Yes, you will.

28
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,670
And the day after that, and the day
after that, and the day after that...

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,032
Get the double treat
that's so double sweet

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,072
Oh, it's hard to beat
when the meat meets...

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,831
Oh, why can't I get that
stupid jingle outta my head?

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,756
Least of your problems now, little girl.

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,836
- Wait.
- OK.

34
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,756
OK, let's do this. Quickly.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,790
What's that smell?
Jeez, Slayer, is that you?

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,358
- I've been working!
- Where? In a slaughterhouse?

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,516
- Double Meat Palace.
- Oh.

39
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,716
You know what? Let's just call it a night.
If it's all the same to you.

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,638
If you're eating that stuff,
I don't wanna bite you.

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,672
You're dead. You smell like it.

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,519
How do you get to say
I'm the one who's stinky?

43
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,154
Really, it's cool.
I'll just catch you next time.

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,439
Oh, for pete's sake. Spike?

45
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,518
Ah, it's a fair cop. You caught me, Slayer.

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,113
However, in all honesty, I think
we have to say this one doesn't count.

47
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,595
After all, I wasn't exactly hiding.

48
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,233
No, Spike.

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,875
No? What kind of answer is that?
You haven't heard the question yet.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,629
I don't have to.
We both know what you're thinking.

51
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,036
And we both know
I'm not the only one thinking it.

52
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,671
No. Not here.

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,194
- Why not?
- Dawn.

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,357
She's inside waiting for dinner.
She's counting on me.

55
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,678
I'm not letting her down by letting you in.

56
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,951
It's the fear of getting caught, then?

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,629
- Reason number one on a very long list.
- Needn't be an obstacle.

58
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,196
- Spike, I mean it. Come on.
- I hear you're serious. So am I.

59
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,357
I want you. You want me.

60
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,433
I can't go inside, so...

61
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,519
maybe the time is right...
for you to come outside.

62
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,354
Dawn. Hey. Hi.

63
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,229
- Rough night?
- The usual.

64
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,395
- I brought you dinner.
- Oh, great.

65
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,512
I know it's not the most original
these days, but... I made it myself.

66
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,269
I made hundreds, actually.
But this is the very best one.

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,150
It looks kinda squished.

68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,717
Oh. Well, just, you know... give it a sec.

69
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,957
These babies really bounce back. Literally.

70
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,398
Buffy, it's not like
I don't appreciate it. I do.

71
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,396
It's just that... I can't eat
this stuff another night. I'm sorry.

72
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,194
Oh. No, it's all good.

73
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,553
I get it.

74
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,753
Tell you what. Tomorrow, I'll bring home
the Fisherman's Nuggets with cheese.

75
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,599
Hey, working lady. Rough night?

76
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,235
Why does everybody keep asking me that?

77
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,275
No reason. I just thought you were busy
with the slayage cos of that grass stain.

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,595
- Some vamp get rough with you?
- He's not getting any gentler.

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,917
- He?
- They. Them.

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,354
You know, vampires
in the general population sense.

81
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,553
- Now I'm gonna have to wash this.
- Ready for a bold suggestion?

82
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,592
Blow it off. Dawnie and I
are headed out to the Bronze.

83
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,112
Um, do I have your permission?
And wanna come along?

84
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,754
Like how I slipped in
that permission request?

85
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,757
Very smooth.

86
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,235
- You guys go.
- Really?

87
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,358
Buffy, are you sure? It might do you good
to get away from the Double Meat lifestyle.

88
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,677
- See your friends...
- Who'd love to see you.

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,598
I'm sure. But I've seen
enough action for one night.

90
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,075
- Home by eleven?
- On the dot.

91
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,510
Have a good time.

92
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,036
Somebody should.

93
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,877
See, this seating chart makes no sense.
We have to do it again.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,230
We can't do it again. You do it.

95
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,636
The seating chart's fine.
Get back to the table arrangements.

96
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,036
I'm starting to have dreams
of gardenia bouquets.

97
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,436
I am so glad my manly co-workers
didn't just hear me say that.

98
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,873
Stop wolfing down those chips. One more
bag and you'll pop out of your cummerbund.

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,639
You're not even hungry.
You're just nervous.

100
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,671
Yeah! Wedding, one week.

101
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,759
We have friends, family, demons flying in,
a to-do list getting no shorter...

102
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,599
And do not take my chips.

103
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,718
Hey, guys.
How's the soon-to-be newlyweds? Nervous?

104
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,796
No!

105
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,079
OK. I'll just be over here, then.

106
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,594
- Your Arnold Palmer, milady.
- Thanks.

107
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,393
So, how are Mr and Mrs High-strung?

108
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,238
I'm betting they explode.

109
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,036
When I was little, I spent hours imagining
what my wedding to Xander would be like.

110
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,549
And now I look at them...

111
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,671
and just think...

112
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,032
- You're awfully chipper tonight.
- Can't hide it.

113
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,188
Hm. Big wedding coming up,
lots of date possibilities,

114
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,393
you and Tara are speaking again...
You wanna call her? Invite her over?

115
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,478
No. Too soon for so bold a manoeuvre.

116
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,160
But if I did call
she wouldn't hang up on me.

117
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,796
- That's progress.
- Hence the happy.

118
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,755
Garbage. Oh!

119
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,595
Wait! Wait up, guys!

120
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,432
Wait!

121
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,915
Don't you want your garbage?

122
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,519
Hey, Buffy.

123
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,676
Oh, don't forget, today's trash day.

124
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,512
Thanks.

125
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,797
"Dear Ms Summers,
we are sorry to reject... "

126
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,193
- What's that?
- Nothing.

127
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,798
Bronze was fun, in a home-by-eleven-ish
way. You should've come.

128
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,236
Maybe next time.

129
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,835
- Where are you going?
- School.

130
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,393
That's good. Don't you want breakfast first?

131
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,752
Already made it. See you this afternoon?

132
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,476
Unless you're working. Tonight, then.
Or, you know, tomorrow's cool.

133
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,670
Don't work too hard.

134
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,870
Bye.

135
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,355
That's where even your best political minds
can drop the ball: Zeitgeist.

136
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,945
You don't take the pulse of the public,
next thing, you're...

137
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,395
LBJ handing over to Nixon.

138
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,480
Heard back from your college yet?

139
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,716
- Yeah.
- All right.

140
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,071
- You know, we're out of special sauce.
- I'll get it.

141
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,035
No, no. Your turn up front.
I'll deal back here. You take the customers.

142
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,716
Welcome to the Double Meat Palace.
How may I help...

143
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,717
You.

144
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,839
Hey.

145
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,278
Riley.

146
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,797
Sorry to just drop in on you
like this, Buffy.

147
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,433
- It's you.
- It's me.

148
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,073
- You're here.
- I know.

149
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,509
And... were you always this tall?

150
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,069
This isn't the way I wanted it,
but something's come up. Somthing big.

151
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:02,636
We don't have much time.
Understand?

152
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,949
- Not a word you've said so far.
- Right.

153
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,992
I should've known.
Anticipated. You're working.

154
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,556
- Just counter, not grill.
- I want to explain. I don't have time.

155
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,752
I'm tracking something bad.
Now it's come to Sunnydale.

156
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,872
My hat has a cow.

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,629
I know I'm putting you on the spot,
showing up like this, but...

158
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,753
But, you know, here we are.
I need the best. I need you, Buffy.

159
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,511
Can you help me?

160
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,870
Hello? Buffy? People are waiting.

161
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,473
Buffy.

162
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,795
Buffy. Wait! Buffy!

163
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,829
I'm sorry this is all so sudden.
If we get a minute, I'd like to sit down...

164
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,672
- What is it?
- Suvolte Demon. Rare. Lethal.

165
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,236
Nearly extinct, but not nearly enough.
It's close.

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,956
- What?
- Sorry.

167
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,838
It's just you still carry around
all that James Bond stuff.

168
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,428
It's so cute. I forgot.

169
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,755
Sorry. Carry on.

170
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,470
We've been through every jungle
from Paraguay up, takin' out nests.

171
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,718
As soon as we put one Suvolte down,
a dozen take its place.

172
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,515
They're breeders, Buffy.
One turns into ten. Ten become a hundred.

173
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,679
If this gets out of hand and there's a war
with humans, the humans are gonna lose.

174
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,109
So they're like really mean tribbles?

175
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,716
Sorry. I've been dealing with these geeks.
It's a whole thing.

176
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,640
- Ready for this?
- Yes, please.

177
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,589
National Forestry Service.
We got a wild bear! Everybody stand back!

178
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,076
Look out!

179
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,152
Let's split.

180
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,472
Riley!

181
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,432
- You all right?
- I'll feel better when we catch it.

182
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,791
- But it's too fast.
- I wouldn't necessarily say that.

183
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,794
- Nice wheels.
- Came with the car.

184
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,056
Know where we're going?

185
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,913
Got an idea. The tag's online.
We'll find it.

186
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,510
- How's your arm?
- It'll heal. How are you doing?

187
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,197
- Complicated question.
- I just meant...

188
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,117
- I know.
- I hear ya.

189
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,109
Got some big stories to tell you, too.
If we ever get half a second.

190
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,037
- Did you die?
- No.

191
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,038
I'm gonna win.

192
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,912
Here. No offence, but this is black ops
and you look like a pylon.

193
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,952
Ninja wear?

194
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,753
Battle gear.
Lightweight Kevlar, state of the art.

195
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,590
- What a surprise.
- Boys like toys. Put it on. Thank me later.

196
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,873
- You won't look?
- I'm a gentleman.

197
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,837
OK.

198
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,431
So... the black-ops life,
it's working out for ya?

199
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,275
- Don't suck.
- They got dental?

200
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,356
Yeah, we're covered.

201
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,117
You know, there's not many people
I'd ask to risk their life for me, Buffy.

202
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,356
It's really good to see you.

203
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,596
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

204
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,351
And, Buffy?

205
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,675
Love the hair.

206
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,911
I think we died on the way to the airport
and we're stuck in hell.

207
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,875
- The radio said no traffic.
- It's a hell radio, of course it said that.

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,514
We'll never be in time
to pick up your stupid uncle.

209
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,518
It gives my uncle Rory more time
at the bar. He'll be happy.

210
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,997
Great. So he can sleep off his drunken
stupor on our newly reupholstered couch.

211
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,192
- He can't afford a hotel.
- Why are you defending him?

212
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,993
I'm not. I hate my uncle.

213
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,829
I hate my whole family. That's why
I'm marrying you, to start a new family.

214
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,791
Have children. Make them hate us.

215
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,118
Then they'll get married, we'll sleep
on their couch. It's the circle of life.

216
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,708
The Gnarals are teleporting in
in 20 minutes.

217
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,434
If I don't greet them
somebody gets incinerated.

218
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,552
Why did we ever agree
to have your friends, who are demons,

219
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,148
and my family,
who are monsters, stay at our place?

220
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,510
Well, I can only do so much, Xander.

221
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,757
Planning this marriage is like
staging the invasion of Normandy.

222
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,110
Without the laughs. We should have eloped.

223
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,394
No! I've been through too much planning
this wedding, and it is going to happen.

224
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,840
It will be our perfect, perfect day,
if I have to kill...

225
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,957
everyone of our guests
and half this town to do it.

226
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,874
- Cool Ranch?
- Cajun Fiesta.

227
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,080
End of the line?

228
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,953
- I don't see our demon.
- It's not here.

229
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,150
Let me guess.

230
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,953
- Down we go?
- Looks that way.

231
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,150
That's a big first step.

232
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,875
So, Mr Finn, got an extra
jet pack for a girl like me?

233
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,391
Sorry, fresh out of jet packs.
Looks like we'll have to share.

234
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,638
This test line's built for one,
so if we go together,

235
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,911
there's no gear. Just be you and me.

236
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,430
- I was never big on the hardware anyway.
- Will you hold on to me?

237
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,394
- If that's what it takes.
- Come on.

238
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,275
Ready when you are, Agent Finn.

239
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,479
Riley!

240
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,431
Hey. Hey, there.

241
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,353
What exactly are you
doing with my husband?

242
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,559
Husband?

243
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,359
Wife.

244
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,713
And those aren't code names,
like Big Dog or Falcon or...?

245
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,356
I didn't think so.

246
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,835
Buffy, meet Sam. Sam, Buffy.

247
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,311
- Pleasure.
- Demon.

248
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,592
Mine.

249
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,549
- She's good.
- She's a special one.

250
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,955
How long have you been married?

251
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,436
- Four months almost.
- Mazel tov. Any children?

252
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,468
Buffy, I meant to tell you,
when the time was right.

253
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,798
She caught up to us a lot faster than
I would've guessed possible. She does that.

254
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,150
So, you guys do this often?

255
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,353
The whole husband-wife
tag-team demon-fighting thing?

256
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,996
It's what brought us together.
I almost feel sorry for the Suvolte.

257
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,633
But not quite.

258
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,918
Call this your wedding gift.

259
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,832
So, guess that's mission accomplished.

260
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,557
- She killed it.
- Oh, honey.

261
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,477
That's OK.

262
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,352
OK?

263
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,996
Wait.

264
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,268
You have been tracking this thing
as a couple for two days straight,

265
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:16,797
and you did want it dead, right?

266
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,232
Let me guess. Captain Can-do here forgot
to mention this was a homing operation.

267
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,319
But it's nice to finally meet you,
by the way. Knife.

268
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,274
- What is a homing operation?
- It's my fault. I should have explained.

269
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,472
That would have saved me some... trouble.

270
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,431
Damn.

271
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,166
We're too late. Finn, how could you
recruit the Slayer...

272
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,272
without filling her in on the objective?

273
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,118
That'd be my question.

274
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,994
If we weren't under time constraints,
I'd think about ripping you a new one.

275
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,749
- Stand down, soldier.
- He's your boss, too?

276
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,034
Oh, he wishes. We better regroup.

277
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,478
Buffy, I'd hate to impose further,
but... you got a safe house?

278
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,477
I have a house.

279
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,388
I think it's safe.
Sometimes you can't even leave.

280
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,592
I know the way.
And I'll fill you in. On everything.

281
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,798
Sorry the place is such a mess. I haven't
had a chance to give it a good clean.

282
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,992
- Hey.
- Agent Finn returns.

283
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,510
Dawn. Jeez, look at you.
I think you grew a foot and a half.

284
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,598
A lot can happen in a year.

285
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,393
- Well, it's good to see you.
- Hey, there's the man!

286
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,590
Life taker, heartbreaker.

287
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,231
- You know, figuratively speaking.
- Xander, Sam. Willow.

288
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,108
- Hi.
- We got your call.

289
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,711
We're here to help. Just like old times.
Except you being big with the married life.

290
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,718
Hear you're getting hitched.
You're gonna love it.

291
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,831
Congratulations. Really, both of you.

292
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,869
Just so you know, I'm prepared
to hate this woman any way you want.

293
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,754
Thanks, but no.
I don't wanna seem all petty.

294
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,838
Well, that's the beauty -
you can't, but I can.

295
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,350
Please, let me carry
the hate for the both of us.

296
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,715
Go nuts.

297
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,873
So, what brings you back to town,
after you left suddenly with no word?

298
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,358
We've been tracking a Suvolte Demon
through Central America. Killing machine.

299
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,074
- Nearly mature.
- Three months old, growing fast.

300
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,112
They kill the minute they hatch
and leave a clear trail.

301
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,710
Yeah. Just follow the villages
with nothing in them but body parts.

302
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,719
Uh... Dawn, are you sure
you wanna be around hearin' all this?

303
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,991
Oh, come on, Finn.
She looks all grown-up to me.

304
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,831
- That is, if it's all right with you.
- Sure. Yeah, it's fine.

305
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,238
So, this demon shredded your guys
and now you're looking for a little payback?

306
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,276
No. It came here to the Hellmouth to spawn.
But we think it already hatched its eggs.

307
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,233
The plan was to track it,
let the demon take us to its nest.

308
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,239
And now they're gonna hatch
a bunch of baby demon things?

309
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,952
Unless we stop it.

310
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,835
So we have to find the nest before Sunnydale
turns into the Trouble Meat Palace.

311
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,831
- I wish I'd said something else.
- OK. So we track down the demon,

312
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,078
find the nest, Mr and Mrs Finn make with
the killin', and everyone goes home happy.

313
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,715
But seriously, choosing between
a photographer and place settings...

314
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,559
We can't track the demon.

315
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,797
I killed it. So, who's hungry? We got...

316
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,990
- Ice cubes.
- All you can eat.

317
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,796
Buffy, it's good that you killed the Suvolte
before it killed us. Disposable cameras.

318
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,270
Yeah. You know,
little plastic ones, ten bucks a pop.

319
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,870
Arrange 'em like table settings.
Guests snap photos. Breaks the ice.

320
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,913
Then when the wedding's over,
you get to take home the pictures.

321
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,110
I like it.

322
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,151
So, demon eggs, any timetable
on when they're gonna hatch?

323
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,955
- Hatching's not the problem.
- We think they're for the black market.

324
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,755
There are some military powers
that would love to have their own Suvolte.

325
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,192
- Drop it on an urban population...
- And it cleanses the area.

326
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,109
Is that a nice way of saying
it kills people?

327
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,155
Lots of 'em. Money's been exchanged.

328
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,875
There's a dealer in town.
Calls himself the Doctor.

329
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,117
Willow, you think you can help
with a little locating spell?

330
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,992
I can't do the magics.

331
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,873
Riley says you're coming on
as one major-league Wicca.

332
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,673
I got addicted. The way addicts do.

333
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,310
Two teams. No civilians.

334
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,477
I'll go out and look for our doctor.
You two find that nest.

335
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,287
Me and Sam together?

336
00:24:42,322 --> 00:24:44,396
You find a Suvolte nest, you'll want backup.

337
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,150
I don't wanna be dragging down the Slayer.
You've got speed and power I can't even...

338
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,748
Let's go. Xander,
are you OK to stay with Dawn?

339
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,271
- Yeah.
- I'll check out some bars, some crypts.

340
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,235
Hey, Willow.

341
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,558
I'm sorry. I think I really...
stepped in it in there.

342
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,799
Back in the jungle, we had not one,
but two hard-core shamans working for us.

343
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,797
They were working the dark magics,
and... got addicted.

344
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,593
And now they're gone.

345
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,838
Gone, as in, there's nothing left.

346
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,439
I have never met anyone
with enough strength to quit before.

347
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,396
I'm just saying.

348
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,468
Thanks for letting me tag along.

349
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,751
- No problem.
- Maybe not for you.

350
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,347
Gotta tell you, Buffy,
I'm a bit intimidated.

351
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:56,510
I mean, patrolling with
the real, live Slayer.

352
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,872
You're like Santa Claus,
or Buddha, or something.

353
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,592
Fat and jolly?

354
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,756
Legendary.

355
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,634
And it's not just slayer status
I'm talking about. It's you.

356
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,959
Riley talks about me?

357
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,072
He didn't say anything
for a long time, but I could tell.

358
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,034
- He was ripped up inside.
- Good thing he has you.

359
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,549
More like miraculous.

360
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,353
I went down to Central America
with the Peace Corps.

361
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,075
One night, my entire infirmary
got slaughtered by...

362
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,228
I didn't know what they were. I got
saved, quit the Corps, joined the squad.

363
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,918
My first firefight, I met Riley.

364
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,796
We started talking. First about
tactics, missions, stuff like that.

365
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,795
And then about you.

366
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,234
He thinks I let him go.

367
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,035
Do you wish you hadn't?

368
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,874
I wish things were different.
I'm not trying to...

369
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,434
I don't...

370
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,630
You know.

371
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,399
I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Buffy.

372
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,079
There's no bad guys in this one.

373
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,115
The only thing that could help
Riley work it out was time.

374
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,708
Lots of time.

375
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,877
Took him a year to get over you.

376
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,468
I'm glad he's over me.

377
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,788
So, you seeing anyone new?
Someone special?

378
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,593
I'm just taking my time, you know?

379
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,198
I don't wanna jump right into anything.
I don't wanna... be defined by who I'm with.

380
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,198
Yeah. Better no guy
than the wrong guy, that's for sure.

381
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,471
Sam, you know what?
Um, I think we should split up.

382
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,751
I'm slowing you down.
I knew I would. This was selfish of me.

383
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,916
No, it's not...

384
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,271
There's this guy, an informant.

385
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,517
But he's twitchy. I show up
with company and we get nothing.

386
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,430
Cool. I'm guessing Finn needs me about now.

387
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,439
He's probably off somewhere getting
his ass kicked. You know how wild he gets.

388
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,757
Don't worry about Rye and me. We're good.

389
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,116
I noticed.

390
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,918
Buffy.

391
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,396
Hey, now. If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake.

392
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,636
I need information.

393
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,594
Well, I suppose I could be helpful,
if the price is right.

394
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,678
Not sure I'll sell out
at Double Meat Palace wages, though.

395
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,951
I need to find a guy. A dealer.
Calls himself the Doctor.

396
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,911
- Human?
- His traffic isn't.

397
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,874
- Clock ticking?
- Whatever he's doing, he's doing it soon.

398
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,314
Soon, but not now?

399
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,155
Tell me you love me.

400
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,479
I love you. You know I do.

401
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,110
Tell me you want me.

402
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,196
I always want you.

403
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,715
- In point of fact...
- Shut up.

404
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,996
Well, looky here.

405
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,474
I don't usually use the word "delicious",

406
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,309
but I've gotta wager
this little tableau must sting a bit, eh?

407
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,908
Me and your former? Must kill.

408
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,789
What can I say? The girl just needs
a little monster in her man.

409
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,358
That's not why I'm here... Doctor.

410
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,116
Oh, God.

411
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,232
I thought we'd run you out of town, mate.
Last time I saw you, if memory serves,

412
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,434
you were getting the juice sucked out of you
by undead ladies of questionable reputation.

413
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,677
Now, be a good tin soldier and, uh...

414
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,469
Where are they, Doctor?

415
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,595
Where are what?
Why do you keep callin' me that?

416
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,510
Glad to be back in Sunnydale. Locals speak
English. I knew who to beat for information.

417
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,158
- It's all brought me here.
- Look, crew cut, she's not your bint now.

418
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,195
And, frankly, she always had a thing for me,
even when she was shagging you.

419
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,072
Nice. That's very distracting.

420
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,476
Tell me, before I get unprofessional,
where are the eggs, Spike?

421
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,352
Eggs?

422
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,435
You're off your nut. It must be those
drugs they kept you on. I did warn you.

423
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,916
OK. We can do this the hard way,
or we can do this the fatal way.

424
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,436
- Where are the eggs?
- The Doctor, it can't be Spike.

425
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,790
No need to defend me, love.

426
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,719
Look, it can't be, OK?

427
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,400
He's too incompetent.
It's just Spike, Riley.

428
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,069
Right. Deadly, amoral, opportunistic.

429
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,358
Or have you forgotten? I'm takin'
this place apart until I find that nest.

430
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,471
Over my dead body.

431
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,533
I've seen enough of your dead body
for one night, thanks.

432
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,876
You're not...

433
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,436
You coming?

434
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,990
Oh, this is...
unconstitutional, is what it is.

435
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,756
Here! There's nothing to see there.

436
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,159
Riley, I'm not saying he's good. I'm saying
that he's not capable of something as...

437
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,954
- I can explain.
- We're gonna need more weapons.

438
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,278
Spike screwed up. You didn't
keep 'em frozen, did you... Doctor?

439
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,197
You can stop calling me
that any time. If I may?

440
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,471
The thing of it is,
I'm holding these for a friend, who...

441
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,156
No more games.

442
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,308
Well, that's bloody funny comin' from you!

443
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,274
No more games?
That's all you've ever done, is play me.

444
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,678
And you keep playin' with rules you make
up as you like. You know what I am.

445
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,232
You've always known,
and you come to me all the same.

446
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,875
- Can you shut him up?
- Not so far.

447
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,954
You better get outta here.

448
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,757
- On second thoughts, stick around.
- Riley, I...

449
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,155
- Aim high.
- I'm not exactly Gun Girl.

450
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,236
You wanna live, learn fast.

451
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,995
These things? Never useful.

452
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,073
We have to pull out.

453
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,157
- We need a way to contain those things...
- Riley!

454
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,313
If you love Riley so much,
you should marry him.

455
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,831
He's taken. And that's not the point.

456
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,338
You think their marriage
is better than ours?

457
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:48,714
No!

458
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,691
But I can't imagine Nick and Nora Fury...

459
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:54,392
hiding up from their own
relatives in the bathroom.

460
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,834
And I have no idea what Riley
and Mrs Riley's wedding was like.

461
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,032
- You haven't shut up about them.
- They have a great marriage.

462
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,720
It bummed Buffy out, but I can see it.

463
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,879
And, Anya, I really have no clue
what their wedding was like.

464
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,278
So our wedding... is not our marriage.

465
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,195
Separate things. One fills me with a dread
akin to public speaking engagements.

466
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,356
- The wedding.
- Which will be over soon.

467
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,916
- But our marriage?
- That lasts for ever.

468
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,077
Ah, well. That works out nicely, then.

469
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,275
So, are you and Sam headed back
to Central America? Or is that classified?

470
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,312
Nepal.

471
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,311
- Sounds fun.
- Send you a postcard.

472
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,039
- Buffy...
- Riley...

473
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,264
By mission parameters, I'm done here.

474
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:02,190
But I have authorisation
to take the Doctor out.

475
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,278
- Do you want me to do that?
- Do I want you to...

476
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,036
How can you ask me...?

477
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,835
I'm sleeping with him.

478
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,875
I'm sleeping with Spike.

479
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,639
I had actually noticed that.

480
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,285
And then you come back...

481
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,020
Did you wait until your life was absolutelly
perfect and then send that demon here,

482
00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:27,753
so you can throw it in my face?

483
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,155
Look... You think this was easy for me?

484
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,159
Yeah. I think it was a rollicking adventure,
fun for the whole family.

485
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,430
I was terrified about seeing you again.

486
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,872
Well, I'm sure my incredible patheticness
softened the blow for you.

487
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,753
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Riley, please, don't patronise...

488
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,474
You want me to say
I like seeing you with that idiot?

489
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,470
Or that blinding orange is your best colour?
Or that that burger smell is appealing?

490
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,831
- You smelled the smell?
- Buffy, none of that means anything.

491
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,076
It doesn't touch you.

492
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,115
You're still the first woman I ever loved
and the strongest woman I've ever known.

493
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,189
Now, I'm not advertising this to the
missis... but you're still quite the hottie.

494
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,073
You know, it goes away after many bathings.

495
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,794
This isn't about who's on top.

496
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,675
I know how lucky I am right now.
I love my work and I love my wife.

497
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,672
I know. And I kinda love her, too.

498
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,988
So you're not in the greatest place
right now. And maybe I made it worse.

499
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,758
No.

500
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,316
Wheel never stops turning, Buffy.
You're up, you're down...

501
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,035
It doesn't change what you are.
And you are a hell of a woman.

502
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,995
Riley, that night...

503
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,836
I never got the chance to tell you...

504
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,711
how sorry I was...
about what happened between us.

505
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,913
And you never have to.

506
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,261
The wedding itself was held
in a military chopper...

507
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,079
just before a night drop
into hostile territory.

508
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,715
Huh. And - just curious -
what's a chopper rental run these days?

509
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,358
Well, actually, we commandeered it
from a local guerilla squad, so... cheap.

510
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,475
You have my email. You'll keep in touch?

511
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,276
You won't get traced? I don't wanna lead
the bad guys to your location by mistake.

512
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,109
- Our line's secure.
- Of course it is.

513
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,391
I keep thinking you're regular people,
but no, you're not.

514
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,389
Oh, right! Like demon hunting
is all exotic to a girl from Sunnydale.

515
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,906
So, you gonna say goodbye this time,
or just...

516
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:44,515
split all secret-agenty, like last time?

517
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,631
Depends. I warrant a hug?

518
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,228
Goodbye, Dawn.

519
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,113
Thought it would suck less this time.

520
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,196
It doesn't.

521
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,232
It was really nice meeting you all.

522
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,794
You ready for Nepal, Agent?

523
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,198
Firefights, bug hunts, big body-counts...

524
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,675
Yeah, I could use a break.

525
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,878
Bye!

526
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,355
Bye, Riley. Bye, Sam.

527
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,476
What a bitch!

528
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,876
So she's back.

529
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,715
Thought you'd be off
snogging with soldier boy.

530
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,796
He's gone.

531
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,873
So you've come for a bit of cold comfort?

532
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,668
The bed's a bit blown up.
But that was never our...

533
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,553
I'm not here to...

534
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,270
And I'm not here to bust your chops
about your stupid scheme either.

535
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,472
That's just you. I should have remembered.

536
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,398
Oh, this is worse then, is it?
This is you tellin' me...

537
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,272
It's over.

538
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,238
I've memorised this tune, love.

539
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,955
Think I have the sheet music.
Doesn't change what you want.

540
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,436
I know that.

541
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,636
I do want you.

542
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,396
Being with you...

543
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,316
makes things simpler. For a little while.

544
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,559
I don't call five hours straight
a little while.

545
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,796
I'm using you.

546
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,916
I can't love you.

547
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,798
I'm just being weak and selfish.

548
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,350
Really not complaining here.

549
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,354
And it's killing me.

550
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,478
I have to be strong about this.

551
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,670
I'm sorry, William.

552
