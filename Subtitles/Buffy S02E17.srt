<i># I'll say it, replay it</i>

7
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:20,942
Passion,

8
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:24,405
It lies in all of us...

9
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:28,966
sleeping, waiting,

10
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:32,438
And though unwanted, unbidden...

11
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,806
it will stir, open its jaws...

12
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,921
and howl,

13
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:43,525
<i># I'm on my knees to pray</i>

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,761

<i># I'll get through somehow</i>

17
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,097
It speaks to us...

18
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,738
guides us,

19
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,476
Passion rules us all...

20
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:22,525
and we obey,

21
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:26,663
What other choice do we have?

22
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,733
"Passion"

23
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,758
- He was in my room.
- Who?

24
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:57,897
Angel. He was in my room last night.

25
00:03:57,902 --> 00:04:00,380
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

26
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,910
When I woke up, I found a picture
he'd left me on my pillow.

27
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,872
A visit from the pointed-tooth fairy.

28
00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:09,247
Wait. I thought vampires can't come in
unless you invited them in.

29
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,989
Yes, but, uh, once you've invited them in,
thereafter they're, they're always welcome.

30
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:16,012
You know I think there may be
a valuable lesson for you gals here.

31
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:18,512
About inviting strange men
into your bedrooms.

32
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:22,147
Oh, God! I invited him in my car once!

33
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:25,511
That means he can come into my car...
whenever he wants.

34
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,552
Yep, you're doomed to having to give

35
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:30,002
him and his vamp pal a lift
whenever they feel like it.

36
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,505
And those guys never chip in for gas.

37
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,359
Giles, there has to be some sort of spell
to reverse the invitation, right?

38
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:39,004
Like a barrier, a "no shoes, no pulse -
no service" kind of thing?

39
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,246
- Yeah, that works for a car, too?
- Yes, well, I, I, I can check on my...

40
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:45,041
Hello?

41
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:47,850
Excuse me, but
have you ever heard of knocking?

42
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:50,113
We're supposed to get some books.

43
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:54,053
- On Stalin.
- Does this look like a Barnes&Noble?

44
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:58,268
- This is the school library, Xander.
- Since when?

45
00:04:58,303 --> 00:05:01,463
Uh, yes, yes. Third row,
historical biographies.

46
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:03,303
Thanks.

47
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:19,139
What?

48
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,912
Oh!

49
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,387
Hey, did you say that was the...?

50
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:26,674
Hello?

51
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:31,928
So, Angel has decided
to step up his harassment of you.

52
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,908
By sneaking in her room
and leaving stuff at night?

53
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:38,122
Why doesn't he just slit her throat
or strangle her while she's sleeping

54
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:41,203
or... cut her heart out?

55
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:43,506
What? I'm trying to help.

56
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,899
Yes. Uh, look, it's-it's
classic battle strategy -

57
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,703
to throw one's opponent off his game.
He-he-he's just trying to provoke you.

58
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:55,485
Uh, to taunt you, to, to goad you into,
uh, some mishap of some sort.

59
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,286
The nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
approach to battle.

60
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,808
Yes, Xander. Once more you've managed

61
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:03,337
to boil a complex thought
down to its simplest form.

62
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:07,048
Giles, Angel once told me that when
he was obsessed with Drusilla,

63
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,419
the first thing he did
was to kill her family.

64
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:12,605
- Your mom...
- I know.

65
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,223
I'm gonna have to tell her something.

66
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:18,540
- The truth?
- No. You-you-you-you can't do that.

67
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:21,732
Yeah! The more people who know the secret,
the more it cheapens it for the rest of us!

68
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,069
I've gotta tell her something.
I've gotta do something!

69
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,574
Giles, Angel has
an all-access pass to my house

70
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,889
and I'm not always there when
my mother is. I can't protect her.

71
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:32,552
- I told you, I will find a spell.
- What about until you find a spell?

72
00:06:32,587 --> 00:06:36,756
Until then, you and your mother are
welcome to ride around with me in my car.

73
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:39,314
Buffy, I-I understand your concern,

74
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,269
but it's imperative that you keep
a level head through all this.

75
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:45,991
That's easy for you to say. You don't have
Angel lurking in your bedroom at night.

76
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:48,561
I know how hard this is for you.

77
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,336
All right, I don't. But as the Slayer...

78
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:55,103
you don't have the luxury
of being a slave to your, your passions.

79
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,209
You mustn't let Angel get to you,

80
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,727
no matter how provocative
his behaviour may become.

81
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:03,833
So what you're basically saying is
just ignore him and maybe he'll go away?

82
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:06,092
Yes, precisely.

83
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,936
Hey, how come Buffy
doesn't get a snotty

84
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:11,799
"once again you boil it down
to the simplest form" thing?

85
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,392
Watcher's pet!

86
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:18,194
Don't forget I need your sample
spreadsheets by the end of the week.

87
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:25,345
Oh-oh, and I want both a paper printout
and a copy on disk. Thank you.

88
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:28,251
- Willow.
- Yes?

89
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:30,270
Uh, I might be a little late tomorrow.

90
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:33,187
Do you think you could
cover my class till I show?

91
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:36,960
Really? Me? Teach the class? Sure!

92
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:38,610
- Cool.
- Oh, wait.

93
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:41,751
W-what if they
don't recognize my authority?

94
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:45,661
What if they try to convince me
that you always let them leave early?

95
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:48,266
What if there's a fire drill?
What if there's a fire?!

96
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,376
Willow... you're gonna be fine.

97
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:55,756
- And I'll try not to be too late, OK?
- OK, good. Earlier is good.

98
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:01,092
Will I have the power to assign detention?
Or make 'em run laps?

99
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:05,713
- Hey, Will.
- Hey, Buffy. Rupert.

100
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,258
Willow, I thought I might take in a class.

101
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:11,530
Figured I could use someone
who knows where they are.

102
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,355
Sorry. I have to talk to her.
She's a teacher

103
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:18,589
and teachers are to be respected, even if
they're only filling in until the real

104
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,997
teacher shows up because
otherwise chaos could ensue.

105
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:28,547
How have you been?

106
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:31,998
Uh, not so good, actually. Um...

107
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,027
Since Angel lost his soul,
he's regained his sense of whimsy.

108
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,942
- Well, that sounds bad.
- He's been in Buffy's bedroom.

109
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:42,193
I, I need to... drum up a spell to, uh,
keep him out of the house.

110
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,375
This might help.

111
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:48,508
I've been doin' a little reading
since Angel changed.

112
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,812
- I don't think you have that one.
- Thank you.

113
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:56,210
So how's Buffy doing?

114
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,959
How do you think?

115
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:03,693
- I know you feel betrayed.
- Yes, well,

116
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:05,938
that's one of the
unpleasant side effects of... betrayal.

117
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,910
Rupert...

118
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:12,461
I was raised by the people
that Angel hurt the most.

119
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,374
My duty to them
was the first thing I was ever taught.

120
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:20,001
I didn't come here to hurt anyone.

121
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:24,004
And I lied to you because I thought
it was the right thing to do. I...

122
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,829
I didn't know what would happen.

123
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:31,334
I didn't know I was gonna
fall in love with you.

124
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,773
Oh, God...

125
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:42,222
Is it too late to take that back?

126
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:46,131
Do you want to?

127
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,019
I just wanna be right with you.

128
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,485
I don't expect more.

129
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:57,155
I just want so badly
to make all this up to you.

130
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:00,132
I understand.

131
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:04,597
But I'm not the one
you need to make it up to.

132
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:09,815
Thank you for the book.

133
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:20,004
OK... What's wrong?

134
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,678
No, it's nothing.

135
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,767
Come on, you can tell me anything,

136
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:28,320
I've read all the parenting books.
You cannot surprise me.

137
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,843
Do you remember that guy, Angel?

138
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:36,041
Angel? The, um...

139
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,753
The college boy
who was tutoring you in... history?

140
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,490
Right.

141
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:43,667
He... I...

142
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,201
Oh, God. Um...

143
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,842
We're sort of dating.
Were dating. Um...

144
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:53,826
Going through a serious
"off again" phase right now.

145
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:58,158
Don't tell me. He's changed?
He's not the same guy you fell for?

146
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:00,515
In a nutshell.

147
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,361
A-anyway, um...

148
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:07,025
Since he... changed,
he's been kinda following me around.

149
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:11,375
- He's having trouble letting go.
- Buffy, has he done anything?

150
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,736
No! No, it's not like that.

151
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,495
He's just been hanging around...
A lot.

152
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:18,853
Just sending me notes,
that kind of thing.

153
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,896
I just don't wanna see him right now.

154
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:24,994
I mean, If he shows up,
I'll talk to him. Just...

155
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,480
don't invite him in.

156
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,453
I agree with Giles.

157
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:32,542
You need to just try
and not let him get to you.

158
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:36,763
Angel's only doing this to try
to get you to do something stupid.

159
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,083
I swear, men can be
such jerks sometimes.

160
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,114
Dead or alive.

161
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,850
I just hope Giles
can find a keep-out spell soon,

162
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:47,635
I know I'll sleep easier
when I can...

163
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,275
sleep easier.

164
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,375
I'm sure he will.
He's, like, Book Man.

165
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,707
Until then, try
and keep happy thoughts and...

166
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:01,640
And what?

167
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,722
Willow?

168
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:07,886
Willow?

169
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:20,622
Thanks for having me over, Buffy.

170
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,904
Especially on a school night and all.

171
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,225
No problem.

172
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,547
Hey, sorry about your fish.

173
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,248
Oh, it's OK.

174
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,328
We hadn't really had time to bond yet.

175
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:36,049
Although, for the first time,

176
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,326
I'm glad my parents
didn't let me have a puppy.

177
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,786
It's so weird.

178
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:46,263
Every time something like this happens,

179
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:49,469
my first instinct is still
to run to Angel.

180
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,760
I can't believe it's the same person.

181
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:55,513
He's completely different
from the guy that I knew.

182
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:58,421
Well, sort of, except...

183
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,565
Except what?

184
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,581
You're still the only thing
he thinks about.

185
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:11,388
I brought something for you.

186
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:15,258
Poor thing. She's an orphan.

187
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,466
Her owner died...

188
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:21,007
without a fight.

189
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,814
Do you like her?

190
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:24,862
Mm?

191
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:28,203
I brought her especially for you.

192
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:30,741
To cheer you up.

193
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,954
And I've named her...

194
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,783
Sunshine.

195
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,587
Open wide.

196
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:43,907
Come on, love.
You need to eat something

197
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:46,138
to keep your strength up.

198
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,204
Now...

199
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:52,324
- Open up for Mommy!
- I won't have you feeding me

200
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:55,330
- like a child, Dru!
- Why not?

201
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:57,130
She already bathes you,

202
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:00,123
carries you around
and changes you like a child.

203
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:03,028
Why, Angel. Where have you been?

204
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:06,807
The sun is almost up
and it can be so hurtful.

205
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:10,380
- We were worried.
- No, we weren't.

206
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,279
You must forgive Spike.
He's just a bit testy tonight.

207
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:16,699
Doesn't get out much any more.

208
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:19,984
Well, maybe next time
I'll bring you with me, Spike.

209
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,520
It might be handy to have you around
if I ever need a really good parking space.

210
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:26,938
Have you forgotten
you're a bloody guest in my bloody home?

211
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:31,423
And as a guest, if there's
anything I can do for you,

212
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:37,321
any... responsibility I can assume
while you're spinning your wheels...

213
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:42,589
- Anything I'm not already doing, that is.
- That's enough!

214
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:52,647
You two boys...

215
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,522
fighting over me and all...

216
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:59,686
makes a girl feel...

217
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:07,600
- Dru, what is it, pet?
- The air...

218
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:09,791
It worries.

219
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:14,482
Someone... an old enemy,
is seeking help.

220
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:18,376
Help to destroy our happy home.

221
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:21,173
Oh...

222
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:53,256
Welcome. How may I serve you today?

223
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,004
- Uh...
- Love potion?

224
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,318
Perhaps a voodoo doll
for that unfaithful...

225
00:15:57,353 --> 00:15:59,676
I need an orb of Thesulah.

226
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:01,996
Oh, you're in the trade!

227
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:06,448
Sorry about the spiel,
but around Valentine's Day

228
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:09,297
I get a lot of tourists
shopping for love potions

229
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:12,553
and... mystical revenge
of past lovers.

230
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:16,100
Sad fact is,
Ouija boards and rabbits' feet -

231
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,229
that's what pay the rent around here.

232
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:23,884
- So how'd you hear about us?
- My Uncle Enyos told me about you.

233
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,944
So you're Janna, then.

234
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:28,182
I'm sorry to hear about your uncle.

235
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:31,426
- Thank you.
- He was a good customer.

236
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,676
Well, no, there you go

237
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,666
One Thesulan orb:

238
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,297
spirit vault
for the rituals of the undead.

239
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,270
I don't get many calls for those lately.

240
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:45,706
Sold a couple as
New Age paperweights last year.

241
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,188
Yeah, I just love
those New Agers, boy.

242
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:52,103
They helped to...
send my youngest to college.

243
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:53,660
By the way,

244
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:58,148
you do know that the transliteration annals
for the Ritual of the Undead were lost?

245
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,652
Without the annals,
the surviving text is gibberish.

246
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,216
And without a translated text,

247
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:05,031
the orbs of Thesulah
are pretty much useless.

248
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,300
I know.

249
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:09,371
Well, I only mentioned it because
I have a strict policy of no refunds.

250
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:12,463
It's OK.
I'm working on a computer program

251
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:15,229
to... translate
the Rumanian liturgy to English

252
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,124
based on a random sampling
of the text.

253
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:19,403
Ugh! I don't like computers.

254
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,882
- They give me the willies.
- Well, thank you.

255
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,172
You're welcome.

256
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:31,910
By the way! Not that it's
any of my business, really, but, uh...

257
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:35,410
What are you planning on conjuring up
if you can decipher the text?

258
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,417
A present for a friend of mine.

259
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:40,972
Really?
What are you gonna give him?

260
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:44,613
His soul.

261
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,400
We'll be in hiding, probably...

262
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:54,574
- Where?
- Siberia.

263
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:57,340
Well, good morning, ladies.
What did you two do last night?

264
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,492
We had kind of a "pyjama party
sleepover with weapons" thing.

265
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:04,244
Oh, and I don't suppose either of you
had the presence of mind

266
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,779
to locate a camera to...
capture the moment?

267
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:09,885
I have to go. I have a class to teach
in about five minutes

268
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,560
and I have to arrive early to glare
disapprovingly at the stragglers.

269
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,239
Oh, darn. She's here.

270
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:22,212
Five hours of lesson planning
yesterday down the drain.

271
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:26,492
You know what? I'll see you in class.

272
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,268
- Hey.
- Hi.

273
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:39,518
Uh, is there something...?
Did you want something?

274
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:44,212
Look, I know you feel badly
about what happened

275
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:47,166
and I just wanted to say...

276
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,657
Good. Keep it up.

277
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:58,245
- Don't worry, I will.
- Oh, wait. Um...

278
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:02,543
He misses you.

279
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:06,517
He doesn't say anything to me,
but I know he does.

280
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,665
And I don't want him to be lonely.

281
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,147
I don't want anyone to.

282
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:15,481
Buffy, you know that
if I have a chance

283
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:18,451
- to make this up...
- We're good here.

284
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:21,182
Let's just leave it.

285
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:26,913
I put it here somewhere.
Oh, yes, yes. That's it.

286
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:30,543
Could you, uh, hang those up?
Thank you, it's all.

287
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:33,303
Buffy. So...
So how was your night?

288
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,042
Sleepless, but no human fatalities.

289
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:41,319
I-I found a ritual to revoke...
the invitation to, to vampires.

290
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,380
Oh, thank goodness! I actually had to
talk my grandmother into

291
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,820
switching cars with me last night.

292
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:50,078
Um, the-the-the, uh,
the ritual's fairly basic, actually.

293
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,232
It's just the recitation
of a few rhyming couplets

294
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:56,077
burning of, uh, moss herbs,
sprinkling of holy water...

295
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,877
- All stuff I have in my house.
- Hanging crosses...

296
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:05,125
I'm gonna have a hard time
explaining this to my dad.

297
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,982
You really think it'll bother him?

298
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:11,006
Ira Rosenberg's only daughter
nailing crucifixes to her bedroom wall?

299
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,304
I have to go over
to Xander's house just to watch

300
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,283
'A Charlie Brown Christmas' every year.

301
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:17,868
- I see your point.
- Although it is worthwhile

302
00:20:17,903 --> 00:20:21,119
to see him do the Snoopy Dance!

303
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:26,484
Willow, are you aware that
there are no fish in your aquarium?

304
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,616
You know, Cordelia,
we've already done your car.

305
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:32,475
- Call it a night, if you want.
- Right. Thanks.

306
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:36,560
And you know I'd do the same for you
if you had a social life.

307
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:40,444
Oh! This must be for you.

308
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:50,896
It's for you.

309
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:55,828
Mom.

310
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:09,923
Mrs. Summers, I need to talk to you.

311
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:13,055
You're Angel.

312
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,265
Did Buffy tell you about us?

313
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,740
She told me she wants you
to leave her alone.

314
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:23,017
- Oh, I can't. I can't do that.
- You're scaring her.

315
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,969
You have to help me.

316
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:29,848
Joyce, I need to be with her. You can
convince her. You have to convince her.

317
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:32,412
Look, I'm telling you to leave her alone.

318
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:36,128
You have to talk to her for me, Joyce.
Tell her I need her.

319
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:39,371
Please, look,
I-I just want to get inside, OK?

320
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:44,828
You don't understand, Joyce.

321
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:49,509
I'll die without Buffy.
She'll die without me.

322
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:54,108
- Are you threatening her?
- Please! Why is she doing this to me?

323
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:57,020
I'm calling the police, now.

324
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:09,888
I haven't been able to sleep
since the night we made love.

325
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,484
I need her.

326
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:15,431
I know you understand.

327
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:18,354
Just leave us alone.

328
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,503
'His verbis consensus rescissus est.'
(With these words permission is withdrawn)

329
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:29,939
Sorry, Angel. Changed the locks.

330
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:41,017
- Hello?
- Oh!

331
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,233
Hey.

332
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:48,474
- You're... working late?
- Special project.

333
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,841
- I spoke to Buffy today.
- Oh!

334
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:56,068
Yes?

335
00:22:56,964 --> 00:22:59,138
She said you missed me.

336
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:02,775
Well, uh, she's... a meddlesome girl.

337
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:05,512
Rupert...

338
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:07,498
OK, I don't want to
say anything if I'm wrong,

339
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:09,833
but I may have some news.

340
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:14,248
You know, I need to finish up here.
Could I see you later?

341
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:17,078
Yes, yes...

342
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:19,905
You could stop by my house.

343
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,697
OK.

344
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,769
Good.

345
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:50,206
Sorry, honey. We're closed.

346
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:56,351
- What do you want?
- Miss Sunshine, here,

347
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,175
tells me you had a visitor today.

348
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,114
But she worries.

349
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:07,069
She wants to know what you
and the mean teacher talked about.

350
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:17,697
Come on. Come on.

351
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:23,464
That's it.

352
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:29,974
It's gonna work! This... will work.

353
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,505
Angel.

354
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:54,113
- How did you get in here?
- I was invited.

355
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:58,916
The sign in front of the school:

356
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:03,479
"Formatia trans sicere educatorum, "

357
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:06,532
"Enter all ye who seek knowledge."

358
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:11,076
What can I say?
I'm a knowledge seeker.

359
00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:13,374
Angel, I've got good news.

360
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:17,907
I heard. You went shopping at
the local boogedy-boogedy store.

361
00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:27,377
The orb of Thesulah.

362
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:33,010
If memory serves, this is supposed
to summon a person's soul...

363
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,800
From the ether...

364
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:40,038
Store it until it can be transferred.

365
00:25:42,949 --> 00:25:46,041
You know what I hate most
about these things?

366
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,161
They're so damn fragile.

367
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:55,798
Must be that shoddy,
gypsy craftsmanship, huh?

368
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:02,611
I never seize to be amazed
how much the world has changed

369
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:04,888
in just two and a half centuries.

370
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,718
It's a miracle to me.

371
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:11,385
You-you put the secrets
to restoring my soul... here!

372
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,036
It comes out here!

373
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:23,197
"The Ritual of Restoration."

374
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:26,835
Wow. This... This brings back memories.

375
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,594
- Wait, that's your...
- Oh, my cure?

376
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:34,163
No, thanks. Been there, done that...

377
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:37,315
Déja vu just isn't what it used to be.

378
00:26:37,535 --> 00:26:41,446
Boy, isn't this my lucky day?

379
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:43,781
The computer...

380
00:26:44,106 --> 00:26:46,622
and the pages.

381
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:51,398
Looks like I get to kill two birds...

382
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:54,443
with one stone.

383
00:26:57,275 --> 00:27:00,543
The teacher... makes... three.

384
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:14,403
Oh, good.
I need to work up an appetite first.

385
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:40,148
Sorry, Jenny. This is where you get off.

386
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:49,302
I never get tired of doing that.

387
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:01,871
- Willow. Good evening.
- Hi. Come on in.

388
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,929
- Here's the book.
- Right.

389
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,009
Guess, I should
do my apartment tonight.

390
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:10,121
- The ritual go all right?
- Oh, yeah, it went fine.

391
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:12,706
Well, it went fine
until Angel showed up

392
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:15,868
and told Buffy's mom
that he and Buffy had...

393
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,025
Well, you know.

394
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,805
That they had... you know.

395
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,508
- You do... know, right?
- Oh! Yes, yes, sorry.

396
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:28,974
Oh, good. 'Cause I just realized that,

397
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:32,009
being a librarian and all,
you... maybe didn't know.

398
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:34,082
No, thank you. I got it.

399
00:29:34,117 --> 00:29:38,294
You would've been proud of her, though.
She totally kept her cool.

400
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:45,012
OK, well, I'll tell Buffy you stopped by.

401
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:48,245
Would you, um... Perhaps I should, uh,

402
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:51,761
intervene on, on Buffy's behalf
w-w-with her mother?

403
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:54,199
Maybe... say something?

404
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:57,460
Sure. Like, what would you say?

405
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:02,293
W... Uh...

406
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,689
- You will tell Buffy I dropped by?
- You bet.

407
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:12,558
That stuff with the...
Latin and the herbs, uh,

408
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,182
he's just real superstitious.

409
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:18,137
Oh.

410
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:22,706
- We just thought if...
- Was he the first?

411
00:30:22,741 --> 00:30:27,430
No, wait. I don't wanna know.
I don't think I want to.

412
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:30,757
Yeah, he was the first.

413
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,881
I mean, the only.

414
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:36,622
- He's older than you.
- I know.

415
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:39,186
Too old, Buffy.

416
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:41,756
And he's obviously not very stable.

417
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,988
I really wish...

418
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:50,209
I just thought you would
show more judgment.

419
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,730
He wasn't like this before.

420
00:30:55,415 --> 00:30:58,978
Are you in love with him?

421
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:01,686
- I was.
- Were you careful?

422
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:04,269
- Mom, this is no time...
- Don't "Mom" me, Buffy!

423
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:06,573
You don't get to get out of this.
You had sex with a boy

424
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,913
you didn't even see fit
to tell me you were dating.

425
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:13,484
- I made a mistake.
- Yeah, well, don't you just say that

426
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,431
to shut me up,
because I think you really did.

427
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:17,838
I know that!

428
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:24,390
- I can't tell you everything!
- How about anything?

429
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,687
Buffy, you can shut me out of your life,
I am pretty much used to that.

430
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:30,378
But don't expect me
to ever stop caring about you,

431
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:32,877
because it's never gonna happen.

432
00:31:32,912 --> 00:31:36,854
I love you
more than anything in the world.

433
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:43,192
That would be your cue to, uh...

434
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,479
roll your eyes
and tell me I'm grossing you out.

435
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,303
You're not.

436
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:57,457
Oh, well...

437
00:31:58,553 --> 00:32:01,107
I guess that was "the talk".

438
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:04,635
So how'd it go?

439
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,141
I don't know. It was my first.

440
00:32:33,974 --> 00:32:36,013
Hello?

441
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:41,358
Jenny?

442
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,195
It's me!

443
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,044
<i># Sei mia</i>

444
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,244
<i># V'aspettan gli amici</i>

445
00:32:57,704 --> 00:33:02,344
<i># Già mi mandi via?</i>

446
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,650
<i># Vorrei dir, ma non oso</i>

447
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:08,950

00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:18,566

00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:22,121

00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:34,829

<i># Tu sol comandi, amor!</i>

458
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,748
Mr. Giles, I need to ask you
to come with us.

459
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:16,368
Just to... answer a few questions.

460
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:20,332
Of course.

461
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,949
Yes.

462
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:26,275
Procedure.

463
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,398
I need to make a phone call,

464
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:35,249
if that's all right?

465
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:46,485
Passion is the source
of our finest moments:

466
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,730
the joy of love...

467
00:34:48,765 --> 00:34:51,304
the clarity of hatred...

468
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,708
and the ecstasy of grief...

469
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:06,248
Giles?

470
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:21,383
Hello?

471
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:27,269
Really? No...

472
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:30,078
No...

473
00:35:31,374 --> 00:35:33,214
No!

474
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:49,341
- Where's Giles?
- No luck.

475
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,604
By the time we got to the station,
the cops said he'd already left

476
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:53,810
I guess they just wanted
to ask him some questions.

477
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:55,869
Cordelia, will you
drive us to Giles' house?

478
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,832
Of course.

479
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:59,305
But don't you think
he wants to be left alone?

480
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,298
I'm not worried about what he wants.

481
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:04,581
I'm worried about what he's gonna do.

482
00:36:46,158 --> 00:36:47,926
Hello?

483
00:36:49,982 --> 00:36:51,739
Giles?

484
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:13,748
I guess Giles had
a big night planned tonight.

485
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:16,084
Giles didn't set this up.

486
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,982
Angel did.

487
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:21,255
This is the wrapping for the gift.

488
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:24,328
Oh, man.

489
00:37:24,886 --> 00:37:27,577
Poor Giles.

490
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:31,229
Look, all his weapons are gone.

491
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,263
But I thought
he kept his weapons at the library.

492
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:35,799
No, those are his, uh,
everyday weapons.

493
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:39,039
These were his good weapons.
The ones he, uh...

494
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,331
breaks out when company comes to visit.

495
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:44,946
- So he's not here?
- Well, then where is he?

496
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:49,224
- He'll go to wherever Angel is.
- That means the factory, right?

497
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:51,441
So Giles is gonna try to kill Angel then.

498
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:54,159
- Well, it's about time somebody did.
- Xander!

499
00:37:54,194 --> 00:37:56,059
I'm sorry, but let's not forget
that I hated Angel

500
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,881
long before you, guys,
jumped on the bandwagon.

501
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:59,439
So I think I deserve a little something

502
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,601
for not saying
'I told you so' long before now.

503
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:05,370
And if Giles wants to go after the, uh...
fiend that murdered his girlfriend,

504
00:38:05,405 --> 00:38:08,092
I say 'Faster, pussycat. Kill, kill!'

505
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:10,622
- You're right.
- Thank you.

506
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:13,771
There's only one thing wrong
with Giles' little revenge scenario.

507
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:17,411
- And what's that?
- It's gonna get him killed.

508
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:20,362
Are you insane?

509
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:25,878
We're supposed to kill the bitch,
not leave gag gifts in her friends' beds.

510
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:31,165
But, Spike, the bad teacher
was going to restore Angel's soul.

511
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,497
What if she did? If you ask me,

512
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:36,658
I find myself preferring
the old Buffy-whipped Angelus.

513
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:41,547
'Cause this new, improved one
is not playing with a full sack.

514
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:44,548
I love a good slaughter
as much as the next bloke,

515
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:49,346
but his little pranks will only leave us
with one incredibly brassed-off Slayer!

516
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:53,803
Don't worry, Roller Boy.
I've got everything under control.

517
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:09,745
Jeez, whatever happened
to wooden stakes?

518
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,319
Uh-uh. No fair going into the ring
unless he tags you first.

519
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:27,833
All right. You've had your fun.

520
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:30,286
But you know what it's time for now?

521
00:39:32,366 --> 00:39:34,437
My fun!

522
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,277
Gonna let your old man just burn?

523
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:46,264
Why did you come here?
This wasn't your fight!

524
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:51,485
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

525
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,090
You can't leave me.

526
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:01,805
I can't do this alone.

527
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:09,800
It hurts sometimes
more than we can bear.

528
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:15,843
If we could live without passion,
maybe we'd know some kind of peace...

529
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:18,651
but we would be hollow:

530
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:20,773
empty rooms...

531
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:23,585
shuttered and dank...

532
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,139
Without passion...

533
00:41:26,574 --> 00:41:29,858
we'd be truly dead.

534
00:41:39,454 --> 00:41:43,514
In my years as... Watcher...

535
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:47,837
I've buried... too many people.

536
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,827
But Jenny was the first I've loved.

537
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,991
I'm sorry.

538
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:59,213
I'm sorry I couldn't kill him for you...

539
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:01,297
For her...

540
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:04,371
When I had the chance.

541
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:11,256
I wasn't ready.

542
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:16,847
But I think I finally am.

543
00:42:17,383 --> 00:42:19,167
Hi.

544
00:42:19,507 --> 00:42:23,406
Principal Snyder asked me
to fill in for Ms Calendar...

545
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:27,580
until the new
computer-science teacher arrives.

546
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:33,608
So, I'm just gonna stick to
the lesson plan she left.

547
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:38,107
I can't hold on to the past any more.

548
00:42:38,142 --> 00:42:40,433
Angel is gone.

549
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:43,542
Nothing's ever gonna bring him back.

550
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:52,204
