Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,250
- Hello, you two, come on in.
- Thank you, kind proprietor.

3
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,130
Don't touch anything.

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:12,445
She still thinks I'm Little Miss Nobody.

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:13,932
Just her sister.

6
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,163
Boy, is she in for a surprise!

7
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:17,686
Who are you?

8
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:23,889
You know Walsh pumped chemicals into us?
You got more than anyone.

9
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:28,171
- I'm taking you to the doctor.
- The one from the government who did this?

10
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,732
All patched up.

11
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:32,448
How's it going in there?

12
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,888
Good. Back to normal.

13
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:43,852
I love you so much.

15
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:02,849
- I've always wanted to kill the Slayer.
- I've always wanted piano lessons.

16
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,845
Who's surprised we have
all this unexpressed rage?

17
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:14,411
But, honestly, I think
I'm expressing mine better.

18
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:17,404
Tell you what.

19
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,883
You find yourself
a good anger-management class,

20
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:27,449
and I'll jam this poky wood stick
through your heart.

21
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,327
That sets the world speed record for closure.

22
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:35,210
Hey.

23
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:40,211
If you're looking for one of those rave parties,
I'm afraid you're late.

24
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:44,605
- Chased a bunch of kids out last night.
- Oh, right. Yeah. Darn.

25
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:49,403
My fellow ravers will be so disappointed.
It was my turn to bring the Bundt cake.

26
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:51,723
If it was my call, I'd let you do whatever.

27
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:54,964
It's not like anybody's
using this place or nothin'.

28
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:57,521
They just don't pay enough
to argue with the boss.

29
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:59,729
- Already gone.
- Hold it, miss.

30
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,567
Take your, whatever this is, with you.

31
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:06,287
Thank you.

32
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:10,844
Glow balls, huh?
I swear, I don't get your generation.

33
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,924
Now what is that thing?

34
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,247
I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

35
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:17,851
- Dawn, touch nothing.
- Who died and made you the Iron Chef?

36
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:21,812
Mom's sick and I made her
a nice non-instant breakfast for once.

37
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:23,690
I don't need you...

38
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,122
Oops!

39
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,449
- ..doing that.
- Morning, guys.

40
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,083
Check out the pamper-Mom platter.

41
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,482
- You two do all this?
- Buffy helped.

42
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:38,211
I didn't help...

43
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:40,124
I'm sure you did.

44
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:45,003
So neither of you is pregnant, failing,
or under indictment? Just checking.

45
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:48,651
We knew you were feeling
less than great, so...

46
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:52,487
The headaches they said would go away
came back and brought some friends.

47
00:04:52,573 --> 00:04:54,404
What did the doctor say?

48
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:57,610
Take four of some pills a day
and come back for tests.

49
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:00,163
- They don't know what's wrong?
- Not yet.

50
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:02,687
That's unacceptable.
We need a second opinion.

51
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:06,163
- We need a first opinion first, honey.
- OK. We'll go now.

52
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:09,768
Buffy, I know you're concerned, but don't be.

53
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:12,970
I'm still the mom, which means
I get to worry about you two.

54
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:16,568
Which is a good thing
because you're a vampire slayer.

55
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:19,326
And you, you are my little pumpkin belly.

56
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:21,688
Mom! That's, like, my kid name.

57
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:25,322
- So I can't be retro?
- Did you ever have any names for me?

58
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:28,652
No, I think you were always just Buffy.

59
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,962
I got some names for ya.

60
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,682
What are you doing hanging around?
Isn't this Giles' big day?

61
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:39,082
Bigger than big. It's his grand opening.

62
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,846
So go. Bring me back a...

63
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,969
I don't know...

64
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,248
A flying broomstick or something.

65
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,722
- Those never really work.
- Whatever.

66
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:51,729
Book club tonight?

67
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,321
You guys have a book club?

68
00:05:57,173 --> 00:06:01,485
OK, I'm gonna go. I will be back later.
When is your doctor's appointment?

69
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:07,132
I just wanna know. Take it easy. I want you
to relax, keep your feet up, plenty of Oprah.

70
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:12,172
Plus you can check my rainforest report.
And there's old board games...

71
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:14,972
- Hey. You said I couldn't come.
- Changed my mind.

72
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,810
I told you you couldn't ditch me.

73
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,211
Mr Giles.

74
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:53,932
This place is so... wow.

75
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:57,603
- I mean, check out all the magic junk.
- Our new slogan.

76
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,445
- So when's it open? For customers?
- Since nine this morning.

77
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,890
Dawn. Go. Browse. And...

78
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:09,886
"You break it, you bought it."
Heard you the first 60 times.

79
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:13,852
Still, not to worry.
I have good feelings about this place.

80
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:18,811
Magic's a small niche market,
but... well, think about it.

81
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:23,045
Sunnydale, monsters, supply and demand.

82
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,931
They'll be lining up
round the block in no time.

83
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:29,285
Yeah. You'll be making money hand over fist.

84
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,449
Which I guess is a good thing.

85
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:39,366
You all right? You seem a little distracted.

86
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:43,048
It's just my mom's still sick
and we have no idea what the deal is.

87
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:45,328
- She is getting medical attention?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:49,611
We have a highly trained medical staff
working round the clock to tell us diddly.

89
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:54,244
I'm sorry. Still, you know,
time and patience... both great comforts.

90
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,282
Giles, where's your hat and cloak?

91
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:01,523
Yeah, the hype was out of control.

92
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:03,763
Willow, you gotta see this.

93
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,890
They have the coolest
talis... mans. Talisguys.

94
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:12,131
Actually, I have a little
Scooby-centric deal to deal with first.

95
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,842
I put this before the group.

96
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,924
What the hell is it?

97
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:20,443
- It appears to be paranormal in origin.
- How can you tell?

98
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:23,123
Well, it's so shiny.

99
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:26,205
- I found it on patrol.
- May be more where that came from.

100
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:28,966
I say we go back out again tonight.

101
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:30,602
Sure.

102
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:34,527
- You can't patrol. Buffy said.
- No, I didn't.

103
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:38,208
You said it'd be easier if you
didn't have to look out for anybody.

104
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:41,126
- I wasn't talking about Riley.
- Don't worry.

105
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:46,367
She said you look even cuter when you're
all weak and kitteny, but you'd get hurt.

106
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:49,843
So welcome to the club.
She'll never let me go either.

107
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,608
What? What?

108
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:00,212
Giles, you got that danger room
set up out back?

109
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:04,172
- I'm feeling the need for physical rehab.
- Of course, yes.

110
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,925
- If any customers...
- On it.

111
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,004
Dawn, we're going.

112
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,604
Buffy, wait.

113
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,726
- Go easy on her.
- Why?

114
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:19,492
I can't help it. I just have all this
involuntary empathy for Dawn.

115
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:22,610
Cos she's, you know, a big spaz.

116
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:28,605
She's so annoying now Mom's sick. She's
all over her while I have to be the grown-up.

117
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:34,211
The two of them are like the Giggle Twins.
Why can't I ever be "little pumpkin belly"?

118
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:37,410
While I don't feel qualified
to address the last part,

119
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,805
I can tell you that Dawn's not
just the youngest, she's the baby.

120
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:44,168
Maybe your mom needs that right now.

121
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:46,244
Dawn doesn't care what my mom...

122
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:52,611
You just have no idea how much
I wish I were an only child these days.

123
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,004
Oops!

124
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,801
We can't all be born
with Chosen One reflexes.

125
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,451
Sh. Mom?

126
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,806
Mom?

127
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:09,884
What's wrong?

128
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,605
It's just my head.

129
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:16,242
- I'm taking you to the doctor.
- No, sweetheart. I'm fine.

130
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:19,804
We don't know that.
We don't know anything. We're going.

131
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:22,691
I just need my prescription. Please?

132
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:26,604
Hospital pharmacy open?

133
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,684
Ten minutes.

134
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:37,848
Hey, it's Buffy, isn't it?

135
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,401
Ben. But call me man-nurse.
Everybody else does.

136
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:45,327
I don't belong here.
I have important instructions.

137
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:48,485
- Fascists!
- Now you're hurting the nice intern.

138
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:50,962
I need nine cc's of phenobarbital...

139
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,322
Or not.

140
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:56,927
Let's strap him.
For your own good, I promise.

141
00:10:57,013 --> 00:11:01,723
Not to be rampantly sexist, but you've
got some serious muscles for a girl.

142
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,523
- I...
- Radioactive-spider bite?

143
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:08,325
- How'd you guess?
- I'm a doctor. Well, almost.

144
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:12,368
Doesn't even help.
Doesn't make a damn bit of difference!

145
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:15,331
I've met this guy. He's a security guard.

146
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:18,246
- He's not crazy.
- If you say so.

147
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,847
They're coming at you.

148
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,208
Don't think you're above it, missy.

149
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:27,366
They come through the family.
They get to your family!

150
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:32,322
- My family? What do you mean?
- Get him to Exam One. Now would be nice.

151
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:35,962
They come through the family.
Your family.

152
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:38,608
I'm real sorry about that.

153
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:40,365
Here.

154
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:42,842
- For your mom?
- Yeah. Thanks.

155
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:46,885
- She's not feeling better?
- Not yet.

156
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,964
But she will be.

157
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:52,090
I'm starting to figure out what's wrong.

158
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:43,371
There you are.
I have been looking all over for you.

159
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:54,567
Thank you for choosing to shop at
the Magic Box. Please do come again.

160
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,287
Did you see that?
Real live customers.

161
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:09,050
They came in, I gave them things, they gave
me money and then they left. It's brilliant!

162
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:13,251
Congratulations.
You're an official capitalist running dog.

163
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,450
But on the orbular front
we're batting zeros.

164
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,967
Well, we'll just have to keep trying.

165
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:22,250
If there's anything you need help with,
let me know.

166
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,608
- Your conjuring powder is overpriced.
- Anya...

167
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:33,770
I'm nearly out of money. I've never had to
afford things before and it's making me bitter.

168
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,883
The change is palpable.
That stuff doesn't come cheap.

169
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:43,366
Well, you're getting ripped off. I could
hook you up direct with the troll that sheds it.

170
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:46,286
Giles, I have an idea
what's making my mom sick.

171
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:52,243
- Have you spoken with her doctors?
- They won't find anything. It's supernatural.

172
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:57,043
The night watchman who found this thing,
he went crazy overnight.

173
00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:01,007
It won't hurt us. I had it on me all night.

174
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:04,483
But this guy, he saw things. He said things.

175
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:06,484
Such as?

176
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:09,965
They'll come at me through my family.

177
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:13,125
- Who will?
- I don't know... yet.

178
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:18,446
But whatever touched this guy, it made him
see through what the rest of us are seeing.

179
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:21,809
He knew someone's hurting my mom
and they're trying to get to me.

180
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:26,842
It's possible, but still... the ramblings
of a madman aren't much to go on.

181
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:31,051
Yeah, but it's a start. We need to find out
who's making my mom sick, and how.

182
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,124
Then what?

183
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:37,491
Then I hunt them, find them, and kill them.

184
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:44,328
When you think about it,
I'm the victim here.

185
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:47,487
First off, I don't even wanna be here.

186
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:52,806
I'm not talking about this room, city, state
or planet. I'm talking about the mortal coil.

187
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,487
It's disgusting.

188
00:14:55,573 --> 00:15:00,442
The food, the clothes... the people.

189
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,127
I could crap a better existence than this.

190
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,091
But...

191
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:12,169
Tell me if this next part gets a little too
personal, because I have boundary issues.

192
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,130
But I'm hurt.

193
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:21,044
Yes. By your incredibly selfish behaviour.

194
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:27,532
Newsflash, hairdo: it's not always about you.

195
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:31,167
All I want is the Key.

196
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:38,045
Why can't you tell me where the Key is?

197
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:49,883
Forgive me... monky.

198
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,883
Sometimes I just get so anxious,

199
00:15:55,293 --> 00:16:00,162
like there's something deep inside of me
and it's swelling up and it's making me crazy,

200
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:04,644
that I forget there's
all that duct tape on your face.

201
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:07,172
Now...

202
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,085
tell me where the Key is.

203
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:17,404
Or I'm going bowling.

204
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:23,609
It's OK, it's OK.
The stutter's sexy. Keep it coming.

205
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:37,043
speak American.

206
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:41,131
I... will tell you...

207
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,444
..nothing.

208
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:56,612
Fine.

209
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:01,402
You know what I wish?

210
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:06,043
I wish that you could feel
what I'm feeling right now.

211
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:09,804
Whatever you are,
whatever you're on, please.

212
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:15,285
Cos I don't know
how much more of this I can take.

213
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,044
I have a wife.

214
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:24,285
Her name's Jennifer.
We have two daughters.

215
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:31,962
I bet this is fun for you, isn't it?

216
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:36,005
Say it. You like to torture me.

217
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:41,202
Why? You don't even own
the damn thing and I want it, I need it.

218
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:45,730
I've gotta have it now and you keep
refusing to tell me where the Key is.

219
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:48,327
And it's typical. It's typical. It's typical.

220
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:53,043
The mortal meat sack comes with stink and
bile, sweat and protein. Yes, I said humans.

221
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,532
Not now, Mommy's talking.

222
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:58,891
Wriggling, prowling, crawling, cavorting,
doing it over and over and over and over

223
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:03,683
until someone's gonna sit down
on their tuffet and make this birthing stop!

224
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:23,683
That is so much better.

225
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:29,846
- Do you gift-wrap?
- Do we!

226
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:33,323
Do we? We do. A little help.

227
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:38,326
No, no, no.
Ground cloven hooves are 30°% off.

228
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,811
The whole ones are full price.

229
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:45,244
That's not candy...

230
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:47,287
Xander.

231
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:49,682
There's too many of them. People.

232
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:51,923
And they all seem to want things.

233
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:56,328
I hear ya. Stay British. You'll be OK.

234
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,963
The thousand-yard stare.

235
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:03,841
Damn. You hate to see that
on any man but especially in retail.

236
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:07,204
Please go.

237
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:10,765
Anya, the Shopkeepers' Union
of America called.

238
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:14,732
They want me to tell you that "Please go"
just got replaced with "Have a nice day".

239
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:17,964
But I have their money.
Who cares what kind of day they have?

240
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:24,208
No one. It's just a long cultural tradition
of raging insincerity. Embrace it.

241
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:27,563
Hey, you. Have a nice day.

242
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:30,491
There's my girl!

243
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:37,888
Did you ever think in a million years
you'd miss the high-school library?

244
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:42,763
Someone put a spell on my mom.
Something to make it seem like she's sick.

245
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:45,447
That's a new kind of nasty. Any suspects?

246
00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:49,522
Well, I've got the list narrowed down
to just under infinity.

247
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,124
Does this look right to you?

248
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,362
Sure. If you wrapped it with your feet.

249
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:08,046
Buffy, there used to be this French sorcerer
back in the 16th... I don't know what name...

250
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,966
- Cloutier?
- So cute in his little knickers.

251
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:15,491
But he had this one spell demons
just hated called "tirer la couverture".

252
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:19,452
- "Rotate many foodstuffs"?
- "Pull the curtain back."

253
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:24,482
A spell to see spells. A trance to see spells,
actually, but you get the idea. Try that.

254
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,643
What do you mean, "see" spells?

255
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:31,648
All spells leave a trace signature.
It's just not perceptible to the human eye.

256
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:36,247
In this case, it could be the image
of a hand choking your mother.

257
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,285
Or a cloud of mist around her.

258
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:42,651
Or maybe the shape of the demon
that's performing the spell?

259
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,325
Possible, yes.

260
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:47,208
So I'll do what Monsieur Silk Knickers did.

261
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:50,205
I'll go home, get trancey
and see what's affecting my mom.

262
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:52,488
I don't know, Buffy. Trances?

263
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:55,246
Yes, the sorcerer Cloutier was legendary.

264
00:20:56,973 --> 00:21:00,443
His skills at achieving
higher states of consciousness were...

265
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:06,130
Better than mine? I knew he'd say that. But
I've been practising concentration. I'm close.

266
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:11,207
- Are you ready?
- It's my mom. I'll get ready. What do I need?

267
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:16,086
Thanks for coming over.
I really appreciate the help.

268
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:18,607
Sure thing. So what do I do?

269
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:21,443
Lots. Tons.

270
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,808
Lots and lots of tons.

271
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:25,929
- This is all kinda...
- New terrain?

272
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:28,004
All praying, no slaying.

273
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:32,564
OK, so the incense needs
to be ignited. There's ajob.

274
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:35,531
This stuff needs to get poured
around me in a circle.

275
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:37,808
You need me to light incense and pour sand?

276
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:41,488
Magic incense... and spooky sand.

277
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:44,929
- The ritual itself is...
- Something you do alone.

278
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,052
Are you sure this isn'tjust your way
of trying to make me feel less...

279
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,601
"cute and weak and kittenish"?

280
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,285
"Kitteny."

281
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:55,364
Right. Much manlier.

282
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,045
Look...

283
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:05,169
- I really am OK.
- I know.

284
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:08,450
So I'm not Superguy any more.
It was borrowed power anyway.

285
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,728
Had to give it back sometime.

286
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:16,762
I know you can handle yourself.
I just didn't wanna see you get hurt.

287
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:22,528
Maybe instead of you trying to take care
of me, we agree to take care of each other.

288
00:22:22,613 --> 00:22:24,888
Deal?

289
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,004
Done.

290
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:30,492
Good.

291
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:34,291
For luck.

292
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,008
A girl needs more luck than that.

293
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:45,804
Have a nice trip.

294
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:22,127
- What are you doing?
- My boyfriend. Go away.

295
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:25,410
- Liar. Are you doing magic?
- No, I'm not.

296
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:29,170
- Can I watch?
- No, you can't.

297
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:33,690
Come on. Please, please.
Like, times ten and cubed. Please!

298
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:39,764
Yeah, well, I can smell
your stinky incense down the hall.

299
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:42,049
And your clothes are gonna reek.

300
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:45,045
And if you are doing magic, I am so telling.

301
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,648
Fine. Go. Go tell.
Go do whatever you want.

302
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,724
Just go.

303
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,803
Buffy?

304
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:30,690
Mom.

305
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,325
Are you going out?

306
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:38,292
Either modern medicine's working
or I took the world's best placebo.

307
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:40,728
Either way,
I'm going out for a couple of hours.

308
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:41,928
Nothing.

309
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:47,091
There's nothing.

310
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:50,768
Are you sure you're feeling OK?
You seem a little out of it.

311
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:01,525
Hey, Buffy?

312
00:26:01,613 --> 00:26:04,525
Oh. Yeah, I'm fine.

313
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:09,172
Long day's all.
You go, have a good time.

314
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:12,764
You're so grown-up.

315
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,852
Buffy?

316
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:05,372
Buffy.

317
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:10,647
Buffy, who said
you could come in my room?

318
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:19,524
You're not my sister.

319
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:30,526
Yeah, like I even wanna be related
to your nasty self. What are you doing?

320
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:32,604
- What are you?
- Get off me.

321
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,570
- You wanna hurt me?
- Let go, you freak.

322
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,087
- Then you deal with me.
- I'm telling Mom.

323
00:27:37,173 --> 00:27:39,403
You stay away from my mother.

324
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:53,286
- What?
- Buffy?

325
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:57,491
I'm glad I've caught you. We may have
underestimated what we're dealing with.

326
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:00,242
Go on.

327
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:04,563
We've uncovered
more than expected about this orb.

328
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:12,808
It's called the Dagon Sphere and it has
a history going back many centuries.

329
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:15,523
- What's it do?
- It's a protective device.

330
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:19,051
Used to ward off ancient primordial evil.

331
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:23,201
- Any word on what this evil looks like?
- Unfortunately, no.

332
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:25,409
This is where accounts get...

333
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:26,972
Excuse me.

334
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:29,044
This is where accounts get vague.

335
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:32,887
All we've managed to uncover so far is...

336
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:37,046
the Dagon Sphere was created to repel
That-Which-Cannot-Be-Named.

337
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:43,326
I'm gonna go back to the factory. Whoever
planted this doohickey's got answers.

338
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:46,166
You've heard me say this before,
but do be careful.

339
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:50,724
Anything that goes unnamed is usually
an object of deep worship or great fear.

340
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:56,049
Have you completed the trance?
Seen what's harming your mother?

341
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,806
That's the thing. I just saw...

342
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:03,802
Nothing.

343
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:06,604
It didn't work.

344
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,763
What are you talking about?

345
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:14,321
Slayer stuff.

346
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:16,643
I'm going out.

347
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:19,486
Do you really think I care you're the Slayer?

348
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:25,088
What's that supposed to mean?

349
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,687
I'll be home in an hour.

350
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:32,764
Mom's coming back.

351
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:35,444
I'll be back first.

352
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,732
Spike.

353
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:00,132
Hi, Buffy.

354
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,522
Don't take this the wrong way, but...

355
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:09,008
What are you doing here?

356
00:30:09,093 --> 00:30:11,209
Five words or less.

357
00:30:12,653 --> 00:30:15,121
Out for a walk.

358
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:17,608
Bitch.

359
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:22,050
Out for a walk at night by my house.
No one has time for this, William.

360
00:30:22,413 --> 00:30:24,404
On your merry way, then.

361
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,567
Contrary to one's self-involved world-view,

362
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:33,842
your house happens to be directly
between parts and other parts of this town.

363
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:38,848
I would pass by in the day but I'm outgrowing
my whole "burst into flame" phase.

364
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:44,245
- Fine. Keep going. I cut you a break.
- Yeah, OK. Let me guess, you won't kill me?

365
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:50,211
The whole crowd-pleasing threats
and swagger routine. How original.

366
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:52,363
I'm just passing through.

367
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,205
Satisfied?

368
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:57,004
I really hope so,

369
00:30:57,093 --> 00:31:01,962
cos God knows you need some satisfaction
in life besides shagging Captain Cardboard.

370
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:06,251
And I never really liked you anyway.
And... you have stupid hair.

371
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:19,532
Buffy?

372
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:23,412
Girls?

373
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:30,364
Where is everybody?

374
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:32,332
Hi, Mom.

375
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,842
Dawn. Where's Buffy?

376
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:38,163
You don't have to worry about her.

377
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:42,087
You're probably right.
It's not like she's never patrolled before.

378
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:46,644
Anyway, I was feeling kind of...
What's the medical term? Crappy.

379
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,724
So I called off the big night out.

380
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:50,492
Want tea, Mom?

381
00:32:52,093 --> 00:32:53,970
I made it for you.

382
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:09,725
It was you who planted
the Dagon Sphere, right?

383
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:13,284
I got it.

384
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,482
Don't worry.
I'm stronger than I look.

385
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:19,887
I've had experience
with stuff like this before.

386
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:21,964
Best of all...

387
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,284
I'm not stupid.

388
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,971
Sure about that last part?

389
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:48,451
Would someone please
rip that bloody bell off its hinges?

390
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:51,127
Would that involve moving?

391
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:53,204
My feet are numb.

392
00:33:53,293 --> 00:33:56,490
I'll see your numbness
and I'll raise you a lower back pain.

393
00:33:56,573 --> 00:34:01,124
I think I liked it better when demons would
just crash in here and tear the place apart.

394
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:03,010
Itjust seemed simpler.

395
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:06,608
You're out of crystal balls.
They're popular with the amateurs.

396
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:10,527
Better restock and raise
the price 10°%. Make it 15.

397
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:13,446
- Anya...
- Cash register looks like a squirrel's nest.

398
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:15,967
- Anya...
- The Hand of Glory packs serious power.

399
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:19,329
- Better institute a check for...
- Anya!

400
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:24,088
Would you like ajob?

401
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:26,164
OK.

402
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:30,726
Good. Then we can talk shop tomorrow.

403
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:32,372
OK.

404
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,012
Boss.

405
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:39,925
Hey, any word from Buffy
on how her spell went?

406
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:42,648
She said it didn't work.

407
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:46,772
Now she's off investigating
whoever left the Dagon Sphere behind.

408
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:49,965
You're not worried about
the Slaymaster General, are you?

409
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:51,964
No, no.

410
00:34:52,053 --> 00:34:54,726
I just hope she isn't doing anything too rash.

411
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:00,001
And another thing.
I just want you to know...

412
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:09,210
this "beat you to death" thing - it's valuable
time out of life that I'm never gonna get back.

413
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:14,451
Wait. I've always wanted
to try that thing with worms

414
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:17,206
where, if you rip it in half,
you get two worms.

415
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:19,488
D'you think that'll work with you?

416
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:24,409
You hit me. Are you crazy?

417
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:28,611
You can't go around hitting people.
Were you born in a barn?

418
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:32,163
Fine. Be that way.

419
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:41,969
I just noticed something.
You have superpowers.

420
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:44,442
That is so cool.

421
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:46,524
Can you fly?

422
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:01,764
Hey. Hands off my holy man.

423
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,367
Stop.

424
00:36:37,453 --> 00:36:40,047
- Please.
- No. We have to keep going.

425
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:50,527
My journey is done, I think.

426
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:53,122
Don't get metaphory on me. We're going.

427
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,283
You have to...

428
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:56,931
The Key.

429
00:36:57,013 --> 00:36:59,652
You must protect the Key.

430
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:04,249
Fine. We can protect the Key together, OK?
Just far, far from here.

431
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:09,327
Many more die... if you don't keep it safe.

432
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:12,009
How? What is it?

433
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:15,449
The Key is energy.

434
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,683
It's a portal.

435
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:19,764
It opens the door.

436
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:23,444
The Dagon Sphere?

437
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:25,128
No.

438
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:30,766
For centuries it had no form at all.

439
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:34,448
My brethren... its only keepers.

440
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:41,289
Then the abomination found us.

441
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:43,648
We had to hide the Key.

442
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:46,884
Gave it form. Moulded it flesh.

443
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,966
Made it human and sent it to you.

444
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,804
Dawn.

445
00:37:57,253 --> 00:37:59,244
She is the Key.

446
00:38:00,773 --> 00:38:02,764
You put that in my house?

447
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:06,322
We knew the Slayer would protect.

448
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:10,047
My memories and my mom's?

449
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:13,409
- We built them.
- Then unbuild them.

450
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:15,529
This is my life you're...

451
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:21,766
You cannot abandon.

452
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:26,802
I didn't ask for this.
I don't even know...

453
00:38:26,893 --> 00:38:29,407
What is she?

454
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:31,484
Human.

455
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:35,361
Now human... and helpless.

456
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,732
Please...

457
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:42,572
She is an innocent in this.

458
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:44,884
She needs you.

459
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:50,444
She's not my sister.

460
00:38:52,453 --> 00:38:55,445
She doesn't know that.

461
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,524
You're home.

462
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,122
I wasn't bothering her.

463
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:34,404
What was that all about?

464
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:37,052
Nothing.

465
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:44,844
Sister stuff.

466
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:49,565
Go away.

467
00:39:54,813 --> 00:39:56,804
I'm sorry.

468
00:39:58,693 --> 00:40:01,491
- You hurt my arm.
- I know.

469
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,285
Butthole.

470
00:40:07,893 --> 00:40:09,724
Really sorry.

471
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:15,413
I tell you, I have this theory.

472
00:40:15,493 --> 00:40:18,530
It goes where you're the one
who's not my sister.

473
00:40:18,613 --> 00:40:21,844
Cos Mom adopted you from
a shoe box full of baby howler monkeys

474
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:25,972
and never told you, cos it could
hurt your delicate baby feelings.

475
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:37,002
That's your theory?

476
00:40:37,093 --> 00:40:39,812
Explains your fashion sense.

477
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:41,884
And smell.

478
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:45,848
I'm sorry, OK?

479
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:47,924
Broken record much?

480
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:52,372
You can't even take an apology.
You always do that. Ever since...

481
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:07,764
I just had a bad day.

482
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:09,969
Join the club.

483
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:12,362
- Can I be president?
- I'm president.

484
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:15,804
You could be the janitor.

485
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:18,252
OK.

486
00:41:33,173 --> 00:41:35,164
- Buffy?
- Yeah?

487
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:38,524
What's wrong with Mom?

488
00:41:43,493 --> 00:41:45,484
I don't know.

489
