00:00:01,522 --> 00:00:03,001
<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:04,913
- I killed people.
- I've not forgotten.

3
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:07,152
When you brought me here,
I thought it was to kill me.

4
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:09,961
Instead, you go all Dumbledore on me.

5
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:13,079
I don't wanna go back home
just so I can screw up again.

6
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:17,519
- What exactly are you afraid of?
- What if I go all veiny and homicidal again?

7
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:19,558
- What if...
- They won't take you back?

8
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:22,634
Did you turn this nice lady's ex
into a giant worm monster?

9
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,758
You wish it, I dish it.

10
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,878
- It's what you wanted.
- What happened?

11
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:28,953
Why does a man do what he mustn't? For her.

12
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:30,839
<i>(whispers)</i> Your soul.

13
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:33,480
You got your soul back.

14
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:37,439
I'll call you when I get there.

15
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:40,232
OK? They said they'd meet us.

16
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:42,114
Oh, look, they're there.

17
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,274
- Hi!
- Hi, honey.

18
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:48,239
- How are you doing?
- Good.

19
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:51,200
- And how's it going with you two?
- <i>(both)</i> Hi, Dad.

20
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:55,193
- Go on!
- Hey!

21
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:57,671
- See what you did?
- Stop acting up!

23
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:10,601
- You think she'll get the sign?
- Get the sign?

24
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:13,879
I don't think she's gonna see the sign.
Why is it so pale?

25
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:18,235
I used yellow crayon. It was a thing
from when I talked to Willow on the bluff.

26
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:23,232
- I hope she gets it.
- Oh, tell us again what you said.

27
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:27,952
Well, I was talking from my heart and I knew
Evil Willow wasn't really ready to...

28
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:30,761
- You were kidding.
- A little bit.

29
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:33,993
We've heard the crayon speech.
But it is great, of course.

30
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:38,473
I saved the world with talking from
my mouth. My mouth saved the world!

31
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:41,401
Uh-huh. I'm getting nervous.

32
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:44,519
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:48,914
It's gonna be weird seeing her. What
do you say to someone in this situation?

34
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,754
I'm gonna say "Hi, Willow."

35
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:55,074
Come on. You're saying
it's not gonna be the least bit strange?

36
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:59,273
We saw her kill someone.
She was about to kill Dawn.

37
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:03,799
Giles wouldn't let her leave unless she
completed that whatever recovery course.

38
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,600
Right.

39
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:10,398
- Right?
- She kinda didn't finish.

40
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:14,953
She didn't finish?
She didn't finish being not evil?

41
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:20,674
He said it's important that she come back
early, she's doing well and not to worry.

42
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:23,071
- Guys, I just noticed something.
- What?

43
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:27,152
Everyone's off the plane, so where's Willow?

44
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,959
I'll call you when I get there.

45
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:35,472
OK? They said they'd meet us.

46
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,514
Oh, look, they're there.

47
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:41,634
- Hi!
- Hi, honey.

48
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:43,599
- How are you doing?
- Good.

49
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:46,560
- And how's it going with you two?
- <i>(both)</i> Hi, Dad.

50
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,673
- Go on.
- Hey!

51
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:53,151
- See what you did?
- Stop acting up!

52
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:11,233
Welcome home, me.

53
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,751
<i>(voice)</i> All alone.

54
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:32,597
Are you frightened to be all alone?

55
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:34,874
Hey, is somebody there?

56
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:39,198
The wind talks when you're alone.

57
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:43,161
<i>- (maniacal laughter)</i>
- You'd better clear out, whoever you are.

58
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,233
<i>- (shrieking)</i>
- Aargh!

59
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:06,553
Buffy?

60
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,473
Hello?

61
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:07,993
<i>- (gunshot)</i>
<i>- (Willow) Tara?</i>

62
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:42,233
<i>(door opens)</i>

63
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,157
Dawn? Did I hear the door?

64
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,550
They absolutely
put her on the plane in London.

65
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,236
So, she got off in Chicago
when they stopped?

66
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:28,359
She could've caught a flight
anywhere from there.

67
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:32,071
Maybe she doubled back.
Got off the plane in London after Giles left.

68
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:37,441
Well, if she's doing that - ducking Giles -
then, she's evil, right?

69
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:41,276
I've avoided Giles tons of times.
Just meant I was lazy, not evil.

70
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:46,632
I hope you're right, because defeating
Lazy Willow - probably less hard.

71
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:50,438
We should check the messages.
See if she tried to reach us here.

72
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:51,921
Good idea.

73
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,993
<i>- (door shuts)</i>
<i>- (noise)</i>

74
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:58,313
- What was that?
- Upstairs.

75
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:01,153
Willow, is that you?

76
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,557
<i>(Buffy)</i> Definitely not up there.

77
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:13,439
She didn't leave a message?

78
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:16,355
I checked with Giles again.
He hasn't heard from her.

79
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,912
- Is he throwing a tasteful British wiggins?
- Oh, with extra wig.

80
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:25,471
He's blaming himself pretty hard.
Like he should've known she wasn't ready.

81
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:27,837
I kept telling him it wasn't his fault.

82
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:29,958
Maybe she couldn't face us.

83
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,034
Like she didn't think we were ready
to forgive her. I get that.

84
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:37,157
So Giles is blaming Giles,
and we're blaming us.

85
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:41,080
Is anyone gonna blame Willow?

86
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:43,630
Oh, don't give me shock face.

87
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:47,158
Will anyone around here
ever start asking for help when they need it?

88
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,312
If Willow flipped out, it's her bad.

89
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:54,601
We can only be here for her so much
if she won't be, you know, here.

90
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:44,917
Hello. I'm calling for Giles. A Mr Giles?

91
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:48,995
Right. Council meeting all day.

92
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:52,154
No, no, I know he can't be reached there.

93
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:54,233
Thanks, bye.

94
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:16,999
Anya!

95
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,879
Anya, don't! Don't run away.

96
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,320
What are you doing here?

97
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:24,474
I thought you were with Giles
studying how to not kill people.

98
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:27,679
- I just got back.
- As in you're all better or,

99
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:30,754
just got back to bring about
a fiery apocalypse of death?

100
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:36,919
Neither, but I have been studying.
Working real hard, and I'm gonna be fine.

101
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,152
Oh. Good.

102
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,756
Cos I remember the last time you said that.

103
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:46,074
I've spent a lot of time since then
cleaning the debris out of my ex-livelihood.

104
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,595
Stuff like that.

105
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:51,515
Yeah, I wanna help any way I can with that.

106
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,877
I feel really responsible.

107
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:57,841
You feel really responsible?
You are really responsible!

108
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:01,275
I know I hurt you and... and everyone.

109
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,795
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:07,355
You should know vengeance demons
don't ruth with the "sorry."

111
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:11,321
We prefer "Oh, God, please stop
hitting me with my own rib bones."

112
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:14,155
Go on. Say whatever you want.

113
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:17,234
Rib bones and so forth. I deserve it.

114
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:20,553
Then you won't mind?

115
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:23,756
- Well, then, that's no fun.
- Sorry.

116
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:44,714
So, where is everyone these days?

117
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,997
Well, I'm back in my own apartment.

118
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,074
And, of course,
vengeance takes me all over the world.

119
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:53,632
I was in Brazil yesterday.
They love their soccer.

120
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:55,832
And the others?

121
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:57,514
Dawn and...

122
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:01,437
Xander? Buffy?

123
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:04,719
- You haven't seen them?
- Not so much.

124
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:08,074
Huh. I guess they're still mad at you.

125
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:13,036
They've been a little temperamental lately,
just between you and me.

126
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:17,117
- We had this little mix-up a few days ago...
- That sounds great. So...

127
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,193
Where do you think they'd be?

128
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:24,402
At the new high school, probably.
Everyone's all about the high school.

129
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:27,280
Buffy's got some job there
helping junior deviants,

130
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:31,275
Spike's insane in the basement,
Xander's there doing construction...

131
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:33,592
Wait, Spike's what in the whatment?

132
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:35,912
Insane. Base.

133
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,993
Xander does construction.

134
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:41,677
He likes to start early,
so he's probably there by now.

135
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,634
Xander?

136
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:57,753
Xander, are you down there?

137
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,474
No skin.

138
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,159
Tough to look at.

139
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,632
And yet my eyes refuse to look away.
Stupid eyes.

140
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,681
I found it first thing this morning.

141
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:39,675
I gave my crew the day off,
and I called you right away.

142
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:43,994
I gotta get a job where
I don't get called right away for this stuff.

143
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:50,960
Yeah, I know exactly what you're thinking.
Maybe Willow <i>is</i> back.

144
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,233
<i>(class bell)</i>

145
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:34,957
Out! This is my place.
You need permission to be here.

146
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,317
You need a special slip with a stamp.

147
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:40,041
Spike. My God...

148
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:44,354
You go off, you try to wall up the bad parts,
put your heart back in where it fell out.

149
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:48,720
You call yourself finished, but you're not.
You're worse than ever, you are.

150
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,159
You went away.

151
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:01,352
You've been gone since...

152
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,754
Yeah, I needed to go. But I'm back now.

153
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:08,159
And I found...

154
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:11,754
- There's a body.
- Tragedy.

155
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:14,354
Is there blood?

156
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:19,394
Yeah. And I can't find Buffy
or Xander or Dawn and...

157
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,677
there's this thing killing people.

158
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:27,080
The victim was skinned.
What could do that?

159
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:31,034
You did it once. I heard about it.

160
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:35,911
Anything other... other than me?

161
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,234
Look at you...

162
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:42,873
glowing.

163
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:47,034
What's a word means "glowing"?
Gotta rhyme.

164
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:49,795
- Spike?
- Oh... no!

165
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,756
I should hide. Hide from you.

166
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:55,515
Hide my face. You know what I did.

167
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:58,400
What you did? You didn't do anything.

168
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:00,994
Did you?

169
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:03,073
Everyone's talking to me.

170
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:06,601
No one's talking to each other.

171
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:09,799
Spike, please try to listen to me.

172
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:12,601
Someone isn't here.

173
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:16,280
Button, button. Who's got the button?

174
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:19,752
My money's on the witch.

175
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:27,431
We can't use the blueprints
to find our way around down here.

176
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,990
It's like the walls move or something.

177
00:16:31,362 --> 00:16:34,911
<i>- (Spike)</i> Out! This is my place.
- I think I hear him.

178
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:37,391
You need a special slip with a stamp.

179
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:44,272
..and put your heart back in where it fell out.
You call yourself finished, but you're not.

180
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:46,353
Worse off than ever, you are.

181
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,600
Spike.

182
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,274
Spike!

183
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:00,595
You went away.

184
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:03,242
- You've been gone since...
- The church.

185
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:07,278
You scared me a little. I didn't...

186
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:11,239
- I didn't know what to think.
- We're here for a reason.

187
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,280
Tragedy.

188
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,392
Is there blood?

189
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,996
He knows. He must have seen the body.

190
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:24,792
- You did it once. I heard about it.
- Spike, we need to know who did this.

191
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,441
Look at you...

192
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:31,921
glowing.

193
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:37,792
What's a word means "glowing"?
It's gotta rhyme.

194
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:39,281
Spike, please.

195
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:45,279
I... I should hide. Hide from you.

196
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:48,160
Hide my face. You know what I did.

197
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:52,795
- Boy, he's extra useful today.
- <i>(whispers)</i> This isn't the time.

198
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:55,350
Everyone's talking to me.

199
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,593
No one's talking to each other.

200
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:01,277
Might as well go.

201
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,717
Someone isn't here.

202
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:08,076
Button, button. Who's got the button?

203
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:10,596
My money's on the witch.

204
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:15,153
Red's a bad girl.

205
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,994
He's talking about Willow.

206
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:21,075
And that means something
because he's chock-full-of-sanity.

207
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,994
- Maybe he saw her.
- They think you did it.

208
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:29,117
The Slayer and her boy.

209
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:31,670
They think you took the skin.

210
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,400
Is there something here?
Something that killed?

211
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,474
Her boy? I'm her boy?

212
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:42,521
I have to go.

213
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:46,481
There are things here without permission.
I have to check their slips.

214
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:49,156
Make sure they have authorisation.

215
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:55,961
- I need help.
- I don't have any money.

216
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:58,033
I don't want money.

217
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:02,957
Come in. Enjoy my personal space.

218
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:08,273
- I found a dead body near the high school.
- Yes, that can happen.

219
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:11,752
Something horrible killed a boy.
Took his skin right off.

220
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:13,673
- <i>(both)</i> Was it you?
- <i>(both)</i> No!

221
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:18,753
With the skin thing, they're definitely
gonna think it was you. Buffy is, anyway.

222
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:21,993
Yeah. Maybe she already does,
I don't know. I just...

223
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:27,390
I have to find whatever did this.
I just... I need to do something right.

224
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:31,634
Oh, and so they'll think it wasn't you, right?
That has to be part of it.

225
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:35,761
Maybe you're thinking you kill this thing,
they don't have to know about it.

226
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,152
- Won't suspect you, even for a minute.
- No, I don't...

227
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:43,360
- When did you get all insightful?
- I'm surprisingly sensitive.

228
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:45,114
So, will you help me?

229
00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:49,517
Is it difficult or time-consuming?

230
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:58,838
- This isn't gonna get all sexy, is it?
- I'd be shocked.

231
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:02,119
- OK, do you have your powder?
- Oh, I ate that.

232
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,560
I have it.

233
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:09,952
OK, we scatter it over the map, and where
there's a demon, a little light appears.

234
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,998
Oh, pretty!

235
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:14,277
- Will it hurt the carpet?
- No.

236
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:20,038
OK, scatter.

237
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:25,636
<i>(both)</i> Oh!

238
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:29,277
Hey, look! That's me.

239
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:32,078
Hello!

240
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:36,277
- What's that huge clump?
- It's the high school.

241
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:40,833
- It's all Hellmouthy underneath.
- Things have been stirring there lately.

242
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:46,161
- Is it getting brighter?
- Smoke!

243
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,477
Uh! OK.

244
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:56,360
Remember our talk about the carpet?

245
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,599
Hey, this could be it.

246
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:01,640
It's strong, it's near the body...

247
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,599
and it's all by itself.

248
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:09,600
Hiding in the woods or maybe a cave.
There are a couple good caves around there.

249
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,435
I don't know. Sounds pretty thin to me.

250
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,832
Well, if you teleport over there
real quick like a bunn...

251
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:20,837
- Real quick and see if I'm right.
- No, sorry. You damaged my carpet.

252
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:24,798
Anya, you're a vengeance demon.
Just teleport.

253
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:30,474
Well, as it turns out,
teleporting isn't a right, it's a privilege.

254
00:21:30,562 --> 00:21:34,760
I withdrew a vengeance spell last week,
and this is my punishment.

255
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:39,913
I can only teleport for official business.
I have to file a flight plan and everything.

256
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:43,872
Oh. I'm sorry. That must be hard.

257
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:46,398
Yeah, it bites a pretty big one.

258
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:49,637
And the vengeance itself, it's...

259
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:53,800
It's not as fulfilling as I remember.

260
00:21:54,362 --> 00:22:00,437
Really? Cos I got the impression
that you enjoyed, you know, inflicting.

261
00:22:00,522 --> 00:22:04,401
Well, causing pain
sounds really cool, I know, but...

262
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,791
it turns out it's really upsetting.

263
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:10,760
Didn't use to be, but now it is.

264
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:15,757
Is it like you're scared
of losing that feeling again?

265
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:18,754
And then having it be OK to hurt people?

266
00:22:18,842 --> 00:22:23,518
And then you're not in charge of the power
any more because it's in charge of you?

267
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,834
Wow, that was...

268
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:30,153
really over-dramatically stated,
but, yeah, that's it.

269
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:32,961
I get it. Believe me.

270
00:22:33,842 --> 00:22:35,992
I'm sorry, Willow.

271
00:22:36,082 --> 00:22:40,678
- I wish it were better for you.
- You too.

272
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:45,561
It did get a little sexy, didn't it?

273
00:22:46,362 --> 00:22:49,160
- I have to find this monster.
- Willow?

274
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:52,517
Isn't there another spell?

275
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:56,720
You're trying to find Buffy and Xander.
Couldn't we use a spell to do that?

276
00:22:56,802 --> 00:23:01,432
I did. I tried, and something went kaflooey,
and it didn't work.

277
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:04,320
- What did it say?
- It said they don't exist.

278
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:11,753
OK, I looked up demons
that skin their victims

279
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:14,800
and demons that flay their victims
cos, same thing.

280
00:23:14,882 --> 00:23:18,352
There's a ton of prospects.
Anything else gone?

281
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:24,881
- Eyeballs, toenails or viscera? That's guts.
- She knows about viscera. Makes you proud.

282
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:28,674
- Just skin.
- OK, I'll work on that.

283
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,834
- What's up?
- I need to do something.

284
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:43,835
- I just... I have this feeling in my gut...
- In your viscera.

285
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,517
..that we know exactly who did this.
And this work that we're doing

286
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:50,435
is just a way to convince ourselves
that Willow's OK.

287
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,831
Guys! I got a good one.

288
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:59,360
A demon called "Gnarl." He's a parasite
with these nasty long fingernails.

289
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:02,718
He secretes something through them
which paralyses his victims.

290
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:07,273
He then cuts strips of their skin
while they're still alive. It takes hours.

291
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,717
We didn't find any strips of skin.

292
00:24:09,802 --> 00:24:12,077
Which, by the way, gghh!

293
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:14,153
You wouldn't. He eats them.

294
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:17,473
That's why he's a parasite.
It's like his natural food.

295
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:21,157
Dawn, you're new at this,
and I get why you're proud,

296
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:26,077
but I'm not exactly sure why this demon
is any more likely than any of the others.

297
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:28,153
You never said pool of blood.

298
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:31,598
- There was no pool, just splatters.
- Then this is your guy.

299
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:34,958
He laps up the blood.
You could say it's, like, his natural beverage.

300
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:39,957
- You're terrifying.
- Now if we just knew how to find this thing.

301
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:43,432
- We can ask questions at Willy's Place.
- Or, we could be smart.

302
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,598
- Sorry, Xander.
- What?

303
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:51,150
Whoever did this had to get blood on them,
which means they left a trail.

304
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:54,200
- Minute traces of blood.
- And we have a way to track it.

305
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:55,920
We have a...

306
00:24:56,002 --> 00:24:58,391
Oh. I get it.

307
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:01,273
What? How?

308
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:03,681
What's goin' on?

309
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,153
William's a good boy.
Carries her water, carries her sin.

310
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:10,791
Supposed to get easier.
Supposed to help to help, but it doesn't.

311
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:12,474
Still so heavy.

312
00:25:14,842 --> 00:25:16,833
We should've put a leash on him.

313
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:19,436
Yes, let's tie ourselves to the crazy vampire.

314
00:25:19,522 --> 00:25:22,514
- You really think it's gonna work?
- It's pretty easy.

315
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:27,676
Spike follows the exciting smell of blood,
and we follow the fairly ripe smell of Spike.

316
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,992
It's smell-ementary.

317
00:25:30,082 --> 00:25:32,755
Also, I'm sure there's tons of stuff like this.

318
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:37,597
Procedures we can use that don't involve
magic spells. Just good, solid detective work.

319
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:41,914
And we can develop a database of tooth
impressions and demon-skin samples

320
00:25:42,002 --> 00:25:46,359
- and I could wear high heels more often.
- That was so close to being empowered.

321
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:48,512
Everybody loves a slender ankle.

322
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:51,836
That's it. End of the line. Everyone off.

323
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:54,755
Keep your ticket, you'll need that.

324
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:57,800
- There's a rock cliff.
- Give him a break, Buffy.

325
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:00,794
Maybe it's a vicious skin-eating rock cliff.

326
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,797
There's a cave in it. Look.

327
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:08,481
I'm insane. What's his excuse?

328
00:26:39,802 --> 00:26:41,030
<i>(scampering)</i>

329
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:44,233
<i>(Gnarl)</i> All alone.

330
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:54,713
Dark and dank.

331
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:57,270
- I was hoping it'd be dark and dank.
- Shh!

332
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:59,193
<i>- (scampering)</i>
- Do you hear that?

333
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:01,273
- No, I don't.
<i>- (scampering)</i>

334
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:03,353
But now I do.

335
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:07,879
- Something's moving in here.
- Guess we're in the right place.

336
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:12,076
<i>(Gnarl)</i> Look at the shorn lamb.

337
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:15,234
See how it trembles.

338
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:17,916
Is it the cold wind?

339
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:25,035
Or is it that the flock is nowhere to be seen?

340
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:30,720
Poor little lamb all alone.

341
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:34,913
- You guys hear that, right?
- Yep.

342
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:38,640
It's echoing. It sounds close,
but I don't think...

343
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,713
<i>- (shrieking)</i>
- Dawn!

344
00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:44,156
- Are you OK?
- I guess so.

345
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:47,352
- Poison paralyses.
- Dawn.

346
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:52,358
OK, we need to get her out of here.
We'll deal with him later. Seal him in.

347
00:27:54,482 --> 00:27:57,315
<i>- (rocks being moved)</i>
- What's going on? Who's there?

348
00:27:59,322 --> 00:28:00,914
No! Stop!

349
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:04,671
<i>(maniacal laughter)</i>

350
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:10,751
<i>(maniacal laughter continues)</i>

351
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:19,552
No way out now. No way out.

352
00:28:20,762 --> 00:28:24,357
Protect me, Goddess.
In thy name, I supplicate myself.

353
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:29,357
Take the powers from my enemy,
and lay him lower than the lowest field.

354
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:33,071
Gnarl loves spells.

355
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:35,278
He keeps them as pets.

356
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:37,956
They love him.

357
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:40,920
And they leave him alone.

358
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:45,678
You may be immune to magic,
but I've got more than that.

359
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:50,153
- You wanna fight?
- Your friends left you here.

360
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:53,996
<i># No one comes to save you

361
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:58,234
They wanted me to have you.

362
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:06,597
The computer. That thing Dawn was reading
might have an antidote for the paralysis.

363
00:29:06,682 --> 00:29:08,479
- <i>(muffled)</i> Buffy?
- What?

364
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:11,030
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, it's OK.

365
00:29:11,122 --> 00:29:15,877
- It had paralysing fingernails.
- Just like you said, so good on you.

366
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:23,437
Did they leave you as a gifty for me?
Are you a tasty little gifty?

367
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:27,435
- Stop it.
- Or did they just throw you away?

368
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:31,754
Were they here? Were my friends
really here? I heard something.

369
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:32,991
<i>(shrieking)</i>

370
00:29:37,762 --> 00:29:42,074
They were here. Here they were.
And there they went.

371
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:44,551
<i># Gone, all gone, what a pretty song

372
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,754
They sealed you in with me.

373
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:56,115
I love a gifty.

374
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:00,630
Can't wait to unwrap it.

375
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:04,834
Oh!

376
00:30:14,962 --> 00:30:17,760
- OK, watch the head.
- I've got ya.

377
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:20,231
- Watch my head.
- Sofa.

378
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,720
- Face up! Face up!
- She's right. Face up is better.

379
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:31,155
I'm gonna check the computer.
Find that page. See if there's an antidote.

380
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:33,961
It'll be all right. We'll get you fixed up.

381
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,398
- You'll be doing limbo in no time.
- Yeah, as a pole.

382
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:41,475
- No, not as a pole. I promise.
- Oh! Got it.

383
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,601
It says the paralysis is permanent.

384
00:30:46,162 --> 00:30:49,757
<i>- (Dawn squeaks)</i>
- No. Oh, wait. My bad.

385
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:52,800
"Permanent until the creature dies." Sorry.

386
00:30:52,882 --> 00:30:55,954
<i>- (Dawn mumbles)</i>
- I guess we have to go back.

387
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:59,352
We can't leave her here. What if she vomits?

388
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,797
- I won't vomit.
- Do you think she'll vomit?

389
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:05,478
- Stop talking about vomit.
- I'll call Anya. She can watch her.

390
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:08,281
Right, she'll love
being called for vomit watch.

391
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:11,434
<i>(muffled)</i> Stop talking about vomit!

392
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:15,232
Gnarl makes a pretty picture.

393
00:31:16,802 --> 00:31:19,874
It's easy when you know how.

394
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:24,560
It's easy when everyone helps.

395
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,793
They helped me.

396
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:35,550
Too bad there's no one to help you.

397
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:59,436
<i>- (Anya)</i> I bet she's dying.
- She's not dying. She's just paralysed.

398
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:02,275
- Paralysed how?
- Paralysed how?

399
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:05,957
- In the not moving way.
- Well, there's lots of different ways.

400
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:07,839
Did you try this?

401
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:10,796
- Hey!
- Hey!

402
00:32:10,882 --> 00:32:14,477
- Oh! You're poseable.
- She's poseable?

403
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:17,197
It's a common variety. Watch this.

404
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:25,793
Huh! Neat as you please.

405
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:28,521
- Hardly a need to undo her.
<i>- (worried noise)</i>

406
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:31,241
- Mm. Where'd you get the nuts?
- Brazil.

407
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:35,234
No need to thank me, by the way,
for sitting with her.

408
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:39,474
I'm feeling very benevolent today.
Helping Willow. Helping you.

409
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:42,554
Might even call it even
for that worm thing last week.

410
00:32:42,642 --> 00:32:46,396
Yeah, I don't think we could call...
Wait, you saw Willow?

411
00:32:46,482 --> 00:32:50,521
She's looking for you, by the way.
Decided you might be out in some cave.

412
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,593
- Sounded pretty tenuous.
- Cave?

413
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:56,595
Anya, listen. This is really important.
Did Willow go to that cave?

414
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:59,150
Last time I saw her,
that's where she was headed.

415
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,996
- Shall I make her salute? That'd be cute.
- She could be there right now.

416
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:06,961
- Willow could be trapped with the Gnarl.
- It's not "the Gnarl", just "Gnarl".

417
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:12,755
It'd be tragic if you were being silly with your
paralysed sister while Willow was dying.

418
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:18,073
- Anya, you know about this creature?
- Uh-huh. Sure.

419
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,278
You're coming with us.

420
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:22,881
Mmm?

421
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:34,071
<i>(muffled)</i> They wouldn't leave. They'll return.

422
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:36,835
<i>(maniacal laughter)</i>

423
00:33:36,922 --> 00:33:39,117
They don't want you.

424
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:43,234
<i># Lock you in, nice white skin

425
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:49,155
And if they do return,
where will they find you?

426
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:53,121
Inside me, you'll already be.

427
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:16,798
- Anya, you gotta keep up!
- Out of shape. Been teleporting for months.

428
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,918
Hurry!

429
00:34:19,002 --> 00:34:22,312
No, no, no...

430
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:26,473
<i>(shrieking)</i>

431
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:29,440
- What's going on? Where's Willow?
- She's right here.

432
00:34:29,522 --> 00:34:32,400
- Can't you see her? She's hurt.
- What? Where?

433
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:36,514
- There's nothing here.
- Your hand's going through her.

434
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:38,752
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

435
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:42,232
- I'm starting to get why we haven't seen her.
- Cos we haven't <i>seen</i> her.

436
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:47,077
I think whatever's causing this invisible thing
is separate from the skin-eating monster.

437
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:48,277
Behind you!

438
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:50,037
Close one.

439
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,071
Remember what I said. Get him in the eyes.

440
00:35:03,282 --> 00:35:05,432
Willow, I'm here.

441
00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:09,120
- Wow, you're really hurt.
- What's going on?

442
00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:13,912
Buffy's fighting the demon over there, see.
If they get too close, I'm gonna have to run.

443
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:18,075
- I don't see.
- But they're here. Buffy and Xander.

444
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:20,960
Someone came? They didn't leave me?

445
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:24,876
No, they didn't leave you. They can't see you.

446
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:27,681
They're here. They're here.

447
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:29,639
I'm not alone.

448
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:33,154
Good. You're doing really good.

Eew. Thumbs?
I can't believe you did that.

454
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:58,671
Oh. Buffy killed the demon. It was gross.

455
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,513
I can... I can move. Oh!

456
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:03,955
Oh!

457
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:06,033
Willow? Are you here?

458
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:08,912
Where is she? Is she alive?

459
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:12,915
She's right here. OK, stand back.
You're getting your feet in her.

460

Willow?

461
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:18,792
She's hurt really bad, you guys.
I'm gonna go get help.

462
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:24,312
I think she's sort of... here-ish.

463
00:36:25,242 --> 00:36:28,518
Willow? We can't exactly see you,

but we're really glad that you're back.

465

I don't know how badly you're hurt, but...

466
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:38,754
What's happening?

467
00:36:39,882 --> 00:36:44,672
I couldn't find you guys. I looked everywhere.
And the demon said that you left me...

468
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:48,550
Oh! There you are. There you are!

469
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,510
- Don't go away.
- We're not going away.

470
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:56,274
Oh, God.

471
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:59,672
It's gonna be OK, Will. You're gonna be OK.

472
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:02,356
I know. You're here.

473
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:14,631
Buffy.

474
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:19,239
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

475
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:22,993
That's all I had left in me anyway.

476
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:25,471
I didn't realise meditating
was such hard work.

477
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:28,994
I'm healing. Growing new skin.

478
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,516
Wow. That's magic, right?

479
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:34,833
When most people meditate,
they don't get extra skin, right?

480
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:37,595
Cos Clem should, like, cut back.

481
00:37:37,682 --> 00:37:39,400
It's magic.

482
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:42,713
I'm drawing power from the earth
to heal myself.

483
00:37:43,322 --> 00:37:45,790
We're on the second floor.

484
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:49,238
You know, Giles says
everything's part of the earth.

485
00:37:49,322 --> 00:37:52,598
This bed. The air. Us.

486
00:37:52,682 --> 00:37:56,391
Explains why my fingernails get dirty
even when I don't do anything.

487
00:37:56,482 --> 00:38:00,361
- Plus you stuck your thumbs in a demon.
- True.

488
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:10,437
- You're wiped out. I should go.
- No. Please stay.

489
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,400
I missed you so much
when I couldn't find you.

490
00:38:14,282 --> 00:38:16,432
We missed you too.

491
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:17,591
I missed you.

492
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:22,314
Dawn's working on what caused
the no-see-ums, but so far...

493
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:24,677
I did it.

494
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:28,072
- You did a spell?
- I didn't mean to. I...

495
00:38:28,162 --> 00:38:33,077
I just remember thinking
I wasn't ready to see you guys yet.

496
00:38:33,162 --> 00:38:36,996
I was afraid we wouldn't, you know, connect.

497
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,636
So you made it happen just by thinking it?

498
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:46,561
Guess I have a ways to go
before I master my powers, huh?

499
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:49,679
It's OK. As long as you're all right.

500
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:56,838
It's nice to be forgiven.
Too bad I need so much of it.

501
00:38:59,602 --> 00:39:01,593
I have a confession to make.

502
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:08,075
I thought it might be you. With the flaying.

503
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:10,118
I know.

504
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:15,040
I wanna be the kind of person
that wouldn't think that.

505
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,113
Xander never thought it.

506
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:20,990
He did a little. Heck, I did a little.

507
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:24,995
Xander has the luxury of not saying it,
but you're the Slayer.

508
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:28,836
You have to say stuff like that. It's OK.

509
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:34,474
It's OK too, if you still don't think
I can recover from this magic stuff,

510
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:39,158
because honestly,
I'm not that sure about it either.

511
00:39:49,202 --> 00:39:50,999
I thought you were too tired.

512
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:54,630
It hurts too much not to try.

513
00:39:55,762 --> 00:39:57,241
I'm sorry.

514
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:02,598
It just takes so much strength.
I don't have that much.

515
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,798
I got so much strength, I'm givin' it away.

516
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:12,200
Are you sure?

517
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:15,239
Will it help?

518
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:17,360
Much.

519
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:20,354
Good.
