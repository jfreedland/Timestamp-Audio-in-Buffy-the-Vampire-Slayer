1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:05,364
Almost time to wake up
and take your first look at the world.

2
00:00:05,453 --> 00:00:07,523
I know you're gonna make me proud.

3
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:11,332
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

4
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:13,404
Adam?

5
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:17,921
Spike, I want you to come with me.
You're going to help me with my problem.

6
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:20,481
- The Slayer's got pals.
- Take them away from her.

7
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:23,371
- This all goes down, the chip comes out.
- Scout's honour.

8
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:28,129
Riley had a career. He had a future till he
met you, and yeah, I got a problem with that.

9
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:30,567
Thank you.

10
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:36,605
Adam was at that cave so maybe he was there
for a reason. I'll go back, scope it out...

11
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:40,049
- You never train with me. He'll kick your arse.
- Giles!

12
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:43,011
Stupid? You finally had the guts
to say it to my face.

13
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:46,403
- What do you mean by "witch stuff"?
- You guys, what is happening?

14
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:48,563
Buffy, things have been wrong for a while.

15
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:52,726
I'm starting to understand why there's
no ancient prophecy about a Chosen One...

16
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:54,326
and her friends.

17
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:57,128
If I need help,
I'll go to someone I can count on.

18
00:00:57,213 --> 00:01:00,762
- I've been waiting for you.
- And now I'm here.

19

20
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,930
Riley?

21
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,205
Riley?

22
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:25,130
Your thoughts are troubled. In turmoil.

23
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:28,407
I understand, brother.
We have a lot to discuss.

24
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:34,164
- Speak.
- What have you done to me?

25
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:38,046
Nothing. It was Mother.

26
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,522
Your... Professor Walsh.

27
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:43,762
She implanted the behaviour modifier.

28
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:48,931
- A chip in my head. She really did it.
- Actually, the chip is here.

29
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:53,245
Tied directly into your central nervous
system through the thoracic nerve.

30
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,767
This is phase one of your preparation.

31
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:58,890
It lay dormant until now.
I simply activated it, brother.

32
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:01,407
Stop calling me that. I'm not your brother.

33
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:04,769
You're a botched science experiment
and I'm a human being,

34
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:07,208
- who'll do everything in his power...
- Sit.

35
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,444
You have no power.

36
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:15,164
Not yet.

37
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:18,848
Once you forget your old life
and embrace your destiny, as I have,

38
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:21,925
you will know power
you have never dreamed of.

39
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,522
I think you're going to like it.

40
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:25,291
Demons cling to old ways and ancient feuds.
And they're hopeless with technology.

41
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:28,445
- Unworthy.
- Not really wanting a lecture right now.

42
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:31,843
Disappointed by demonkind,
we turn to humans.

43
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:36,131
Smart, adaptive, but emotional and weak.

44
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:40,448
Blind. There's imperfection everywhere.

45
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:44,842
Something must be done.
Who will deliver us?

46
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:50,125
Mother. She saw our future.

47
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,410
Yours and mine.

48
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:55,082
She saw that you are necessary.

49
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,127
She saw the role
that you will play by my side.

50
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,449
Stand up.

51
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,888
You see, we are brothers after all.

52
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:08,447
It warms the cockles of my non-beating heart,
seeing you lads together.

53
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,569
I didn't send for you, Spike.

54
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:14,248
Yeah, well, I'm not much
the "being sent for" type.

55
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:19,086
I'm much more the "I did my part, now
get this chip out of my head" kinda guy.

56
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,524
Slightly stiffer than usual.

57
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:29,604
Subtle, but I like it.

58
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:33,206
- What's with him?
- I activated his chip.

59
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:38,083
Oh. So it's chips all around, is it?
Someone must've bought the party pack.

60
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,691
You get yours removed
when the Slayer is where I want her.

61
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:45,482
She's separated from her friends.
They want nothing to do with her.

62
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,244
She's all alone.

63
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:53,244
That's how I want her.
Where I want her is down in the Initiative.

64
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:57,051
She will ensure
that as many demons die as humans.

65
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:00,250
She will achieve maximum carnage
before she's too weak to go on.

66
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,483
- No. You can't...
- Stop talking.

67
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:11,122
Right. The Initiative. But getting her there -
that's what the disks are for, innit?

68
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:14,728
The witch gives her the info and
Alice heads back down the rabbit hole.

69
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:18,852
- The witch?
- Willow. About so high, perky,

70
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,924
good with maths. A natural choice.

71
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:22,924
- Her friend.
- Right.

72
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:25,811
One of those from whom
you so efficiently separated her.

73
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:30,489
Damn right I did. They won't be talking
to each other for a long, long...

74
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:37,608
Hang on. I think
I might've detected a small flaw.

75
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,843
So you failed.

76
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:43,926
Well, hey, you're supposed to be so smart.
You let me plan this thing.

77
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:50,885
Let's not quibble. The important thing is
making sure the Slayer is where we want...

78
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:52,645
- Go.
- Gone.

79
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,606
So we'll do this chip thing when I get back.

80
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:12,567
- Hey.
- Hello.

81
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:19,365
Oh. Pardon the robe.
It's a bit of a late start.

82
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,283
Right.

83
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:27,447
- I hope you're feeling all right, Mr Giles.
- Oh, quite well, thank you.

84
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,403
Yes, I'll probably have a briskjog later on.

85
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:37,682
- Did you want something?
- I forgot my laptop and the disks.

86
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,964
Yes. Please, please, come in.

87
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:46,241
Will you be working here?
You know, typing, talking?

88
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,844
Because that will be fine.

89
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,924
No. That's OK.

90
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,330
Got 'em.

91
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:04,881
So... see ya.

92
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,885
Right. Yes, well, good luck with that.

93
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:11,523
OK.

94
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:14,684
- Bye.
- Bye.

95
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:08,404
Xander?

96
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:13,841
You wanted to check the board
at the unemployment office this morning.

97
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,207
You can't go like that. They won't
even interview you if you're naked.

98
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:26,603
I'm not goin'. There's never anything good.

99
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:32,525
- Maybe I shouldjoin the army.
- Don't they make you get up really early?

100
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,605
Oh, yeah. Never mind.

101
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:41,412
Are you still upset about that fight you had
with your friends? It was hours ago!

102
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:43,484
- Get over it.
- Anya, you...

103
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:46,282
Forget it.

104
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:51,083
So they all think you're a lost, directionless
loser with no plans for his future. Pfft!

105
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:54,290
- Anya, you can't pfft that stuff away.
- Why not?

106
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:57,684
I don't know.

107
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,524
Cos I think maybe they're right.

108
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:15,525
So what if they are? You're a good person
and a good boyfriend and...

109
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,762
and I'm in love with you.

110
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:24,525
Whatever they think of you,
it shouldn't matter.

111
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,052
Yeah.

112
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:31,651
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

113
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,285
Adam.

114
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,566
Where are you?

115
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:27,047
This is where it will all happen.

116
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,844
Where the new race begins.

117
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:34,925
- Where are we?
- In the Initiative.

118
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:40,451
There are areas no one knew about
beyond those that needed to.

119
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:44,564
Mother kept her secrets well.

120
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,764
Didn't you?

121
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:53,486
- Professor Walsh?
- This is all how she planned it,

122
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:55,962
except she thought she would be alive.

123
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,929
Are you...

124
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:14,683
- Is that what you're gonna do to me?
- They're just workers.

125
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:17,922
You know your destiny is much greater.

126
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:25,204
Forrest.

127
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:28,123
Oh, God.

128
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,884
God has nothing to do with it.

129
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:47,926
Easy, sheriff.
Watch where you point that thing.

130
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,208
What are you doing here?

131
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,968
Looking for a little weekend
getaway place. Shove off.

132
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,044
Adam's been using these caves.

133
00:11:57,053 --> 00:12:00,090
- What?
- I found his lair.

134
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:04,724
Oh, cripes. That's all I need -
running into that goon.

135
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:09,250
Adam's cleared out of here.
Something is about to go down.

136
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,927
Look at little Nancy Drew.

137
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:15,922
What about those disks I nabbed?
They ought to tell you something.

138
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:20,363
- Willow has the disks.
- Well, I'd get on that.

139
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:25,046
Can't ignore valuable information
just cos you two birds fell out, can you?

140
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,005
- Right.
- Well, you do what you want.

141
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:32,684
No worry of mine now, is it?

142
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:41,931
- Maybe you should rest. Clear your head?
- Can't. Not now. I think I'm on to something.

143
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:46,768
I've been assuming that the cipher text
was encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm.

144
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:51,244
- Then it hit me. A hexagonic key pattern.
- Hey, look, you did it!

145
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:58,609
I didn't. I haven't even finished
typing in the new code.

146
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:01,124
Something's doing it.

147
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:05,650
Must be programmed to self-decrypt
at a certain point. That is so annoying!

148
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:09,521
It's like somebody blurting out
the answer to a riddle just when you've...

149
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:12,491
I mean, yippee! We have the information.

150
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:15,929
I don't know if "yippee" is
the right response either. Read that.

151
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,486
Hello?

152
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:23,370
Yeah, she's right...

153
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:26,047
I mean, let me check.

154
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,924
It's Buffy.

155
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:32,644
Professor Walsh.

156
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:35,844
Professor Walsh, it's Riley Finn.

157
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,483
- Can you hear me?
- She's dead.

158
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:43,728
Artificially reanimated
with basic to moderate brain activity.

159
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:47,648
Mommy can hear you,
but she's still a walking corpse.

160
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:53,045
- So are you.
- Mm-mm. Got that wrong.

161
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:56,765
I'm surging with life, and strength.

162
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,848
Adam made me to be nearly as bad as he is.

163
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,409
Really lookin' forward
to tryin' out your girl again.

164
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:08,842
- I'm sorry, Forrest.
- Don't be.

165
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:11,887
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

166
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:15,966
I'm free of all my weaknesses,
and my doubts.

167
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:20,841
He's gonna fix you up, too.
Soon as we got some choice parts.

168
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:24,892
Then you and me will be back on the
same side, moving toward a new future.

169
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:28,363
- I'll never let that happen.
- You don't have a choice, brother.

170
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:34,485
- Your will belongs to us now.
- No. That's not true.

171
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,006
Then why don't you
get out of that chair and walk out?

172
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:45,689
- You can't control my...
- Riley, be a good boy.

173
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:13,203
Where's Anya?

174
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:17,684
Oddly, Anya decided not to join us,
despite all the fun we had at our last meeting.

175
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:20,082
And I don't think Tara felt welcome.

176
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,368
Why? Because of the things that we said?

177
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:27,125
Who told you we were talking
behind your back, specifically?

178
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:31,172
Well, I... Spike, specifically, but...

179
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:34,131
And who told you
we thought you should join the army?

180
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:37,967
That's not exactly what he said.

181
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:42,845
Well, Spike can be very convincing when...

182
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:47,162
- I'm very stupid.
- He played us.

183
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:49,369
He wanted us to fight to split us up.

184
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,530
That's where it came from -
the stuff we said the other night.

185
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:58,844
Of course. Well, piffle. Let's move on.

186
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,889
- I'm movin'.
- Me, too.

187
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,569
Good.

188
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:05,810
Great.

189
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:15,325
So, why do you think
Spike made with the head games?

190
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:18,962
He's all dressed up with no one to bite.
Gotta get his ya-yas somehow.

191
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:22,284
I think it was more than that.
I think it was Adam.

192
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,370
Spike's working for Adam?
After all we've done for...

193
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,444
Nah. I can't even act surprised.

194
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:32,971
I just went to Adam's lair and he was gone.
But Spike just happened to be there.

195
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:36,090
He made a big noise about
getting information off the disks.

196
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,482
Oh. I decrypted 'em.

197
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:42,566
Well, they decrypted themselves,
but I almost had it.

198
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:46,487
- What did they say?
- A bunch of stuff we already knew about 314.

199
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,007
But it also said there's some final phase

200
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:54,372
where Adam manufactures a bunch
of creepy cyberdemonoids like him.

201
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:57,923
There's a special lab in the Initiative,
but it didn't say where.

202
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:00,447
Adam fed Spike those disks. It has to be.

203
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,528
He wanted me to know
about his evil-guy assembly line.

204
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:08,606
- This lab, it's in the Initiative?
- Hidden somewhere.

205
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:13,731
I'll give the demon his due.
He thought this one out.

206
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:16,965
What do you mean?

207
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:20,523
Think how overcrowded the
containment cells are in the Initiative.

208
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:24,526
Those demons were just too easy to catch.
It's like they wanted in that place.

209
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:26,205
The Trojan Horse.

210
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:29,842
Adam's making sure the demons
attack the Initiative from the inside.

211
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:32,891
Demons versus soldiers.
Massacre, massacre.

212
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:37,171
And Adam has a neat pile of body parts
to start assembling his army.

213
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:40,206
Diabolical, yet... gross.

214
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:45,048
Does anybody else miss the mayor -
"I just wanna be a big snake"?

215
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:48,364
I've gotta shut him down.
His final phase is about to start.

216
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:51,843
- We need to warn the Initiative.
- They're not gonna listen to me.

217
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,686
- Riley?
- He's a deserter.

218
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,368
He got some bad news anyway
and kinda took off.

219
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:03,365
OK, I'm confused again.

220
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:07,287
Adam has this evil plan. Why is he
so anxious for you to know about it?

221
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:10,809
He wants me there.
Probably figures I'll even the kill ratio.

222
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:14,442
He's not worried you might kill,
oh say... him?

223
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,328
No. He's really not.

224
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,925
She's coming. I can feel it.

225
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:26,527
Good on you. Got a chunk
of prognosticating demon in there, eh?

226
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:34,164
Now, if you'll just get this chip
out of my cranium, I'll be out of your way.

227
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:39,725
Mind the hairline. I don't fancy fussing with
a comb-over once I resume my killing ways.

228
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:45,090
- Come on. We had a deal.
- When she's here.

229
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:53,364
There's certainly no lack of supplies. I only
wish I knew which ones would kill Adam.

230
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:57,287
Riley said his power source
is a uranium core embedded inside his chest.

231
00:18:57,373 --> 00:18:58,965
Probably near the spine.

232
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:03,205
Great. So we just ask him to lie down quietly
while we do some exploratory surgery.

233
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:09,084
What about magic? Some kinda...
I don't know... uranium-extracting spell?

234
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:15,523
- I know. I'm reaching.
- Perhaps a paralysing spell.

235
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:19,444
- Only I can't perform the incantation of this.
- Right.

236
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,684
Don't you have to speak it
in Sumerian or something?

237
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:25,685
I do speak Sumerian. But it's not that.

238
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:31,086
Only an experienced witch can incant it
within striking distance of the subject.

239
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:33,846
See what you get for taking French
and not Sumerian?

240
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:37,323
- What was I thinking?
- So no problem. All we need is Combo Buffy.

241
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:42,282
Her with slayer strength, Giles's multilingual
know-how and Willow's witchy power.

242
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:46,763
Yeah. Don't tell me.
I'm just full of helpful suggestions.

243
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,003
As a matter of fact, you are.

244
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,527
- Nervous?
- No way.

245
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:06,931
I'm full of that good old kamikaze spirit.

246
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,571
Just because this will never work,
don't be negative.

247
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:13,565
The spell isn't powerful enough
to defeat Adam?

248
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:17,248
It's very powerful.
It's also extraordinarily dangerous.

249
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:20,248
Game faces, guys. We're going in.

250
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,844
- How you doin'?
- Super.

251
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,921
What was I thinking,
using stairs all this time?

252
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:34,605
OK.

253
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:41,443
- Will...
- No, really. It's not as scary as I thought.

254
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,569
No. That's not what I was gonna say.

255
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:47,885
I just...

256
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:50,684
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:54,527
I hate that things have been
so strained between all of us.

258
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:57,525
It's not your fault. Spike stirred up trouble.

259
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:01,486
Yeah, but I think trouble was stir-upable.

260
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:05,122
I think we've all sort of
drifted apart this year, don't you?

261
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:07,365
Maybe a little.

262
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:12,686
But, you know, first year of college, it's hard
to keep the old high-school gang together.

263
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:15,930
But I want it together. Will, I miss you.

264
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:21,368
And Giles and Xander. And it is my fault.

265
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:24,763
I've been so wrapped up in my own stuff,
I've been a bad friend.

266
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:28,013
You're the Slayer.
Your stuff is pretty crucial.

267
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:30,084
I mean Riley, and...

268
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:33,044
Riley, mostly.

269
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:37,241
Well, I haven't been Miss Available either.

270
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:43,484
I kept secrets. I hid things from everyone.

271
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:47,486
That's not your fault. Will,
you were going through something huge.

272
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,931
I wanted to tell you, but I was so scared.

273
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:56,128
You can tell me anything. I love you.

274
00:21:57,053 --> 00:22:00,284
- You're my best friend.
- Me, too.

275
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:02,764
- I love you, too.
- Oh!

276
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:05,011
Falling now.

277
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:12,846
- Let's promise to never not talk again.
- I promise, I promise.

278
00:22:14,853 --> 00:22:17,606
- Xander.
- Oh, wonderful Xander!

279
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:20,969
- You know we love you, right?
- We totally do.

280
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:25,092
- Oh, God. We're gonna die, aren't we?
- No. We just missed you.

281
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:31,492
Giles, hurry up!
You definitely wanna get down here for this!

282
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:39,932
OK. We stick together and everything
should be fine. Everybody ready? Let's...

283
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:44,606
do this.

284
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:52,447
It's Must See TV.

285
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,447
Bait's been taken. Trap's all set.

286
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:58,524
The Slayer has landed.

287
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:00,692
So.

288
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:03,727
One chiperectomy, please.

289
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:09,331
- Hello? Paging Dr Owe-me-one.
- She's not alone.

290
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:17,364
You've failed me again.

291
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:21,446
- Well, that's one way of looking at it.
- What's the other way?

292
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:27,523
Oh, come on!

293
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:31,686
It's not like I wasn't trying.
That's worth something, isn't it?

294
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:34,446
I suppose. Yes.

295
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:37,206
I will honour our agreement
and remove your chip.

296
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,284
Take his head off.

297
00:23:50,693 --> 00:23:52,684
Let him go.

298
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:57,613
There's nowhere left to run.

299
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:02,204
- Colonel.
- Shut up.

300
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,447
- You got some nerve, lady.
- You have to listen.

301
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:09,446
You think you and your friends
can waltz into a government installation

302
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,330
brandishing weapons like...

303
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,203
- like...
- It's a gourd.

304
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:19,564
It's a magic gourd.

305
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,808
What kind of freaks are you people?

306
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:28,804
- Adam is here, Colonel. In the Initiative.
- Nice try.

307
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:33,171
Those overcrowded cells? Courtesy of Adam.
He's pulling a Trojan Horse on you.

308
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:37,849
Every inch of this installation
is under constant 24-hour surveillance.

309
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:41,926
- Including the secret lab?
- Including everything.

310
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:49,125
- What secret lab?
- The one Adam's been using.

311
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:53,001
The one built for the final stage
of the 314 project.

312
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:58,684
- You have no idea what I'm talking about.
- I know everything that goes on around here.

313
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:01,367
A tick on a mouse
couldn't get in without my knowing.

314
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:04,763
- If Adam wants to try, we're ready for him.
- Oh, jolly good.

315
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:10,052
How exactly do you plan to get close enough
to Adam to remove his power source?

316
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:15,850
Hit him simultaneously
with multiple Taser blasters.

317
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:19,130
Incapacitate him
with as much voltage as we can muster.

318
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:22,364
Great plan. That's right up there
with "duck and cover".

319
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:24,603
I've seen Adam hit with Taser blasts.

320
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:28,003
He feeds on it. And you're giving him
an all-you-can-eat buffet?

321
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:32,484
- You telling me my business?
- This is not your business. It's mine.

322
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:37,370
You, the Initiative, the boys at the Pentagon -
you're all in way over your heads.

323
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,604
Messing with primeval forces
you have no comprehension of.

324
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:42,684
- And you do?
- I'm the Slayer.

325
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,728
You're playing on my turf.

326
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:51,405
Up there, maybe. But down here,
I'm the one who's in control.

327
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:57,569
Sir, the power grid's down.
Backup's not responding.

328
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:00,532
We're locked in.

329
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:21,323
This will be interesting.

330
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:26,523
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

331
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,252
Go!

332
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:41,082
Containment area has been breached.
Hostiles are loose.

333
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:43,164
How many?

334
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:46,647
- All of them, sir.
- It's Adam.

335
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:52,566
I'm the only one that can stop him. Let me
handle this. Get your people out of here.

336
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,213
You men follow me.
We gotta take the armoury now.

337
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:56,282
- Sir.
- Colonel.

338
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:59,922
- These people are under arrest. Understand?
- Yes, sir.

339
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:13,844
- We've gotta find Adam.
- On it.

340
00:27:16,293 --> 00:27:21,083
The enjoining spell is extremely volatile.
We can't risk it being interrupted.

341
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,926
We need a place that's close to you and quiet.

342
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:25,890
Uh... quiet?

343
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,606
- How are we doing, Will?
- Done.

344
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:12,285
Hold on.

345
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:17,447
According to this, there's air ducts
and electrical conduits all running into there.

346
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:22,846
- So?
- So there's no "there" there. Look.

347
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:29,208
- It's Adam.
- Are you sure?

348
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,568
Right behind 314.

349
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:35,612
- Can you unlock it?
- I don't have to.

350
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:40,448
All the locks in the Initiative
have been disengaged, except for the exits.

351
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,442
Demon open house.

352
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:48,445
Great. So we know we're going to 314.
Now all we have to do is get there.

353
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:42,932
Willow, down!

354
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:47,805
Come on!

355
00:29:58,853 --> 00:30:00,844
OK, it should be over here.

356
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:14,047
Once I'm in, barricade the door behind me.

357
00:30:15,053 --> 00:30:18,523
- Is this place OK to be Magic Central?
- It should do.

358
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:22,409
- As long as we don't get blowed up.
- What are the odds of that?

359
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:26,928
- How long before the ritual kicks in?
- Five minutes, give or take.

360
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:32,526
- I'll move fast, then.
- Buffy, I still don't like you going in alone.

361
00:30:34,693 --> 00:30:36,888
I won't be.

362
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,324
Riley.

363
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:02,283
Are you hurt?

364
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,644
Say something.

365
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:15,204
What is this?

366
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:20,927
- Why won't you talk to me?
- He can't. He's not programmed to.

367
00:31:21,653 --> 00:31:25,612
He's part of the final phase now.
As you were supposed to be.

368
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:28,571
Sorry. I don'tjump through hoops
on command.

369
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:31,003
I've never really been one to toe the line.

370
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:35,285
Oh.

371
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,444
Kill her.

372
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:39,524
I thought you'd never ask.

373
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:02,966
The power of the Slayer
and all who wield it.

374
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:06,045
Last to ancient first, we invoke thee.

375
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:10,968
Grant us thy domain and primal strength.
Accept us and the powers we possess.

376
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:16,173
Make us, mind and heart and spirit, join.
Let the hand encompass us. Do thy will.

377
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:28,924
Buffy!

378
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:34,050
Shut up. Watch me kill your girlfriend, Finn.
That's an order.

379
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:06,284
Spiritus: spirit.

380
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:11,523
Animus: heart.

381
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:15,204
Sophus: mind.

382
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:20,012
And manus: the hand.

383
00:33:35,453 --> 00:33:39,207
We enjoin that we may inhabit
the vessel, the hand,

384
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:42,046
daughter of Sineya, first of the Ones.

385
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:01,929
Is that it? Is that all you got?

386
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,803
No. She's got me.

387
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,769
Look who's come off the bench.

388
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:15,648
I need to get to Adam - now. Are you able?

389
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:17,325
Go.

390
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:44,682
Fall back! Fall back!

391
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:48,649
Protect the flank! Close down that pit!

392
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:55,044
Fun, isn't it?

393
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,927
I do appreciate violence.

394
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:01,245
Good.

395
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:21,802
- Broke your arm.
- Got another.

396
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:30,244
I've been upgrading.

397
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:46,571
We implore thee, admit us.

398
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:49,486
Bring us to the vessel. Take us now.

399
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:09,925
- You can't last much longer.
- We can.

400
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,444
We are for ever.

401
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:24,925
Interesting.

402
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:31,045
Very interesting.

403
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:43,122
What are you making me do this for?

404
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:46,204
Not that I'm not enjoying myself.

405
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:52,323
But Adam's not gonna like it if I...

406
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:47,927
How can you...

407
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:50,846
You can never hope to grasp
the source of our power.

408
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:11,724
But yours is right here.

409
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:23,365
Buffy.

410
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,524
Wow. That was...

411
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:07,763
Nasty sort of fellow.

412
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:11,971
- Lucky for you blighters I was here, eh?
- Yes. Thank you.

413
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:18,891
But your heroism is slightly muted by your
helping Adam start a war that would kill us.

414
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:24,762
You probably just saved us
so we wouldn't stake you right here.

415
00:39:24,853 --> 00:39:27,925
Well, yeah. Did it work?

416
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:40,289
Then everything's all right. We all get to be
not staked through the heart. Good work!

417
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:45,924
- Buffy!
- Wasn't it amazing?

418
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:47,890
- You were great.
- We were great.

419
00:39:47,973 --> 00:39:51,124
- We still got men out there.
- Well, let's go save 'em, by gum.

420
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:56,967
You guys open the exits. You, organise
the soldiers, pull 'em back. I'll take point.

421
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:00,683
- Are you up to this?
- I am.

422
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:05,564
It was an experiment. The Initiative
represented the government's interests

423
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,804
in not only controlling
the otherworldly menace,

424
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:12,852
but in harnessing its power
for our own military purposes.

425
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:19,249
The considered opinion of this council
is that the experiment has failed.

426
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:24,652
Once the prototype
took control of the complex,

427
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:28,123
our soldiers suff.ered
a 40 per cent casualty rate.

428
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:34,007
It was only through the actions of a deserter
and a group of civilian insurrectionists

429
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:37,085
that our losses were not total.

430
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:41,365
I trust the irony of that
is not lost on any of us.

431
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:46,923
Maggie Walsh's vision was brilliant,
but ultimately insupportable.

432
00:40:48,653 --> 00:40:50,644
The demons cannot be harnessed.

433
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:53,444
Cannot be controlled.

434
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:57,205
We therefore recommend
that this project be terminated

435
00:40:57,293 --> 00:40:59,887
and all records concerning it expunged.

436
00:41:00,693 --> 00:41:04,686
Our soldiers'll be debriefed.
Standard confidentiality clause.

437
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:07,524
We will monitor the civilians

438
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:11,652
and the usual measures prepared,
should they try to go public.

439
00:41:12,293 --> 00:41:14,284
I don't think they will.

440
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:18,650
The Initiative itself
will be filled in with concrete.

441
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,843
Burn it down, gentlemen.

442
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:24,925
Burn it down and salt the earth.

443
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:36,849
