Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:07,966
- Get away from me.
- Wanna point that somewhere else?

3
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:11,602
You all think I'm an idiot. A short idiot.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:16,046
Faith switched. I mean, she had
some device. She switched our bodies.

5
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:19,603
- Hi, baby. You miss me?
- I did, actually.

6
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:22,285
I love you.

7
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:29,362
You slept with her.

8
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:32,447
I was created to kill.

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,808
To extinguish life wherever I find it.

10
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:36,690
Tell us what to do.

12
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:48,566
Xander! Anya!

13
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:50,684
Buffy, another one!

14
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,085
Buffy!

15
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:03,528
- Where's the other one?
- Scampered like a bunny.

16
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:05,604
In there.

17
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:24,252
I don't care if it is an orgy of death.
There's still such a thing as a napkin.

18
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,848
A nest. No biggie. I bet I could do it.
I know I could take at least two.

19
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:32,051
Yes, and we could run for help while the
others suck your heart out through your neck.

20
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,603
You're right. It's too many forjust us.
You know who we need?

21
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,122
Hi.

22
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:47,208
We have a problem.

23
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:51,922
Sounds like you could use my help.

24
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:54,169
A quick draw's about more than speed.

25
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:56,847
It's also about pointing a stake the right way.

26
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:59,049
And there can be splinter issues.

27
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,203
It is a true test of dexterity.

28
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:04,888
- Can you open this?
- No, I tear it and it gets all sloshy.

29
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:10,011
Thanks for doing this, Jonathan.
I wouldn't ask, but...

30
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:15,087
Hey, don't worry about it. Nest full
of vampires, you come get me. OK.

31
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:18,165
Box full of puppies?
That's more of ajudgment call.

32
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,086
Hit me!

33
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:23,771
You got me. It was very punchy.

34
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:27,163
Watch out for southpaws, Buff.
Don't let 'em surprise you.

35
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:32,850
Can't find a reference to any rituals.
Seems more like a family meal, if you will.

36
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,925
And they say no one needs
to have the TV on any more.

37
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:40,484
Thanks, Rupert. It's good to know we're not
walkin' into some unholy feast or other.

38
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:42,643
Oh, Jonathan. I'm in.

39
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:45,764
Schematics for the crypt.

40
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:50,210
Part of the original plan for
the cemetery. Sometimes there's a...

41
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:53,763
Oh, no back way in. Just the one entrance.

42
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:57,687
Well, maybe we could make it work for us.
We could stake out the entrance.

43
00:03:57,773 --> 00:04:01,243
- Maybe use a decoy. Lure 'em out.
- Or I bet...

44
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:07,892
- There! I can get in that way.
- Oh, of course! Why didn't I think of that?

45
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:10,612
I'm sure you would have.

46
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:13,605
I think we have a plan.

47
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:17,208
Buffy, you go in first.
Let 'em get a look at a slayer.

48
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,925
Xander and...

49
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:21,846
The Nimzowitsch Defence.
Let's see if I remember.

50
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:28,922
Mate in four. You almost got me
that time, Rupert.

51
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:31,766
Xander, Willow and Anya, you back up Buffy.

52
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:34,204
I'll be the surprise guest.

53
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:38,605
Everyone, let's show these fiends
that they came to the wrong town.

54
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,813
Buffy, he's getting away!

55
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:10,126
- I should've gotten that one.
- You got two of them.

56
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:12,249
And that second one was ready for ya.

57
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,528
- You should feel good.
- But I let one get by.

58
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:18,083
Don't worry. You know it only
matters that you do your best.

59
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:23,803
But that's just it. I don't think it was my best.

60
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:27,124
Hey, Jonathan, over here!
A quick photo, please!

61
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:30,330
- A couple more, a couple more.
- OK, guys, that's enough.

62
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,132
I think we did great. We knocked 'em dead.

63
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:35,204
Which they already were.

64
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,806
We knocked 'em deader.

65
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:40,772
If they'd all rushed at Buffy,
they could've killed her right away.

66
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:43,208
Thanks. That won't keep me awake.

67
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,807
Vampires only form nests
to make hunting easier.

68
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,884
They're not big on the cooperation.

69
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,602
They mostly like to hang out
all creepy and alone in the shadows.

70
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,490
Don't you agree, Spike?

71
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:00,204
Well, well!

72
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,724
The man himself.

73
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:08,364
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

74
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:13,322
I wasn't pining for a visit from Wonder
Jonathan and his Fluffy Battle Kittens.

75
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,202
Yeah? You think that one up with
all the time you're not able to bite people?

76
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,363
Careful. He's still pretty dangerous.

77
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:22,889
- Yeah, back off, Betty.
- It's Buffy,

78
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:25,043
you big bleached...

79
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,889
stupid guy.

80
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:32,524
Spike, you're the worst type of scum.

81
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:35,446
The second you're back
to your old tricks,

82
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:40,243
let's say, before you even sniff out a victim,
you'll be pretty indistinguishable from...

83
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,372
Oh, what should we say?
Instant soup mix.

84
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:51,652
Next thing I know, this crazed vamp
is, like, running right at me,

85
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:56,488
and I know that if he gets past me
there's no telling who's in danger next.

86
00:06:56,573 --> 00:07:00,122
Come on, you have fun. Admit it.
Living the Scooby life.

87
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:03,762
I was goin' for a kind of
stoic bravery, but yeah.

88
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:07,687
And it was exciting, with the
ceiling coming in and everything.

89
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:09,963
Oh, that's a cute one.

90
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:14,851
- And Buffy, she was OK?
- Oh, she was great! Twang! Poof!

91
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:20,485
That was the sound:
crossbow, vampire dusting...

92
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:23,373
She was a little cranky
that she missed that one vamp.

93
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:25,364
I kind of meant personally.

94
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:30,402
That whole thing with Faith. That freaked me
out and I was just sensing it from a distance.

95
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:34,611
Oh, yeah. I know she's not over
the whole Riley-sleeping-with-Faith thing.

96
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:39,642
You know, Faith's insides and Buffy's
outsides, when her insides were out.

97
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:44,173
I hope they'll be OK.

98
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:48,212
I'm sure it'll blow over. They're probably
all with the smoochies right now.

99
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,012
- You must be feeling better.
- Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:59,802
I'm a lot stronger. I mean,
I'm no Jonathan, but... I'm doing OK.

101
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:02,453
Are you? I mean, you're not...?

102
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:05,249
What?

103
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,325
Eating the Initiative's
technicolour food of strongness?

104
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:14,084
No. They swear they've stopped treating
the food, but I'm not takin' the chance.

105
00:08:14,613 --> 00:08:21,246
You know, l, uh, I don't know if that means
I'll get weaker or dumber... or smarter.

106
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:23,848
They're not big with the disclosure, huh?

107
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:29,053
They still haven't released a profile on Adam.
And we're having zero luck trackin' him.

108
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:34,283
If they'd just put a little trust in me,
I know I could get the job done.

109
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,523
I've felt that way my entire life.

110
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:56,521
You'd think I could do that.

111
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:59,366
Guess it takes different muscles
than demon beheading.

112
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,648
You just need a few pointers.

113
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,450
Now, if slaying was a competitive sport,
I'd have a chance.

114
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:13,367
You know, we could have
figure staking and speed staking. I...

115
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,691
Sorry.

116
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:19,446
This just isn't my game. I gotta...

117
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:29,126
It's all Faith's fault. She's like poison.

118
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,929
No, worse, she's like acid
that eats through everything.

119
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,167
Maybe she's a bomb.

120
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:40,610
The point is, everything was going
along great with Riley, and then...

121
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,082
she comes along and messes everything up.

122
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:45,764
Buffy, you know what I think?

123
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,731
I don't think this is about
you being angry with Faith.

124
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:51,452
I think you're angry with Riley.

125
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,285
- Riley?
- Could you, please?

126
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:58,448
Sure. I mean, you have this
amazing connection with him,

127
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:04,091
and then at the one moment when it matters
the most, he looks into your eyes,

128
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:07,609
and he doesn't even see
that it's not you looking back at him.

129
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:16,004
There's no way he could know. I mean,
you don'tjust look at someone and say:

130
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:19,244
"That's not your body!
Get out of that body with your hands up!"

131
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,370
I know you know that.
But you have to believe it.

132
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:26,892
Buffy, if there's any part of you that's
blaming Riley for what happened,

133
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:30,409
it seems like there's a part of you
that needs to forgive him.

134
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:33,572
You're Jonathan Levinson!
Oh, my God!

135
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:39,331
Oh, my God! My name is Karen and I think
you're... you're wonderful! Oh, my God!

136
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:43,042
Hi, Karen. Thank you.
Oh, is that my book? Well, I could...

137
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:46,443
Yeah, please. I didn't wanna bother you.
It's Karen with a K.

138
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,443
Thank you! So much! Thanks!

139
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:03,049
So what do you think, Buffy?
I mean, if I'm wrong, smack me.

140
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:06,125
Karen with a K will lend you a book,
and it's pretty heavy.

141
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,244
Maybe I have been blaming him.

142
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:14,244
But how do I get past it?

143
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:18,403
What if it's too late? What if after all this
he doesn't want me any more?

144
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:23,487
He does. It's not gonna be easy, Buffy,
but you guys are very special together.

145
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,488
That's worth a little hard work.

146
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:32,132
But... I'm not even sure if I know
how to talk to him any more.

147
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,124
How do I make it OK again?

148
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:39,206
If you really want it,
you can make anything happen.

149
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:44,527
For those of you who don't already know,
my name is Colonel George Haviland.

150
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:50,083
I'm commanding officer here until such time
as the facility review is completed.

151
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:55,247
This review does not mean our
primary mission is changed in any way.

152
00:11:55,333 --> 00:12:00,168
Recovery of the hostile known as Adam
is our first and most importantjob.

153
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:06,771
To this end, I've asked our tactical
consultant here to address us today.

154
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,124
Mr Levinson.

155
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:16,371
- Thank you, Colonel.
- It's about time we brought out the big guns.

156
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:23,571
Men, before we can locate Adam,
we need to understand him better.

157
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,804
And there's somethin' that's
bothered me almost from the start.

158
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,124
He doesn't eat.

159
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:33,049
We've known him to kill,
but never to eat the kill.

160
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:36,603
So I pulled some of Professor Walsh's
original design schematics,

161
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:41,130
and I found something.
His power source is not biological at all.

162
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:43,368
It's here.

163
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:49,403
The design attempts to hide it, but I believe
that there's a small reservoir of uranium 235.

164
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,688
Sir, how long will it last?

165
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:56,962
Essentially forever. It also means
that cutting off his head is useless.

166
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:01,446
Killing Adam means
annihilating him completely.

167
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,764
But first we have to find him.

168
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:07,129
Where are you, Jonathan?

169
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:10,084
Are you, like, never home?

170
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:35,247
- I feel terrible.
- She's ready to forget it.

171
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,211
- You'd better be ready too.
- I don't know, Jonathan.

172
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:41,683
I mean, I don't know if
she'll really ever forget it.

173
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,969
- Every time I try to touch her...
- She's scared.

174
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:49,363
- Scared of me?
- Scared of what you're thinking about.

175
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:54,083
- What do you mean?
- She knows that Faith is... experienced.

176
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:57,848
What are you saying? Experienced?

177
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:02,204
God! Does she think that...
that I'd be comparing?

178
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:06,846
She knows she's the one I... I care about.

179
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:10,045
- Have you let her know that?
- I think I...

180
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,647
Haven't I? She has to know.

181
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:16,965
People can't always see
what's right in front of them.

182
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:27,205
 I loves the big witch doctor,
who stirred a brew for me

183
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:31,844
 I took sips from your sweet lips
and now I can't get free

184
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,083
 Trapped in a web of love

185
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:36,568
 Trapped in a web of love

186
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:39,850
- Did not.
- Last night. With me.

187
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,970
- You said "Jonathan".
- It was a moan!

188
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:46,170
Fine! You moaned"Jonathan".

189
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,608
It was like, "Ahh-n".

190
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,131
Maybe it was "Ahh-nathan".
Still not fluffin' up the old ego.

191
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:55,891
Quite the couple, aren't they?

192
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:58,407
They get into a fist fight,
I got a 50 on Anya.

193
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:01,362
I wonder if they'll make it.

194
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:19,411
Good evening, everyone. I'd like to
dedicate this song to some friends of mine.

195
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:23,725
A very special couple who've been
going through a tough time.

196
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:30,364
 When I hear that serenade in blue

197
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:34,241
 I'm somewhere in another world

198
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,245
 Alone with you

199
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:42,532
 Sharing all the joys we used to know

200
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:49,007
 Many moons ago

201
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:54,963
 Once again your face comes back to me

202
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:58,568
 Just like the theme of some forgotten

203
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:01,842
 Melody

204
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:07,087
 In the album of my memory

205
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:10,051
 Serenade

206
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:13,609
 In blue

207
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:16,526
 It seems like only yesterday

208
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:19,605
 A small café, a crowded floor

209
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:22,605
 And as we danced the night away

210
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:25,571
 I hear you say forevermore

211
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:28,645
 And then the song became a sigh

212
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:32,362
 Forevermore became goodbye

213
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:37,686
 But you remain in my heart

214
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:42,244
 Tell me, darling, is there still a spark?

215
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,565
- Buffy, I want you to know.
- Do we have to have the talk?

216
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:49,406
No talk. More dance.

217
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:53,247
I just wanna say I'm sorry.
That it's only you that I want.

218
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,324
I know.

219
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:58,613
- I know all of that.
- You do?

220
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,928
Since when?

221
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:07,448
Since you put your arms around me.

222
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:22,446
Oh, my God! He's gonna do
something off the new album.

223
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:32,932
Xander.

224
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,049
Let's go and have sex now.

225
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:38,522
Yeah. OK.

226
00:17:58,573 --> 00:17:59,972
What is it? Are you OK?

227
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:08,005
Karen! That's your name, isn't it?
I signed my book for you.

228
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:12,809
Tell me what hurt you, Karen. I can help.

229
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,363
Let's get you warmed up.

230
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,364
What's going on? Why are you here?

231
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:23,241
Mr Levinson, someone on your staff
reported a disturbance.

232
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,609
When I realised it was on your property
I thought I'd come in person.

233
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:31,608
- That's all right. I have it under control.
- Of course, sir. Glad to see you're all right.

234
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:35,925
Karen, I know you're scared,

235
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,811
but I need to hear your description again.

236
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:42,124
It was ugly. Big ugly.

237
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:47,571
All bent over, sort of, with these
huge arms and, like, scabs and stuff.

238
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:50,167
That must have been
very frightening. I'm so sorry.

239
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:53,086
- Oh, I forgot. It had a mark.
- A mark?

240
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,243
On its forehead, like... a symbol.

241
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,411
Oh. This is a clue.

242
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:11,888
- Jonathan?
- I've heard of this.

243
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:15,170
It's not a demon, just a monster.
Not much more than an animal.

244
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:19,087
It sticks to the woods.
It doesn't come near populated areas.

245
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:22,210
But it did this time. It might again.
Maybe we should patrol?

246
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,888
- If you want me to mobilise the squad...
- I think Karen simply startled it.

247
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:29,648
Probably more afraid of you than
you were of it. I'll patrol. Don't worry.

248
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:33,646
I can handle it on my own. Now, let's
see about getting Karen a ride home.

249
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:51,288
I wish you'd get rid of that body.
The smell's makin' me hungry.

250
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,933
You wouldn't want it. It had a blood disease.

251
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:57,649
It didn't know it but it would've
been dead within the year.

252
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:00,452
Humans sense so little
of what they carry inside.

253
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,521
All right. Well, you're
the Evil Messiah Guy, so...

254
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:10,243
Oh, hey, there's something new in town.
Yeah, attacked a girl, caused a little fuss.

255
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:12,964
Oh. He was there.

256
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,371
- Jonathan.
- Jonathan? Tell me, who is he?

257
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,083
You're jokin', right?

258
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:26,131
Jonathan is Jonathan. Look!

259
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:30,089
These are lies.

260
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:32,368
None of this is real.

261
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:34,523
The world has been changed.

262
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:36,649
It's intriguing, but it's wrong.

263
00:20:39,053 --> 00:20:42,807
- Feels OK to me.
- You're under his spell, just like the others.

264
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:47,250
- I seem to be the only one who's not.
- Really? And what makes you so special?

265
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:52,202
I'm aware. I know every molecule of myself
and everything around me.

266
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:58,851
No one - no human, no demon - has
ever been as awake and alive as I am.

267
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:02,288
You are all just shadows.

268
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:08,644
So, what do you do now?

269
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:12,284
Hey, you could kill Jonathan!

270
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:17,171
Well, or... you could try.
The guy's like a dynamo of action.

271
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:19,369
I don't need to do anything.

272
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:22,047
These magics are unstable, corrosive.

273
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,723
They will inevitably lead to chaos.

274
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:28,407
And I am interested in chaos.

275
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:51,489
Jonathan, aren't you coming to bed?

276
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:54,408
Ja, it's getting late.

277
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,004
Be right there.

278
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:07,366
I'm glad you're OK.

279
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:10,968
Everyone in the Bronze was
pretty freaked out after you left.

280
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,886
So, I guess you have
to go fight this thing, huh?

281
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:17,602
All the weapons are at Giles's.
It shouldn't take too long.

282
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:21,322
- No go.
- Did you just go "no go"?

283
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:25,292
Jonathan did. He said it was some brainless
beastie and that he'd take care of it.

284
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:27,603
Oh, cool.

285
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,604
I guess.

286
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:32,332
I don't know, he just... He seemed a little...

287
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:34,890
scared.

288
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:38,488
Buffy, this is Jonathan.
You know he doesn't get scared.

289
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:42,725
You talked about it when you gave him
the Class Protector Award at the prom.

290
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,485
You're right.

291
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:50,051
My exit. Willow, I'll see you tomorrow?

292
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:54,484
OK.

293
00:22:56,613 --> 00:23:00,447
So, saw you and Riley, with the dancing?

294
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:04,123
That was a great dance.

295
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:08,282
For the first time,
it felt like Faith wasn't there.

296
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:11,092
Like no one was there but us.

297
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:05,484
What's going on?

298
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,449
Oh, my God.

299
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,524
She's gonna be OK.

300
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:12,924
But she's terrified.

301
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:16,049
What happened? Who did this?

302
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:19,205
Someone found her in the janitor's
closet about an hour ago.

303
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:24,092
I think she was there all night.
She was all alone.

304
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:26,164
Tara,

305
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:29,204
what did this?

306
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:32,643
Big... lumpy...

307
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:37,210
Had something on its head, like...

308
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:40,486
like a Greek letter, only not.

309
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:52,247
This?

310
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:55,130
Was it this?

311
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:58,892
Buffy, Jonathan said we were all safe.

312
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:01,929
Jonathan said it.

313
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:18,524
Xander's not here.

314
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:24,890
You're not going away.
Why aren't you going away?

315
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:29,882
Well, I was kind of hoping
to look at some of Xander's stuff.

316
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:37,207
Sure. Come on in. Make yourself at home.

317
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:39,524
And so on.

318
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,284
Oh, you're still here?

319
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:05,049
That's nice.

320
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:08,850
May I ask you something?

321
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:16,132
Does it ever seem just a little strange
that Jonathan is so good at everything?

322
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,370
He's Jonathan.

323
00:26:20,853 --> 00:26:23,765
Hey! I was just at the part
where he invents the Internet.

324
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:28,003
Anya, he fights better than I do.
And I'm the Slayer.

325
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,011
The Slayer!

326
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:32,732
I mean, that's supposed
to mean something, right?

327
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:41,887
Buck up, you. You kill the best.
Go, you. Kill, kill.

328
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,087
Actually not needing validation
right now, but thank you.

329
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,566
He just seems too perfect.

330
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:56,292
- I don't know.
- So I can have my book back?

331
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:59,445
Anya, when you were a demon,
you granted wishes, right?

332
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:02,093
Vengeance wishes on ex-boyfriends.

333
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:07,645
I'd wish he was a dog, or ugly, or in love
with President McKinley or something.

334
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:12,090
But someone could wish the whole world
to be different, right? That's possible?

335
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,641
Sure. Alternate realities.

336
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,486
You could have, like, a world without shrimp.

337
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:20,531
Or with, you know, nothing but shrimp.

338
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:24,572
You could even make a freaky world
where Jonathan's a mouth-breather,

339
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:28,612
if that's what's blowing up your skirt.
Just don't ask me to live there.

340
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:35,172
Now, if, uh... I can just have my book back,
you'll be on your way someplace else?

341
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,524
Here.

342
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:42,009
I'm just saying it doesn't make any sense.

343
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,926
He starred in The Matrix,
but he never left town.

344
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:48,005
And how did he graduate
from med school? He's only 18.

345
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:50,323
Effective time management?

346
00:27:50,413 --> 00:27:54,372
I'm sorry, Buffy, but I... I just don't
understand what you're trying to say.

347
00:27:54,813 --> 00:27:58,692
Yeah, and when is Jonathan
gonna get here and start the meeting?

348
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:01,526
- This is the meeting.
- This is the meeting?

349
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,411
Well, I was just kind of...

350
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:07,769
wondering if maybe
anyone else thought that...

351
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:11,447
Jonathan was kind of too perfect?

352
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:16,249
No, he's not! He's just perfect enough!

353
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,609
He crushed the Master,
blew up a big steak made out of Mayor,

354
00:28:19,693 --> 00:28:23,003
and coached the US women's
soccer team to World Cup victory.

355
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:26,244
- We saw him doin' those things.
- But that's just it.

356
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:30,125
I'm not entirely sure that
we can trust our memories.

357
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:34,612
- Tell them about the alternate universes.
- Oh, OK.

358
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:38,766
Say you really like shrimp a lot.
Or we could say you don't like shrimp at all.

359
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:43,483
- "Blah, I wish there weren't any shrimp."
- Stop, you're saying it wrong!

360
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:47,487
I think that Jonathan
may be doing something...

361
00:28:47,573 --> 00:28:52,249
so that he's manipulating the world
and we're all, like, his pawns.

362
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,210
Or prawns.

363
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:57,251
Stop with the shrimp.
I am trying to do something here!

364
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,488
Of course, but...

365
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,212
I think you may be
a little out of your depth.

366
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:06,330
- I'm not.
- It sounds like nonsense.

367
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:12,086
But... I'm starting to know this girl pretty well.

368
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:15,690
And I think she sees things
that the rest of us don't.

369
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:18,810
I think, for once, we should follow her lead.

370
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:26,923
OK.

371
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,052
I think Jonathan might be ignoring evidence.

372
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:34,329
I think he might have let Tara get hurt.

373
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:38,292
- On purpose?
- No! No.

374
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,848
How did he ignore evidence?

375
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:46,165
The monster had a mark on it.
Jonathan saw it and he kind of...

376
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:50,402
- blinked.
- He blinked?

377
00:29:50,493 --> 00:29:53,883
The man moistens his eyeballs
and we're having a meeting about it.

378
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:57,602
He knows something about the monster.
He was reacting to the mark.

379
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,083
Oh! Wait. I remember something.

380
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,165
Giles, do you have
a Jonathan swimsuit calendar?

381
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:05,130
No.

382
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:07,843
Yes.

383
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,924
It was a gift.

384
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:17,128
No. No.

385
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:21,444
No.

386
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,171
There.

387
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:26,522
Oh.

388
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:29,525
Yeah. Pretty darn lickable.

389
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:32,969
The other kind of "oh".
That's it. That's what Tara saw.

390
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:36,363
Why would Jonathan have
the same mark as the monster?

391
00:30:36,453 --> 00:30:39,172
I don't know. But he's definitely keeping...

392
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:43,087
Is this a private conversation?
Or can Mr July sit in?

393
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:45,641
- Jonathan.
- Hi!

394
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:49,885
Buffy was just saying how you had
a monster cut up Willow's friend and...

395
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,247
Buffy?

396
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,527
No.

397
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:01,927
It's just... the mark.

398
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:06,648
You said it was safe, and... it wasn't.

399
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:11,808
I'm sorry, I just don't understand.

400
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:15,524
Then I'll explain.

401
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:22,089
Buffy is right.

402
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:25,568
No.

403
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:28,929
I do have a history with
the creature. The monster.

404
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:33,572
The problem is, every time I face it
my mind becomes sort of confused.

405
00:31:34,173 --> 00:31:39,167
- There's some kind of power it possesses.
- Oh! He's like your kryptonite.

406
00:31:39,253 --> 00:31:44,202
Maybe. I just know that it takes all my energy
to try and fight the confusion.

407
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:50,406
That's why I had his mark tattooed on me:
so that I wouldn't underestimate it next time.

408
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:55,288
- This does explain everything.
- I knew he wouldn't do anything on purpose.

409
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:59,366
Me too. And that whole alternate
universe thing was too freaky.

410
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:04,972
Jonathan, let's go after the monster.
Right now, you and me.

411
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:08,603
I'm sure it's left town by now.
That's been its pattern.

412
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,684
We can try.

413
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:13,084
Sure.

414
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:15,882
Let's do that.

415
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:19,729
- Goodbye, Jonathan!
- Goodbye.

416
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:29,612
Oh, look. Jonathan.

417
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:33,482
Taking the little sidekick
out for a walk, are we?

418
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:37,208
- Shut up, Spike.
- Ooh! Semi-harsh language from Betty.

419
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:42,242
You're feisty when the big guy's
standing beside you.

420
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,204
Someday,

421
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:48,763
sweet Slayer,

422
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:51,492
I would love to take you on.

423
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,363
See you face the evil alone, for once.

424
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:02,323
That's enough of the creepy small talk.
We're looking for a monster.

425
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:05,884
- Why would I know about that?
- Every demon's gunning for you,

426
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:08,613
so I figure you're keeping good track of 'em.

427
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:11,127
Big arms, mark on its head.

428
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:15,809
- Have you seen it?
- No. But then again, I'm probably lying.

429
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:23,048
We're not getting anything outta him.

430
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:28,132
Hey, what are you doing?
You're not supposed to do that!

431
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:31,849
You're pretty much relying on
butcher's blood these days, right?

432
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:36,609
- What are you saying?
- Just that the butchers respect Jonathan.

433
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:41,244
They do him a favour and you might
find yourself getting kinda thirsty.

434
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,644
Look, I don't know much, OK?

435
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:56,011
Some vampires got kicked out of a cave
in the hills behind Brookside Park.

436
00:33:56,653 --> 00:34:00,805
I don't know what did the kicking out,
but it was probably pretty big.

437
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:04,283
That was very good.

438
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:07,084
Very good.

439
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:10,361
These spells. These really work?

440
00:34:10,853 --> 00:34:15,324
I mean, can you really
turn your enemies inside out? Or...

441
00:34:16,293 --> 00:34:20,081
- learn to excrete gold coins?
- That one's not so much fun.

442
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:24,883
They work, Riley, but they take concentration.
Being attuned with the forces of the universe.

443
00:34:24,973 --> 00:34:30,127
Right. You can'tjust go
"librum incendere" and expect...

444
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:36,290
Xander, don't speak Latin
in front of the books.

445
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:42,372
Hey, I found the mark.
It's part of an augmentation spell.

446
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:45,490
Jonathan did an augmentation spell.

447
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:49,569
What, uh... did he have...? You know.

448
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:52,367
Him. And how we see him.

449
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:58,449
This spell turns the sorcerer into a paragon.
The best of everything. Everyone's ideal.

450
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:01,284
But there's a drawback.

451
00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:03,489
- A drawback?
- That happens a lot.

452
00:35:03,573 --> 00:35:08,283
In order to balance the new force of good, the
spell must create the opposing force of evil.

453
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:12,491
- The worst of everything. A nightmare.
- He created the monster.

454
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:16,566
So we're saying he did a spell
just to make us think he was cool?

455
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:18,608
Yes.

456
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:21,048
That is so cool.

457
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:25,684
Giles, Buffy and Jonathan are going after
this nightmare thing. Are they gonna be OK?

458
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:28,810
It seems the wellbeing of this
creature is linked to Jonathan.

459
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:32,010
If it dies the spell is broken
and Jonathan reverts to...

460
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:34,484
whatever he was before.

461
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,889
Jonathan isn't gonna want
Buffy to get very far.

462
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,491
Fall down there and be dead for a while.

463
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:01,131
Yeah.

464
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:03,965
Don't want that to happen.

465
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:14,133
Come on. We've got a monster...

466
00:36:21,653 --> 00:36:23,644
Buffy was right.

467
00:36:24,613 --> 00:36:28,288
- Buffy was right.
- It doesn't sound very likely, does it?

468
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:31,410
So, if this is the world he created,
what's the real world like?

469
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:34,724
I'm scared. Everything's gonna change.

470
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:40,167
Actually, it'll remain pretty much the same,
except Jonathan won't be Jonathan.

471
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:45,202
- Well, not our Jonathan, anyway.
- No! No! No! World without sunshine.

472
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:47,090
World withoutjoy!

473
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:49,812
But it only changes back
if Buffy kills this thing.

474
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:54,091
I mean, if she loses, then we could
be stuck in this wrong world for ever.

475
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:58,530
Things looking up.
I mean, we're all happy here, right?

476
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:01,009
You know, if she doesn't get killed?

477
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,483
Giles, can Buffy do it?

478
00:37:04,253 --> 00:37:09,122
I honestly don't know. She's never stood
alone against something like this before.

479
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:26,812
- What do I do?
- You'll have to handle this one solo.

480
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:30,852
- What? But... How?
- You'll know. You used to.

481
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:33,527
And the more you hurt it
the more I'll lose my...

482
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:35,490
What? Lose your...

483
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:52,087
I remember this. Is good.

484
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:36,567
- I can't believe we believed it.
- It seemed so real.

485
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:38,644
Well, in that world, it was real.

486
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,849
Alternate realities are neat.

487
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:45,848
- You know what I'll always remember?
- The swimsuit calendar sticks in my mind.

488
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:47,685
Not in a good way.

489
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:50,765
I'll always remember the way
he made me feel about me.

490
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:54,963
Valued, respected. Sort of tingly.

491
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:57,044
Now I'm just...

492
00:38:57,493 --> 00:38:58,721
empty.

493
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:02,089
Poor Xander. I guess
Jonathan hurt you most of all.

494
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:05,927
Except, of course, after Tara.

495
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:09,528
Did anyone else feel way too tall?
I felt way too tall.

496
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,443
I liked his clothes.
He had really cool clothes.

497
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:18,365
- I don't understand how he got the house.
- And who really did star in The Matrix?

498
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:21,242
Wait. That wasn't real either?

499
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:25,647
Hi. I wasn't sure you'd come over.

500
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:31,687
Everyone's mostly forgetting, but...
I think some people are kinda angry.

501
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:34,771
Yeah.

502
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:37,287
Nobody's even talking to me.

503
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:39,728
And... the twins moved out.

504
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:44,570
Why did you do it, anyway?
No. I get why. How?

505
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:49,012
After the thing with the bell tower
and the gun, I went to counselling.

506
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:53,006
You know, other kids with problems,
and one of them had this spell.

507
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:56,121
He glossed right over the monster.

508
00:39:56,653 --> 00:40:01,169
Well, anyway, I just...
I just wanted to apologise.

509
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:04,247
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

510
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:09,202
Jonathan, you get why everyone is angry,
though, right? It's notjust the monster.

511
00:40:09,293 --> 00:40:12,968
People didn't like being the little actors
in your sock-puppet theatre.

512
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,445
You weren't! You weren't socks!

513
00:40:16,973 --> 00:40:18,804
You were friends.

514
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:24,092
You can't keep trying to make everything
work out with some big gesture all at once.

515
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:28,122
Things are complicated.
They take time and work.

516
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,846
Yeah.

517
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:34,166
Right.

518
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:40,371
Hey, Buffy. You remember
I gave you some advice?

519
00:40:40,733 --> 00:40:44,203
- Watch out for southpaws?
- No. About you and Riley.

520
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:50,326
I mean, things are kinda starting to blur,
but this cool thing I said...

521
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:53,004
that I don't really remember.

522
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:55,729
I think it's right.

523
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:59,362
I think it's kind of the same thing
you just said to me.

524
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:04,642
About things taking work.

525
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:07,922
Yeah. I remember.

526
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:11,364
Good. Because it's true.

527
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:17,408
What you have is really complicated,
but it's worth it.

528
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,324
I think that's what I said.

529
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:39,362
I'm glad we talked this all out.

530
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:43,243
We haven't talked at all.

531
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:48,970
Well, whatever we're doing,
we're doing it great.

532
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:57,771
Jonathan...

533
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:30,566
