1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,275
Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,435
Hey, Mom.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,235
Mom?

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,790
Mommy?

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,480
There's some money stuff
we have to talk to you about.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,158
You're telling me I'm broke?

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,158
- Hospital bills.
- Pretty much sucked up all the money.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,669
- I don't think I can do this.
- Yes, you can.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,031
So, you guys wanna team up
and take over Sunnydale?

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,476
OK.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,556
We're, like, supervillains.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,596
Why are you always around
when I'm miserable?

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,999
Cos that's when you're alone, I reckon.
I'm not one for crowds myself these days.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,674
- Me neither.
- That works out nicely then.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,756
Buffy, what is it?

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,075
Angel.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,510
He needs to see me. I have to see him.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,358
You'll leave for LA tomorrow.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,152
I have to go now.

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,631
- Hello?
- Buffy?

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,752
Yep, it's me. I brought dinner.
Deep-fried chicken parts.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,474
Hope you're hungry.

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,674
- You already ate.
- No.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,711
Well, yes, obviously.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,869
We didn't know when you'd be coming back.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,389
It's OK. More for me.

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,798
I don't know about you,
but I would love some chicken.

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,434
- Yes. As would I.
- I'll take a drumstick.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,473
I'm a breast girl myself.
But then again you knew that.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,037
- So...
- What so?

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,316
So, how was it?

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,159
Seeing Angel. Him seeing you.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,676
Was it weird?

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,595
It was intense.

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,518
- Well, if you wanna talk about it...
- I don't.

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,998
It's not important. Past.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,353
I'd just rather keep this one
to myself, if that's OK.

38
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,959
Sure, whatever.

39
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,358
Buffy, there was some discussion,
in your absence,

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,711
about what you're gonna do now.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,878
Your plans.

42
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,751
I've been giving that
a lot of thought.

43
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,350
- I think I've figured out what I should do.
- Good. That's good.

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,950
I figure, if I hold off paying the plumber,
I can pay the utility bill.

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,073
- I can wait to reshingle the roof until...
- I meant with your life.

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,234
Life plans. Well...

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,556
I have no idea.

48
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,232
I guess... Well, I left school,
you know, when Mom got sick,

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,557
but I always figured I'd go back.
And then she...

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,196
So I was thinking about re-enrolling,

51
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,108
but I missed the registration cutoff.
Busy being dead and all.

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,790
If it's too late for late registration
and too early for early,

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,275
you can always come to classes
with Tara and me.

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,678
Right. You can audit for the rest
of the semester until registration.

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,188
Audit. I guess I could do that.

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,072
Yeah. It sounds like a good plan.
What do you think, Giles?

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,398
The Slayer always knows what she's doing.

58
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,149
Sharp. Decisive. Always with a plan.

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,035
We'll never be the crime lords of Sunnydale
with her one step ahead of us.

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,310
That's why we're throwing tests at her,

61
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,910
seeing which one of us can shake her up,
maybe find a weakness or two.

62
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,598
- She's ready.
- Sweet. Run me through it.

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,996
We got nine surveillance cameras hooked in -
super wide-angle, infrared, auto-iris -

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,954
six types of audio monitoring, filtered
through a dual quad DVR system...

65
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,072
Yeah, yeah. Fine. Just tell me.

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,757
Are you sure we'll be able to watch Buffy
without her noticing?

67
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,269
Absolutely. She'll never even know...

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,756
What the hell is that?

69
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,836
Death Star, dude. Wicked, huh?

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,872
Thermal exhaust port's
above the main port, numbnuts.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,675
I'm using the Empire's revised designs
from Return of the Jedi.

72
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,314
That's a flawed design.

73
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,715
OK. Since we're messing with the Slayer,

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,479
who could pummel us all
into a sludgy substance,

75
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,479
it might be a good idea for us
to not draw attention to ourselves.

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,111
- I could paint over it if you want.
- Yeah, do that.

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,435
This time tomorrow, the games begin.

78
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,518
And the Slayer will never
even know what hit her.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

80
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,356
This is gonna be great.

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,315
I thought it might be a little weird being
back It is weird, but a good kind of weird.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,637
There's the teacher, Mike.
You'll like Mike.

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,119
You call your teacher Mike?
Boy, school sure has changed since my day.

84
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,358
Social construction of reality.
Who can tell me what that is?

85
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,310
Rachel.

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,510
A concept involving opposing theories:

87
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,553
one stressing the externality
of social reality from individuals.

88
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,069
And the flip side? Steve.

89
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,397
Each individual participates fully
in the construction of his life.

90
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,556
Good. And who can expand on that?

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,352
- Chuck.
- Those...

92
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,836
Will, I'm not following this too well.

93
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,430
The trick is to get in the rhythm.
Kinda go with the flow.

94
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,070
That would be easier if your
classmates weren't such big brains.

95
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,237
Buffy, that's ridiculous.
They are no smarter than you or me.

96
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,349
Willow.

97
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,109
Because social phenomena don't have
unproblematic objective existences,

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,755
they have to be interpreted
by those who encounter them.

99
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,668
Nicely put. So, Ruby, does that mean
there are countless realities?

100
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,676
What?

101
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,189
You're not dumb. Just rusty.

102
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,976
Maybe I should ease back
in with classes like...

103
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,633
Introduction to Pies, or Advanced Walking.

104
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,638
- Hey. How'd it go?
- She did fine.

105
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,593
- Sociology, not a big fave.
- She didn't like Mike?

106
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,380
No, it's fine. I just need to
spend more time reacclimating,

107
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:47,850
to get back into the swing...

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,956
You could at least say sorry, rude-o.

109
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,831
Everybody's in a hurry.

110
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,231
Hans 7, this is Logan 5.
I'm in position, do you copy?

111
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,238
Yeah, Warren, we copy that.
And you're up on the monitor.

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,396
Hey, Warren, this is working great.

113
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,074
Runner is tagged, inhibitor is on.
Initiate omega pulse sequence.

114
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,398
My art appreciation class
doesn't start for 20 minutes,

115
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,988
so we've got some time to kill.

116
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,430
Here. You'll like it. It's very mellow.

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,514
.. didn't think she liked my cooking until
I realised that was her yummy face.

118
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,234
- What was that?
- What was what?

119
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,355
That noise...

120
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,040
What was that about cooking?
Whose yummy face?

121
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,957
Willow.

122
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,437
Wow. You really got engrossed
in that Renaissance book.

123
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,632
I guess. I must have spaced out.

124
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,915
I do that sometimes.
Once Willow and I were watching...

125
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,598
Buffy. Are you coming?

126
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,075
We're gonna be late for class.

127
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,498
What the...?

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,113
- Is it working? Is it doing it?
- Dude, it's doing it.

129
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,958
It's wicked cool.

130
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,076
Tara. Tara, wait.

131
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,269
Buffy, where were you? You missed art class.

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,949
Missed? Tara, something freaky's
going on. It's like I'm...

133
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,069
Look, there. There. Did you see...?

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,149
Crap.

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,076
Tara.

136
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,276
Tara, wait.

137
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,870
That noise. There's something on me.

138
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,675
Oh, no.

139
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,392
She found it.

140
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,470
- This is bad.
- This is bad.

141
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,270
- Self-destruct. Self-destruct.
- I don't know, I...

142
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,955
OK. Score me.

143
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,548
Right. 50 points for ingenuity.

144
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,717
- Another 30 since there was actual contact.
- Very smooth.

145
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,516
- On the freak-o-meter, she was at a six.
- Come on, it's an eight, easy.

146
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,557
We'll split the diff, call it a seven,
which is good for 140.

147
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,433
- Giving you a grand total of...
- 220.

148
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,711
- Beat that.
- I will.

149
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,470
I will.

150
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,113
This is gonna be great.
Diving into the workforce.

151
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,471
Being a breadwinner.
Building things with my hands.

152
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,471
Actually, you won't be building
so much as lifting and toting.

153
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,749
Toting?

154
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,758
It's just a temp gig, Buff.
You know, unless it tanks.

155
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,475
Since you're not union, I had to call in
a few favours to get you on a crew.

156
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,034
I appreciate it. Muchly.

157
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,311
You saved me from having to
accept work at the Magic Box.

158
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,034
I mean, retail? Yeee.

159
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,116
I'd rather be dead. Again.

160
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,839
So, Giles have any thoughts about your
fast-forward freak-out at school?

161
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,635
No. Well, he implied
that maybe it was stress-related.

162
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,196
Like I was imagining it or something.
I don't know. Maybe.

163
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,276
I guess I could have been blacking out.

164
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,076
But there was this thing on my sweater, and
then it just blew away, or went poof.

165
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,873
Maybe it was lint. Maybe it was evil lint.

166
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,873
OK. First tip of the day. When I introduce
you to Tony the foreman,

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,993
you might wanna leave out stuff
about blackin' out and evil lint.

168
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,955
Tony. This is Buffy.
You know, that friend I told you about.

169
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,000
Nice to meet you, Tony.

170
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,757
- Guys.
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

171
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,998
We're a week behind, I got two men out,
and you want us to baby-sit a little girl?

172
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,236
- Excuse me, but I...
- Hang on, Gidget.

173
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,828
This stinks, Harris.
What am I gonna do with her?

174
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,952
Give her a chance.
She's stronger than she looks.

175
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,310
That's the spirit.

176
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,434
Don't mind him. He may seem pig-ignorant,
rude, and a little hostile. Have fun.

177
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,996
- Where are you going?
- I need to supervise the Sheetrock hangers.

178
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,953
Don't sweat it.
I'll be back and check on you later.

179
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,474
Danny, finish putting in those J-boxes.
Vince, Marco, haul the steel inside.

180
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,991
I don't know, Tone. Don't wanna get in
trouble with affirmative-action lawyers

181
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,918
Why don't you put little Britney here
on hauling duty?

182
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,473
It's Buffy.

183
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,672
OK, princess, you're on it.
Try not to break a nail.

184
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,355
Don't worry. And don't let them hassle you
into hurting yourself.

185
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,278
These beams weigh
quite a few hundred pounds.

186
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,829
Which way?

187
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,916
Thanks.

188
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,310
I'm just trying to learn everything I can.

189
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,991
Cos I don't want just a job. I want
a career, something I can grow into.

190
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,159
I never thought of working in construction,
but it kinda...

191
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,830
We get paid by the hour. You wanna ruin it
for the rest of us? Slow down.

192
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,115
Got visual of subject, four o'clock.

193
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,358
- That's not four o'clock.
- It is if you face the front of the van.

194
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,678
But we're not, we're facing out that way.
That's 12, so she's at two o'clock.

195
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,598
- Look, she's over there, OK?
- OK.

196
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,916
You're up.

197
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,911
Jumpy.

198
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,429
What's the matter? I scare ya?

199
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,120
- Oh, man. She took 'em out.
- Let me see.

200
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,796
- Give it back now.
- I'm still looking.

201
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,118
- No, you had your turn, now gimme...
- No, I'm still...

202
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,837
Duck.

203
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,188
All you said was lose the mural.

204
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,593
Oh, my God. Buffy, what...
What happened? How...

205
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,034
I know they can be jerks,
but was it necessary...

206
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,799
- I didn't do that.
- I'll tell you what she did.

207
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,912
I came over to tell her I was impressed
by the job she was doing,

208
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,238
liking the way she handles herself, and
suddenly she goes berserk and attacks me.

209
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,670
Wh...? I saved you from the...

210
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,039
The demons. There were
three big apey things.

211
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,799
No. Not here.
Not at my job. That's your job.

212
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,593
I can't help where
the forces of darkness attack me.

213
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,981
Buffy, look at this mess.

214
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:33,236
Do you have any idea how much
it's gonna cost to repair this?

215
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,273
What do I say to the clients? Show 'em
the demon bodies, say it's their fault?

216
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,356
You can't.

217
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,315
They melted.

218
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,035
But there are witnesses.

219
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,234
Vince. You can tell him, right, how I jumped
in and protected you from those things?

220
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,828
I don't know what you're talkin' about. All
I know is you were losin' it.

221
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,793
- That time of the month, huh?
- What?

222
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,595
You were huddled in a corner,
crying like a baby.

223
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,711
No way. Me, crying?

224
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,956
You're trippin', sweetie.

225
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,150
What's her problem?

226
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,710
- I didn't imagine this, Xander.
- I know. I believe you.

227
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,594
I think, between this and the school thing,
somebody's messin' with you.

228
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,757
- They're connected?
- There's somethin' going on.

229
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,351
I think it's worth checking out. You need
to see Giles, get on it right away.

230
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,710
I'd start with ID'ing those demons.

231
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,990
- You're firing me, aren't you?
- Big time.

232
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,795
The whole melty thing
oughta help narrow it down.

233
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,592
Try sketchin' 'em.

234
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,871
When I get off work, I'll help you
go through the mug shots.

235
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,356
This is gonna be great.
I've always been interested in...

236
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,630
interested in retail.

237
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,116
Is this all research or just some
kind of stress test for the table?

238
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,312
I just want to be thorough.
This time anomaly

239
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,955
and the demon attacks
could be completely unrelated events,

240
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,038
but if they're not,
you might be in some danger.

241
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,515
So, situation normal then.

242
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,915
Let's review.

243
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,996
You record returns here.

244
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,749
These are for special orders. You ship them
wherever the customer wants.

245
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,873
- And these are the hold slips.
- Fill out two hold slips for each item.

246
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,958
And be sure to remove
the items from the shelf.

247
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,914
I can illustrate with
an amusing story about a crystal.

248
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,511
See, there was this certain customer
who had wanted to purchase a sapphire.

249
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,076
Sapphire. Well, ding-dong. Right?

250
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,350
And so anyway...

251
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,235
This is so dull I might actually have fallen
asleep and be dreaming, you guys.

252
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,753
Why is the Slayer here anyway? She's
a student, she's a construction worker,

253
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,714
and now she's some kind of
selling stuff person?

254
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,479
It's like she's completely without focus.

255
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,079
Shall we check the other channels
for free cable porn?

256
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,156
Guys, I'm ready.

257
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,870
- I need you to hold hands.
- With each other?

258
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,152
Well, you know what homophobia really means
about you, don't you?

259
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,191
Stop touching my magic bone.

260
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,912
Shut up.

261
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,636
OK.

262
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,598
OK.

263
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,633
It's in Latin, so don't laugh. It's supposed
to sound like this.

264
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,876
Buffy, a word in your ear.

265
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,014
While I was running the store,
I found it useful...

266
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,549
to imagine myself back in the library.

267
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,309
If you concentrate on service
and not on making a sale,

268
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,512
you're more likely to have
a satisfied customer.

269
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,838
- Guess I'll have to find my own style.
- Yes. Quite right.

270
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,158
That woman. Go sell her something.

271
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,629
Miss?

272
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,719
Which candle creates a more,
you know, romantic atmosphere?

273
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,439
"Lemon Seduction. "

274
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,237
"Essence of Slug. "

275
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,316
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

276
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,158
Yeah...

277
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,592
- May I help you?
- I need something for a prosperity spell.

278
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,075
I heard you have it. A mummy hand?

279
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,790
Yeah, actually, I saw one downstairs.

280
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,390
It's kinda hairy, though.
Maybe it was a daddy hand.

281
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,990
I'll just get it.

282
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,029
Petrified hamster.

283
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,469
Eyeballs in honey.

284
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,397
Dagger of Lex...

285
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,998
Ancient mummy hand.

286
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,669
And you get the dagger of Lex
for free with it.

287
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,952
See the inlaid mother-of-pearl...
underneath the black oozing goo?

288
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,073
This hand is dead. The power is gone.
I'm not giving you money for this.

289
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,237
It's just playing dead. Little scamp.

290
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,869
Buffy, a word in your ear.

291
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,072
- While I was running the store...
- What?

292
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,510
.. to imagine myself back in the library.

293
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,030
We did this just now.
Giles, something is happening.

294
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,356
Yes. Quite right.

295
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,357
You did it. Dude, she's looping.

296
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,029
- What'd you do, enchant the hand thing?
- Not exactly.

297
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,551
I made it so she had to satisfy a customer
with a task that resists solving.

298
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,240
- Maybe I should've done more.
- Like what?

299
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,875
I don't know. Like make her kind of itchy?

300
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,793
- Go help the lady who just came in.
- Wait...

301
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,436
Don't worry, don't be nervous. Do what I do
- just picture yourself naked.

302
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,236
Miss...

303
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,558
Hi. I'm looking for something
really specific. I heard you carry it.

304
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,636
A mummy hand.

305
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,799
You look like the mummy hand type. Sorry, I
can't get that for you.

306
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,390
I called here 20 minutes ago, and someone
said you had one.

307
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,035
Yeah, but there's a thing happening.

308
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,754
You have one and I was told I could buy it,

309
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,793
and I'm sorry but I'm really gonna have to
hold you to that.

310
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,832
I'm not leaving until I get a mummy hand.

311
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,992
OK.

312
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,751
I guess I'll have to get it for you.

313
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,719
Smart. She's figuring out the game.

314
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,671
Satisfy the customer.

315
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,078
- She might have you beat there, Stretch.
- No way. She hasn't even started yet.

316
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,332
Hope she solves it faster
than Data on the ep of TNG...

317
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:51,352
where the Enterprise kept blowing up.

318
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,074
Or Mulder, in that X-Files
where the bank kept exploding.

319
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,350
Scully wants me so bad.

320
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,912
Fingers sold separately.

321
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,478
- Where are you going?
- Lady needs a mummy hand.

322
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,068
What? You haven't even talked to her yet.

323
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,072
I could explain,
but you would just forget it.

324
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,430
I'm worried about you.

325
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,269
Retail is a fast-paced and exciting world.

326
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,756
I mean, has this whole day
gone by too quickly for you?

327
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,953
No. No, I don't think
that's exactly the problem.

328
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,116
Buffy, a word in your ear. If you think
of the store as a library,

329
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,234
it'll help you to concentrate on
service rather than selling.

330
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,319
Yes. And then I'm going to marry
Bob Dole and raise penguins in Guam.

331
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,396
Yes. Quite right, yes.

332
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,630
Miss, I...

333
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,558
Mummy hand, right? You got it, lady.

334
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,676
Miss...

335
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,709
- Miss?
- Hi.

336
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,915
If you like slug, go with slug. She's
not gonna sleep with you anyway.

337
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,079
- This mummy hand has ceased to be.
- It is an ex-mummy hand.

338
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,518
Buffy, a word in your ear.

339
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,634
It's you. You're doing this.

340
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,676
I know we promised you
a mummy hand. It's just...

341
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,109
I can't get it for you.

342
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,555
There's something wrong. It's defective.

343
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,231
Defective? Are you sure?
There must be something you can do.

344
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,516
But there's no way to get...

345
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,038
to get that hand. I can special-order one.
We can deliver it anywhere you want.

346
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,431
Really?

347
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,594
Thank you for shopping at the Magic Box.

348
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,396
Oh, yes.

349
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,308
So, Warren had 220, and I had that bonus
for getting her fired.

350
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,752
But the biggest component has to be how long
it took. Mine took the longest.

351
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,110
Only if you're external to the time loops.

352
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,596
From Mr Giles' perspective,
it was shortest of all.

353
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,598
- So what do we do?
- It's obvious.

354
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,358
It's not over.

355
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,433
Buffy, your first sale. Congratulations.

356
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,512
You didn't charge for delivery.

357
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,993
Well, first day...
These things happen.

358
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,759
Yeah, I'll just take it out of your pay.

359
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,034
Yes, I'm sure Buffy would understand that.

360
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,718
Absolutely.

361
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,400
This is gonna be great.

362
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,835
Life is stupid.

363
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,916
I have a dim memory of that, yeah.

364
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,310
And I didn't figure you were here cadging my
whiskey cos life is full of bloody peaches.

365
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,513
There's this thing.
Someone's doing stuff to me.

366
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,553
Messing up my life. Except that
it was kind of pre-messed already.

367
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,990
You know, with school and jobs.

368
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,588
It was pretty bad even without the evil.

369
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,512
So you're gonna let this whoever play you
till it figures out what kills you?

370
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,635
- Giles is workin' on it.
- Good.

371
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,797
Giles rules the mighty force
of library books.

372
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,434
- You'd do better?
- Damn right.

373
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,630
I'd hit the demon world.

374
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,514
Ask questions, throw punches, find out
what's in the air.

375
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,995
It's fun too.

376
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,076
It's not my kind of fun.

377
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,195
Yeah. It is.

378
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,710
Your life will be a lot less confusing
when you figure that out.

379
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,277
You have had so too much to drink
at this point, I am cuttin' you off.

380
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,596
You're not a schoolgirl.

381
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,596
You're not a shop girl.

382
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,031
You're a creature of the darkness, like me.

383
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,271
Try on my world. See how good it feels.

384
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,908
Are there drinks in your world?

385
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,909
- The motorcycle was loud.
- Sssspike.

386
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,634
The usual, Dave, and one for the lady.

387
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,035
We're heading for the back room, pet.

388
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,196
Where the real action is.

389
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,674
These lowlifes know everything
that happens in town.

390
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,916
Good. These are the lowlifes.

391
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,553
Fine. A little louder.

392
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,790
Boys, what's the game?

393
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,957
You know the game, Spike. You in?

394
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,029
He kills our kind. Don't let him in.

395
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,911
- Ask him if he's heard about...
- Later.

396
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,315
You're gonna play cards?

397
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,310
I need a moment with my lady.

398
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,193
You wanna play, that's fine. I am sticking
to the original plan.

399
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,348
- Which one do I kill for information?
- Listen. These guys talk while they play.

400
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,508
We'll get more information out of their
mouths than out of their corpses.

401
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,955
I'm in. Everybody OK with that?

402
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,111
Ante up.

403
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,358
You play for kittens?

404
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,519
So, who's gonna advance me a tiny tabby,
get me started?

405
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,796
- Come on, someone's gotta stake me.
- I'll do it.

406
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,515
What? You thought I was
just gonna let that lie there?

407
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,829
- Where are we going?
- To Final Jeopardy,

408
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,315
where Buffy's the one in jeopardy.

409
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,035
We're really supervillains now,
like... like Dr No.

410
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,118
Yes, back when Bond was Connery,
and movies were decent.

411
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,630
Who remembers Connery?
I mean, Roger Moore was smooth.

412
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,275
You're insane.
You're short, and you're insane.

413
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,595
I like Timothy Dalton.

414
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,870
Don't make me pull over, OK?

415
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,918
- You're lucky today, Spike.
- Got my good-luck charm with me.

416
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,068
- You cleaned us out. No one's that lucky.
- Yeah. I'm startin' to think you cheat.

417
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,519
Me?

418
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,438
I cheat? He's got x-ray vision.

419
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,155
- I'm not using it.
- We are not the ones who were cheating.

420
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,829
I had no idea that was there. I could have
leaned on that days ago.

421
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,520
You better go, Spike. Things could get ugly.

422
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,155
Got ugly the second he walked in.
Him and his human.

423
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,196
Her skin's so tight, I don't even know
how you can look at her.

424
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,630
Leave your winnings and get out.

425
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,108
We'll forget this whole thing.

426
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,313
So it's a setup, isn't it?
Squeeze a few quid outta the vamp.

427
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,637
Well, you didn't count on me and the bird.

428
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,628
You wanna fight, you face the two of us.

429
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,359
What? I'm not getting into a bar fight.

430
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,028
I'll beat 'em up for information,
great, but...

431
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,994
not to defend your rights to
gamble for kittens.

432
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,795
- Which, by the way, is stupid currency.
- They're delicious.

433
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,753
Come on, Slayer,
a big fight's just what you need.

434
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,032
Forget it. I'm not playing by anyone
else's rules any more. I'm done.

435
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,152
- I won those.
- Scamper. Be free, kittens.

436
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,430
The money's gettin' away.

437
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,157
- What's wrong, love?
- What's wrong? You were gonna help me.

438
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,670
You were gonna beat heads and fix my life.

439
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,759
But you're completely lame. Tonight sucks.

440
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,468
And look at me. Look at stupid Buffy.
Too dumb for college.

441
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,469
And freak Buffy -
too strong for construction work.

442
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,911
And my job at the magic shop?

443
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,191
I was bored to tears even before the hour
that wouldn't end.

444
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,677
And the only person that I can even stand
to be around is a neutered vampire

445
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,836
who cheats at kitten poker.

446
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,033
- You saw the cheating, did you?
- Also, I think you're drunk.

447
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,079
- Connery is Bond. He had style.
- Yeah, but Roger Moore was funny.

448
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,556
Moonraker?The gondola turns into
a hovercraft? It's retarded.

449
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,069
Besides, the guy had, like, no edge.

450
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,557
Dalton had edge. In Licence to Kill he was
a rogue agent. That's edgy.

451
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,913
- He was amazing in The Living Daylights.
- Which was written for Roger Moore.

452
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,430
This is stupid. We're wasting time.
End of discussion.

453
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,476
There were pigeons doing double takes
when the gondola blasted by.

454
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,556
Moonrakeris inexcusable.

455
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,437
That van.

456
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,228
You wanna steal a van, I'm with you,
love, but we have got the motorcycle.

457
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,716
I've seen it before.
At the construction site.

458
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,034
Connery is the only actor of the bunch.

459
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,836
Timothy Dalton should get an Oscar and beat
Sean Connery over the head with it.

460
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,918
- OK, that's it.
- Stop it. Guys.

461
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,238
Look.

462
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,797
- She's coming over here. What do we do?
- Jonathan, grab your magic bone.

463
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,669
You have discovered me.

464
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,910
But do not try to defeat me, for I have been
testing you and I know your weaknesses.

465
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,235
I'm OK. I'm fine. Get off me.

466
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,669
I am well struck.

467
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,236
I call on the misty portal
to my demon dimension,

468
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,238
where I'll lay my head and gently die.

469
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,915
He blew up. Did you see that?

470
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,190
Yeah, I saw. He's gone.

471
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,072
I love it, you know.
It makes you feel all powerful.

472
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,474
Strong...

473
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,874
Kinda sick.

474
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,272
- She hurt me.
- Someone'll see you. Get in the back.

475
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,756
- I won't fit.
- Do the thing.

476
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,438
Right. Let the spell be ended.

477
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,749
Next time I do that spell, one of you guys
has to look like the demon.

478
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,632
The Slayer touched you.

479
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,514
Yeah, it was sexy the way she touched
me real hard with her fists.

480
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,317
I only looked big. I actually had the
proportional strength of me.

481
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,110
Guys, think about this.
We took on the Slayer.

482
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,435
We've got lots of stuff in the computer now.

483
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,680
Speed, strength, reaction time... We're
getting what we need to be a threat to her.

484
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,792
We tested her, faced her, and we survived.

485
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,514
Unless I have internal injuries
that will kill me.

486
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,553
Of course. But, barring that,
Warren's right. We did good.

487
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,193
The Trio versus the Slayer. It's not over.

488
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,709
Plus, look what Warren and me
discovered by accident.

489
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,435
- What?
- Free cable porn.

490
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,997
Feel any better?

491
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,874
I think at one point
I actually turned completely inside out

492
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,836
But, yeah, better.

493
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,389
I'm sorry I didn't find this demon
with my research.

494
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,117
It's OK. It wasn't much of a fight.

495
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,796
I got lucky.

496
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,548
- I'm really screwing up, Giles.
- What? Come on.

497
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,393
You were being tested sequentially
by some unknown demon.

498
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,034
I don't call that screwing up.

499
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,993
No, it completely is.

500
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,193
- I let the demon set the rules.
- Go easy on yourself, will you?

501
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,599
You don't have to figure the whole thing out
at once, you know. The job and everything.

502
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,233
You're pushing yourself too hard.

503
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,717
The nice people at the phone company seem to
think it's not hard enough.

504
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,792
Well, maybe there's something
I can do about that.

505
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,108
This is... I...

506
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,077
It's for you.

507
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,156
A cheque?

508
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,274
This is too much. I can't take it.

509
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,756
- Tear it up then.
- No. I was just being polite.

510
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,836
I'm taking the money.

511
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,513
This is great. This is more than great.

512
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,400
I don't really know how to say this,

513
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,839
but it's a little like having Mom back.

514
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,148
In this scenario, I am your mother?

515
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,718
Wanna be my shiftless absentee father?

516
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,352
Is there some sort of rakish uncle?

517
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,956
I'm just saying thank you.

518
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,355
So much.

519
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,194
I'm gonna show this to Dawn.

520
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,356
She loves it when things get easy.

521
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,919
I just wanna tell you...

522
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:38,479
that this makes me feel safe.

523
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,520
Knowing you're always gonna be here.

524
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:49,180
