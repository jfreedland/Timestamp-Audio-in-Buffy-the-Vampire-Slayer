1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:04,438
In every generation, there is a Chosen One,

2
00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:09,479
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness,

3
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:11,748
She is the Slayer.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,993
Come on, Stephan, rise and shine. Some
of us have a ton of trig homework waiting.

5
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:29,649
Hey.

6
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:31,435
- Is this a bad time?
- Are you crazy?

7
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:33,887
You don't just sneak up
on people in a graveyard.

8
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:38,151
You make noise when you walk.
You stomp or... yodel.

9
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:41,237
- I heard you were on the hunt.
- I'm supposed to be, but...

10
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:44,012
lazybones here
doesn't wanna come out and play.

11
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:47,946
When you first wake up,
it's a little disorienting. He'll show.

12
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,271
It's weird to think of
you going through that.

13
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:52,731
It's weird to go through.

14
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:56,363
So, uh, you're here alone?

15
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:58,536
Yeah. Why?

16
00:00:58,537 --> 00:01:00,700
I just thought you'd have
somebody with you.

17
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:02,728
- Xander, or someone.
- Xander?

18
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,948
- Or someone.
- Nope.

19
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,129
Why? Are you jealous?

20
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:14,973
- Of Xander? Please! He's just a kid.
- Is it 'cause I danced with him?

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,338
"Danced with" is a pretty loose term.
"Mated with" might be a little closer.

22
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,510
Don't you think
you're being a little unfair?

23
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:23,293
It was... one little dance, which...

24
00:01:23,294 --> 00:01:26,394
I only did to make you crazy.
By the way, behold my success.

25
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:28,578
- I am not jealous!
- You are not jealous.

26
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:31,797
- What, vampires don't get jealous?
- See? Whenever we fight,

27
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:35,139
- you always bring up the vampire thing.
- Well, I didn't come here to fight!

28
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:39,546
Oh, right, I did!

29
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:49,004
- Where's my stake? I know I had a stake!
- I didn't see a stake.

30
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:13,139
What d'you mean, he's just a kid?
Does that mean I'm just a kid, too?

31
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:17,649
Look, obviously I made
a mistake coming here tonight.

32
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:20,694
Oh, no, you don't. You can't just turn
and walk away from me like that.

33
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:24,507
It takes more than that to get rid of me!

34
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:33,120
You OK?

35
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:36,611
I'm fine.

36
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:42,057
I wish people wouldn't leave
open graves laying around like this.

37
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:47,581
So... another vampire has risen tonight.

38
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:54,078
I don't think so. Look at those tracks.

39
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:58,403
Whoever was buried here
didn't rise from this grave.

40
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,650
She was dragged from it.

41
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:05,040
<b>"Some Assembly Required"</b>

42
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:09,661
W-w-what I'm proposing is,
and I don't mean to appear indecorous...

43
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:14,268
is-is, um, a-a social engagement,
a-a date, if you're amenable.

44
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:18,473
You idiot!

45
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,653
Boy, I guess we never realized
how much you like that chair.

46
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:25,408
- I-I was just working on...
- Your pickup lines?

47
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:28,538
Um... in a manner of speaking, yes.

48
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:30,628
Then if you wouldn't mind
a little Gene and Roger,

49
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,714
you might wanna
leave off the "idiot" part.

50
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:35,866
Being called an idiot tends
to take people out of the dating mood.

51
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,534
It actually kinda turns me on.

52
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,085
I fear you.

53
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,424
You also might wanna avoid words like

54
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,925
"amenable" and "indecorous",
you know? Speak English,

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,316
- not whatever they speak in...
- England?

56
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:51,892
Yeah. You just say "Hey,
I got a thing. You maybe have a thing.

57
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:53,047
Maybe we could have a thing".

58
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,981
- Oh, thank you, Cyrano.
- I'm not finished.

59
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:58,169
Then you say
"How do you feel about Mexican?"

60
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:01,415
- About Mexicans?
- Mexican. Food.

61
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,887
You take her for food,
for which you then pay.

62
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:08,348
- Oh, right.
- So this chair-woman?

63
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:11,611
- We are talking Ms Calendar, right?
- What makes you think that?

64
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:15,366
Simple deduction.
Ms Calendar is reasonably dollsome,

65
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:18,446
especially for someone in your age bracket.
She already knows that

66
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:20,439
you're a school librarian,
so you don't have to worry about

67
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,278
how to break
that embarrassing news to her.

68
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:24,880
And she's the only woman we've
actually ever seen speak to you.

69
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,369
Add it up, it all spells "Duh!".

70
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:30,079
Now, is it time to have a talk
about the facts of life?

71
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:32,710
You know, I'm suddenly deciding
this is none of your business.

72
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:37,503
You know, 'cause that whole
stork thing is a smoke screen.

73
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:43,642
So, how did things go last night?
Did Mr... Korshak show up on schedule?

74
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,053
More or less.
Angel and I took care of him.

75
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:50,238
- Angel.
- There's something else, though.

76
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:52,306
We found an empty grave.

77
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:53,778
- Another vampire?
- No.

78
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,100
No, this one was dug up
and the body was taken out.

79
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:59,479
Grave robbing? That's new. Interesting.

80
00:05:59,514 --> 00:06:02,212
I know you meant to say:
"gross and disturbing".

81
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:07,508
Yes, yes, of course. Terrible thing.
Must-must put a stop to it... Damn it.

82
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:11,688
So, why does someone
want to dig up graves?

83
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:14,366
Well, I'll collate some theories.

84
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,919
It would help if we knew
who the body belonged to.

85
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:20,271
- Meredith Todd. Ring a bell?
- No.

86
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:25,342
- She died recently. She was our age.
- Drawin' a blank.

87
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:31,910
Why don't we ask Willow to fire... this
"thing" up, and... track Meredith down?

88
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:45,976
- Smile.
- Hey!

89
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,178
- Oh, look at those legs.
- No, thank you.

90
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:52,713
Eric, will you knock it off?

91
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:55,812
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey.

92
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:00,759
Oh, I was just wondering
what you were gonna do this year.

93
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:03,469
- Why?
- 'Cause every year you win

94
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:06,757
and I place second, so I just thought
I'd see what I'm up against.

95
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:10,985
You know what the key is? If Dr Clark
doesn't understand your experiment,

96
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,353
he gives you higher marks so it looks like
he understands your experiment.

97
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:19,482
"Effects of Subviolet Light
Spectrum Depravation...

98
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:23,643
on the Development of Fruit Flies"?
That should do the trick!

99
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:26,242
OK, I'm doing this under protest.

100
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:30,931
It is not fair they're making participation
in this year's science fair mandatory.

101
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:33,286
I don't think anyone should have to do
anything educational in school,

102
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:37,918
- if they don't want to.
- "The Tomato: Fruit or Vegetable?"

103
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:40,788
I wanted to do something
I could finish in a weekend, all right?

104
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:43,871
Stop it! What are you doing?!
We are under

105
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:46,359
- fluorescent lights for God's sake!
- The camera loves you.

106
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:49,799
I didn't think yearbook nerds
came out of hibernation till spring.

107
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,735
- It's for my private collection.
- Eric, will you quit it?

108
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,783
Coming through. Sorry.

109
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,379
Sorry to interrupt, Willow,
but it's the Batsignal.

110
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,737
OK, sure.
See you later, Chris.

111
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,856
- Thanks for the tip.
- OK.

112
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:14,967
Cordelia's so fine.
You know, she'd be just perfect for us.

113
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:18,823
Don't be an idiot. She's alive.

114
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,570
This shouldn't take long.
I'm probably the only girl in school

115
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,628
who has the coroner's office
bookmarked as a favorite place.

116
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:31,510
Hi. Sorry to interrupt
your little undead playgroup,

117
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,147
but I need to ask Willow if she'll help me
with my science fair project.

118
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:37,437
- It's a fruit.
- I would've asked Chris to help me,

119
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:40,470
but then that would've brought back
too many memories of Daryl.

120
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:45,784
I found it! Meredith Todd died
in a car accident last week.

121
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:48,023
Of course, I have learnt
to deal with my pain.

122
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:51,913
- How was her neck?
- Fine, except for being broken.

123
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,414
Hello! Can we deal with my pain, please?

124
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:57,272
There, there.

125
00:08:57,307 --> 00:09:01,349
It says that Meredith and two other girls
in the car were killed instantly.

126
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,551
They were all on the Fondren High
Pep Squad, on the way to a game.

127
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,757
- You know what this means?
- That Fondren might actually

128
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:10,745
beat Sunnydale in the cross-town
body count competition this year?

129
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:13,772
She wasn't killed by vampires.
Somebody did dig up her corpse.

130
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:18,310
Eww! Why is it that every conversation
you have has the word "corpse" in it?

131
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:20,848
OK, so we've got a body snatcher.
What does that mean?

132
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:22,211
Here's what I've come up with.

133
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:25,485
Demons who eat the flesh of the dead
to absorb their souls.

134
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,546
Or it could obviously be
a voodoo practitioner.

135
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:32,127
- You mean, making a zombie?
- Uh, zombies, more likely.

136
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:34,365
For most traditional purposes,

137
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,654
a voodoo priest would require
more than one.

138
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:40,019
So, we should see if the other girls
in the accident are AWOL, too.

139
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,284
Maybe we can figure out what this creep
has in mind if we know whether or not

140
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:45,248
- he's dealing in volume.
- So we dig up some graves tonight?

141
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:48,439
Oh, boy, a field trip!
You gonna call Angel?

142
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:51,861
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, why bother him, huh?

143
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:55,250
Angel and I have been, um...
Never mind.

144
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:57,827
As far as Angel's concerned,
I'm taking the night off, OK?

145
00:09:57,862 --> 00:10:01,788
So we're set then.
Say nine-ish? BYO shovel.

146
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:05,086
And I'll pack some food. Who else likes
those little powdered doughnuts?

147
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:07,310
- Hey!
- Cordelia?

148
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,992
Darn, I have cheerleader practice tonight.

149
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,718
Boy, I wish I knew we were gonna be
digging up dead people sooner.

150
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:15,030
- I would've canceled.
- All right. But if you come across

151
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:18,723
the army of zombies, can you
page us before they eat your flesh?

152
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,518
- Xander?
- Huh?

153
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:25,615
Zombies don't eat the flesh of the living.

154
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:30,710
Yeah, I knew that.
But did you see that look on her face?

155
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,773
I couldn't believe Angel.

156
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:38,614
He was acting all jealous
and he wouldn't even admit it.

157
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,164
- Jealous of what?
- Of Xander.

158
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:44,141
Because you did that
sexy dance with him?

159
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:47,797
- Am I ever gonna live that down?
- Nope.

160
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:53,070
- Anyway, he was being totally irrational.
- Love makes you do the wacky.

161
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:55,160
- That's the truth.
- You know, this might go a lot faster

162
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,284
if you femmes actually
picked up a shovel, too.

163
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,286
- Here, here.
- Sorry, but I'm an old-fashioned gal.

164
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:05,090
I was raised to believe that men dig up
the corpses and women have the babies.

165
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,032
So, speaking of the wacky,

166
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,736
what was Cordelia's whole riff
about painful memories? Who's Daryl?

167
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,443
Daryl Epps. Chris's older brother.

168
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:16,750
He was a big football star.
All-state two years ago.

169
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:19,123
He was a running...

170
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:23,233
He was a running...
Someone who runs and catches.

171
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,086
- Was he a studly?
- Big time.

172
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,770
- All the girls were crazy for him.
- And he broke Cordy's heart?

173
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,489
Thus possibly proving its existence.

174
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,451
He died. Rock climbing,
or something. He fell.

175
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,328
Man, that's lousy. Poor Chris.

176
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:41,842
Ever since then,
Chris has been real quiet.

177
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:44,368
Kind of in his own world.

178
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:48,410
I heard their mother doesn't even
leave the house any more.

179
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:50,749
I think we're there.

180
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:58,734
By the way, are we hoping
to find a body, or no body?

181
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:02,008
Call me an optimist, but I'm hoping
to find a fortune in gold doubloons.

182
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:05,181
Um, body would mean flesh-eating demon.

183
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:09,993
No body would point towards the army
of zombies thing. Take your pick, really.

184
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:13,085
Right then, go on.

185
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:16,778
- You're closer.
- Pathetic much?

186
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:18,889
Move over.

187
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:30,302
Guys, if we don't
get this down by tomorrow,

188
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:31,303
no one's gonna be led by our cheers.

189
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:35,287
- Practice.
- OK.

190
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,987
See you later.

191
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:54,845
Hello?

192
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:17,090
Xander Harris,
if this is some kind of joke...

193
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,216
Cordelia. This is the last place
I expected you to hang out.

194
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,866
Oh, God.

195
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,539
- God, it's you. Why were you following me?
- I wasn't sure it was you at first.

196
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,943
- I'm looking for Buffy.
- Buffy?

197
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:07,488
Well, she's, uh, big shock,
she's at the graveyard.

198
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:12,526
- She said she'd be home.
- Well, she lied. Isn't she a rascal?

199
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:16,244
Well, you're in luck.
It just so happens that my night is free.

200
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:20,180
Oh, hold on. My skirt is caught.

201
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,777
There.

202
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,418
So, both coffins are empty. That makes

203
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:35,797
three girls signed up
for the army of zombies.

204
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:39,717
- Is it an army if you just have three?
- Zombie drill team then.

205
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:41,762
You're back.

206
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:45,778
- Angel.
- Xander.

207
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:48,046
- Angel.
- I thought you were taking the night off?

208
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:51,102
I, I was, um, but something came up.

209
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:55,364
- Cordelia told me the truth.
- That's gotta be a first.

210
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,859
Um, as long as you're here,
perhaps you could be of some help. Hm?

211
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:07,159
We were investigating. Somebody's
been digging up the bodies of dead girls.

212
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:09,464
I know. We found some of them.

213
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:11,530
You mean, like, two of the three?

214
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:14,666
I mean, like, some of them. Like parts.

215
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:17,461
It was horrible.
Angel saved me from an arm.

216
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,773
God, there were so many parts.
They were everywhere.

217
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:22,801
Why are these terrible things
always happening to me?

218
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:26,457
- Karma.
- So much for our zombie theory.

219
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,112
- So much for all our theories.
- I don't get it.

220
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:32,200
Why go to all the trouble
to dig up three girls,

221
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:35,533
only to chop them up and throw them away?
It doesn't make any sense!

222
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,088
Especially from
a time-management standpoint.

223
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:41,053
What I saw didn't
add up to three whole girls.

224
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:44,708
- I think they kept some parts.
- Could this get yuckier?

225
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,847
They probably kept the other parts to eat!

226
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:48,172
Question answered.

227
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:53,170
Why dispose of the remains five miles from
the cemetery, at a school, of all places?

228
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:55,880
Maybe because whoever did it
had some business in the neighborhood.

229
00:15:55,881 --> 00:16:00,454
- Like, say, classes?
- Oh. Ah.

230
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:01,978
This was no hatchet job.

231
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:04,636
Whoever made those incisions
really knew what they were doing.

232
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:08,726
Yes, really. What student here is gonna be
that well versed in... physiology?

233
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:12,972
Well, I can think of five or six guys
in the science club. And me.

234
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:14,429
So, Will, come clean.

235
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,639
Promise to never do it again,
and we'll call it a night.

236
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:20,482
He joked!

237
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:23,576
Willow, why don't you get these guys'
locker numbers so we can do some checking?

238
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:27,993
No. I have to go home now.
I have to take a bath and burn my clothes.

239
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,447
You have to go?
Ah, too bad. Keep in touch. Bye-bye.

240
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:35,929
I don't wanna go alone. I'm still fragile.

241
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:38,772
Can you take me?

242
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,848
Great. I'll drive.

243
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:57,141
How about that? I always pegged him
as a one-woman vampire.

244
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:15,206
I'm going out, Mom.

245
00:17:21,191 --> 00:17:24,460
I'll be back later, OK?

246
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:27,281
Mom?

247
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:36,517
Daryl! Daryl! Daryl!

248
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:47,546
You understand, in my capacity
as school official,

249
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:51,033
this search is completely unauthorized,
and I, I cannot condone it.

250
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:54,374
Fine, your butt's covered.
Wanna grab a locker?

251
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:56,584
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

252
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:01,625
OK, Eric, let's see
what's on your annoying little mind.

253
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,483
Nothing in here but back issues
of Scientific American,

254
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,519
Ooh, I haven't read this one.

255
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:13,010
Nothing remarkable here.

256
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:15,433
Guys.

257
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:20,148
Your friend Chris Epps' locker.

258
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,552
Grey's Anatomy,
Mortician's Desk Reference,

259
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:27,533
Robicheaux's
Guide to Muscles and Tendons,

260
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:30,346
I think it's fair to say
Chris is involved.

261
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:33,491
He's into corpses, all right,
but we still don't know why.

262
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,544
Yes, we do.

263
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:44,765
<i># I guess you say</i>

264
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,521
<i># What can make me feel this way?</i>

265
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,274
<i># My girl</i>

266
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:54,123
<i># Talkin' 'bout my girl</i>

267
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:56,323
<i># My girl!</i>

268
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:59,364
- How's my baby?
- She's not your baby.

269
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,920
She's not gonna be anybody's baby
if we don't finish her soon.

270
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:07,742
- I'm working on it!
- So am I, friend. So am I.

271
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:20,307
- Any sign of our suspects?
- Not yet.

272
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:24,813
I don't get it. Why would
anybody wanna make a girl?

273
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:27,877
You mean when there's so many
pre-made ones just laying around?

274
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:30,780
- The things we do for love.
- Love has nothing to do with this.

275
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,610
Maybe not, but I'll tell you this:

276
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:35,127
people don't fall in love with
what's right in front of them.

277
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:37,874
People want the dream.
What they can't have.

278
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,729
The more unattainable, the more attractive.

279
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:46,918
And for Eric, the unattainable
would include everyone that's alive.

280
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,125
Eric's sick enough
to do something like this, but

281
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:52,650
what about Chris?
He seems like a "human" person.

282
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:56,495
I don't know. That thing
with his brother was really hard on him.

283
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:58,910
And he talked about death a lot.

284
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:01,639
Maybe he just wanted
to get one-up on it.

285
00:20:01,674 --> 00:20:03,717
But it's not doable.

286
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:07,738
I mean, making someone from scraps,
actually making them live.

287
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:12,279
If it is, my science project's
definitely coming in second this year.

288
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,890
And speaking of love...

289
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:17,948
We were talking about
the re-animation of dead tissue.

290
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:20,184
Do I deconstruct your segues? Huh?

291
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:22,131
Hey.

292
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,370
Oh, yes. Hello.

293
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:27,299
- Still no sign of our mad doctors?
- What?

294
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:30,900
Oh, corpses. Yes, evil. Very good.

295
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:34,324
- Did you bring it? Tomorrow...
- Very good.

296
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,865
OK, Giles, just remember. "I feel a thing.
You feel a thing." But personalize it.

297
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,994
- Personalize it?
- She's a technopagan, right?

298
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:44,445
Ask her to bless your laptop.

299
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:47,827
- Have fun.
- What? Oh, don't...

300
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:50,258
- Best of luck.
- ...leave.

301
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,960
- Good morning, Rupert.
- Ms Calendar?

302
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:55,863
Oh, no, please, call me Jenny.
"Ms Calendar" is my father.

303
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:57,740
Jenny, then.

304
00:20:57,775 --> 00:21:02,122
You know, uh, Jenny,
um, would it appear indecorous...

305
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:04,560
No, not indecorous. Uh...

306
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:05,707
Yeah?

307
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:09,674
Well... Oh, dear. I-I, um...

308
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:13,287
Rupert, look, I've got to get inside
and set up the lab.

309
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,265
- What I'm proposing is...
- Ah!

310
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,892
I gotta go! Sorry.

311
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,902
Idiot!

312
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:27,399
Hey. Listen, if it's important,
why don't you just tell me at the game?

313
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:31,137
Game? Oh, you're going
to the football game?

314
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:34,037
- Yeah. You seem surprised.
- No, no, uh...

315
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:36,942
I-I-I-I-I just assumed that
you-you-you spent your evenings

316
00:21:36,943 --> 00:21:39,943
downloading incantations
and, and casting bones.

317
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:42,428
On game night? Are you nuts?

318
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:45,242
- You're going too, right?
- Oh, of course.

319
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:48,400
- Always. Always do.
- So we should just go together.

320
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:50,460
Look, I could pick you up after school,

321
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:52,717
and we'll grab a bite to eat
on the way if you like.

322
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:54,873
How do you feel about Mexican?

323
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:58,221
Good! OK! And whatever it is you wanna
tell me, you can just tell me then.

324
00:21:58,222 --> 00:22:00,081
- OK?
- OK.

325
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:03,155
Uh, tonight, then.

326
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:07,537
That went well.

327
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:09,674
I think.

328
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:15,590
I still don't get how Chris could do it.

329
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:18,548
I mean, arresting cell deterioration
is one thing, but...

330
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,892
"Hello. I wanna get ahead,"

331
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,106
Maybe an electrical current
combined with an adrenaline boost.

332
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:29,543
"For the love of God,
can somebody scratch my nose?"

333
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:33,388
Well, it's official. Chris and Eric
didn't come to school today.

334
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:36,345
- That's no coincidence.
- Maybe they finished their project.

335
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,895
God. What if it worked? What if
that poor girl is walking around?

336
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,689
- Poor girls, technically.
- What could she be thinking?

337
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:45,405
And... what are they gonna... do with her?

338
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,377
I don't think we have
to worry about that just yet.

339
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:51,925
I spoke to a press person this morning
about the remains.

340
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:54,306
The police have finished
sorting through them and

341
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:56,961
apparently, they found
three heads in the dumpster.

342
00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:58,950
- They only had three girls.
- Precisely.

343
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:01,979
So they don't have the whole,
uh, package?

344
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:07,005
Heads must be no good.
Huh. I found 'em attractive enough.

345
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:10,752
Well, obviously
I'm not as sick as Chris and Eric.

346
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:13,358
Based on what the police have put together,

347
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:17,133
I would say they're one step short
of completing their masterpiece.

348
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:20,460
One step...

349
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:26,172
We're running out of time.

350
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:30,362
If we wait too long, the onset of atrophy
in the limbs will be irreversible.

351
00:23:30,397 --> 00:23:33,883
We can turn up the current.
That'll buy us a day at least.

352
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:36,753
We will lose the body
if we don't attach a head soon!

353
00:23:36,788 --> 00:23:40,570
- We have time.
- We don't!

354
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:43,345
The crash with the girls was lucky.

355
00:23:43,437 --> 00:23:46,194
But we can't just keep waiting around
for another lucky accident

356
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:49,667
to drop a head in our laps.

357
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:53,273
You know what we have to do.

358
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:57,182
- Hell, it's just one lousy girl.
- I won't do it.

359
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:58,758
I...

360
00:23:58,793 --> 00:24:02,191
I can't... kill anyone.

361
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,246
Please... understand.

362
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,475
I-I can't do that.

363
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:15,883
- Please don't make me.
- But you gave me your word.

364
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:18,846
You promised me, little brother,

365
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:23,995
that I wouldn't be alone.

366
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:31,204
The body is perfect. And if we harvest
a head tonight, she'll be ready by sunrise.

367
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:35,116
When you brought me back,
you promised you'd take care of me.

368
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,362
I need this, Chris.

369
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:40,163
I need someone.

370
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:46,543
Please don't ask me to do this.
Don't ask me to take a life.

371
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,551
I tried to tell him. If you take a life
in order to make a life,

372
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:53,130
the whole thing is a wash.
No harm, no foul.

373
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:55,678
Maybe you could... you could go out.

374
00:24:55,713 --> 00:24:57,416
- No!
- Let people know.

375
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,222
They can't see me!

376
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:04,374
Chris, you've always been smarter than me.

377
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:07,129
You were always the brains.

378
00:25:07,504 --> 00:25:11,584
You're the only one who can help me now.

379
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:15,140
Third and long, seconds to go.

380
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:17,639
Where do you throw?

381
00:25:17,674 --> 00:25:20,020
Where do you throw?

382
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:22,347
Number five.

383
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:25,654
Daryl's gonna drive.

384
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:29,034
Help me, brother.

385
00:25:32,438 --> 00:25:35,191
Thank you.

386
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:38,580
Show me!

387
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:48,279
- This one!
- Ha-ha.

388
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:51,272
A man of taste.

389
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:57,256
<i># My girl</i>

390
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:01,638
<i># Talkin' 'bout</i>

391
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,015
<i># My girl</i>

392
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:06,560
<i># My girl</i>

393
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:09,928
I checked the obits. Nothing
that would make a likely candidate.

394
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:13,045
They seem kinda picky for guys
who had three heads to begin with.

395
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,601
Formaldehyde.

396
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:17,196
- Come again?
- Formaldehyde. Oh, yes, yes, yes,

397
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:20,630
yes, of course! It accelerates
neural decay in the brain cells.

398
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:24,799
After a couple of days they're useless.
They're gonna need something really fresh.

399
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,788
- How fresh?
- As fresh as possible.

400
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,344
Buffy, you don't think that they would...

401
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:32,658
I think anyone who
cuts dead girls into little pieces

402
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:35,343
does not get the benefit of any doubt.
I wanna end this thing now.

403
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:37,575
- I second that.
- OK, fine. You guys go to Eric's,

404
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,933
- we can go to Chris', and meet up.
- I'm supposed to be at the...

405
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:44,484
- "big game". I-I believe it's called.
- Fine. Go ahead. We'll take care of this.

406
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,304
- Yes, but shouldn't I... I'm...
- OK, then why don't we all meet there?

407
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:50,663
Fine. Yes.

408
00:26:50,998 --> 00:26:53,269
Buffy?

409
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:57,829
Don't be too hard on Chris.
I mean, he's not a vampire.

410
00:26:57,881 --> 00:27:02,121
No, he's just a ghoul.

411
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:13,028
Hi. Um, I'm a friend of Chris's.
I kinda need to talk to him.

412
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:15,072
D'you know if he's home?

413
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:29,328
So, is he home?

414
00:27:29,363 --> 00:27:34,148
Westbury game. November 17th, '95.

415
00:27:34,307 --> 00:27:39,003
Daryl rushed 185 yards that night.
Four TDs.

416
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,388
He was MVP and he made
all-city that season.

417
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,824
Yeah, that was a great one.
But is Chris home?

418
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:50,505
I don't know. Is today a school day?

419
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,248
Oh, watch! Watch this move!

420
00:27:52,457 --> 00:27:56,782
Daryl takes a kick-off.
He sheds one, two, three defenders.

421
00:27:56,838 --> 00:28:01,590
And he breaks into the open field
for a 95-yard touchdown.

422
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,225
He would have been 19 next week.

423
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,148
Cordelia.

424
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:27,096
- Cordelia, 'you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be right out.

425
00:29:33,764 --> 00:29:37,549
Oh, God. Chris, you scared me.

426
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:40,121
What are you doing in here?

427
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:43,386
Is something wrong?

428
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:53,052
- Joy, Lisa, where's Cordelia?
- Cordelia has a game to think about.

429
00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:56,195
She doesn't need losers like you.

430
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,902
I'm sorry. What did you say?

431
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:08,186
- Are you OK?
- Oh, my God, Buffy.

432
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:09,962
Don't worry. He's gone.

433
00:30:09,964 --> 00:30:12,246
I was on my way down to the field
when Chris came in

434
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:15,827
- and all of a sudden someone jumped me.
- Shh! Quiet down. Relax. Take it easy.

435
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:19,768
That's the fight song. Oh, my God,

436
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:21,956
it's time for the cheerleader pyramid
at mid-field. I've gotta go.

437
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:24,129
- Are you sure you're OK to go out there?
- Yeah, you don't understand.

438
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,089
I have to go. I'm the apex!

439
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,056
Chris?

440
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:37,770
I know what you're trying to do.

441
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:40,065
You and Eric.

442
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:43,729
I know about the bodies from the cemetery.

443
00:30:44,487 --> 00:30:47,200
But you haven't hurt anyone yet.

444
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:56,178
Look, I know what it's like
to lose someone that you're close to.

445
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:58,590
But that's no excuse.

446
00:30:58,882 --> 00:31:02,981
- What you're doing is wrong.
- I have to do this for him.

447
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,580
- He needs someone.
- Who? Eric?

448
00:31:07,581 --> 00:31:09,700
He needs industrial-strength therapy!

449
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:13,071
He always... looked out for me.

450
00:31:13,903 --> 00:31:16,462
Stood up for me.

451
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:20,528
He's all alone.

452
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:24,643
Everybody loved him...
and now he's all alone.

453
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:27,695
Who are you talking...

454
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,153
Oh, my God.

455
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:33,805
You promised me!

456
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,371
You promised!

457
00:31:36,434 --> 00:31:38,837
I wouldn't have to be alone!

458
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:41,226
It's not too late.

459
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:50,750
Nothing's changed.
We can still do this, you and me.

460
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:54,232
Your brother's not the only one
who can create life.

461
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:56,267
What d'you say?

462
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,069
Let's go scare you up a date.

463
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:15,822
Daryl!

464
00:32:18,993 --> 00:32:20,328
Daryl?

465
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,956
Daryl! What...

466
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,504
He's not here. Where else could he be?

467
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:29,809
But... he would never go out.

468
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:34,794
- Unless...
- He's gonna pick up where you left off.

469
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,991
Go, Greenbacks, go! Go, team, go!

470
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:45,018
Go, team, go!

471
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:53,994
I don't know what it is
about football does it for me.

472
00:32:54,291 --> 00:33:01,027
I mean, it lacks the grace of basketball,
the, uh, poetry of baseball.

473
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:06,183
At its best, it's unadorned aggression.
It's such a rugged contest.

474
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:11,614
- Rugged? American football?
- And that's funny because?

475
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:16,397
No, I just think it's rather odd that
a nation that prides itself on its virility

476
00:33:16,432 --> 00:33:19,223
should feel compelled to strap on
40lbs of protective gear

477
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:21,530
just in order to play rugby.

478
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,648
Is this your normal strategy
for a first date:

479
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:27,463
dissing my country's national pastime?

480
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:31,344
Did you just say... "date"?

481
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:34,773
- You noticed that, huh?
- Hi, Ms Calendar. Hi, Giles.

482
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:38,302
- Hey. What's up?
- Eric's was a bust. Nothing there.

483
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:41,156
Nothing much but computer equipment
and a pornography collection

484
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:43,109
so prodigious it even scared me,

485
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:46,138
- Did Buffy get back yet?
- No. Uh, no.

486
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:48,855
Perhaps you should, uh,
circulate nearer the field

487
00:33:48,856 --> 00:33:51,960
and see what you can find.

488
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:55,749
So what's the score?

489
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:20,677
- I don't see her. Do you?
- No.

490
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:25,125
Please, what's going on?

491
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,632
Just take off the blindfold.
I promise I won't scream. I promise.

492
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,361
- She's beautiful.
- No!

493
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,431
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

494
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:41,649
Please, just take off the blindfold.
I promise I won't scream. I promise.

495
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:43,192
Cordelia...

496
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:51,238
Scream all you want.
We're in an abandoned building.

497
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:53,414
Help!

498
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:56,167
OK, that's enough.

499
00:35:57,946 --> 00:36:03,937
You were always good to me,
always noticed me, but I ignored you.

500
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:09,541
I'm sorry. I'm glad I have
a second chance to tell you that.

501
00:36:09,688 --> 00:36:11,690
D-Daryl?

502
00:36:12,191 --> 00:36:15,320
I was thoughtless. I see that now.

503
00:36:15,355 --> 00:36:17,824
But I've changed.

504
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:20,814
I've learned to appreciate
how much it meant...

505
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:23,256
that you wanted to be with me.

506
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:26,335
- We're ready.
- Ready? Ready for what?

507
00:36:26,586 --> 00:36:30,541
You're gonna feel a little pinch,
maybe some discomfort around the neck area.

508
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:34,947
But don't worry. When you wake up
you'll have the body of a 17-year-old.

509
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:38,235
In fact, you'll have the body of several.

510
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:46,443
He was here, Chris. Where did he take her?

511
00:36:46,614 --> 00:36:49,618
- To the rest of the body. To the lab.
- Where is that?

512
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:52,288
- I promised him...
- He'll kill Cordelia!

513
00:36:52,872 --> 00:36:55,231
You can't just
give and take lives like that.

514
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:58,628
It's not your job.

515
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:02,886
He's in the old science lab.
Everything's set up there.

516
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,699
Thank you.

517
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:08,955
Now find Xander and Willow,
and tell them what's going on.

518
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:15,612
Daryl, please. You don't have to do this.

519
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:18,327
We have to, so we can be together.

520
00:37:19,158 --> 00:37:22,188
We'll be together anyway.
I'll be with you, I promise.

521
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:24,165
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

522
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,131
You see anything you like?

523
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:33,404
And when you're finished,
you won't go out, you won't run away,

524
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:35,792
but we can hide together.

525
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:40,032
- Please. Please!
- Sterile enough for government work.

526
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:42,748
No!

527
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:44,879
No! Please!

528
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:49,909
Buffy, help me!

529
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,309
Daryl, listen.
I know what you're doing, OK?

530
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:54,685
- Your brother sent me to stop you.
- He wouldn't do that.

531
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:57,031
- My brother loves me.
- Buffy, they're crazy.

532
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,751
It's OK, Cordelia.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

533
00:37:58,786 --> 00:38:04,096
No, I'm not done with her yet.
I'm not finished!

534
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,415
I won't live alone!

535
00:38:16,654 --> 00:38:19,684
- I'm gettin' outta here!
- You have to help me.

536
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,812
Let go!

537
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:41,939
- Buffy!
- Get Cordelia!

538
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,851
Xander!

539
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:47,613
Get me out of here!

540
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:59,385
Come on, Xander, come on!
Come on! Get it off!

541
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:03,542
Get it off! Get me out of here! Come on!

542
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:14,652
Hurry up!

543
00:39:33,011 --> 00:39:34,847
Daryl!

544
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:38,771
Don't!

545
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:46,928
- Sh-she's mine!
- Daryl!

546
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,958
Daryl!

547
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:53,539
No. We'll be together always. No.

548
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:56,513
Mine.

549
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:16,138
The first time he woke up, after...

550
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:20,777
He said I shouldn't've brought him back.

551
00:40:20,812 --> 00:40:23,538
I was just trying to look out for him.

552
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,424
Like... he would have done for me.

553
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:32,243
I saw the fire. I figured you'd be here.

554
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:35,288
- Is everyone OK?
- Yeah.

555
00:40:35,472 --> 00:40:37,682
We're OK.

556
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,030
- Sorry about all this.
- It's OK.

557
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:46,580
Although a good rule of thumb
for a first date is:

558
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:49,893
don't do anything so exciting
it'll be hard to top on a second date.

559
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:52,871
Believe it or not, since I've moved here
to live on top of the Hellmouth,

560
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:56,862
the events of this evening
actually qualify as a slow night.

561
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:01,706
Did you just say "second date"?

562
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:04,115
You noticed that, huh?

563
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:12,551
Well, I guess that makes it official.
Everybody's paired off.

564
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:17,451
Vampires get dates. Hell, even the
school librarian sees more action than me.

565
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:20,244
You ever think that the world is
a giant game of musical chairs,

566
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:23,038
and the music's stopped and we're
the only ones who don't have a chair?

567
00:41:23,073 --> 00:41:25,541
- All the time.
- Xander.

568
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:29,431
I just wanted to...
thank you for saving my life.

569
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:32,251
What you did in there
was really brave and heroic.

570
00:41:32,252 --> 00:41:34,274
and I just wanted to tell you
if there was anything

571
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:38,584
- I could ever do to...
- Do you mind? We're talkin' here.

572
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:41,813
- So, where were we?
- Wondering why we never get dates.

573
00:41:41,848 --> 00:41:45,229
Yeah. So, why do you think that is?

574
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:52,204
God, the whole thing was so creepy.

575
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,459
But, at the same time, I mean,
he did do it all for his brother.

576
00:41:56,494 --> 00:42:00,214
Sounds like he took it
a little over the edge.

577
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:03,304
- Love makes you do the wacky.
- What?

578
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:06,273
- Crazy stuff.
- Oh.

579
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:11,508
Crazy like a 241-year-old
being jealous of a high-school junior?

580
00:42:11,543 --> 00:42:13,884
Are you 'fessing up?

581
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:18,491
I thought about it.
Maybe it bothers me a little.

582
00:42:18,526 --> 00:42:21,695
- I don't love Xander.
- Yeah, but he's in your life.

583
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,884
He gets to be there when I can't.

584
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:27,640
Take your classes, eat your meals,

585
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:31,569
hear your jokes and complaints.

586
00:42:31,604 --> 00:42:35,394
He gets to see you in the sunlight.

587
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:39,439
I don't look that good in direct light.

588
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:45,402
It'll be morning soon.

589
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:48,421
I should probably go.

590
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:54,539
I could walk you home.
