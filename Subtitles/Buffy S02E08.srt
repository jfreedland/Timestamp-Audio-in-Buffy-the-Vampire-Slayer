1
00:00:00,425 --> 00:00:03,452
In every generation there is a Chosen One,

2
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:06,494
She alone will stand against the vampires,

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:09,469
the demons and the forces of darkness.

4
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:11,810
She is the Slayer.

5
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,972
Can I help you?

6
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:30,654
Rupert Giles. I need to see him.

7
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,281
Mr. Giles, he's our librarian.

8
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:36,952
Next building over,
first door on your left.

9
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,594
You're welcome.

10
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:05,214
Oh, God.

11
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:09,144
Deidre?

12
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,108
Philip.

13
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:23,482
Help! Help! Somebody, please!

14
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:39,218
Must we have this noise
during your callisthenics?

15
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:41,310
It's not noise! It's music!

16
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:45,766
I know music! Music has notes!
This is noise!

17
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:48,622
I'm aerobicising! I must have the beat!

18
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:52,950
Wonderful.
You work on your muscle tone

19
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:55,441
while my brain dribbles out of my ears.

20
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:57,433
Help! Help, please!

21
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:00,443
Help me, somebody, please!

22
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:24,688
Very good. And the rest is silence.

23
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:36,936
<b>"The Dark Age"</b>

24
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:42,365
Time to go to sleep.

25
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,991
I'm on a beach.
But not one of those American beaches.

26
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:59,999
One of those island beaches
where the water's way too blue.

27
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:04,450
And I'm laying on my towel.
And it's just before sunset.

28
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:09,598
- And Gavin Rossdale's massaging my feet.
- Oh, that's good!

29
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:15,500
Uh, I'm in Florence, Italy. I've rented
this scooter that's parked outside.

30
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:18,904
And I'm in a little restaurant eating ziti.

31
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,791
And there are no more tables left...

32
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:24,884
so they have to seat this guy with me,
and it's John Cusack.

33
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,401
Very impressive.
You have such an eye for detail.

34
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:30,016
- 'Cause, with the ziti...
- What are you two up to?

35
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,681
Just having a quick game of
Anywhere But Here.

36
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:35,861
Oh! Amy Yip at the water-slide park.

37
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,969
You never come up with anything new.

38
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:41,565
I'm just not fickle like you two, OK?
I'm constant in my affections.

39
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,279
Amy Yip at the water-slide park.

40
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,708
Do you think Giles ever played
Anywhere But Here when he was in school?

41
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:52,680
Giles lived for school. He's actually
still bitter that there are only 12 grades.

42
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,861
He probably sat in math class thinking

43
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,331
"There should be more math.
This could be mathier"

44
00:04:57,366 --> 00:05:00,156
Come on! You don't think
he ever got restless as a kid?

45
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,799
Are you kidding?
His diapers were tweed.

46
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,078
- Giles!
- Oh. There you are.

47
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:09,648
Hey, morning. Say, is that tweed?

48
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:12,526
What? Oh, yes. Um...

49
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:16,519
- Now, look. Tonight is very important.
- Now that's a surprise!

50
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,749
So, what's on tap tonight
that's so important?

51
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,810
Uprising? Prophesied ritual?
Preordained death-fest?

52
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:26,451
Ah, the old standards.

53
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:30,917
Medical transport is delivering
a monthly supply of blood to the hospital.

54
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:33,688
- Vampire meals-on-wheels.
- Hopefully not.

55
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:36,703
Uh, we'll meet outside the hospital
at 8:30 sharp.

56
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:39,252
- I'll bring the weaponry.
- I'll bring the party mix.

57
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:42,132
- Just don't be late.
- Have I ever let you down?

58
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:45,235
Do you want me to answer that,
or shall I just glare?

59
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,014
- Morning, England.
- Oh, hello, Ms, er... Jenny.

60
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,273
- Feel the passion.
- Willow.

61
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,557
Coughing, not speaking.

62
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:57,126
- Are we still on for tomorrow?
- What's tomorrow?

63
00:05:57,161 --> 00:06:00,209
I'm reviewing some computer basics for the
couple of students who've fallen behind.

64
00:06:00,244 --> 00:06:02,548
Willow's helping out for extra credit.

65
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:05,060
Those poor schlubs
have to attend school on Saturday!

66
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:08,246
9 a.m. OK with you, Xander?

67
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:13,050
Got a bit of schlub on your shoe there.

68
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:15,866
- Cordelia's gonna meet us.
- Ooh, gang, do you hear that?

69
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:19,060
A bonus day of class plus Cordelia!
Mix in a little rectal surgery,

70
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:21,614
and it's my best day ever!

71
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,084
- Walk me to class?
- Pleasure.

72
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:26,759
- Look at them.
- A twosome of cuteness.

73
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:30,773
Can't you just image them getting together?

74
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,800
Oh! Thank you so much
for loaning me the Forester book.

75
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:36,919
- It's wonderful.
- Glad you enjoyed it.

76
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,282
That was so romantic. So... evocative.

77
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:44,466
That edition was my father's.
I must have read it... 20 times.

78
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:47,215
Yeah, you know how you have to,
to dog-ear your favorite pages

79
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,035
- so you can go back to them?
- Uh, uh, what?

80
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,709
Well, I mean, I-I practically had to
fold back every single page.

81
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,546
So finally I just started underlining
all the pages I really wanted to discuss.

82
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,632
- Underlined?
- But then, of course,

83
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,473
I spilt coffee all over it.
I can't even read it.

84
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:03,355
- It's a first edition.
- I'm lying, Rupert.

85
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,428
The book's fine.

86
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:10,121
I just love to see you squirm.

87
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:14,257
Yes, well, I, uh... trust
I gave good... squirm.

88
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:16,859
Did anyone ever tell you
you're a fuddy-duddy?

89
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,862
Nobody ever...
seems to tell me anything else.

90
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,407
Did anyone ever tell you
you're kind of a sexy fuddy-duddy?

91
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:26,916
No. Actually, that-that part
usually gets left out.

92
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,384
I ca-can't imagine why.

93
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:32,756
This weekend.

94
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,218
Would you like to go out?

95
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:38,679
Mm, no, I think I'd like to stay in.

96
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:52,793
- This... Saturday.
- Saturday night.

97
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:58,449
Let's see if I can make you squirm.

98
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:13,561
- Rupert Giles?
- Yes?

99
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,609
Detective Winslow.
You're gonna have to come with me.

100
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,501
Why?

101
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:20,922
There was a homicide on campus last night.

102
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:25,012
The victim had no identification,
but he was carrying this slip of paper...

103
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,590
with your name and address on it.

104
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:30,447
My name?

105
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:33,263
Well, evil just compounds evil,
doesn't it?

106
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:36,050
First I'm sentenced
to a computer tutorial on Saturday,

107
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:38,179
now I have to read some computer book.

108
00:08:38,214 --> 00:08:40,228
There are books on computers?

109
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,702
Isn't the point of computers
to replace books?

110
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:46,873
Cordelia, I'm a little busy right now.

111
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:48,500
Oh, great!

112
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:52,217
Can you help me with a ticket? It's
totally bogus. It was a one-way street.

113
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:54,584
- I was going one way.
- Cordelia!

114
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,910
What? Why does everyone
always yell my name?

115
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:01,682
I'm not deaf.
And... I can take a hint.

116
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:06,463
- What's the hint?
- To come back later.

117
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:09,874
Yeah, when you've visited decaf land.

118
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:17,631
Where do you want me to go?

119
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:28,113
- Have you had your breakfast?
- No.

120
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:30,839
That was probably a good idea.

121
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:37,947
- Do you know him?
- Yes.

122
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:41,307
I mean... I did.

123
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:45,697
His name's Philip Henry.
He was a friend of mine in London.

124
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:47,610
I haven't spoken to him in 20 years.

125
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:52,167
Can you think of any reason
why he might have wanted to contact you?

126
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:54,485
No.

127
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:00,662
Do you know what that is?

128
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:06,279
- The tattoo?
- No.

129
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:10,756
No, I don't.

130
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:19,066
"Don't be late." Sheesh!

131
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:38,523
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey.

132
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:44,871
All's well that ends
with cute ER doctors, I always say.

133
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,922
Since when do doctors take deliveries?

134
00:10:55,957 --> 00:10:58,224
See ya!

135
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:16,685
Hey! No samplin' the product.

136
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,714
- Angel!
- Buffy. Look out!

137
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,995
- How did you know about this?
- It's delivery day.

138
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:04,005
Everybody knows about this.

139
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,763
They only ruined one bag.

140
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:10,740
Do you think you can make sure
the hospital gets the rest?

141
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:16,686
Thanks. I'm worried about Giles.

142
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:19,515
- He was supposed to meet me here.
- Maybe he's late.

143
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,201
Giles? Who counts tardiness as,
like, the eighth deadly sin?

144
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:26,771
You're right. Go.

145
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:45,122
Buffy. It's late. Uh, you all right?

146
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,158
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

147
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:49,319
Yes. No, I'm fine. Fine.

148
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,689
I'm, er... I'm rather busy at the moment

149
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,739
so... I'll see you on Monday
at-at school.

150
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,573
Giles, did you forget?

151
00:12:57,608 --> 00:13:01,793
The hospital, vampires,
handy carry-out packets of blood?

152
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:04,886
Oh! Yes, uh...

153
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:06,959
Are you all right? Were you hurt?

154
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,634
No. I mean, my feelings a little.

155
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:12,838
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing. Nothing's wrong.

156
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:17,165
I'm just in... the, uh,
middle of something extremely important.

157
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:21,109
And... I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have to say good night now.

158
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:28,279
I'm sorry to disturb you.

159
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:32,371
Uh, I realize it's, uh,
five in the morning there, um...

160
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:36,179
Uh, I-I'm trying to reach Diedre Page.

161
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,957
My name is Rupert Giles,
uh, uh, she knows me.

162
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:42,107
It's, it's very important.

163
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:49,661
I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know.

164
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:53,313
When did she, er... pass away?

165
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:57,915
Oh. That recently.

166
00:13:58,124 --> 00:14:01,834
Um... Yes. Yes, um...

167
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:05,000
We were friends when we were young.

168
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:09,813
My condolences.

169
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:06,218
So.

170
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:09,230
You're back.

171
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:24,641
This isn't right. School on a Saturday.
It throws off my internal clock.

172
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:26,832
When are we gonna need computers
for real life anyway?

173
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:30,560
Hmm, let's see. There's
home, school, work, games...

174
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:33,677
You know, computers are on the way out.
I think paper's gonna make a big comeback.

175
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:35,571
- And the abacus.
- Yeah, you know,

176
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:38,381
you don't see enough abaci.

177
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:45,711
Hi, guys. The first thing
we're gonna do is... Buffy?

178
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:49,508
- Huh? Did I fall asleep already?
- You miss your friends.

179
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:52,591
Sit here, Buff. Demilitarize the zone
between me and Cordelia.

180
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:54,363
Yeah, and de-louse him
while you're at it.

181
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:56,986
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you for a second.

182
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:59,568
- Is something wrong?
- Is there some crisis

183
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:03,096
that requires instant action?
Very far from here?

184
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:07,724
- It's Giles.
- Ooh. He's all right, isn't he?

185
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,671
I don't know. He didn't show up
when he was supposed to last night.

186
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:17,035
And then, when I went over to his place,
he was acting... well, very anti-Giles.

187
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,497
He wouldn't let me in.
And he looked really bad.

188
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:23,289
I think he might have been...

189
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:28,703
- I think he was drinking.
- He was home alone drinking?

190
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:32,970
- But... tea, right?
- It wasn't tea, Will.

191
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:35,389
Yep. Yep, I knew this would happen.

192
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:38,869
Nobody can be wound as straight and narrow
as Giles without a dark side erupting.

193
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:43,118
My Uncle Rory was the stodgiest
taxidermist you've ever met, by day.

194
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:46,604
By night, it was
booze, whores and fur flyin'.

195
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:49,428
- Were there whores?
- He was alone.

196
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:51,340
Give it time.

197
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:54,678
So, none of you guys have noticed
anything different lately?

198
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:56,657
- No.
- Not really.

199
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:59,142
- Uh, you haven't seen anything weird?
- Nope.

200
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:02,966
No. He seemed perfectly normal yesterday
when I saw him talking to the police.

201
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,205
And you waited till now
to tell us this because?

202
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,147
- I didn't think it was important.
- We understand. It wasn't about you.

203
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:13,323
What were the police
talking to him about?

204
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:16,178
Oh, don't tell me.
I know this one. Um...

205
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:18,285
Something about...

206
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,079
a homicide.

207
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:22,774
That's it. I'm calling him right now.

208
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:24,436
- I know you. You ran that costume shop.
- Oh, I'm pleased you remember.

209
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:27,985
You sold me that dress for Halloween
and nearly got us all killed!

210
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,766
But you looked great.

211
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,865
- So now we're even?
- I'll let you know when we're even.

212
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,771
- What are you doing here?
- Snooping around.

213
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,492
- Honesty. Nice touch.
- It's one of my virtues.

214
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,851
- Not really.
- I've got a great idea.

215
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:52,143
Why don't I just call the police
and have you arrested

216
00:19:52,144 --> 00:19:54,727
for breaking and entering, and then
I can get back to my fun Saturday?

217
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,966
Yes, the police. Well,
they'll have all those questions

218
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:59,600
and they'll really need Rupert
to answer them all.

219
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:02,871
- You know Giles.
- We go back.

220
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:06,643
Way back. You don't happen
to know where he is, do you?

221
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,879
- Hello.
- Giles, it's me.

222
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:27,447
Buffy, unless this is an emergency,
I'll see you on Monday.

223
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,658
What's the Mark of Eyghon?

224
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,543
- Giles?
- Cat got his tongue?

225
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:39,155
I'm in your office with someone who claims
to be an old friend of yours. Ethan Rayne?

226
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,025
He's there with you?

227
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:45,955
Listen, Buffy, you're... You're
in grave danger while Ethan's there.

228
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,094
I want you to put the phone down and get
out of the library as soon as possible.

229
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,500
I'm not going anywhere
until you give me some answers!

230
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:56,151
Buffy!

231
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:12,494
Ethan!

232
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:14,981
Don't let him get away!

233
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:38,171
I'm not gonna get close enough
to feel his pulse, but... he looks dead.

234
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:41,107
Except for the walking
and attacking Buffy part.

235
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:42,889
He's dead.

236
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:45,035
Sorry, Philip. Really, I am.

237
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:46,994
- Is everyone all right?
- Super!

238
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:49,290
- I kicked a guy.
- We're OK.

239
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,339
The dead guy here
interrupted our tutorial.

240
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:55,041
Been meaning to thank you for that.

241
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:03,595
- It can't be.
- Yes, it can.

242
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:08,814
- Hello, Ripper.
- I thought I told you to leave town.

243
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:13,108
You did. I didn't. Shop's lease
is paid till the end of the month.

244
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,774
Why did he call him Ripper?

245
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:19,273
You should have left when I told you.

246
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:21,802
- Oh.
- Giles!

247
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:25,364
You put these people in danger.
The people I care about.

248
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,012
If you cared so much about them,
why didn't you leave town?

249
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,475
You've been having the dreams. I know.
I have. We both know what's coming.

250
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:37,376
What dreams? What is going on here?

251
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:41,217
- Tell her, Ripper.
- Giles!

252
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:45,438
Jenny!

253
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,928
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

254
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,550
I'm gonna be in therapy till I'm 30.

255
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:17,797
Where's Ethan?

256
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,211
Where'd he go?

257
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,266
Are you all right, Jenny?

258
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,319
Careful. Can you stand?

259
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:31,758
I think so.

260
00:23:31,874 --> 00:23:35,220
This is what happens
when you have school on Saturday.

261
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,317
Lean on me.

262
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:41,891
It'll be all right.

263
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,479
- Promise?
- I promise.

264
00:23:46,822 --> 00:23:50,405
I believe you.

265
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:04,588
- How's your head?
- Throbbing.

266
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:06,728
I lost Ethan.

267
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,453
Giles, what's going on?

268
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:14,386
It's complicated, Buffy.
And quite frankly, it's private.

269
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:18,778
I don't care from private.
I care from dead guys attacking us.

270
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:21,040
I care from you lost weekending
in your apartment.

271
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,050
I wasn't...

272
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:25,553
I was just trying to find a solution.

273
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:27,868
Giles, share.
What is the Mark of Eyghon?

274
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:29,319
Hey!

275
00:24:29,354 --> 00:24:31,378
This is not your battle.

276
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:35,050
And as your Watcher, I'm telling
you unequivocally to stay out of it!

277
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:41,380
- I have to get Jenny home.
- Mm. Thank you.

278
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,593
We have work to do.

279
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,813
Will, I want you to find out
anything and everything you can

280
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:01,425
- about the Mark of Eyghon.
- I'll try the Net.

281
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,678
But Mark of Eyghon sounds like
Giles-and-his-books sort of deal.

282
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,051
Then we hit the books.

283
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:11,060
Xander, how do you feel about digging
through some of Giles' personal files

284
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:13,671
- and seeing what you can find?
- I feel pretty good about it.

285
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:16,922
Does that make me a sociopath? Nah!

286
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,429
- What?
- What about me? I care about Giles.

287
00:25:24,652 --> 00:25:26,757
Work with Xander.

288
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,366
- When I say "care", I-I mean...
- Cordelia!

289
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:31,205
OK, OK!

290
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:37,444
Thanks for bringing me here.

291
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:40,950
I'm not quite ready
to be home alone just yet.

292
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:53,445
Jenny, uh...

293
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,875
I'm so very sorry about all of this.

294
00:25:58,835 --> 00:26:01,176
I, er...

295
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:04,905
I never meant for you
to be involved in-in...

296
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,195
any of this.

297
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:10,126
So I got involved.

298
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:14,906
It's what happens
when two people... get involved.

299
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:25,444
I really am, however,
gonna have to get you home.

300
00:26:25,796 --> 00:26:28,187
It's not, uh...

301
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:32,594
Well, I'm... not a very safe person
to be around at the moment.

302
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:35,683
Nothing's safe in this world, Rupert.

303
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:39,205
Don't you know that by now?

304
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,521
It's not Egyptian, it's Etruscan!

305
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,812
Mistaken for Egyptian
by the design pattern.

306
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:51,317
But any fool can see
it predates their iconology.

307
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:54,292
Look, the Mark of Eyghon,
worn by his initiates.

308
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:58,499
"Eyghon, also called the sleepwalker,
can only exist in this reality...

309
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,249
by possessing an unconscious host."

310
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:05,799
"Temporary possession imbues
the host with a euphoric feeling of power."

311
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,434
Yeah, but what about not temporary?

312
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:11,882
"'Unless the proper rituals are observed,
the possession is permanent,

313
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:14,894
and Eyghon will be born
from within the host."

314
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,907
- I'm guessing eww.
- Wait. Hey, listen.

315
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:21,494
"Once called, Eyghon can also
take possession of the dead,

316
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:24,871
but its demonic energy
soon disintegrates the host

317
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:29,496
and it must jump to the nearest dead or
unconscious person to continue living."

318
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:31,967
I still don't get
what this has to do with Giles.

319
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,353
I don't know about Giles,
but ancient sects used to...

320
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:37,903
induce possession for
bacchanals and-and orgies.

321
00:27:37,938 --> 00:27:40,756
OK. Giles and orgies in the same sentence.

322
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:43,486
- I could have lived without that one.
- Wait a minute.

323
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:45,554
The dead guy's all puddly now.

324
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:49,538
So the demon's gone.
There was no one dead to jump into.

325
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,444
I mean, we're all not dead, right?

326
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:54,833
No. No one dead.

327
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:57,543
But someone unconscious.

328
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:06,905
- What was that?
- What was what?

329
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:10,593
I thought I heard something.

330
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:13,019
I didn't.

331
00:28:13,054 --> 00:28:15,627
Here.

332
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:19,029
Drink that and then I'll...
drive you home.

333
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:22,627
You could take me home...

334
00:28:24,075 --> 00:28:27,372
or you could take advantage
of me in my weakened state.

335
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:29,592
Thank you, operator.

336
00:28:29,627 --> 00:28:33,302
There's no answer at Ms Calendar's
and Giles' phone is out of order.

337
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:36,084
I'm gonna go over there.

338
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:39,285
Jenny, um...

339
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,745
I'm, I'm really very attracted t-to you.

340
00:28:42,746 --> 00:28:44,900
- Good.
- But, um...

341
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:47,236
Now really isn't the right time.

342
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:50,636
Oh, there's never been a better time.

343
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:00,395
It's not right.
I would be taking advantage.

344
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:04,993
God, you just don't change, do you?

345
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:06,622
What?

346
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:09,638
"It's not right. It wouldn't be proper."

347
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:12,707
"People might get hurt."

348
00:29:12,742 --> 00:29:15,422
You're like a woman, Ripper.

349
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:18,104
You cry at every funeral.

350
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:23,176
You never had the strength for me.

351
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:27,165
You don't deserve me.

352
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,370
But guess what?
You've got me...

353
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:35,744
under your skin.

354
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,329
Was it good for you?

355
00:29:48,683 --> 00:29:52,355
Oh, you never had the stomach.
But that's OK,

356
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:55,021
'cause I'm about to rip it out!

357
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:10,787
Back off!

358
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:17,015
Three down, two to go.

359
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,089
Be seein' ya!

360
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:31,184
- Are you all right?
- Jenny. Oh, God.

361
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,991
- Giles, how do we stop this?
- Oh, God. What have I done?

362
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:35,789
Talk to me!

363
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,418
Giles, you're scaring me.

364
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:42,115
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Be Giles.

365
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,848
Come on, we fight monsters.
This is what we do.

366
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:48,350
They show up, they scare us, I beat 'em up
and they go away. This isn't any different!

367
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:49,595
It is different.

368
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:52,855
- Because you don't know how to stop it?
- Because I created it.

369
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,982
Did you find anything?

370
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:59,736
The most meticulous banking
and phone records you've ever seen.

371
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:01,993
And, um... this.

372
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,874
That's Giles?

373
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:05,880
I was 21.

374
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,390
Studying history at Oxford.

375
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:11,423
And, of course, the occult by night.

376
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,865
I hated it.

377
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:20,086
The tedious grind of study, the...
overwhelming pressure of my destiny.

378
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:22,605
I dropped out. Went to London.

379
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:27,658
Fell in with the worst crowd
that would have me.

380
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,794
We practiced magics.

381
00:31:31,463 --> 00:31:34,446
Small stuff, for pleasure or gain.

382
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:39,453
Then Ethan and I discovered something...

383
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:42,081
bigger.

384
00:31:42,122 --> 00:31:44,791
Eyghon.

385
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:46,804
Yes.

386
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:51,580
One of us would, um...
go into a deep sleep...

387
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:55,327
and the others would, uh...
summon him.

388
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:58,379
It was an extraordinary high.

389
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,900
God, we were fools.

390
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:07,770
- And you couldn't control it.
- One of us, Randall...

391
00:32:08,457 --> 00:32:10,791
He lost control.

392
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:17,359
Eyghon took him whole. We tried
to exorcise the demon from Randall...

393
00:32:17,989 --> 00:32:20,993
but it killed him.

394
00:32:23,632 --> 00:32:27,238
We killed him.

395
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:32,331
We thought we were free
of the demon after that.

396
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:36,280
But now he's back.

397
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:41,281
- And, one by one, he will kill us all.
- Three down, two to go.

398
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:46,105
Then it's going after Ethan.
I better beat it there.

399
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,794
- We'd better.
- I'd better.

400
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:53,841
Giles, you're barely mobile
and speed is of the serious essence here.

401
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:59,144
I don't know how to stop it
without killing Jenny.

402
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:01,418
I've got the guys working on it.

403
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:06,479
I'll, um... try to contain it
until we figure something.

404
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:09,995
Buffy.

405
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,123
I'm sorry.

406
00:33:14,748 --> 00:33:17,637
I know.

407
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:25,748
Ethan?

408
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:32,079
Ethan!

409
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:35,980
Giles told me everything.

410
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:39,280
Look, it's coming for you.

411
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,018
And you came to protect me.
I'm touched.

412
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:45,877
Don't worry. It's nothing personal.

413
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:48,162
To protect Giles, I have to protect you.

414
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:51,626
How does Ripper inspire such goodness?

415
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:55,352
- 'Cause he's Giles.
- And I'm not.

416
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:59,050
- Still, lucky me.
- Hm. Lucky you.

417
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:01,129
Well, we can't run. Eyghon will find us.

418
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:05,113
- This mark's like a homing beacon.
- It's OK. I'm not much into running.

419
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:07,859
- Aren't we manly?
- One of us is.

420
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,633
You're gonna hide till it's over.

421
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,406
- Excellent plan.
- Is there a way into the back?

422
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:15,259
Uh, there's a back door.
It's locked. I think it's solid.

423
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:17,831
We'll set up there. Let's go.

424
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:20,440
Oh, no. Please.

425
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,665
Ladies first.

426
00:34:33,928 --> 00:34:36,989
Wakey wakey. You're missing all the fun.

427
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:39,980
- What fun?
- Your initiation.

428
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,725
You know what? I'm not real interested
in joining your club.

429
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,052
Too late. I already voted you in.

430
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:50,743
You know, I hope you're not
taking this personally, Buffy.

431
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:54,730
I actually kind of like you.
It's just that I like myself a lot more.

432
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,305
If you think of it karmically, this is,
this is really big for your soul, you know.

433
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,221
Taking my place with the demon,
giving... so that others may live.

434
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:07,574
I'm gonna kill you.
Will that blow the karma thing?

435
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:13,832
Sweet child.
Now this may sting a little, just at first.

436
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:19,715
But don't worry, that'll go away
once the searing pain kicks in.

437
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:24,242
You can go ahead and scream if you like.

438
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:30,201
We have to figure out how to
kill this thing and we need to do it fast.

439
00:35:30,236 --> 00:35:32,112
- Uh... hot lava.
- That's for a heretic.

440
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,051
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, OK. Uh...

441
00:35:37,086 --> 00:35:39,363
Oo, oo! 'Bury a potato!'

442
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:42,881
No, that's for warts.
Who writes this stuff?

443
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:45,144
I've got the solution right here.

444
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:48,592
"To kill a demon, cut off its head."

445
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:51,899
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah! We'll, uh, find
Ms. Calendar, then we'll decapitate her.

446
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:54,391
Hey! She'll be the first headless
computer teacher in school.

447
00:35:54,392 --> 00:35:56,591
- You think anybody'll notice?
- Do you know what you need, Xander,

448
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:58,645
besides a supply of acne cream?

449
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,371
- A brain.
- That's it!

450
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:04,242
12 years of you and I'm snappin'!

451
00:36:04,243 --> 00:36:06,559
I don't care if you're a girl.
I'm throwin' down. Come on!

452
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:09,821
I've seen you fight.
And don't think I can't take you!

453
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:11,616
Give it your best shot!

454
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:13,123
Hey!!!

455
00:36:13,158 --> 00:36:16,270
We don't have time for this!
Our friends are in trouble!

456
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:19,642
Now, we have to put our heads together
and, and get them out of it!

457
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:25,481
And if you two aren't with me 110%,
then get the hell out of my library!

458
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:30,308
- We're sorry.
- We'll be good.

459
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:36,197
OK. Now, we've done the research.

460
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:38,649
We just have to figure out
how to use it.

461
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:41,472
Oh, hey! Why don't we find another
dead body for the demon to jump into?

462
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:43,473
Yes! At the cemetery!

463
00:36:43,508 --> 00:36:47,513
That won't kill the demon.
It'll only give it a change of scenery.

464
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:55,265
Oh. Oh! Oh, I've got it! I've got it!

465
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,705
She's good.

466
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:02,161
Hmm. I think
I missed my calling as an artist.

467
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:05,134
Ethan, listen to me.
This is a bad idea.

468
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:07,211
You're dealing with
something very dangerous.

469
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:09,863
But it will get Eyghon off my scent.

470
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:17,046
Now relax. I'm finished with you.
This is for me.

471
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:50,171
Ethan? No. No!

472
00:37:56,122 --> 00:38:00,797
Well, I hate to mutilate and run, but...

473
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:23,873
It's your time.

474
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:55,288
Eyghon! Take me.

475
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,929
Buffy, get out of here.

476
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:02,218
No! No!

477
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:14,809
I've been waiting a long time to do this.

478
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:28,802
- He's killing her.
- No, trust me. This is gonna work.

479
00:39:35,979 --> 00:39:37,818
Jenny!

480
00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:10,401
- Jenny?
- Rupert.

481
00:40:11,348 --> 00:40:13,060
You knew that
if the demon was in trouble

482
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:15,011
it was gonna jump
into the nearest dead person.

483
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,872
- I put it in danger.
- And it jumped.

484
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:21,695
Well, I've had a demon inside me
for a couple hundred years...

485
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,233
just waitin' for a good fight.

486
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:28,341
- Winner and still champion.
- I think that Ethan guy disappeared again.

487
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:31,239
Darn. I really wanted
to hit him till he bled.

488
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:34,893
Well, at least it's over.

489
00:40:44,815 --> 00:40:47,042
You know what the worst thing is?
I was saving up for some

490
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,577
very important shoes.

491
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,276
And now I have to blow my entire allowance
to get this stupid tattoo removed.

492
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:54,320
Let's just hope
my mom doesn't see it first.

493
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:57,205
Puttin' that demon into Angel
was pretty brill, Will.

494
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,353
I wasn't sure it was gonna work.

495
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:01,379
- But it did.
- Like a charm.

496
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:03,967
Hey! Maybe you should consider
a career as a Watcher.

497
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:06,397
Oh, no. I don't think
I could handle the stress.

498
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:08,473
And the dental plan is crap.

499
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,267
I don't see how Giles does it.

500
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,999
I don't think he has a choice.

501
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:20,593
Jenny. Jenny.

502
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:23,046
Rupert. Hi.

503
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:27,803
Uh... I tried to call you last night.
See how you were.

504
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:30,449
Yeah, I-I-I, uh...
I left my phone off the hook.

505
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:33,733
I seem to need a lot of sleep lately.

506
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:35,996
But, but you're al-alright?
Is, is, is there anything you need?

507
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:38,233
No, I'm fine.

508
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:41,468
I mean, I'm not...
running around, wind-in-my-hair,

509
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:45,361
the-hills-are-alive-with-
the-sound-of-music fine, but...

510
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:48,652
I'm coping.

511
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:52,307
- I would like to help.
- I know.

512
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:55,903
Perhaps we could, um, talk sometime, um...

513
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:58,647
Dinner, or, or a drink?

514
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:03,064
- When you're feeling stronger.
- Sure. Some time.

515
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,712
Yeah. Some time.

516
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:12,163
I better get to class.

517
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:15,427
Of course.

518
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:28,578
Hey.

519
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,636
Is... she OK?

520
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,909
- The hills are not alive.
- I'm sorry to hear that... I think.

521
00:42:38,944 --> 00:42:41,926
I don't think
she'll ever really forgive me.

522
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:44,540
Maybe she shouldn't.

523
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:46,949
Maybe you should.

524
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:50,105
I never wanted you to see that side of me.

525
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,721
I'm not gonna lie to you.

526
00:42:52,756 --> 00:42:55,211
It was scary.

527
00:42:55,246 --> 00:42:58,158
I'm so used to you
being a grown-up and...

528
00:42:58,737 --> 00:43:01,428
then I find out that you're a person.

529
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:03,787
Most grown-ups are.

530
00:43:03,822 --> 00:43:05,485
Who would have thought?

531
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:12,495
Some are even...
short-sighted... foolish people.

532
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,731
So... after all this time...

533
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:18,873
we finally find out that we do
have something in common.

534
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:23,066
Which, apart from being a little weird...

535
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,657
is kind of OK?

536
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,371
I think we're supposed
to be training right now.

537
00:43:32,406 --> 00:43:34,380
Yes, yes. Um...

538
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:37,628
We need to...
concentrate on your... flexibility.

539
00:43:37,663 --> 00:43:40,706
And you know what?
I have just the perfect music.

540
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:45,535
Go on, say it. You know you want to.

541
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:48,373
It's not music, it's just, uh,
meaningless sounds.

542
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:52,327
- There. Feel better?
- Yes. Thanks.

543
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:58,100
The Bay City Rollers. Now that's music.

544
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:00,961
I didn't hear that.

545
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:06,541
