00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:24,674
* All is calm *

3
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:27,980
* All is bright *

4
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:31,613
* Round yon virgin... *

5
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,988
- * Mother and child *
- Watch it.

6
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:39,825
Daniel.

7
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:41,762
Where were you going?

8
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:43,299
You... You're not human.

9
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,994
Not of late, no.

10
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:46,866
Wh... What do you want?

11
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:48,029
Well, it happens that
I'm hungry, Daniel...

12
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:50,300
and seeing as that you're
somewhat in me debt...

13
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:51,466
Please, I can't.

14
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:52,941
A man playing at cards

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,443
should have
a natural intelligence

16
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,505
or a great deal of money,
and you're sadly lacking in both.

17
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:04,110
So I take me winnings
me own way.

18
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:05,553
The Lord is my shepherd.

19
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:07,056
I shall not want.

20
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:09,149
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures...

21
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:12,354
Daniel, be of good cheer.

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,761
It's Christmas.

23
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:24,799
It's gonna be sunny and warm
with temperatures continuing

24
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,673
in the high 70s throughout
the holiday weekend.

25
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:32,409
* Remember Christ our savior
was born on Christmas day *

26
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,974
* To save us all
from Satan's power *

27
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:36,849
- * When we had gone astray *
- Merry Christmas.

28
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:40,823
* Oh, tidings of comfort
and joy *

29
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:42,654
Hi.

30
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,626
Angel.

31
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,327
So, are you shopping?

32
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,528
You're probably not shopping.

33
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:55,367
I couldn't sleep.

34
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,205
Vampires probably not that big on
Christmas, now that I think about it.

35
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:00,834
Not as a rule.

36
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:05,378
But you're good?

37
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:09,042
I... I'm all right. You?

38
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,450
Yeah.

39
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,716
Yeah, I'm good.

40
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,726
I was just getting some
Christmas gifts for the gang.

41
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:20,628
Um, I'd better go before
the magic store closes.

42
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:26,266
Angel?

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,301
What is it?

44
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,072
And then he just bailed.
He didn't say anything.

45
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,701
He just took off.
It was so weird.

46
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:43,338
Angel? Weird?
What are the odds?

47
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:47,441
Do you think something's wrong?
Maybe you should tell Giles.

48
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,646
No. I don't wanna bug Giles.

49
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:53,849
He's still kinda twitchy when it
comes to the subject of Angel.

50
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:57,155
It must be that whole "Angel killed
his girlfriend and tortured her" thing.

51
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:59,855
Giles is pretty petty
when it comes to stuff like that.

52
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,296
Xander, enough, okay?

53
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:05,494
Maybe Angel just has
the holiday blues.

54
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:09,471
Everybody gets them,
especially when they're alone.

55
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,168
It's just so frustrating.

56
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:15,473
I'm trying to do the right thing
and stay away from him

57
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,915
and get over it,
and then boom, there he is.

58
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:23,920
I just want a nice,
quiet Christmas vacation.

59
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:27,116
Xander: So, you doing
anything special?

60
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:30,058
Buffy: Tree. Nog. Roast beast.

61
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:32,755
Just me and Mom and,
hopefully, an excess of gifts.

62
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,422
What are you doing for Christmas?

63
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:36,557
Being Jewish.
Remember, people?

64
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:38,932
Not everybody worships Santa.

65
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,494
I just meant for vacation.

66
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,834
Nothing fun.

67
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:48,469
Oz and I had planned...
But I guess that's off.

68
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:49,978
Well, I'll be enjoying

69
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,015
my annual Christmas Eve camp-out.

70
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,141
See, I take
my sleeping bag outside

71
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:55,981
and I go to sleep
on the grass.

72
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:57,418
Buffy: Sounds fun.

73
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:58,682
Yeah, I like to look
at the stars, you know?

74
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,984
Feel the whole nature vibe.

75
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:01,854
I thought you slept outside

76
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:04,553
to avoid your family's
drunken Christmas fights.

77
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:07,654
Yes, and that was a confidence
I was hoping

78
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:09,631
you would share with everyone.

79
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,693
Well, I'll be in Aspen skiing...

80
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,170
with actual snow.

81
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,002
I hear that helps.

82
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:19,634
It must be a drag to be
stuck here in Sweatydale...

83
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,371
but I'm thinking of you.

84
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:23,879
Okay, I'm not.

85
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:27,246
She certainly has reverted to form.

86
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:28,978
It's not her fault.

87
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:31,615
After what happened,
we gotta cut her some slack.

88
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,648
That's the Christmas spirit.

89
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,275
Hello, stillJewish.

90
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:37,786
Chanukah spirit,
I believe that was?

91
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:41,551
Anyway, forgiveness is pretty much
a big theme with me this year

92
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,525
'cause of the...

93
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:49,889
Hey.

94
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:52,231
Hey.

95
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:55,863
Okay. The thing is...

96
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,206
seeing you with Xander,
it was...

97
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,511
I've never felt that way before

98
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:08,380
when it wasn't a full moon...

99
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,785
but I know you guys
have a history.

100
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:14,790
But it's a history
that's in the past.

101
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:18,885
Well, I... I guess most
history is in the past.

102
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,226
But it's over.

103
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,663
Well, I don't know.

104
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:27,636
I don't know that it ever
will be between you two.

105
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:30,332
Oz, please believe me.

106
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:32,341
This is what I do know.

107
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:35,871
I miss you...

108
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,638
like, every second.

109
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:46,383
It's like I lost an arm
or worse, a torso.

110
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:55,125
So, I think I'd be willing
to give it a shot.

111
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,331
Really?

112
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,809
Yeah.

113
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:16,083
Do you want us to...
to hug now?

114
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,953
Yeah, I'm good for that.

115
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:35,437
Woman:
Take the other one then.

116
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,870
Do you wanna get one
with snow on it?

117
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:47,280
Be very Christmasy.

118
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:49,285
I think those are just for display.

119
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:53,084
Oh. You know, honey,
I was thinking

120
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,818
maybe we should invite Faith
to spend Christmas Eve with us.

121
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,325
I don't know.

122
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,524
Faith and I don't really hang out

123
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,432
or talk or make eye contact lately.

124
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:07,868
Do you really wanna
let her spend Christmas Eve

125
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:10,930
all by herself in that
dingy little motel room?

126
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,540
You're still number one
with a guilt trip, Mom.

127
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:17,774
- I try.
- I'll ask her.

128
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:21,310
- You're a doll.
- What about Giles?

129
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,945
- He doesn't have any fam...
- No, I'm sure he's fine.

130
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,351
We could at least ask him.

131
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,017
He doesn't wanna spend Christmas Eve
with a bunch of girls.

132
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,026
Let's split up.

133
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,848
Bunch of them up and died on us.

134
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,289
Don't know why.

135
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:06,090
If you want one,
I can make you a hell of a deal.

136
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:07,596
No, thank you.

137
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:09,894
Joyce: Oh, honey,
this one's perfect.

138
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:16,171
[Men Chanting]

139
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:28,183
[Gasping]

140
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,718
- [Knock At Door]
- TV: Merry Christmas...
- Yeah?

141
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,627
Happy New Year...

142
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:42,392
Hey, what's up?

143
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,593
Work, damn it!

144
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,135
Hey.

145
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,394
What's going on?

146
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:51,566
Scary monsters?

147
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,131
No.

148
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:59,409
We're having Christmas Eve dinner
at my house...

149
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:02,646
and I thought that if you
didn't have plans...

150
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:05,119
Your mom sent you down, huh?

151
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,951
No.

152
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,218
Well, thanks, but I got plans.

153
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,853
There's this big party
I've been invited to.

154
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,487
It should be a blast.

155
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:16,429
Okay, cool.

156
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,164
But if you change
your mind, the offer...

157
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:23,103
That's nice of you. Thanks.

158
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:26,108
But I got... I got
that big party

159
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:28,667
that I've been
invited to, so...

160
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,985
I like the lights.

161
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:41,956
Yeah. Well, 'tis the season.
Whatever that means.

162
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,657
[Knocking]

163
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,959
Just a minute.

164
00:10:56,395 --> 00:10:58,022
Hello.

165
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:59,257
Um...

166
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:01,822
I'm sorry to bother you.

167
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:07,962
Sorry. Coming from you

168
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,201
that phrase strikes me
as rather funny.

169
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:11,607
Sorry to bother me.

170
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:12,803
I need your help.

171
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:14,937
And the funny keeps on coming.

172
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:18,677
I understand. I have
no right to ask for it...

173
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,184
but there's no one else.

174
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:23,852
All right.

175
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:32,829
I... I can't come in
unless you invite me.

176
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:35,662
I'm aware of that.

177
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:39,967
Come in.

178
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,637
I've been seeing...

179
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:51,740
I've had...
I've had dreams lately

180
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,251
about the past.

181
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,778
It's like I'm living it again.

182
00:11:57,857 --> 00:11:59,290
It's so vivid, I...

183
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:00,791
I need to know.

184
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,159
I need to know why I'm here.

185
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,994
Here, back on Earth?

186
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,001
I should be in a demon dimension

187
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:11,866
suffering an eternity of torture.

188
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:13,700
I don't feel particularly
inclined to argue with that.

189
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:15,263
But I'm not.

190
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,275
I was freed...

191
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:19,777
and I don't understand why.

192
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:21,710
Knowing why you were back
would give you peace of mind?

193
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,840
It might.

194
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,282
You think that's something
you ought to have?

195
00:12:26,352 --> 00:12:28,820
Because, sir, to be blunt...

196
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:32,324
the last time you became
complacent about your existence...

197
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:34,154
it turned out rather badly.

198
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:38,729
What?

199
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:39,787
There.

200
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,496
Don't you see her?

201
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:44,501
Who?

202
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,309
I can't!

203
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:26,438
Sir, please, I should
return to the party.

204
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:28,207
Margaret, Margaret,
there's no hurry.

205
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,713
Mistress will be wondering...

206
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:32,546
Shh. The mistress will be
wondering how to get

207
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:34,108
the good Reverend Chalmers
into bed

208
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:37,178
and will not notice
the absence of canapés.

209
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:38,518
Stay with me.

210
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,616
Sir, people might talk.

211
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:43,560
I'll be put out in the streets.

212
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:46,359
My little boy would...

213
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:48,263
I can't lose this job.

214
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:51,462
Then you best keep quiet.

215
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:53,471
You're hurting me.

216
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,473
Cry out. Call for help.

217
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,032
I'm sure mistress will believe
your behavior beyond reproach.

218
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,805
Please.

219
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,406
Come, make a scene, huh?
Shall I?

220
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:07,152
No.

221
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:09,551
No, no.

222
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:13,756
We'll be as quiet as mice.

223
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:22,129
No matter what.

224
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:25,762
Sir, my son!

225
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:28,739
He'll make a fine dessert.

226
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,745
[Gasps]

227
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:01,568
Trouble sleeping?

228
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,471
You're not here.

229
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,476
I'm always here.

230
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:09,904
Leave me alone.

231
00:15:09,982 --> 00:15:13,577
I can't.
You won't let me.

232
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:18,150
What do you want?

233
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:22,159
I want to die in bed
surrounded by fat grandchildren...

234
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:24,593
but guess that's off the menu.

235
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:25,595
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:25,664 --> 00:15:27,131
You're sorry?

237
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,632
For me?

238
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:30,862
Don't bother.
I'm dead.

239
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:31,925
I'm over it.

240
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:36,666
If you wanna feel
sorry for someone...

241
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:38,642
you should feel sorry
for yourself.

242
00:15:38,711 --> 00:15:41,009
Oh, but I guess you've already
got that covered.

243
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,880
I am sorry...
for what I've done.

244
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,545
What else can I say to you?

245
00:15:52,024 --> 00:15:54,652
I don't wanna make you feel bad.

246
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:59,295
I just want to show you
who you are.

247
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:01,799
You had a dream about Angel.

248
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:03,226
I was in Angel's dream.

249
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,189
I'm not sure...

250
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,625
Giles, there was stuff
in this dream

251
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:08,129
that I couldn't possibly
know about.

252
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:09,631
It was Angel's past.

253
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:12,862
He was dreaming it,
and somehow I got sucked in.

254
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:15,837
There's something wrong with him.

255
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:22,542
I know. I've seen him.

256
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:26,173
He wanted to know
why he was back.

257
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:30,618
Is there a way for us
to find that out?

258
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:33,121
Possibly. I've been looking.

259
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:35,817
Well, let me look too.

260
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:37,621
I'm not seeing him anymore.

261
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:39,628
I'm trying to put
all this behind me...

262
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:42,130
and I'm not gonna be able to

263
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:46,828
as long as we're both doing guest spots
in each other's dreams.

264
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,463
So we'll help him?

265
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:53,101
Yes.

266
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:56,273
Where do we start?

267
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:02,142
Look, I'm aware I haven't been
the mostest best friend to you

268
00:17:02,218 --> 00:17:04,152
when it comes to the whole
Angel thing.

269
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,712
And I don't know. Maybe I
finally got the Chanukah spirit.

270
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,284
Well, we start,
not surprisingly, with research.

271
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:18,223
Xander, the Black Chronicles.

272
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:21,236
And, Buffy, the diary
of Lucious Temple.

273
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:23,864
An acolyte of Acathla,
expert on demons.

274
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,602
You can skip the passages
on his garden

275
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:30,134
unless you're keen on growing
heartier beets.

276
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:33,307
Are you sure this is how you
wanna spend your Christmas vacation?

277
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:36,181
Yeah, this is actually the most
exciting thing I've got planned.

278
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,186
Who else can claim that
pathetic a social life?

279
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:40,449
Hey, guys.
What are we doing?

280
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,906
He's gonna come over on Christmas Eve
'cause my parents are out of town.

281
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:03,810
- We're gonna watch videos.
- That's good, right?

282
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:06,578
You guys are back.

283
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,141
It's good. It's perfect...

284
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:13,711
in an awkward,
uncomfortable sort of way.

285
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:18,456
I just don't know how
to make Oz trust me.

286
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:23,926
Xander has a piece of you
that Oz just can't touch.

287
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,630
I guess now it's just about
showing Oz that he comes first.

288
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:30,536
I guess.

289
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:32,908
Thanks.

290
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:36,071
Hey, he likes beets.

291
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:37,908
I read that one already.

292
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:40,108
We're not getting any closer.

293
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:45,611
The thing I remember most

294
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:49,124
was thinking how artful it was.

295
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:53,128
In the dark, they looked
just like they were sleeping.

296
00:18:53,196 --> 00:18:57,428
It wasn't until I bent down
and kissed them good night

297
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,435
that I felt how cold they were.

298
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:05,770
You grabbed me, and I thought,
"Who would go to so much trouble

299
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:08,276
to arrange them like that?"

300
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:12,176
But you see...

301
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:15,274
that's what makes you
different than other beasts.

302
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:20,584
They kill to feed, but you took
more kinds of pleasure in it

303
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:23,648
than any creature
that walks or crawls.

304
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,318
Oh, God.

305
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:28,023
Yeah, cry out.

306
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:29,655
Make a scene.

307
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:32,030
I was to be married that week...

308
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:35,161
but then, as I recall,
you knew that.

309
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:36,068
It wasn't me.

310
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:37,504
It wasn't you?

311
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:39,871
A demon isn't a man.
I was a man once.

312
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:43,378
Oh, yes, and what a man you were.

313
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,710
[Singing]

314
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:51,586
A drunken, whoring layabout...

315
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:55,522
and a terrible disappointment
to your parents.

316
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,957
I was young.

317
00:19:58,027 --> 00:20:01,656
- I never had a chance to...
- To die of syphilis?

318
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:04,962
You were a worthless being
before you were ever a monster.

319
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:07,195
Stop it! Stop.

320
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,704
[Sobbing]

321
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:11,933
I don't wanna hurt you, Angel...

322
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:13,942
but you have to understand.

323
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:19,073
Cruelty's the only thing
you ever had a true talent for.

324
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:21,776
- That's not true.
- Shh.

325
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,284
Rest.

326
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,953
Rest.

327
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:34,261
You mistake it for a curse,
Angel, but it's not.

328
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:39,000
It's your destiny.

329
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:44,172
I'll show you.

330
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:47,242
I'll show you.

331
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:40,990
- You want her?
- No.

332
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,970
Take her.
Take what you want.

333
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,405
Pour all that frustration
and all that guilt into her...

334
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:50,409
and you'll be free.

335
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:51,910
No.

336
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,008
You can't live for eternity
with all that pain.

337
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:02,488
This is what you are, and this is why
we brought you back.

338
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:04,148
Take her.

339
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:07,459
And then you'll be ready...

340
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,529
to kill her.

341
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,706
Hey, Buffy, take a look.

342
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:28,504
These letters contain references
to an ancient power known as the First.

343
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:30,812
- First what?
- Evil.

344
00:23:30,884 --> 00:23:33,614
Absolute evil,
older than man, than demons.

345
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:37,123
It could have had the power
to bring Angel back.

346
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,557
These guys...
I saw them in my dream.

347
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,720
I fell asleep up there.

348
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,629
You had another dream with Angel?

349
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,064
What happened?

350
00:23:48,702 --> 00:23:51,136
Oh, we don't need
to get sidetracked.

351
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:52,296
Who are these guys?

352
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:53,805
Well, they're known as the...

353
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:57,071
As the Bringers or Harbingers.

354
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,339
They're high priests of the First.

355
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:01,677
They can conjure
spirit manifestations

356
00:24:01,748 --> 00:24:04,876
and set them on people
to influence them, haunt them.

357
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:07,249
These are the guys working
the mojo on Angel?

358
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,550
Xander: We gotta stop them.

359
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:11,614
Y... You can't fight
the First, Buffy.

360
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:13,057
It's not a physical being.

361
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:14,991
Well, I... I can fight
these priest guys.

362
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,188
If we can find them.

363
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:25,471
Willy: Hey.

364
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,234
It's the slayer.

365
00:24:27,307 --> 00:24:29,867
What brings the slayer down here?

366
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,947
Hey, Willy, how you been?

367
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:39,418
Keeping out of trouble,
as God is my witness.

368
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:42,421
So, what can I do for you?

369
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:43,922
Couple of drinks?

370
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,925
Yeah. Let me get
a double shot of...

371
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,460
Of information, pal.

372
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,291
Three priests.
They call themselves...

373
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,352
The Bringers.

374
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:53,695
Bringers, Harbingers.

375
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:56,292
They have a "no eyes"
kind of look.

376
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,301
Doesn't ring a bell.

377
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,134
How about I ring
that bell for you?

378
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,640
Does the threatening come now?

379
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,266
Maybe you shouldn't help.

380
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:05,277
They would've come
to town recently.

381
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:07,074
They'd be holed up somewhere

382
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:09,115
summoning the spirit of the First.

383
00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:17,453
Well, I heard a few things,
you know, from the underground.

384
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:19,321
The underground?

385
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,587
Yeah, you know, from things
that live under the ground.

386
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:24,596
Apparently there's been a lot
of migration out of Sunnydale

387
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:27,098
from the lower inhabitants.
Something's scaring them off...

388
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,158
and these are things that
aren't easily scared.

389
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,329
Could be your priest guys
are underground.

390
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,632
Underground where?

391
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:34,333
I do not know.

392
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:40,045
- Okay. Thanks.
- See you around.

393
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:42,308
Hey. You did great,
by the way.

394
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:44,373
I was very intimidated by you.

395
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,351
Really?

396
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:49,784
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

397
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:53,292
Hey, kid.
Merry Christmas.

398
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,195
Man, is it hot.

399
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,206
It was so nice
and cool in there.

400
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,902
Yeah, a nice cool waste
of time.

401
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:12,206
We know underground.
That's a start.

402
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,214
Sure, in a town with 14 million
square miles of sewer.

403
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,979
Plus a lot of natural cave formations
and a gateway to hell.

404
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:21,543
Yeah, this does
resemble square one.

405
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:25,554
- I don't know what to do.
- I think right now...

406
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,185
the best plan is to deck the halls
with boughs of holly.

407
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:32,893
Look, we'll catch the bad guys,
sooner or later.

408
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,871
Willow?

409
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:45,040
I got videos.

410
00:26:45,111 --> 00:26:46,718
Hi.

411
00:26:47,852 --> 00:26:50,616
Why don't you come s-sit down?

412
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:05,134
* I've heard people say that *

413
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:12,366
* Too much of anything
is not good for you, baby *

414
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:15,936
You ever have that dream
where you're in a play...

415
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:19,882
and you really don't know your lines,
and you kind of don't know the plot?

416
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:22,476
Well, we're alone...

417
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:25,387
and we're together.

418
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:28,358
I... I just wanted it
to be special.

419
00:27:28,426 --> 00:27:30,792
How special are we talking?

420
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:33,956
Well, you know, we're alone...

421
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:38,731
and we're both mature
younger people...

422
00:27:38,803 --> 00:27:43,001
and... and so we...
we could...

423
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:47,238
I... I'm ready to...
w... with you.

424
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:49,974
We could do that thing.

425
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:52,539
* I don't know why *

426
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:54,983
* I can't get enough
of your love, babe *

427
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:57,248
- Where are you going?
- No, I'm not going.

428
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:59,950
Just a dramatic gesture.

429
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:02,959
That's... That's pretty special.

430
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,298
Oz, I... I wanna
be with you first.

431
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,598
I think we should
sit down again.

432
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,200
Oz?

433
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:20,839
I'm ready.

434
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:29,175
Okay. Well, don't take
this the wrong way...

435
00:28:31,756 --> 00:28:33,747
but I'm not.

436
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,361
Are you scared,
'cause I thought you had...

437
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,457
I have,
but this is different.

438
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:45,469
I mean, you look great,
you know.

439
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:48,734
And... And you got
the Barry working for you...

440
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:51,037
and it's all...

441
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:52,474
good.

442
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:56,036
But when it happens...

443
00:28:57,882 --> 00:29:02,649
I want it to be because we both
need it too for the same reason.

444
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:07,056
You don't have to prove
anything to me.

445
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,585
I just wanted you to know.

446
00:29:10,662 --> 00:29:12,220
I know.

447
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:14,595
I get the message.

448
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,579
There we go.

449
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:31,877
Nothing like a roaring fire

450
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,542
to keep away the blistering heat.

451
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:35,950
Oh, come on. It's lovely.

452
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,319
Maybe I should turn
the air conditioning on.

453
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:45,021
So, Angel's on top again?

454
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:46,256
What?

455
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:48,094
Angel or star?

456
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:52,193
Oh, uh, star.

457
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,828
Star.

458
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:55,338
[Doorbell Ringing]

459
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,138
Hey.

460
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,478
Hi.

461
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:10,153
Uh, looked like
that whole party thing

462
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:12,246
was gonna be kind of a drag.

463
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:17,294
I didn't really have anything...

464
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:19,125
You know.

465
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:22,595
I'm glad you came.

466
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:26,627
Uh, here.

467
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:28,695
Why don't you come in

468
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:31,298
from the entire lack of cold?

469
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:33,003
Mm.

470
00:30:33,077 --> 00:30:35,511
Uh, that one is for your mom.

471
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,842
They're pretty crappy.

472
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:38,382
Faith, you made it.

473
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:42,018
Oh, that is so thoughtful.

474
00:30:42,086 --> 00:30:43,383
They're crappy.

475
00:30:43,454 --> 00:30:46,116
You know, I'm gonna go upstairs
and get your gifts.

476
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,157
Excuse me.

477
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:49,216
Uh, would you like some nog?

478
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:50,727
Okay, Mom, don't touch
yours, though...

479
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:53,059
'cause then you're gonna know
what it is.

480
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:58,725
Angel.

481
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:01,362
Huh.

482
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,236
Buffy.

483
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:05,367
What is it?

484
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:07,741
Uh...

485
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:09,370
[Agitated Breathing]
I gotta... I...

486
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:13,579
Look, I, uh,
I had to see you, um...

487
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,646
I don't know, I...

488
00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:21,915
You shouldn't be...

489
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:24,086
Just tell me what's going on.

490
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:29,156
She wants you to touch her.

491
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:31,667
What are you waiting for?

492
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:34,204
You have to stay away from me.

493
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:37,708
You came to see me to tell me
that I can't see you?

494
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:44,772
Angel, something
is doing this to you.

495
00:31:47,118 --> 00:31:49,518
You just have to
control it, okay?

496
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:51,452
I... I know that you're confused.

497
00:31:51,522 --> 00:31:53,956
I think you're the one
who's confused.

498
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:55,788
I think you need to...

499
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,522
She wants you to taste her.

500
00:31:58,596 --> 00:32:01,030
Think of the peace.

501
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:04,296
You'll never have to see us again.

502
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:05,597
Angel, how can I help you?

503
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,864
Leave me alone!

504
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,965
I just need you to stay with Mom
in case he comes back.

505
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:13,476
Yeah, I'll play watchdog.

506
00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:14,977
I don't really get it, though.

507
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:16,479
I'll explain later.

508
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:17,980
Everything. I promise.

509
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,676
Watch your back.

510
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:22,185
Giles, we have to do something.

511
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:23,185
Soon. Now.

512
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:25,188
I'm still not sure what.

513
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,190
Find me these priest guys.

514
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:29,419
Find me something I can pummel.

515
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:30,426
Let's not lose our heads.

516
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:33,627
Giles, he's slipping.

517
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,160
I think we're losing him.

518
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:40,860
Look...

519
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:43,368
you realize if he...

520
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:45,462
truly becomes a danger...

521
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,803
you may have to kill him.

522
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:49,068
Again.

523
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:53,179
Can you do that?

524
00:32:54,414 --> 00:32:55,847
I can't do it.

525
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:57,349
You have to do it.

526
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:58,850
What else are you good for?

527
00:32:58,919 --> 00:32:59,886
Get away from me.

528
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:03,719
Couldn't you just... feel her?

529
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,850
Couldn't you almost smell her skin?

530
00:33:08,395 --> 00:33:11,922
You never were a fighter, Angel.
Don't start trying now.

531
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,694
Sooner or later,
you will drink her.

532
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:19,196
I'll never hurt her.

533
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:21,639
You were born to hurt her.
Have you learned nothing?

534
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,141
As long as you are alive...

535
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,269
Then I'll die.

536
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,144
You don't have the strength
to kill yourself.

537
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,740
I don't need strength.

538
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,348
I just need the sun to rise.

539
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:43,255
You're not supposed to die.
This isn't the plan.

540
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:52,067
But it'll do.

541
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,279
"A child shall be born of man
and goat and have two heads...

542
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:04,283
and the First shall speak
only in riddles..."

543
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:07,650
No wonder you like this stuff.
It's like reading the sun.

544
00:34:07,721 --> 00:34:09,313
Yes. Ah.

545
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,913
Priests?

546
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:14,427
Um, yes, but, uh,
more posturing, I'm afraid.

547
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:16,428
"For they are
the Harbingers of Death.

548
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:18,794
Nothing shall grow
above or below them.

549
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:20,833
No seed shall flower,
neither in man nor..."

550
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:24,667
They're rebels, and they'll never,
ever be any good.

551
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:27,332
- Nothing specific about their haunts.
- Let me see that.

552
00:34:31,078 --> 00:34:33,308
"The Harbingers of Death.

553
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,907
Nothing shall grow
above or below."

554
00:34:39,353 --> 00:34:41,583
What?

555
00:35:05,078 --> 00:35:06,545
[Grunts]

556
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,777
All right, ten more minutes of chanting,
and then you guys have to go to bed.

557
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:50,217
Uhh!

558
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,723
Uhh!

559
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,724
Hmm. I'm impressed.

560
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,497
You won't get Angel.

561
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:03,501
Hmm.

562
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,333
You think you can fight me?

563
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:07,999
I'm not a demon, little girl.

564
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:10,736
I am something
that you can't even conceive...

565
00:36:10,811 --> 00:36:13,143
The First Evil.

566
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,272
Beyond sin...

567
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:18,010
beyond death.

568
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:22,020
I am the thing
the darkness fears.

569
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:26,525
You'll never see me,
but I am everywhere.

570
00:36:26,593 --> 00:36:28,026
Every being...

571
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:29,789
every thought...

572
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:31,490
every drop of hate.

573
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,658
All right, I get it.
You're evil.

574
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,997
Do we have to
chat about it all day?

575
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,436
Angel will be dead by sunrise.

576
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:42,964
Your Christmas will be his wake.

577
00:36:43,043 --> 00:36:45,409
No.

578
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:48,004
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

579
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,514
Let me guess.

580
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,414
Is it... evil?

581
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,289
Dead by sunrise!

582
00:36:57,357 --> 00:36:58,619
Angel!

583
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:25,940
Angel.

584
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:34,025
I bet half the kids
down there are already awake.

585
00:37:34,094 --> 00:37:36,324
Lying in their beds.

586
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:40,924
Sneaking downstairs.
Waiting for day.

587
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:42,764
Angel, please.

588
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:46,097
I need you to get inside.
There's only a few minutes left.

589
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,257
I know. I can smell the sunrise
long before it comes.

590
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,428
I don't have time to explain this.
You just have to trust me.

591
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,200
- That thing that was haunting you...
- It wasn't haunting me.

592
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,039
- It was showing me.
- Showing you?

593
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,669
- What I am.
- Were.

594
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,044
And ever shall be.

595
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,744
I wanted to know why I was back.
Now I do.

596
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,354
You don't know.
Some great evil

597
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,118
takes credit for bringing you back,
and you buy it?

598
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:15,386
You just give up?

599
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,893
I can't do it again, Buffy.

600
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,394
I can't become a killer.

601
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,395
Then fight it.

602
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,556
It's too hard.

603
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,563
Mm-mmm.

604
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,259
Angel, please,
you have to get inside.

605
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,494
It told me to kill you.

606
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,935
You were in the dream.
You know.

607
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,438
It told me to lose my soul in you
and become a monster again.

608
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,998
I know what it told you.
What does it matter?

609
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,100
Because I wanted to!

610
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:36,169
Because I want you so badly.

611
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,181
I want to take comfort in you...

612
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,183
and I know it'll cost me my soul...

613
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,685
and a part of me doesn't care.

614
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,623
Look, I'm weak.

615
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,785
I've never been anything else.

616
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,558
It's not the demon in me
that needs killing, Buffy.

617
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,292
It's the man.

618
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,890
You're weak.

619
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,629
Everybody is.

620
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,261
Everybody fails.

621
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,272
Maybe this evil
did bring you back...

622
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,104
but if it did,
it's because it needs you.

623
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:09,112
And that means
that you can hurt it.

624
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,946
Angel, you have the power
to do real good, to make amends.

625
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:18,319
But if you die now, then all
that you ever were was a monster.

626
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:23,293
Angel, please,
the sun is coming up.

627
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,692
- Just go.
- I won't.

628
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,230
You think this is simple?
You think there's an easy answer?

629
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,927
You can never understand
what I've done. Now go.

630
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,129
- You are not staying here.
I won't let you!
- Leave!

631
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,804
Oh, my God.

632
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,434
No! No!

633
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,639
Am I a thing worth saving, huh?

634
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,648
Am I a righteous man?

635
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,084
The world wants me gone.

636
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,648
What about me?

637
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,190
I love you so much.

638
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,830
And I tried to make you go away.

639
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,360
I killed you,
and it didn't help.

640
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,907
And I hate it!

641
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,411
I hate that it's so hard...

642
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:18,847
and that you can
hurt me so much.

643
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,916
I know everything that you did...

644
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,922
because you did it to me.

645
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,419
Oh, God.

646
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,552
I wish that I wished you dead.

647
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:36,200
I don't.

648
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,235
I can't.

649
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,911
Buffy, please.

650
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,105
Just this once...

651
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,515
let me be strong.

652
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,987
Strong is fighting.

653
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,387
It's hard...

654
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,891
and it's painful...

655
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,392
and it's every day.

656
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,895
It's what we have to do.

657
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,261
And we can do it together.

658
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:14,534
But if you're too much of
a coward for that, then burn.

659
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,540
If I can't convince you
that you belong in this world...

660
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,907
then I don't know what can.

661
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,038
But do not expect me to watch.

662
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,982
And don't expect me
to mourn for you, because...

663
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:06,282
TVweatherman:
And while most of Southern California

664
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,284
is enjoying a balmy Christmas...

665
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,287
an extreme cold front
has sprung up out of nowhere

666
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,290
around Sunnydale, where they
are reporting heavy snowfall

667
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,292
for the first time in,
well, ever.

668
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,352
Sunnydale residents shouldn't expect
to see the sun at all today.

669
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,364
That cold front
isn't going anywhere.

670
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,366
With temperatures in the high 30s...

671
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,867
means you better bundle up

672
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,334
if you're planning to go outside

673
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:28,372
and enjoy the change
in the weather.

674
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,779
Grr. Argh.
