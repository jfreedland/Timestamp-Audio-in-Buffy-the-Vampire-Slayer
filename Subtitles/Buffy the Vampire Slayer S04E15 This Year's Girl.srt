1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:03,404
I'm Faith.

2
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:05,324
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

3
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:07,210
Open your present.

4
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:10,603
- This is a thing of beauty, boss.
- That look on your face is my reward.

5
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:14,925
We've a rogue slayer on our hands.
I can't think of anything more dangerous.

6
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,646
It's a wonder she's alive at all
with the blood loss.

7
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:28,011
There's almost no chance that
she's ever gonna regain consciousness.

8
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:32,367
You're really strong. I like it.

9
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:34,648
I've worked too long...

10
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:39,645
Too long to let some little bitch
threaten this project.

11
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,724
Maggie Walsh set you up?

12
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,006
Maggie wanted me dead, didn't she?

13
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,769
Adam?

14
00:00:51,973 --> 00:00:52,689
Mommy.

15
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:54,491
Why does it bug you that I hang with her?

16
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:58,088
- She's using you to infiltrate our operation.
- You're saying she's a spy?

17
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,368
I don't know which team I'm on.

18
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:04,647
Who the bad guys are.

19
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:12,568
Escort them out.

20
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:15,404
Buffy.

21
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,841
They smell good, don't they?

22
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:28,209
- What?
- Clean sheets. Like summer.

23
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:31,527
I wouldn't know.

24
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:33,808
Right. I forgot.

25
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:37,204
I noticed.

26
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:42,123
- I wish I could stay, but...
- No, you have to go.

27
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,289
- It's just with...
- Little sis coming. I know.

28
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:50,247
So much to do before she gets here.

29
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,847
- Now I really have to...
- So go.

30
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:59,242
Don't let me keep...

31
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:02,524
Damn.

32
00:02:02,613 --> 00:02:05,002
Just when we made it so nice.

33
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,483
Are you ever gonna take this thing out?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

35
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:30,845
So, here it is. The latest
in state-of-the-art combat technology.

36
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,163
It doesn't look that complicated.

37
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:35,244
- So can you repair it?
- Sure.

38
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:39,645
As soon as I get my masters degree
in Advanced Starship Technology.

39
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,523
Why don't we experiment?
Press some buttons, see what happens.

40
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:46,173
- I'd like to veto that.
- Second.

41
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:51,131
It's called a "blaster", Will. A word
that tends to discourage experimentation.

42
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:55,206
If it were called the "orgasmator",
I'd try your button-press approach.

43
00:03:55,293 --> 00:04:00,003
- Just tell me. Can you repair it or not?
- I'm workin' on it, I'm workin' on it.

44
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:05,203
If I blow a hole in my mom's azalea patch,
the neighbours will not be pleased.

45
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:11,772
You all right? You've been patrolling
round the clock for three days straight.

46
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:15,641
- Perhaps you could use some...
- What? Some rest?

47
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:20,568
There's a demonoid killing machine out there
that doesn't only work the night shift.

48
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:26,011
I was going to say perhaps you could use
some backup. But now you mention it,

49
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:29,005
gathering your strength
might not be a bad idea.

50
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:32,722
Just get the blaster working.
That's all the strength I need.

51
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:33,962
Are you sure?

52
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:36,726
Why? Because ray guns
aren't in the Slayer Handbook?

53
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:38,804
Will, you haven't seen this Adam thing.

54
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:41,248
He's the Terminator
without the bashful charm.

55
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,166
He's deadly, and the last time
we met he kicked my ass.

56
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:46,847
Oh, no. Blast away, by all means.

57
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,242
I only meant...

58
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,006
No word about Riley?

59
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:58,322
They keep telling me that he's fine.
That's all they'll say.

60
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:01,450
- Maybe they're telling the truth.
- Maybe.

61
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:04,931
I don't know what
the Initiative's version of "fine" is.

62
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:09,165
They could be forcing him onto medication
and torturing him, for all I know.

63
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:11,847
From what we've seen,
I doubt they'd try to hurt him.

64
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:14,891
The only thing I know is that
my boyfriend is locked away

65
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:17,123
and I'm not helping.

66
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:19,409
Maybe Giles has a point.

67
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:24,328
Riley is their Top Gun guy.
Doesn't make sense that they'd hurt him.

68
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:28,372
The Initiative has all those brainwashy
behaviour-modification guys.

69
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,442
So?

70
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,093
What happens when
they don't like his behaviour?

71
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,648
Stand down, soldier.

72
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:58,367
Stand down before I put you down.

73
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,648
You heard the man. At ease.

74
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:10,487
The shish kebab that walks like a man.

75
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:14,327
Looks like you're feelin' better.
Walkin' around, threatening people.

76
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:16,449
Man was in my way. I got places to be.

77
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:19,047
Really? And where
were you thinking of going?

78
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,328
You know where I'm goin'.

79
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:24,166
Don't tell me you're headed
toward your girlfriend.

80
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:28,690
Look at you. One good conjugal visit
and you're back in Intensive Care to stay.

81
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:31,890
- You wouldn't understand.
- How about you explain it to me?

82
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:34,203
- We all friends here, fellas?
- Absolutely.

83
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,887
Riley is about to explain why he's leaving us.

84
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:41,524
I don't explain, because I don't have to.
I'm the one in charge.

85
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,922
- Things change.
- Do they?

86
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:46,891
In case you failed to notice,
we're in a world of hurt here.

87
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,851
It's time to band together,
not go off our separate ways.

88
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:54,211
- Forrest has a point, Rye.
- We have a problem, we deal with it.

89
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:59,242
The most important part of the equation is
that we keep said problem within the family.

90
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,324
Family?

91
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:03,608
Is that what we are?

92
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,528
Step aside.

93
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:25,562
You think it's gonna rain?

94
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,963
Nonsense. It's a beautiful day.
Eat your sandwich.

95
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:33,205
I don't know, it's just it always seems
like it starts raining right about now.

96
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:38,083
You're too young and too pretty a girl
to start wearing worry lines on your face.

97
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,564
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

98
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,244
Hey there, little fella.

99
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:47,803
I don't know where you belong,
but it's not here with us.

100
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:50,844
There you go.

101
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,689
You see, there's nothing
gonna spoil our time together.

102
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,923
Who wants cheesecake?

103
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,841
No!

104
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:06,487
I told you I had things to do.

105
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:27,172
- Spread out?
- Not too far.

106
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,448
So not a problem.

107
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,287
I've never seen anything like that.

108
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:04,446
And I can go a long, healthy stretch
without seeing anything like that again.

109
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:08,492
- It had to be Adam who killed it. But why?
- He's studying biology.

110
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:10,962
Human, demon,
whatever he can get his hands on.

111
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:15,444
- Learning what makes things work.
- I don't wanna be around for the final exam.

112
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:20,243
It's not coming to that. The Initiative created
this and they can't stop it. But we will.

113
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:25,532
Question. Will hiding in a cabin with
stockpiled chocolates be part of this plan?

114
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,924
No.

115
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,844
Told you.

116
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:33,322
- What's first?
- Riley.

117
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:36,527
I'm not leaving him down there
with those people.

118
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:39,252
I don't care how many guns they have,
I'm going in.

119
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,962
OK. Will, I need you
to hack into the security mainframe

120
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:45,647
and buy me a ten-minute
shutdown of systems.

121
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,963
- That could be...
- Tricky. Not impossible.

122
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:50,169
If you can't do it online, then use magic.

123
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:53,563
Xander, I want any gear
you've been saving for a rainy day.

124
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:56,167
- Stealthy stuff?
- No, we tried sneaking in.

125
00:09:56,253 --> 00:10:00,929
This time I'm using force. I figure
I'll go in through the elevator shaft,

126
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:03,607
then blast open the doors
and find the infirmary.

127
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:06,127
Am I really worth all that?

128
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:10,329
Riley!

129
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:13,404
God, I'm sorry! Did I hurt you?

130
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:18,328
No, a giant skewer through the ribcage
hurt me. That was just a reminder.

131
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:20,563
- How did you get out?
- I walked.

132
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,929
- They didn't try to stop you?
- Oh, they did. Repeatedly.

133
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:29,406
But I told them they couldn't keep me without
a major ass-kicking, one way or another.

134
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:33,247
- Here I am.
- That's great, Riley.

135
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:37,372
You know, there's no polite way
to ask you this, but...

136
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:39,808
Did they put a chip in your brain?

137
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:43,972
- Beg your pardon?
- Forget it. We're just happy to have you back.

138
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:47,284
Yeah. We were pretty worried
about you for a while, mister.

139
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:48,601
Me too.

140
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:52,368
Hey, look, I know my behaviour
was pretty out there.

141
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,684
Forget it. Tell you what.

142
00:10:54,773 --> 00:11:02,043
You two crazy kids take down an unstoppable
killer-cyborg-demon hybrid thingy

143
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,283
and we'll call it all even.

144
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:09,329
Taking down Adam will be tough. There's
no way to predict what he'll throw at us.

145
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:12,723
You're here. Whatever comes, we can handle.

146
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:34,805
Excuse me? You know how to get
to third floor west from here?

147
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:40,244
What?

148
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:42,770
I see...

149
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:46,410
- You need some help or something?
- Graduation.

150
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,212
- What?
- Graduation.

151
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,887
I gotta get to Sunnydale High School
graduation, now.

152
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:55,966
Well, you can't. Sunnydale High School
isn't even there any more.

153
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,169
- What day is it?
- Friday.

154
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:03,325
- What date? The date?
- February 25th.

155
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,522
What year?

156
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,730
- Maybe I should get a nurse...
- What happened to the school?

157
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:13,691
- Don't you just wanna...
- Just tell me.

158
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:20,443
Well... It was a tragedy, really.

159
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:22,923
Lots of students died.

160
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:25,732
The principal, the mayor...

161
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:28,725
I really think maybe
I should get you some help.

162
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:40,686
You know,
I never stopped thinking about you.

163
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,332
Me neither.

164
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:47,452
All I had in there was
this one little part of you.

165
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:50,172
It's just the scarf part of me, really.

166
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:52,244
I'm serious.

167
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:56,045
Just knowing you were out there.

168
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,328
That you cared.

169
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,127
You think we're bein' watched?

170
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:05,727
I don't know. Does the Initiative do that?

171
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,125
Maybe.

172
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:12,649
You seem a little somewhere else.

173
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,762
Is there anything I can do?

174
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:26,407
Give me an order. It's what I do, isn't it?
Follow orders.

175
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,371
- You don't have to.
- Don't I?

176
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,442
All my life that's what
I've been groomed to do.

177
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:38,650
They say jump, I ask "How high?"
I get the job done.

178
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:43,130
Just don't know if it's the rightjob any more.

179
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,928
I know how you feel.

180
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,928
Giles used to be a part of this Council,

181
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:54,722
and for years all they ever did
was give me orders.

182
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:57,202
- Ever obey them?
- Sure.

183
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:01,213
The ones I was going to do anyway.

184
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:04,047
The point is I quit the Council.

185
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:09,250
And I was scared. But it's OK now.

186
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:13,724
That's where you and I are different.
I just suck at the whole grey-area thing.

187
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:16,721
It's a choice.

188
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:20,852
You can go back in there and maybe
make some changes from the inside.

189
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:24,209
Or you can quit the team,
fight demons in your own way.

190
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:30,048
You make it sound so simple.
I don't even know what my way is.

191
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,522
Well, it's time to find out.

192
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:35,969
I'm a soldier. Take that away, what's left?

193
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:39,684
A good man.

194
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:58,166
- What are you doing?
- I...

195
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:01,245
am looking for brainwashy chips
in your head.

196
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:06,451
- Finding any?
- Not sure.

197
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:09,650
But I should probably
keep looking just in case.

198
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,810
You've been strong long enough, Riley Finn.

199
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:15,884
I'm gonna help you.

200
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:20,205
And we're gonna find this demon,
and we're gonna kill it together.

201
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:24,002
And in the meantime,
you are gonna stop torturing yourself.

202
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:27,208
Sure about that?

203
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,442
It's an order.

204
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,806
- What do you mean, she just wasn't there?
- I don't know.

205
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:42,044
I came to check the monitors,
like I always do at eight o'clock.

206
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:45,045
Eight o'clock is my shift. I got here on time...

207
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:48,250
- The bed was in this condition?
- Haven't touched a thing.

208
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,450
Get the duty rosters, check the log.
I wanna know what happened.

209
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:56,448
- Coma patients do notjust walk away.
- We are checking every room on every floor.

210
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,683
Walk me through this one more time.

211
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:02,083
You knew she was wanted for questioning
in a series of murders.

212
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:04,733
- There's no security here?
- You don't understand.

213
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:08,328
There's no way that girl was gonna wake up.
This can't be happening.

214
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:11,803
- Did you find her?
- Another woman. Unconscious and beaten.

215
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:14,088
And she's been stripped.

216
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,124
It's happened. Send the team.

217
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:28,449
The puzzle is why Adam
has stayed dormant this long.

218
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:32,208
When he's not making performance art
out of other demons.

219
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:35,091
He's probably working off
an autonomic power source.

220
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:38,085
Because he's straight out of the box,
he needs to charge up.

221
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:42,530
- OK. What's he charging up for?
- Based on the clues, I'll go with killing spree.

222
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:45,047
And that's a best-case scenario.

223
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:48,762
I suppose a little fire power
would be a good idea right now.

224
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:54,208
Hey! How did you do that?

225
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:59,882
- Is there an on/off button somewhere?
- Blasters are easy. Adam won't be.

226
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:05,093
Since Professor Walsh designed it, any
chance she left instructions lying around?

227
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:10,009
- If she did, they'll be in the Initiative.
- Which we can't easily get into.

228
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:12,288
Speak for yourself.

229
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:16,372
- I'm just sayin'.
- A man on the inside would be...

230
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:20,002
A really good idea. Are you sure
you wanna be Double Agent Guy?

231
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:24,086
I'm not exactly sure what you'd call me,
but I will share information.

232
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:28,371
- It's the least I can do.
- Riley's right. It is the least he can do.

233
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:37,004
Hello.

234
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:39,370
Yes, she is.

235
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:41,444
It's for you.

236
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:49,211
Hello?

237
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:51,284
Speaking.

238
00:20:51,893 --> 00:20:54,282
What sort of emergency?

239
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,484
No. I haven't.

240
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:07,527
Thank you. I'll let you know.

241
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:10,444
What is it?

242
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,728
It's Faith.

243
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:16,008
She's awake.

244
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:23,405
She beat someone up, took her clothing,
and disappeared out of the hospital.

245
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:25,484
No one knows where she is.

246
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:28,724
I'd say this qualifies
for a "worst timing ever" award.

247
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:31,452
- What do we do?
- Well, we have to find her.

248
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:33,444
What about Adam?

249
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:37,845
I'd hate the pursuit of a homicidal lunatic
to prevent pursuing a homicidal lunatic.

250
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:42,245
Faith's not exactly Low Profile Girl.
I'll patrol and wait for her to make a move.

251
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,722
- But then what?
- Ooh, I have an idea.

252
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,322
- Beat the crap out of her.
- Good plan.

253
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:50,849
Good on paper.
But we still have a decision to make.

254
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:56,204
Do we hand her over to the cops?
They wouldn't know what to do with a slayer.

255
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:59,365
- What about the Council?
- Been there. Tried that.

256
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:03,048
Not unlike smothering a forest fire
with napalm, as I recall.

257
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:05,852
Well, the Initiative has containment facilities.

258
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:09,608
- One word: evil.
- There's no way around it.

259
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:14,642
Faith is back and, whether I like it or not,
she's my responsibility.

260
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,169
Yeah, too bad.
That was the funnest coma ever.

261
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:23,281
We have no idea where she is. We don't know
what she's thinking, what she's feeling...

262
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:26,206
- Who she's doing.
- She could be terrified.

263
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:28,363
Maybe she doesn't even remember.

264
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:32,605
Or maybe she does and she's sorry,
and she's alone, hiding somewhere.

265
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:39,090
Perhaps there's some form of rehabilitation
we just haven't thought about.

266
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:42,643
And if not, ass-kicking makes a solid plan B.

267
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:46,692
I'm not gonna rule it out.
First thing, we need to find her.

268
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:49,367
Then we can take it from there.

269
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:52,645
Who's Faith?

270
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:55,770
- What did you tell him?
- The truth.

271
00:22:55,853 --> 00:23:00,210
She's my wacky cousin from England,
and whenever she visits high jinks ensue.

272
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:03,968
It's good you guys have
such an honest relationship.

273
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:08,604
No, I told him the story.
I vagued up a few bits, but no flat-out lies.

274
00:23:08,693 --> 00:23:12,288
That's fair. How'd you handle
the Angel-y parts?

275
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:16,249
I did some editing. It's not that
I want to hide anything from Riley.

276
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:21,282
It's just that that's a longer conversation
and I had a Faith hunt to do.

277
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:23,568
- Any luck?
- Couldn't find her.

278
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:26,451
Don't know where to place that
in the luck continuum.

279
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:31,653
At least you're not alone on this. I'll bet every
cop in Sunnydale is looking for her right now.

280
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:37,410
Pressure is definitely high. I'll tell you,
if I were her, I'd get out of Dodge posthastey.

281
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:39,882
You're not me.

282
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:47,847
So, check you out, B.

283
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:51,164
Nice. The big-girl-on-campus thing's
really working for you.

284
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:55,246
- I've been looking for you.
- I've been standing still for eight months, B.

285
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,722
How hard did you look?

286
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:01,166
- Are you all right?
- Five by five.

287
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:04,643
That's the thing about a coma.
You wake up rested and rejuvenated

288
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,042
and ready for payback.

289
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:11,606
- So much for pleasantries, huh?
- What did you think? We'd go for tea?

290
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:15,003
- You tried to gut me, Blondie.
- You'd have done the same to me.

291
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:18,210
So let's have another go at it.
See who lands on top.

292
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:25,170
- It doesn't have to be like this, you know.
- Actually, I think it has to be exactly like this.

293
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:28,723
- Faith, these are innocent people.
- No such animal.

294
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:33,606
I guess it was too much to hope that
you'd use your downtime to reflect and grow.

295
00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:38,005
Could say the same about you. You're still
the same old "better than thou" Buffy.

296
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:41,529
I knew it. I kept having this dream,
I'm not sure what it means.

297
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,605
But in the dream this self-righteous
blonde chick stabs me.

298
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,446
- And you wanna know why?
- You had it coming.

299
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:51,242
That's one interpretation.
But in my dream, she does it for a guy.

300
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,528
Try it, Red, and you lose an arm!

301
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:58,651
I wake up to find that this blonde chick isn't
even dating the guy she was so nuts about.

302
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:02,203
She's moved on to the first
college beefstick she meets.

303
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,365
Not only has she forgotten
about the love of her life,

304
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:09,002
she's forgotten all about
the chick she nearly killed for him.

305
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:13,723
So that's my dream. That and some stuff
about cigars and a tunnel.

306
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:17,132
But, tell me, college girl,

307
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:20,046
- what does it mean?
- To me?

308
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:24,648
Mostly, that you still mouth off
about things you don't understand.

309
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:27,812
Uh-oh. I guess somebody knows you're here.

310
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,528
You took my life, B. Payback's a bitch.

311
00:25:40,613 --> 00:25:43,366
- Look who's talking.
- See ya around.

312
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,650
Thanks for coming with.

313
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:21,488
Hunting for a psychopathic superbitch
is in the above-and-beyond category.

314
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:26,089
It's OK. Really.
So what do we do if we find her?

315
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:29,168
Run. Flee. Maybe skedaddle.

316
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:33,567
We're not here to engage.
This is strictly recon.

317
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:37,442
- What?
- You said recon.

318
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:42,163
- You're, like, Cool Monster Fighter.
- Well, technically, Faith isn't a monster.

319
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:46,405
And as far as fighting, I'd be lucky
to bruise her fist with my face.

320
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:48,848
- Oh.
- What?

321
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,925
Face punching.
I'm not so good with the whole...

322
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,848
Swimming?

323
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:56,366
Violence.

324
00:26:56,453 --> 00:27:00,446
Don't worry, we're sure to spot Faith first.
She's this cleavagey slutbomb

325
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:05,607
walking around going "Oh, check me out.
I'm wicked cool. I'm five by five."

326
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:09,049
Five by five?
Five what by five what?

327
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:11,806
See, that's the thing. No one knows.

328
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:15,442
Buffy can handle Faith,
and you're plenty safe with me.

329
00:27:16,613 --> 00:27:20,049
So we recon till nightfall?

330
00:27:21,213 --> 00:27:23,602
Then the ritual hiding begins.

331
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,492
The point being, I could be the target here.

332
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:33,771
Faith finds Mr Xander Harris still in town,
odds are she goes tighter than catgut.

333
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,923
Got a lotta pent-up feelings there.

334
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:38,652
- I'm only sayin'.
- Yes, I'm sure.

335
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:42,408
See, I can't be held responsible
for the effect I have on women.

336
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,164
No.

337
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:46,609
Faith and I have this thing
between us called history.

338
00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:11,691
- Spike.
- What are you doing here?

339
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,287
Me? Hey, I'm not the one out of place here.

340
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:17,922
For your information, smarty,
we've got a rogue slayer on our hands.

341
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:21,050
- Real psycho killer, too.
- Sounds serious.

342
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,772
- It is. What do you know?
- What do you need?

343
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:27,643
Her. Dark hair. Yea tall.

344
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:31,169
- Name of Faith. Criminally insane.
- Have you seen her?

345
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:34,643
- Is this bird after you?
- In a bad way. Yeah.

346
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:39,844
Tell you what I'll do, then.
I'll head out, find this girl,

347
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,801
tell her exactly where you are, and watch

348
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:45,361
as she kills you.

349
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:55,205
Can't any one of your damned Scooby club
at least try to remember that I hate you all?

350
00:28:56,573 --> 00:29:01,567
Just because I can't do the damage doesn't
stop me aiming a loose cannon your way.

351
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,047
And I thought the evening would be dull.

352
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:08,282
Go ahead! You wouldn't even recognise her.

353
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:14,846
Dark hair, this tall, name of Faith,
criminally insane... I like this girl already.

354
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,690
We're dumb.

355
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:46,245
Faith! A friend sent me.

356
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,447
I got a little remembrance from him.

357
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:24,568
Hello, Faith.

358
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:29,807
If you're watching this tape,
it can only mean one thing: I'm dead.

359
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:35,807
And our noble campaign to bring order
to the town of Sunnydale has failed,

360
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:38,968
utterly and completely.

361
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:41,772
But on the other hand, heck, maybe we won!

362
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:47,969
And right now I'm on some jumbo monitor
in the Richard Wilkins Museum,

363
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:53,650
surrounded by a bunch of kids looking up
at my face, filled with fear and wonder.

364
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:56,888
Hi, kids!

365
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:02,403
But the realist in me tends to doubt it.

366
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:07,093
Now, Faith,

367
00:32:07,173 --> 00:32:11,963
as I record this message, you're... sleeping.

368
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:15,170
And the doctors tell me
that you might never wake up.

369
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:17,562
I don't believe that.

370
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:22,966
Sooner or later, you will wake up. And you'll
find the world has gone and changed on you.

371
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:28,932
I wish I could make the world
a better place for you to wake up in,

372
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:32,722
but, tough as it is to accept,
we both have to understand

373
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:37,807
that even my power to protect
and watch over you has its limits.

374
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:43,048
See, the hard pill to swallow here is that,

375
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:46,045
once I'm gone,

376
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,772
your days are just plain numbered.

377
00:32:50,813 --> 00:32:56,171
Now, I know you're a smart and capable
young woman in charge of her own life.

378
00:32:56,253 --> 00:32:59,689
But the problem, Faith, is that

379
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:02,970
there won't be a place for you
in the world any more.

380
00:33:03,053 --> 00:33:06,602
Right now, I bet
you're feeling very much alone.

381
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,888
But you're never alone.

382
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,644
You'll always have me.

383
00:33:12,693 --> 00:33:14,684
And...

384
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:17,962
you'll always have this.

385
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:21,282
Go ahead. Open the box.

386
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:25,883
Don't worry. It's not gonna bite.
That's my job.

387
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:30,283
Go ahead. Open it.

388
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:36,046
Surprise! See, you don't get these
in any gumball machine.

389
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:38,488
When you're around as long as me,
you make friends.

390
00:33:38,573 --> 00:33:43,283
Some of them forge neat little gizmos
like the one you're holding right now.

391
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:46,408
And here's the good news.

392
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:49,405
Just because it's over for my Faith

393
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:52,371
doesn't mean she can't go out with a bang.

394
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:00,964
She's a very dangerous woman.

395
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:04,213
OK, I get it, really. Faith bad.

396
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:07,965
- Do I look like I'm arguing?
- Not yet.

397
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:11,251
You always make that innocent face
right before you start.

398
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,608
Figured that out, huh? Damn.

399
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:16,161
Took Mom 12 years to catch that one.

400
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:19,207
All I'm saying is,
if you're in trouble, I wanna help.

401
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:21,932
- You can't.
- Give me one reason why.

402
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:25,684
That's one.

403
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,082
OK. I'm not exactly Action Guy.

404
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:32,803
But there's gotta be somethin' I can do
besides wait for you to pummel this gal.

405
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:36,727
Riley, the fact that you just called Faith a gal
proves you don't know her.

406
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:39,691
I've never seen anybody
get under your skin this way.

407
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:43,732
- What did she do to you exactly?
- It's a long story.

408
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:48,807
I'm from Iowa. We drive four hours
for a high-school football game. Try me.

409
00:34:49,573 --> 00:34:54,328
I told you, OK? She hurt me
and people that I care about.

410
00:34:54,413 --> 00:34:58,122
- Did I mention psycho killer?
- There's something you're not telling me.

411
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:00,807
Riley, I have to go. She's out there.

412
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:05,204
All right. I'm just sayin',
I think you're holdin' out on me.

413
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:08,012
Riley, this isn't ajoke.

414
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:11,608
There's a criminally insane woman
out there with superpowers,

415
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:15,811
who thinks that I'm responsible
for ruining her life.

416
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:21,933
I know Faith. She'll come after me
and she'll come after the people that I love.

417
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:29,004
Hi, Joyce.

418
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:35,765
Mind if I come in?

419
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:43,688
Ruby Sunset.

420
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:47,008
Burgundy Skyline.

421
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:49,686
Harlot?

422
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:52,564
Way to go, Joyce.

423
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:55,121
Normally I wouldn't go
with a colour this dark,

424
00:35:55,213 --> 00:36:00,606
but I read in a magazine eight months in
a coma will damage a girl's natural skin tone.

425
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:04,451
Good thing pale is in this year.

426
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:06,728
Or was it last year?

427
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:12,765
Anyway, for real now.
I'm gonna ask you something,

428
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:17,688
and you gotta promise to be honest and not
spare my feelings just cos I could kill you.

429
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:19,843
You promise?

430
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,924
- I promise.
- OK.

431
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,528
How do I look?

432
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:32,171
- Psychotic.
- I was shooting for sultry, but hey.

433
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,046
- Bet I know what you're thinking.
- Really?

434
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:40,531
You're thinking "You'll never
get away with this!" Warm?

435
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:43,731
Actually, I was thinking
my daughter will kill you soon.

436
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:45,929
- That a fact?
- More like a bet.

437
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:50,723
Whoa. You got a pair on you, Joyce.
I like seein' that in a woman your age.

438
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:53,885
Guess you can afford to talk that way.
In Joyce's world,

439
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:57,682
Buffy is gonna come crashing
through that door any minute.

440
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:03,242
But look what I found.

441
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:07,211
Buffy Summers.

442
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:11,411
Buffy Summers. Buffy Summers.
Buffy, Buffy... A lot of letters.

443
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:15,005
She hasn't been by in a while, huh?

444
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:18,165
And you'd think, with a crazy chick
like me on the loose,

445
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:23,373
crazy chick with a wicked grudge against
her, she'd call and give you a heads-up.

446
00:37:23,453 --> 00:37:28,004
But Buffy's too into her own deal
to remember dear old Mom.

447
00:37:28,093 --> 00:37:31,802
You don't know the first thing
about Buffy. Or me.

448
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:35,124
Don't I? I know what it's like.

449
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:38,842
You think you matter, you're a part
of something, and you get dumped.

450
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:41,686
It's like the whole world is moving,
but you're stuck.

451
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,128
Like those animals in the tarpits.

452
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:48,606
It's like you just keep sinking a little deeper
every day, and nobody even sees.

453
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:51,207
Were you planning
to slit my throat any time soon?

454
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:54,365
Don't tell me you don't see it, Joyce.
You've served your purpose.

455
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:58,048
You squirted out the kid, raised her up,
and now you might as well be dead.

456
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:04,049
Nobody cares. Nobody remembers.
Especially not Buffy, fabulous superhero.

457
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:08,888
Sooner or later, you're gonna have to face it.
She was over us a long time ago, Joyce.

458
00:38:08,973 --> 00:38:13,046
Too busy climbing onto her new boy toy
to give a thought to the people that matter!

459
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:16,409
You're her mother,
and she just leaves you here to die!

460
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:21,764
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

461
00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:46,887
You thought I'd go after the clean marine.
He's a cutie.

462
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:49,692
Looks like he could use
a good roll in the sack.

463
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:53,652
You're not his type. He's not big on sleaze.

464
00:39:00,493 --> 00:39:04,566
- He's probably never tried it.
- Going for the boyfriend again? That's tired.

465
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:07,770
Just something to remember me by
once I've moved on.

466
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:15,325
Ever occur to you, Faith, that the reason
we all forgot you is because we wanted to?

467
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:38,008
Hello, Rupert.

468
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:48,604
Cops.

469
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,212
- You OK?
- All things considered.

470
00:40:30,293 --> 00:40:33,046
- What is that?
- Weapon of some kind.

471
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:38,281
Didn't work, whatever it was.

472
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:40,964
Oh, the police.

473
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:46,848
She's their problem now.

474
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:49,962
You sure you're OK?

475
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:54,962
Five by five.
