1
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,642
I can't bite. I can't even hit people.

2
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:06,530
Previously on "Buffy the Vamlpire Slayer":

3
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:09,605
I've got information.
About the soldiers you were fighting.

4
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:12,322
- I'm going.
- Well, how long?

5
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:16,891
I don't know.
The wolf is inside me all the time.

6
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:20,283
Until I figure out what that means,
I shouldn't be around you.

7

8
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,770
- Yeah. That looks good.
- I think it's not straight.

9
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:12,650
- One second. Almost finished.
- Oh, right. OK.

10
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,372
- Yeah, just unhook it.
- Then let me flip it over.

11
00:01:18,773 --> 00:01:20,764
Thanks, Riley.

12
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:25,245
Looks good. Hey, Buffy.

13
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,409
- Is there something you wanna tell me?
- What?

14
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:33,244
Yes. I am a lesbian.

15
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:35,889
Well, it's good you're so open about it.

16
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:39,249
Oh, hey. You know we were
talking about having a picnic?

17
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,405
I was thinking,
do you ever hang out at Ruggs' field?

18
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:46,330
It's beautiful there.
Usually not that crowded, either.

19
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:51,282
I thought we could have a little spread -
sandwiches, maybe some ants? It'd be fun.

20
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:54,285
We were talking about having a picnic?

21
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:59,046
So was that a conversation I actually had,
or one I was just practising?

22
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,169
Practising?

23
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:05,326
OK, yes. I have been known to do
a little prep work before our conversations.

24
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:08,086
It's not easy, you know,
talking to you sometimes.

25
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:11,085
It's like an oral exam.

26
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:14,131
Boy. That's just what every girl longs to hear.

27
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,252
- Well, you're tricky.
- Like an exam?

28
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:21,369
I never know how
you're gonna react to something.

29
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:24,604
That's why I like you so much.
You're a mystery.

30
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:29,851
Probably every beautiful girl has
some jerk telling her she's a mystery, but,

31
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:32,288
I swear, you really are.

32
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:36,530
There's a lot about you
that needs puzzling out.

33
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:43,528
I lose you somewhere?

34
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:47,126
Right around "beautiful".

35
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:51,845
Say, don't you just love a picnic?

36
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:55,684
It's just different, you know? A picnic.

37
00:02:55,773 --> 00:03:00,403
First of all, daylight. It's kind of
a new venue, Buffywise. And the best part?

38
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:04,202
He said he would bring all the food,
so all I have to do is show up and eat.

39
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,329
Those are two things I'm really good at.

40
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:09,246
- So he's nice?
- Very, very.

41
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,369
And there's sparkage?

42
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:13,444
Yeah. He's...

43
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:17,128
Have you seen his arms?
Those are good arms to have.

44
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:20,602
I really like him. I do.

45
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,802
But?

46
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:26,202
I don't know.

47
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:31,526
I really like being around him,
you know? And I think he cares about me.

48
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:35,401
But I just feel like something's missing.

49
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:38,444
He's not making you miserable?

50
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,844
Exactly.

51
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:44,612
Riley seems so solid.

52
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:48,003
Like he wouldn't cause me heartache.

53
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,687
Get out. Get out while there's still time.

54
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:56,644
I know. I have to get away
from that bad-boy thing.

55
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,724
There's no good there.

56
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:05,089
Seeing Angel in LA, even for five minutes...

57
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:07,289
Hello to the pain.

58
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:10,445
The pain is not a friend.

59
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:15,209
But I can't help thinking,
isn't that where the fire comes from?

60
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:18,729
Can a nice, safe relationship be that intense?

61
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:23,323
I know it's nuts,
but part of me believes that

62
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:27,804
real love and passion have to go
hand in hand with pain and fighting.

63
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,164
I wonder where I get that from.

64
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:31,092
So, you saw their faces
but you can't describe them.

65
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:37,127
Well, they were human.
Two eyes each, kind of in the middle.

66
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:39,928
Uh-huh. And the lab?

67
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,323
Underground.

68
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:45,405
I came out through an air vent.
I don't know exactly where.

69
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:47,484
I'm done. Put the telly on.

70
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:52,604
It's about time. Hope you got it warm enough.

71
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:10,649
I don't know why you're so dainty suddenly.
You've done this for Angel. You must have.

72
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,724
- OK.
- Give it.

73
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:15,691
That's it.
The invalid-amnesiac routine is over.

74
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:19,011
The kitchen is closed
until you tell me something useful.

75
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:21,732
I'm trying to remember. It was very traumatic.

76
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:25,362
- How long are you gonna pull this crap?
- How long will I live if I tell you?

77
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:29,810
Spike, we have no intention
of killing a harmless creature,

78
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:31,963
but we have to know
what's been done to you.

79
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:35,648
We can't let you go until
we're sure you're impotent, or...

80
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:39,649
- Sorry. Until we know that you're...
- Flaccid?

81
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:44,246
- You are one step away, missy.
- Giles, help. He's gonna scold me.

82
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,883
You know what?

83
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:52,283
I don't think you want us to let you go.

84
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:55,729
- Maybe we made it a little too comfy for ya.
- Comfy?

85
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:59,807
I'm chained in a bathtub
drinking pig's blood from a novelty mug.

86
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:04,165
- Doesn't rate huge in the Zagat's guide.
- You want something nicer?

87
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:07,489
Look at my poor neck,

88
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:12,292
all bare and tender and exposed.

89
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:17,571
All that blood just pumping away.

90
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,963
- Oh, please.
- Giles, make her stop.

91
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:24,762
If those two don't kill each other,
I might lend a hand.

92
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:27,484
What about a truth spell?

93
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:32,372
I'm not positive it would work on a vampire,
but we could try. Make him 'fess up?

94
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,331
A truth spell, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

95
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,530
Cos you had your hands full
with the undead English patient?

96
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,286
- Yes, worth a go.
- Looks pretty simple.

97
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:44,251
- I'll stop by the magic shop tomorrow.
- Excellent.

98
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:49,453
All right. I'll be back in the morning
with doughnuts and motherwort.

99
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:53,448
- Bye, Buffy. I'll see you at home.
- Bye.

100
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,524
Great. Thank you, Willow.

101
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:04,605
Willow may have had a very helpful idea.

102
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:09,127
She seems to be coping better
with Oz's departure, don't you think?

103
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:12,967
She still has a way to go,
but, yeah, I think she's dealing.

104
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:16,682
What, are you people blind?
She's hanging on by a thread.

105
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:19,084
Any ninny could see that.

106
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:44,166
Devon said that he sent for his stuff..

107
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:52,009
I guess this means he's planning
on settling down somewhere else.

108
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:54,084
Not here.

109
00:08:56,893 --> 00:08:58,884
I guess so.

110
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:05,167
I feel like I've been split
down the centre and half of me is lost.

111
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:10,284
I know. It feels like that now.

112
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,808
Oz is gone.

113
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:27,604
Come on, now. It's telly time.

114
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:31,129
This is Buffy and Willow.
Please leave a message.

115
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:36,685
Willow, it's Giles. I thought you were
bringing the ingredients for that spell?

116
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:39,492
- I really have to...
- Passions is on.

117
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:41,291
Timmy's down the bloody well.

118
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,764
- And if you make me miss it, I'II...
- You'll do what? Lick me to death?

119
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:53,323
Look, Willow,
I think we ought to try the spell.

120
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:57,804
Among other things,
I'd like to shower sometime today. Alone.

121
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:01,926
- Driving?
- Yeah.

122
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:04,843
You seriously drive for fun?

123
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:09,165
Well, not four-wheeling
or anything, but yeah. Don't you?

124
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:14,088
Actually, no-wheeling is more my specialty.
I'm an avid pedestrian, though.

125
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:17,051
You're kidding, right?
I mean, you know how to drive?

126
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:19,567
Well, I took the class.

127
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:23,043
Cars and Buffy are, like, un-mixy things.

128
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:27,729
You just haven't had a good experience yet.
You can have the best time in a car.

129
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:31,522
It's not about getting somewhere.
You have to take your time.

130
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:34,525
Forget about everything. Just relax.

131
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:38,649
Let it wash over you. The air, the motion.

132
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:42,361
Just let it roll.

133
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:46,408
We are talking about driving, right?

134
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,484
I thought I was.

135
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:57,245
I'm taking you. Some night when it's warm.
Up past the vineyards.

136
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,325
- It's gonna change everything for you.
- I'm in.

137
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,164
Hey, Willow.

138
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:11,046
- Hey.
- I interrupted.

139
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:14,725
You've got apples. My miss.

140
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:19,413
Wait.

141
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:22,812
Sit. There's plenty to go around.

142
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:31,566
- Did something happen? Something wrong?
- No. Everything's fine. The same.

143
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:38,525
Your apples are turning brown,
the way they do.

144
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:41,963
Yeah, I guess they do that.

145
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:46,448
Yeah.

146
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,524
Yeah...

147
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:03,410
Jeez. You mean Oz just sent for his stuff
and didn't even call her? That's pretty harsh.

148
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:07,083
I wish I had my powers back.
I'd liquefy his entrails for her.

149
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:09,164
That's sweet.

150
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:12,131
God, poor Will. No wonder she's

151
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:16,490
having a wonderful time.

152
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,769
Wow. Way to rebound.

153
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:26,603
I believe that's the dance
of a Brave Little Toaster.

154
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,006
Hey, guys, come on. This music's great.

155
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,561
Nice to see you brought
your boogie shoes, Will.

156
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:42,726
Yeah. You know, I know
I've been sort of a party poop lately.

157
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:47,409
So I said to myself "Self," I said,
"it's time to shake and shimmy it off."

158
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:51,044
- Sounds like a good policy.
- Yeah. And it works, too.

159
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:55,684
You know, I just figure,
in the grand scheme of things, we're all just...

160
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:00,964
Drunk?

161
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:06,169
"Drunk"... I mean, that's such a strong word.

162
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:10,212
Kind of a guttural,
Anglo-Saxon word. "Drunk."

163
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:12,807
Will, not loving the drowning of the sorrows.

164
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,453
Not drowning, wading.

165
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,252
And see? Lite. No big.

166
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:22,963
No big? Remember when Buffy had the fun
beerfest and went One Million Years BC?

167
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:27,012
- Sadly, without the fuzzy bikini.
- Off topic, Xander.

168
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:29,209
Right. Helping now.

169
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:31,568
Will, how about you give me that beer?

170
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,848
No. Why should I?

171
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:38,643
- I've got pain here. Big-time, legitimate pain.
- We all have pain, Will.

172
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:43,045
Like what? "Oh, poor me.
I live in a basement." Yeah, that's dire.

173
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:48,610
- OK, that's it. I'm taking you home.
- No, I don't want to.

174
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:53,609
Well, you'll thank me
when you still have a friend in the morning.

175
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:57,891
I just can't stand feeling this way.
I want it to be over.

176
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,442
It will. I promise.
But it's gonna take time.

177
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:05,967
- Well, that's not good enough.
- I know.

178
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:10,090
It's just how it is.
You have to go through the pain.

179
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:15,241
Well, isn't there some way I can just
make it go away, just cos I say so?

180
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,722
Can't I just make it go poof?

181
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:56,081
Hearken well, ye elements.
I summon thee now.

182
00:14:56,173 --> 00:15:00,052
Control the outside. Control within.

183
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:03,081
Land and sea, fire and wind.

184
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,922
Out of my passions, a web be spun.

185
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:10,732
From this eve forth, my will be done.

186
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:12,804
So mote it be.

187
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,686
It is my will that my heart be healed.

188
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:33,604
Now.

189
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:39,690
I will that this book speak its words to me.

190
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:47,368
I will that this Q-Tip gets unbendy?

191
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:51,044
Come in.

192
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:53,890
Giles. What are you doing here?

193
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:56,647
I'm a bit concerned about you, actually.

194
00:15:57,053 --> 00:16:01,012
- Did Buffy tell you about the beer?
- Buffy didn't tell me anything.

195
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,685
Well, forget the beer part, then.

196
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:07,448
Happily. I came because
we had an appointment the other day.

197
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,252
- Right, right. The truth spell.
- Yes.

198
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:17,363
Willow, I know that you're
going through a very difficult time.

199
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:21,685
- But shirking your responsibilities...
- But I didn't shirk. I...

200
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:27,285
I did the research and I...
I picked up the motherwort.

201
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:29,728
I just forgot the doing-the-spell part.

202
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:35,292
- That isn't like you at all.
- I know. I've been off.

203
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:40,003
I even tried to do a spell last night.
To have my will done?

204
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:43,927
I was hoping it would make me feel better,
but itjust went kablooey.

205
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:48,529
A spell? It's not wise for you to do that alone
right now. Your energy's too unfocused.

206
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:52,288
Well, that's not true.
I said I was off, not incompetent.

207
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:57,527
You're grieving, so it might be wise to take a
break from doing spells without supervision.

208
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:00,173
So I get punished cos I'm in pain?

209
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:05,486
- It's not punishment. I'm saying it because...
- You care. Yeah. Everybody cares.

210
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:08,041
Nobody wants to be inconvenienced.

211
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,490
You all want me to take the time
and go through the pain,

212
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:15,043
- as long as you don't have to hear about it.
- Now that's not fair.

213
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:19,763
Isn't it? Cos I'm doing the best I can, and
it doesn't seem to be enough for you guys.

214
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:23,732
- And I see how you could feel that way. I do...
- No, you don't.

215
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:27,324
You say that you do,
but you don't see anything.

216
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,524
Sorry.

217
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,648
Sorry. Perhaps I'd better be going.

218
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:41,684
Let's... let's talk about this later.

219
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:49,284
I'm sorry. So sorry.

220
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:57,972
"Enemy, enemy, be now quiet."

221
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:03,491
You know, not too keen about this spell
stuff. Tends to be a bit unpredictable.

222
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:06,485
Yes. You might have
thought about that sooner.

223
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:14,929
"Let your deceitful tongue be... be broken."

224
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:23,082
"Let no untruths be spoken."

225
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,486
Hey, what's that all about?

226
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:34,133
Oh, nothing. Just, you know, ash in my eye.

227
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:42,332
Well, I won't have you doing mojo on me
if you can't read properly.

228
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,927
You could turn me into
a stink beetle or whatall.

229
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:48,164
It would be a generous ending for you, Spike.

230
00:18:56,053 --> 00:19:01,810
I mean, I'm going through something. I just
don't see why he was getting down on me.

231
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:06,683
Giles just worries. Spells can be dangerous.
It doesn't mean he thinks you're a bad witch.

232
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:10,163
- I am a bad witch.
- No, you're a good witch.

233
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:15,247
I'm not kidding anyone. If I had any real
power, I could've made Oz stay with me.

234
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:21,052
- You wouldn't have wanted him to stay...
- I didn't dare to do the spell on Veruca.

235
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,886
And my "I will it so" spell went nowhere.

236
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:27,685
The only real witch here is fuzzy little Amy.

237
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:34,445
- I think you're being too hard on yourself.
- She has powers I can't even invoke.

238
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:40,483
I mean, first she's a perfectly normal girl,
then poof, she's a rat.

239
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,648
I could never do something like that.

240
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:51,444
Hello?

241
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:55,089
I'll be right there.

242
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,563
- Spike escaped.
- And you're going? Now?

243
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,724
Sorry, duty thing.

244
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:06,410
Well, I mean, what's the rush?
Spike can't hurt anyone, right?

245
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:11,169
And I figured, since I'm kinda grievey,
we could, you know, have a girl's night.

246
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:17,249
Eat sundaes and watch Steel Magnolias, and
you can tell me at least I don't have diabetes.

247
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:21,008
I can't hang out with you until
I get Spike back to Giles, you know that.

248
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:24,324
OK, I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.

249
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:29,250
I don't see the big.
He's probably just standing out there.

250
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,244
You'll find him in two seconds.

251
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:39,851
- Thought that was gonna take longer.
- Me, too.

252
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,766
Must have got turned around.

253
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,768
Hang on, this...

254
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:49,321
This is it. Wait...

255
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,609
No. Yes.

256
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:56,363
- What are you talking about?
- The lab. Commando lab.

257
00:20:57,493 --> 00:21:01,532
- The door was right here where I escaped.
- I don't think so.

258
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:06,446
Open up. I'm gonna kill you.

259
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:09,885
- Spike, there's nothing there.
- Let me in.

260
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:12,362
- Fix me.
- OK, drop the act.

261
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:15,490
- Get off.
- OK, that's it, I'm gonna gag you.

262
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:27,766
Watch it.

263
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,084
- One more word out of you, and I swear...
- Swear what?

264
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:33,892
You won't do anything to me.
You don't have the stones.

265
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:38,763
I got the stones.
I got a whole bunch of stones.

266
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:40,844
Yeah? You're all talk.

267
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:45,883
Giles. I accidentally killed Spike.
That's OK, right?

268
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:48,448
Just a minute.

269
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:50,764
I mean, I'm going through something.

270
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:54,562
You'd think, every once in a while,
Buffy would make best friends a priority.

271
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:57,167
Will, it's not like she could just let Spike go.

272
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:03,492
I get this spell reversed,
they'll be finding your body for weeks.

273
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,212
Make a move. Please.

274
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:08,329
I'm dying for a good slay.

275
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:12,407
Spike's more important than me. I get it.

276
00:22:12,493 --> 00:22:16,406
Buffy's gotta find out about those
commandos. Right now she needs Spike.

277
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:19,803
Well, fine.
Why doesn't she just go marry him?

278
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:24,964
If the two of you
could remain civil long enough to...

279
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:29,921
It's just so sudden. I don't know what to say.

280
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:34,532
Just say yes,
and make me the happiest man on earth.

281
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:37,891
Oh, Spike. Of course it's yes.

282
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:49,490
Giles. You'll never believe what's happened.

283
00:22:56,933 --> 00:23:01,006
- It's just not fair.
- Will, I know it's hard to see it right now,

284
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:03,607
but everything you feel is because of Oz.

285
00:23:03,693 --> 00:23:05,923
Not because of Buffy and me or anybody.

286
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:08,732
But you'll meet somebody else,
and it'll be better.

287
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:12,772
Yeah. Cos most relationships
are great and trouble-free.

288
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:16,129
I don't think so.
I think we're all doomed to badness.

289
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:20,047
- We're not doomed.
- Oh, yeah? Let's look at your bio.

290
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:26,092
Insect Lady, Mummy Girl, Anya.
You're a demon magnet.

291
00:23:27,293 --> 00:23:28,646
I was just trying to help.

292
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:31,452
Willow, it's me.

293
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:34,809
Something's happened. I need your help.

294
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:38,932
I can't see very well. Everything's blurred.

295
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:42,972
I'm certain it's a spell
of some kind, because,

296
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:48,923
well, it seems something else is going wrong.

297
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:51,481
Here you go. 98.6.

298
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:56,364
Horribly wrong.

299
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:02,329
There's so much to decide.
Ceremony, guests, reception.

300
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:06,322
Well, first thing I'd say,
we're not having a church wedding.

301
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:09,211
How about a daytime ceremony in the park?

302
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:12,808
Fabulous. Enjoy your honeymoon
with the Big Pile of Dust.

303
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:15,691
Under the trees. Indirect sunlight only.

304
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:18,003
A spring breeze tosses the leaves aside,

305
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:22,132
and again, you're registering
as Mr and Mrs Big Pile of Dust.

306
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:26,445
Stop it. This is our wedding
and you're treating it like a big joke.

307
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,285
Pouty.

308
00:24:28,373 --> 00:24:30,841
Look at that lip. Gonna get it.

309
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:33,367
Gonna get it.

310
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:36,489
Stop.

311
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,928
Yes, please stop.

312
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:44,568
- Giles, did you see my ring?
- Thankfully, not very well.

313
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:55,002
I'm not crazy, and I know that
you probably don't approve.

314
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,649
And my father's not that far away.
I mean, he could...

315
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:04,372
But this day is about family, my real family.

316
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:10,686
And I would like you
to be the one to give me away.

317
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:13,172
Buffy.

318
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:15,608
That's... that's so...

319
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:19,049
For God's sake. This is nonsense.

320
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:23,763
Something is making you act this way.
Don't you realise what you're doing?

321
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,405
Living the dream.

322
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:30,246
He's gonna have to take time
to get used to it, pet.

323
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,769
They all will. But you guys
weren't crazy about Angel at first.

324
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:36,321
You weren't gonna say that name.

325
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:40,372
Sorry. Why don't we talk about
where we're gonna register?

326
00:25:40,453 --> 00:25:44,207
Where would Angel register? Can we have
the photographer Angel would want?

327
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,602
And flowers Angel would have liked?

328
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:50,124
You think I don't live
with the shadow of Drusilla over my head?

329
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:54,001
That I'm not wondering if you're gonna
be thinking of her on our honeymoon

330
00:25:54,093 --> 00:25:56,402
when you're making sweet love to me?

331
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,803
Giles, are you OK?

332
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:08,572
I rather think not.

333
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:13,010
I seem to be rather... rather blind.

334
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:16,442
Completely, in fact.

335
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,127
What? How could this happen?

336
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:24,608
- A spell, I believe.
- Well, we'll fix it. Don't worry.

337
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:28,811
What you want is a general reversal spell.
We're gonna need supplies.

338
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:30,770
Are you helping me?

339
00:26:30,853 --> 00:26:33,890
Well, it's almost like
you're my father-in-law, ain't it?

340
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:36,567
See? This is how it's gonna be.

341
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:41,010
Spike'll even take care of you
while I'm at the magic shop.

342
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:43,891
From now on, we're a family.

343
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:49,491
It's all right. I have more Scotch.

344
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,010
Hey, Buffy.

345
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:18,172
- What's up?
- Riley, look. Aren't they beautiful?

346
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:22,168
Yeah, they're nice.

347
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:25,404
A little dressy maybe, for school, but...

348
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:29,249
- Riley.
- Buffy?

349
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,204
I really like you.

350
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:36,127
I hope you know that you mean a lot to me,
and if things were different...

351
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,204
Different than what?

352
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:42,730
I want you to promise me
that we can always be friends.

353
00:27:42,813 --> 00:27:45,247
And I'd really like you to be there on the day.

354
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,642
- The day when...
- The wedding.

355
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,247
- The wedding. What wedding?
- My wedding.

356
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:53,245
I'm getting married. Can you believe it?

357
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:56,484
- I don't think no is a strong enough word.
- I know. It's crazy.

358
00:27:56,573 --> 00:28:00,361
I mean, we fought
for all these years and then...

359
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:03,331
Sometimes you just look at someone

360
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:05,802
- and you know, you know?
- No.

361
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:10,921
I think maybe we fought because we couldn't
admit how we really felt about each other.

362
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:13,288
- Can we start again?
- You'll really like him.

363
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:16,809
- Well, nobody really likes him.
- I need to clear a few things up.

364
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:19,088
- I don't even really like him.
- Buffy.

365
00:28:19,173 --> 00:28:22,882
But I love him. I do.

366
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:25,043
- Who?
- What?

367
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,407
- What's his name?
- Who?

368
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:28,324
- The groom.
- Spike.

369
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:30,005
- That's a name?
- Don't be mad.

370
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:31,606
- I'm not mad.
- No, you are mad.

371
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:34,207
No, I am. I really...

372
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,052
Wow. Who is this guy? Does he go here?

373
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,489
- Spike? Oh, no, he's totally old.
- Old.

374
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:44,725
- Well, not as old as my last boyfriend was.
- OK.

375
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:56,009
It's late, and I'm... I'm very tired now,
so I'm just gonna go far away and be away.

376
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:59,685
- But...
- No. Stay.

377
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:08,648
You're ruining my happy day.

378
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,762
That's OK, Mom.
We don't need any more snacks.

379
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:16,610
- I liked those Fruit Roll-Ups.
- I thought she'd never clear out.

380
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:20,402
Besides, just think of my lips
as the Fruit Roll-Ups of love.

381
00:29:22,013 --> 00:29:24,004
OK, that was gross.

382
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:27,085
I'm a little distracted. Willow was really upset.

383
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:30,485
I shouldn't have let her go away mad.

384
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:41,446
- Regaining focus.
- We just got rid of your mom.

385
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:43,603
Let's not bring Willow into this.

386
00:29:43,973 --> 00:29:45,964
It's time forjust the two of us.

387
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:06,124
No, no, it's the Pargo demon.
Drowning is the only way to kill it.

388
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:17,853
What the hell is going on?

389
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:33,128
So the plan is to cure my total,
incapacitating blindness tomorrow, is it?

390
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:39,205
They were out of tagis root at the magic shop.
They'll have more tomorrow. I'm on top of it.

391
00:30:39,293 --> 00:30:44,731
- Aren't they a perfect little us?
- I don't like him. He's insipid. Clearly human.

392
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:49,409
Red paint. We could smear a little
on the mouth? The blood of the innocent.

393
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:51,484
That's my girl.

394
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:56,285
Stop that right now. I can hear the smacking.

395
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:00,882
Honey, we need to talk about the invitations.

396
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:04,522
Now, do you wanna be
"William the Bloody" orjust "Spike"?

397
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:07,841
Cos either way,
it's gonna look majorly weird.

398
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:11,687
Whereas the name Buffy
gives it that touch of classic elegance.

399
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:14,367
- What's wrong with Buffy?
- Such a good question.

400
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:17,331
- It's a terrible name.
- My mother gave me that name.

401
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:21,201
- Your mother. Yeah, she's a genius.
- Don't you start in on my mother.

402
00:31:22,853 --> 00:31:25,526
Board up the windows
and barricade the doors.

403
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:28,491
- What's going on?
- Demons. They keep coming and coming.

404
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:33,124
I think we lost them, but I couldn't see.
Spike. He's all untied.

405
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:35,408
Which you probably noticed.

406
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,883
Calm down. If you lost them,
that'll give us time to figure this out.

407
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:41,612
Maybe the demons have
something to do with Giles being blind.

408
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,843
Giles is blind?

409
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:47,763
Stop whatever you're doing.
You smell like Fruit Roll-Ups.

410
00:31:47,853 --> 00:31:52,802
This is the crack team that foils
my every plan? I am deeply shamed.

411
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:55,726
Spike's right. We really should get organised.

412
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,088
Why are you holding hands?

413
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:01,567
They have to hear it sooner or later.

414
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,962
Spike and I are getting married.

415
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:06,169
How? What?

416
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:09,051
- How?
- Three excellent questions.

417
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:11,328
What are you looking at?

418
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:13,404
The man I love.

419
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:18,684
Can I be blind, too?

420
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:22,643
Wait. "Married"...

421
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:25,768
I know something. What is it?

422
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:30,089
Everything's so familiar.
Work, brain, work.

423
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:33,731
Willow.

424
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,289
What about Willow? Honey, get off.

425
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:41,003
Something about Willow and her griefy,
"poor me" mood swings. So, so tired of it.

426
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:43,084
I don't have to be nice about her any more?

427
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:45,528
We're all tired of it,
but what does it matter?

428
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:49,601
She told me I was a demon magnet
and you two should get married.

429
00:32:49,693 --> 00:32:53,163
- And that I didn't see anything.
- She did a spell.

430
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:57,924
Yes. To have her will done.
Whatever she says is coming true.

431
00:32:58,013 --> 00:33:01,767
You both were affected. I probably only
escaped because I'm the Slayer.

432
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:03,844
Some kind of natural immunity.

433
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:07,687
Right. You're marrying Spike
because you're so right for each other.

434
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:11,288
- Xander.
- That's it. You're off the usher list.

435
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:14,649
Willow is out there. She probably
doesn't know what she's doing.

436
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:18,282
- We gotta find her.
- Before somebody gets really hurt.

437
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:36,847
- Why does he have to come?
- Spike will be my husband. I want him here.

438
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:39,731
I agree with Xander.
It's work for people who aren't us.

439
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:42,327
Spike, these are my friends.
Besides, it's my job.

440
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:45,246
- For now.
- What? You want me to stop working?

441
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:48,848
Do I want you to give up killing my
friends? I've given it some thought.

442
00:33:51,773 --> 00:33:54,082
- This was burned.
- D'Hoffryn.

443
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:57,688
- Bastard. He's opened a portal here.
- Who?

444
00:33:57,773 --> 00:34:01,482
Fluffy. Wear this to the rehearsal dinner
and the whole thing's off.

445
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,131
Shut up, honey.

446
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:06,523
D'Hoffryn. He made me
a demon 1120 years ago.

447
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:09,844
- Why would he attack Willow?
- I don't believe he did.

448
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,363
You have much anger and pain.

449
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:19,481
Your magic is strong, but your pain, it's
like a scream that pierces dimensional walls.

450
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:22,202
We heard your call.

451
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,842
I'm sorry. I'll try for a quiet rage.

452
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:28,524
Bye.

453
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:33,004
Our intention is not to quash your potential.
Quite the contrary.

454
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,730
I'd been dumped, I was miserable,
doing a few vengeance spells.

455
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:44,408
- Boils on the penis, nothing fancy.
- Please skip ahead.

456
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:47,007
D'Hoffryn got wind of me.
He offered to elevate me.

457
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:49,812
- Meaning?
- They made me a demon.

458
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:53,408
Oh, God. Willow. But you can summon him
from his crypt and make him stop?

459
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:57,691
- Isn't this a perfect place for pictures?
- I'm not posing for chuff all.

460
00:34:57,773 --> 00:34:59,047
Demon.

461
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:08,444
OK, listen. Now we're gonna do this
without destroying the foliage.

462
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,764
Let's go.

463
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,609
Spike.

464
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:44,570
Blessed be the name of D'Hoffryn.

465
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:49,522
Let this space be now a gateway to the world
of Arashmahar, where demons respond.

466
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:54,245
The pain and suffering you brought
upon those you love has been inspired.

467
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,291
You are ready to join us here in Arashmahar.

468
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:59,568
Pain? What pain?

469
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:03,608
- Buffy.
- Not doing well here.

470
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,888
We come in supplication.

471
00:36:05,973 --> 00:36:08,806
We bend as the reed in the flow of...

472
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:12,442
No, wait. We come in the flow of...

473
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:15,165
Blessed be the name of D'Hoffryn.

474
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:22,723
They're strong and I can't fight.
If they get in, I don't know if I can protect you.

475
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,772
- You think you have to protect me?
- Not with the Girl Power bit.

476
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:09,606
Oh, God. But I didn't mean to.

477
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:13,527
But you did. This is the result of your power.

478
00:37:13,613 --> 00:37:15,729
You will make a fine vengeance demon.

479
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:18,168
No, please. You have to help them.

480
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:20,926
It is not my concern.

481
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:24,086
You are my interest in this matter.

482
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:28,529
Really, no offence intended...

483
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:33,004
I mean, you've been super-nice and
everything, but I don't wanna be a demon.

484
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:35,323
I just wanna go back and help my friends.

485
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:37,843
- That is your answer?
- It is.

486
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:41,084
I'm sorry to hear that.

487
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:45,251
Oh, well. Here is my talisman.

488
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,925
You change your mind, give us a chant.

489
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:01,969
Honey.

490
00:38:02,653 --> 00:38:04,644
Spike, are you OK?

491
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:08,328
Slayer.

492
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:13,764
A little help here.

493
00:38:20,893 --> 00:38:23,566
Let the healing power begin.

494
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:25,928
Let my will be safe again.

495
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:30,643
As these words of peace are spoken,
let this harmful spell be broken.

496
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,769
Bloody hell.

497
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:47,610
Spike lips. Lips of Spike.

498
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:57,364
Hi, guys.

499
00:39:00,693 --> 00:39:03,526
How long are you
going to keep making these?

500
00:39:03,613 --> 00:39:06,411
Until I don't feel so horribly guilty.

501
00:39:06,493 --> 00:39:08,927
I figure, about a million chips from now.

502
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,891
Also, I have to detail Giles's car.

503
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,483
Time.

504
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:19,690
- Five past two. Clear as day.
- Look, cookies.

505
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:23,129
A very not-evil thing I did. Oatmeal?

506
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:27,124
Yes, very funny.
They're chocolate chip. I can see them.

507
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:31,570
I still need my glasses, though. You could
be more specific and give me 20/20.

508
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:33,644
Eat a cookie, ease my pain?

509
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,010
Better?

510
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:43,406
Well, baking lifts about 30 per cent of my
guilt, but only 7 per cent of my inner turmoil.

511
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:46,889
- Guess that'll just take a while.
- It'll happen.

512
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:50,769
- Don't I get a cookie?
- No.

513
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:53,568
Well, I gotta have something.

514
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:57,805
- I still have Buffy taste in my mouth.
- You're a pig, Spike.

515
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:04,165
Yeah? Well, I'm not the one who wanted
"Wind Beneath My Wings" for the first dance.

516
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:10,051
That was the spell.

517
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:19,243
Did I mention about the sorry part?

518
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:22,087
We may be into a forgetting spell later.

519
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:26,091
I loved him. We were betrothed.

520
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:29,203
Well, at least you were getting along.

521
00:40:29,413 --> 00:40:33,804
But we weren't. It wasn't even nice.
And the bad-boy thing? Over it.

522
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:40,685
OK, I totally get it. I'd be really happy to be in
a nice relationship with a decent, reliable...

523
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:43,970
- Oh, my God. Riley thinks I'm engaged.
- What?

524
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:47,489
Riley. He saw me.
What the hell am I gonna say to him?

525
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:52,167
- You thought I was serious?
- Well, no...

526
00:40:53,653 --> 00:40:56,725
- You weren't serious?
- Oh, God, please.

527
00:40:56,813 --> 00:40:59,771
- I'm marrying a guy named Spike?
- Maybe.

528
00:40:59,853 --> 00:41:02,651
We haven't known each other that long.

529
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:07,602
No, I saw that fear in your eyes when you
caught me looking at wedding dresses.

530
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:11,732
- I had to give you a hard time.
- I did not have fear in my eyes.

531
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:17,809
Yes, you did. You were looking at me
like I was a cartoon ball and chain.

532
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:21,329
So you decided to tell me
you were getting married?

533
00:41:23,373 --> 00:41:25,250
So you're insane?

534
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,448
But you're still single?

535
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:33,047
Yes.

536
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:37,445
OK, then. Just another
little piece of the Buffy puzzle.

537
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:41,370
You really have a lot
to learn about women, Riley.

538
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:48,803
You're gonna teach me.

539
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:08,811
