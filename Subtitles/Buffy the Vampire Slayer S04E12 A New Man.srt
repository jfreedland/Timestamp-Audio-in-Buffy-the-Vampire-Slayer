00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:05,489
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,449
- How long have you been practising?
- Since I was little.

3
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:13,003
Agent Finn is in charge of this operation.
I'm counting on you, Riley.

4
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,972
I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.

5
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:18,969
No pain.

6
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,328
I can hurt a demon.

7
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:24,962
You really have a lot to learn
about women, Riley.

8
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:27,132
You're gonna teach me.

9
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:34,529
- What are you?
- I'm the Slayer.

11
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,131
Not expecting anyone, are we?

12
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:56,922
Willow said she was gonna be
at the science library all night.

13
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:59,004
Is that right?

14
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,009
- Apparently not.
- We got trouble.

15
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:15,369
- What is it?
- I was in the rec room. It came in the window.

16
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:18,286
- Vampire?
- Vampires don't breathe fire.

17
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:21,522
- I should call for backup.
- No time.

18
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:26,084
We have to make this fast.
I have better things to do tonight than kill.

19
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:31,487
Surprise.

20
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,610
Surprise.

21
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:40,013
Guess you won't be killing anything tonight.

22
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:42,129
Don't be so sure.

23
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:39,684
This is a lively space.

24
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,644
It's like an activity room
we had at public school.

25
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:49,248
I... One time I got up to a bit
of a prank with the dartboard.

26
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,882
- I'm bored. Let's eat.
- Anya, we've talked about this.

27
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,169
I'm sorry. That was rude.

28
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:00,048
Please continue your story.

29
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:03,848
Hopefully it involves
treacle and a headmaster.

30
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,493
- Go and eat.
- OK.

31
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:15,208
Giles. Hi. Havin' a good time?

32
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:18,251
Yes, yes. There's a lot
of new faces here, aren't there?

33
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:21,924
Yeah. Mostly kids from the dorm.
A couple of Riley's friends.

34
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,649
- Hi, Giles.
- Buffy.

35
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,292
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

36
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:30,161
- 19. It's hard to believe.
- There's someone I want you to meet.

37
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,813
This is Riley Finn.

38
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:36,442
- My boyfriend.
- Very nice to meet you, Mr Giles.

39
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,967
Did you help plan this?
It was quite a surprise.

40
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,805
The first of many.

41
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:44,203
- Been dating long?
- Giles was the librarian at my high school.

42
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:47,842
Ah. I've seen the library.
It's gone downhill since you left.

43
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,209
I'm embarrassed to say
that I actually miss it at times.

44
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:54,452
- So, you're retired?
- I'm sorry?

45
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:57,886
Or, you're working somewhere else now?

46
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:59,691
Well, not...

47
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:03,686
I'm sort of between projects right now.
It's a personal...

48
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:06,890
Oh! Oh, look. Giles has no cake.

49
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,168
Oh, here. Here, I'll get you a piece.

50
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:13,845
He's just nervous.

51
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:17,323
But this is so nice.
Having everyone together for my birthday.

52
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:19,802
Of course, you could smash
my toes with a hammer

53
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,010
and it would still be the bestest
Buffy birthday bash in a while.

54
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:24,321
Right.

55
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:28,201
Actually, Willow and Xander
did all the planning.

56
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:31,046
I'm not sure I would've gone
with a surprise party.

57
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:34,523
You know, you have enough things
jumping out at you in the dark.

58
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:39,448
Professor Walsh says adrenaline is like
exercise, but without the exorbitant gym fees.

59
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:41,524
- Very witty.
- You should meet her.

60
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:45,049
She's absolutely
the smartest person I've ever met.

61
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,647
Perhaps we should've
invited Professor Walsh.

62
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,122
Oh, no. I mean, she's, like, 40.

63
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:52,807
She's got better things to do
than hang out with kids.

64
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,884
Here you go, sir.

65
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:59,491
You own nothing.
This shouldn't be taking so long.

66
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:02,167
Hang on. Let a fella get organised.

67
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,331
That's my radio.

68
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:07,723
And you're what?
Shocked and disappointed? I'm evil.

69
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:12,204
- So what kind of place are you looking for?
- I don't know. Maybe a crypt.

70
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:15,205
Some place, you know, dark and dank.

71
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:19,252
- But not as dark and dank as this.
- It's pretty depressing, isn't it?

72
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,928
I've known corpses with a fresher smell.
In fact, I've been one.

73
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:25,084
That's it. Let's go.

74
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:29,724
Wait. I wanna give you something
for your new place.

75
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:32,008
That's my lamp.

76
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,846
A gift is traditional. I've read about it.

77
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:38,721
That's among friends. With bitter enemies,
we don't give them my lamp.

78
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:42,408
It's not gonna have electricity anyway.
It's a crypt, remember?

79
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:45,963
What about running water?
A fridge to keep your blood fresh?

80
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,613
- No.
- Oh. Well, that's gotta suck.

81
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:54,007
- You should just get a hotel room.
- Demon Girl's got a point. I need fresh blood.

82
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:56,561
If I had a few bob
for a room with an honour bar...

83
00:05:56,653 --> 00:06:00,566
Out. Before I get the Slayer over here
to kick your ass out.

84
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:05,044
Don't know why she didn't come.
Say goodbye, shed a few tears...

85
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:08,762
Well, she has an appointment
with someone who's actually still scary.

86
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:11,208
So, the Slayer.

87
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,523
Yeah. That's me.

88
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:18,410
- We thought you were a myth.
- Well, you were myth-taken.

89
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:23,442
And to think, all that time you were sitting
in my class. Well, most of those times.

90
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,366
I always knew you could
do better than a B minus.

91
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:30,526
Now I understand your energies were
directed to the same place as ours, in fact.

92
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:32,524
It's only our methods that differ.

93
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:36,845
We use the latest in scientific technology
and state-of-the-art weaponry,

94
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,846
and you, if I understand correctly,
poke them with a sharp stick.

95
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:46,731
- Oh, it's more effective than it sounds.
- Oh, I'm quite sure of that.

96
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:50,010
As I'm just as sure
we can learn much from each other.

97
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,812
I'm working on getting you
clearance for the Initiative.

98
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:56,283
I think you'll find the results
of our operation most impressive.

99
00:06:56,373 --> 00:07:00,286
Agent Finn here alone has killed
or captured... How many is it?

100
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,972
17. 11 vampires, 6 demons.

101
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:10,363
I mean, that's 17.

102
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,283
- What about you?
- Me?

103
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:17,252
How many hostiles
would you say you've slain?

104
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:46,650
"Third new moon after the
900th Feast of Delthrox."

105
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:51,289
Oh, crap.

106
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:53,329
No, we can't wait for her, Willow.

107
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:56,883
The demon Prince Barvain
is going to rise tonight.

108
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:59,931
Well, where is she, exactly?

109
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:09,205
Those were my best stories. And I didn't
tell you the "Buffy breaks her butt" stories.

110
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,409
But you killed the...

111
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,484
You did the thing with that...

112
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:16,809
You drowned.

113
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:18,804
And the snake?

114
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:22,124
Not to mention the daily slayage of...

115
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,406
It's no big, really. Hey, who wants ice cream?

116
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:31,010
Buffy...

117
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:35,202
When I saw you stop the world
from, you know, ending,

118
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:37,682
I just assumed that was a big week for you.

119
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:42,403
Turns out I suddenly find myself
needing to know the plural of apocalypse.

120
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:47,572
Look, if you'd been fighting since
you were 15, you'd have a hefty résumé too.

121
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,486
- 15?
- I know, wow.

122
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:54,532
The point is that we have different
amounts of experience, you know.

123
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:57,685
Plus, I do have that preternatural
slayer-strength deal.

124
00:08:57,773 --> 00:08:59,491
I've seen.

125
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,929
Don't get me wrong.
Girls I grew up with could hold their own.

126
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:06,642
But... Well, I'm not even sure I could take you.

127
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:09,611
That all depends on your meaning.

128
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:16,884
Yeah?

129
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:20,652
Professor Walsh, I presume.

130
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:24,567
You're hard to find.
These halls are quite the labyrinth.

131
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:29,283
I felt like Theseus and
the Minotaur in the labyrinth.

132
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:33,323
Can I help you with something, Mr...?

133
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:35,604
Giles. Rupert.

134
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:40,131
I'm looking for Buffy Summers.
I'm a friend of hers.

135
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:44,610
And I was her high-school librarian.

136
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:48,130
I'm sorry, Buffy's not here.
But, if I see her...

137
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:53,333
Buffy's been very influenced by your course.
She quotes you quite often.

138
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:57,292
Sometimes she sounds a bit like
an introductory textbook herself.

139
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:01,525
I don't lecture from the textbook.
But I'm glad she's inspired by the material.

140
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:06,004
She's bright. All she's really been lacking
is encouragement in the academic setting.

141
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:08,653
Erm, I think it's best if...

142
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:13,642
if we let a young person
find their own strengths.

143
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:17,965
If you lead a child by the hand,
then they'll never find their own footing.

144
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:21,888
And if it's true about hiking,
ergo it must be true about life.

145
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:25,523
Well, that's not...

146
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:29,652
I'm just saying Buffy is a...
Well, she's not the typical student.

147
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:33,487
Once you get to know her,
she's a very unique girl.

148
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:36,963
- I hope you're not going to push her.
- I think I do know her.

149
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:41,126
- And I have found her to be a unique woman.
- Woman. Of course.

150
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:43,727
- She's self-reliant, independent...
- Exactly.

151
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:46,373
Which is not always a good thing.

152
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:50,450
I think it can be unhealthy
to take on adult roles too early.

153
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:55,163
What I suspect I'm seeing is a reaction
to the absence of a male role model.

154
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,643
- Absence?
- Buffy clearly lacks a strong father figure.

155
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:06,402
I'm sorry, I have things to do.
I'll tell Buffy her friend was looking for her.

156
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:17,722
This prince-demon guy was supposed
to rise at sunset, so aren't we, like, late?

157
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:21,567
Well, if I hadn't had to search for
Ms Summers and battle that harridan...

158
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:25,441
- And if you hadn't gotten lost afterwards...
- I'll just take care of it myself.

159
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,922
I've vanquished a few demons in my day.

160
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:33,133
Course, we may be entirely too late -
demon on the loose, carnage everywhere...

161
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:41,363
Your better demons
will clean up after themselves.

162
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:43,603
I don't understand.

163
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:47,163
There should be ruptured earth
and broken stone.

164
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:53,085
Oh, well, apparently it hasn't happened yet.
A bit of luck.

165
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:57,212
Or... You know what I bet?
I bet the Initiative took care of it.

166
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:00,524
- Who?
- Oh, Riley and his guys. Probably all over it.

167
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:05,245
Yeah. It has that too-neat look.
They must've cleaned up the place.

168
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:06,323
What?

169
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:10,088
Oh, they raid hot spots -
areas of otherworldly energy.

170
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:12,641
They must've picked this place up days ago.

171
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,008
Stop, both of you. What...

172
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:18,403
What are you talking about?
What's the Initiative?

173
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:22,372
What on earth does it have to do
with Buffy's new boyfriend?

174
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:25,172
You know. I'm sure you know.

175
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:28,404
Riley's one of the commandos.

176
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,290
What?

177
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:33,283
Well, that's marvellous, isn't it?

178
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:36,763
I've spent weeks trying to get
a single scrap of information

179
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:39,128
about our mysterious
demon collectors,

180
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:42,171
and no one bothers to tell me
Buffy's dating one of them?

181
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:46,041
- Who else knows?
- No one. No one else knows this.

182
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,648
Anya, and that's it.

183
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,446
- And Spike.
- Spike?

184
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,172
- Spike knew?
- Only the basic stuff.

185
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:59,563
You know, that Riley is a commando
and Professor Walsh is in charge...

186
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,770
Professor Walsh? That fishwife?

187
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:06,368
You know, she's actually
not that bad once you get...

188
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,206
So, the demon's probably a little late.

189
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:12,410
- We'll just, you know...
- Oh, forget it.

190
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:17,603
Go on, you two clear off.
I'll stay a little longerjust in case.

191
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:20,089
You sure? Cos we could stay.

192
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:22,164
No. Go.

193
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:31,488
Who am I kidding?

194
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:40,248
Nothing is going to happen.

195
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,408
I wouldn't say that.

196
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,004
I wouldn't say that at all.

197
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:53,325
In fact, Ripper, old mate, I'd say something
rather interesting was about to hap...

198
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:56,007
- Did someone...?
- Oh, bugger. I thought you'd gone.

199
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:02,083
Ethan Rayne.

200
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:07,732
You have no idea how much thrashing you
is going to improve my day.

201
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,005
No. No, wait. Hang on.

202
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:18,846
You can beat the crap out of me.
Go ahead, I can't stop you.

203
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:22,642
Or you can listen to what I have to say.
Find out what's going on.

204
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,203
- What are you talking about?
- Something bad's happening. For both of us.

205
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,488
- Bad for you.
- No, no, no. You have to listen.

206
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:31,451
You're going to need time to prepare.

207
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,246
Brilliant.

208
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,803
- Isn't this more fun than kicking my arse?
- No.

209
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:40,805
Oh. Well, it's more fun for me.

210
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,522
Just tell me what you want to tell me.

211
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:47,688
Oh, so cross. We used to be friends, Ripper.

212
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:51,048
When did all that fall apart?

213
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,727
About the same time
you started to worship chaos.

214
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:57,522
Oh, religious intolerance. Sad, that.

215
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:00,127
I mean, just look at the Irish Troubles.

216
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:02,842
Oh, hang on, I'll tell ya.

217
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:09,842
There's something happening
in the dark worlds.

218
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:15,530
It's all whispers and rumours out there, but
only one thing's coming through clear,

219
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:17,922
that something's harming demons.

220
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,562
And it's not the Slayer.

221
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,611
- Know anything about it?
- What are they saying?

222
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:27,971
Oh, you know demons.
It's all exaggeration and blank verse.

223
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,090
"Pain as bright as steel", things like that.

224
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:34,244
They're scared.

225
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,681
There's something called "314"
that's got 'em scared most of all.

226
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:41,492
The kind of scared that turns to angry.

227
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:46,408
I know we're not particularly
fond of each other, Rupert,

228
00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:49,848
but we are a couple of old mystics.

229
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:54,165
This new outfit, it's blundering
into places it doesn't belong.

230
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:59,202
It's throwing the worlds out of balance.
And that's way beyond chaos, mate.

231
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:03,892
We're headed, quite literally,
for one hell of a fight.

232
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,003
Are you holding back?

233
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,211
Are you?

234
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:25,124
Maybe a little.

235
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,044
Maybe a little too.

236
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,847
- I'll go all out if you will.
- Are you sure?

237
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:38,725
Here we go.

238
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,724
Riley.

239
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:56,644
Are you hurt?

240
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,450
I...

241
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:05,087
- I don't think so.
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...

242
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,164
It's fine.

243
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,971
I'm good.

244
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:14,406
D'you know what gets me?
This is what gets me.

245
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:20,366
20 years I've been fighting demons. Maggie
Walsh and her nancy ninja boys come in,

246
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:24,924
and six months later the demons
are pissing themselves with fear.

247
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:26,924
They never even noticed me.

248
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,925
- Who's Maggie Walsh?
- Oh, she's awful.

249
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:33,610
She said I was an absent male role model.

250
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:36,412
Absent, my arse. I'm twice the man she is.

251
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:39,485
You know, you're really very attractive.

252
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:43,531
Here's my... my name and number.

253
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:49,368
You give me a call,
and I'll show you a good time.

254
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:52,604
- Yeah, thanks.
- We've gotta face it, we've changed.

255
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:56,686
Well, not you. You're still
sadistic and self-centred.

256
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:59,731
- Here's to me.
- The world has passed us by.

257
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:05,809
Someone snuck in and left this couple
of clapped-out has-beens in our place.

258
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:08,886
I mean, this Initiative...

259
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:13,091
Their methods may be causing problems,
but they're getting the job done.

260
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:17,371
What am I? I'm an unemployed librarian
with a tendency to get knocked on the head.

261
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:20,411
Well, you won't have to worry
about that any more, mate.

262
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:25,521
When you went to the loo, I slipped poison
in your drink. You'll be dead in an hour.

263
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:31,565
Just kidding.

264
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:40,650
- I'm gonna feel like hell in the morning.
- Relax.

265
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:43,484
Enjoy the night.

266
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:48,246
We're still a couple of sorcerers.
The night is still our time.

267
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,650
- Time of magic.
- To magic.

268
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:59,329
I'm glad you wanted to get together.
I know it's late.

269
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:00,812
I...

270
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:03,292
Thanks.

271
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,603
I was happy you called.

272
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,486
- We'll start out slow.
- OK.

273
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:21,125
- Willow?
- Yeah.

274
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:23,408
Start out slow doing what?

275
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:28,808
We're gonna float the rose,

276
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:33,887
then use the magics
to pluck the petals off, one at a time.

277
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,850
It's a test of synchronicity.

278
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:41,371
Our minds have to be perfectly attuned
to work as a single delicate implement.

279
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:43,847
Cool.

280
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,367
And it should be very pretty.

281
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:28,968
It worked.

282
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,567
Now for the hard part. The petals.

283
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,449
What the heck was that?

284
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:47,366
I don't know, but the petals are off.

285
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:05,285
I knew I'd feel like hell in the morning.

286
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:19,964
Wha...?

287
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:22,090
What?

288
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:23,931
No.

289
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:31,330
Damn.

290
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:39,650
Ethan.

291
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:02,122
Oh. And I liked that shirt.

292
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,689
I like pancakes cos they're stackable.

293
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:21,891
Ooh, and waffles, cos you can put things
in the little holes if you wanted to.

294
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,568
You should always have a new boyfriend.
You're so much fun right now.

295
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:29,441
Hey, I didn't hear you come in last night.
Where were you?

296
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:31,524
The chem lab, by myself.

297
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:36,971
I was trying this new spell, floating a rose,
when all of a sudden, zing, zing, zing.

298
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:41,126
Like, all around the room.
It was like a rose-based missile.

299
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:43,090
- Yikes.
- I know.

300
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:46,643
I think there's something out there.
I felt this presence,

301
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:52,365
this dark-magics energy
blocking the spell. It's new.

302
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:54,604
Someone else doing magics?

303
00:22:54,693 --> 00:22:57,446
Maybe. If so, it's someone pretty powerful.

304
00:22:57,853 --> 00:23:01,562
Mm. I'll tell Giles about it.
Or maybe I'll tell Maggie.

305
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:05,248
She seemed interested in the mystical
side of the demon-hunting biz.

306
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,564
Tell Giles. He's feeling a little hurt right now.

307
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:12,091
How come you never told him
about Riley bein' a commando?

308
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:14,209
Did.

309
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:16,922
- I didn't?
- He says no.

310
00:23:17,013 --> 00:23:19,652
He's feeling neglected
and out-of-the-Ioop-y.

311
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:23,248
Well, I mean, I didn't at first
because Riley said not to, and...

312
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:27,804
And then, miaow, cat out of the bag,
and I guess I just forgot that he didn't know.

313
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:31,602
I'll make it up to him when I see him.
Tomorrow. I'm spending today with Riley.

314
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:36,209
Oh, yeah, I forgot - that's what you always do
on the days when the earth rotates.

315
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:38,523
It's just going so well right now.

316
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:40,888
I think. I hope.

317
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:46,643
I sort of kicked him
across the room last night.

318
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,212
Um, that's not good.

319
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,927
We were sparring
and he said not to hold back.

320
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,844
And he's a little dented.

321
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:56,005
But he said he was OK with it.
And I think he's OK with it.

322
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:58,971
- Do you think he's OK with it?
- I'm sure he is.

323
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:02,045
I mean, if he's not,
you know, you had to do it.

324
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:05,682
He's right. You can't walk around
pretending you're less than you are.

325
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:09,163
- It wouldn't be right for you to hold back.
- Right.

326
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:14,292
- What?
- I held back a little.

327
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:26,643
Still asleep?

328
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:30,882
It's 10.30 in the morning.

329
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:36,450
Xander?

330
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,009
Xander, wake up.

331
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,083
- Mom?
- No, it's not Mom.

332
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:47,530
Now, when you look at me,
you may be a little alarmed.

333
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,922
But there's no need. It's me, Giles.

334
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:54,281
Now, Ethan has turned me
into a demon, and I need your help.

335
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,483
Hello. Yes, it's me.

336
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,328
Xander, listen. Don't you understand me?

337
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,043
Demon. Demon.

338
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:12,770
Please, don't you understand?

339
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:15,572
No. No, don't. Xander, calm down.
No, just...

340
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:18,571
Ow. You're just a little overwrought. Ow.

341
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:28,207
That's right. Run for your life.

342
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:36,482
- I'm sorry.
- Call 911.

343
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:39,531
Bloody humans.

344
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:49,053
So it had pointy things.
What kind of pointy things?

345
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:52,523
The pointy kind. And tufty ears.
And maybe a saucepan-shaped bruise.

346
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:55,002
Giles will know what it was.

347
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:01,844
Giles?

348
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:09,167
Looks like Xander
wasn't the only one to get a visit.

349
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:11,847
- He's not upstairs.
- Oh, God, Giles.

350
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:16,571
OK. There's a demon and Giles is gone.
But it doesn't mean that he's hurt.

351
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:21,773
I mean, there's no blood anywhere, so
maybe the demon just took him somewhere.

352
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:24,162
I think it ate him up.

353
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:32,564
Well.

354
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:36,206
What do I spy with my little eye?

355
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:41,048
A demon.

356
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:45,172
That would be...
Oh, right. The things I can kill.

357
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:50,643
Spike. Wonderful.
The perfect end to a perfect day.

358
00:26:51,773 --> 00:26:54,970
- Giles?
- Go on, then. Let's get on with the fighting.

359
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,967
- You understand me.
- Of course I understand you.

360
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:03,046
- I'm speaking English?
- No, you're speaking Fyarl. I speak Fyarl.

361
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:06,808
And, by the way, why the hell
are you suddenly a Fyarl demon?

362
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:09,168
You just come over
all demony this morning?

363
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,051
As a matter of fact, I did.
Thanks to Ethan Rayne.

364
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,805
You have to help me find him.

365
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:17,522
He must undo this, and then
he needs a good being killed.

366
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:21,606
And I'm supposed to just help you
out of the evilness of my heart?

367
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:25,688
You help me and I... I don't kill you.

368
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:30,893
Oh, tremendously convincing.
Try it again without the stutter.

369
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:32,884
Money. I could pay you money.

370
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:35,646
Oh. I like money. How much?

371
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:37,052
$100?

372
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:41,126
$100? You'll have to do a lot better than that.

373
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:44,563
- 200.
- Fine.

374
00:27:45,093 --> 00:27:49,132
Right, then. What's first? I tell the Slayer
what you've gotten yourself into?

375
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:55,004
No. When I find Ethan I can clear all this up
without Buffy ever having to find out.

376
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,972
OK, that's a giant vulture.
I'd have mentioned if it was a giant vulture.

377
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:07,286
Buffy, even if we figure out what kind of
demon got Giles, how are we gonna find it?

378
00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:08,931
We'll figure it out.

379
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,811
Oh. This one has tufty ears.

380
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:16,804
What was that?

381
00:28:25,013 --> 00:28:29,165
- Buffy.
- Riley. What are you doing here?

382
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:32,962
There were 911 calls from a couple
of different places. Including here.

383
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:36,329
- You get 911 calls?
- We have a tap into the system.

384
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:40,884
It flags things with possible
nonhuman causes. We check 'em out.

385
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:45,205
- What are you doin' here?
- This is Giles' apartment. He's missing.

386
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:50,286
- The calls. Did anyone see what did it?
- Negative. No.

387
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:54,412
Neighbours just heard, you know,
growling and things breaking.

388
00:28:54,493 --> 00:28:57,530
- Sounded like a struggle.
- Poor Giles.

389
00:28:57,613 --> 00:29:00,252
We'll get him back.

390
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:04,167
- What are you workin' on?
- We have stuff. Pictures.

391
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:06,443
We have nothing.

392
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:14,528
I'll help. The whole Initiative.
We'll do whatever you need.

393
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,411
Thanks.

394
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,848
I just wish I knew what I needed.

395
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:22,482
I keep thinking "Let's ask Giles."
Then I remember.

396
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:26,805
He'd be great right now. He'd find himself
in a second. Nobody is cooler in a crisis.

397
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:30,563
If you can't find third gear,
don't try for third gear.

398
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:33,963
I'm doin' my best. I don't know
if I'm drivin' this thing or wearin' it.

399
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:36,044
It's perfectly serviceable.

400
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:40,406
Funny hearing a Fyarl demon
say "serviceable".

401
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:45,692
Had a couple of 'em working for me once.
They're more: "Like to crush. Crush now?"

402
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:49,482
Strong, though. You won't meet ajar
you can't open for the rest of your life.

403
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,847
- What was that? Did you growl?
- No.

404
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:56,888
Listen, about this Fyarl demon.

405
00:29:57,813 --> 00:30:00,281
Do I have special powers?

406
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:03,843
Like setting things on fire
with my sizzling eye beams?

407
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,044
Well, you got the mucus thing.

408
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,044
What? Mucus?

409
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:11,603
Paralysing mucus.
Shoots out through the nose. Sets up fast.

410
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:13,763
Hard as rock. Pretty good in a fight.

411
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,526
- Are you making this up?
- Maybe.

412
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:19,286
But, hey, if you feel a sneeze
comin' on, you warn me.

413
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:23,250
Turn here.

414
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:26,131
- Downshift. Downshift.
- Calm down, will you?

415
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:29,888
I'm not sure I can.
I feel like I'm changing.

416
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:32,802
Fine with me. So long as you pay me.

417
00:30:33,173 --> 00:30:38,088
I don't like this feeling.
A sort of mindless need to destroy.

418
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:41,369
This anger. Rage.

419
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,569
Good times. Go with it.

420
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:44,802
No.

421
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:49,409
It's fun. I can't do it. Do it for me.
Oh, let yourself go.

422
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:52,451
I refuse to become a monster
because I look like a monster.

423
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:56,731
I have a soul. I have a conscience.
I am a human being.

424
00:30:57,493 --> 00:30:59,484
Oh, stop the car.

425
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:19,210
Right, let's go, then.

426
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:23,326
That's the thing that attacked me.

427
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:27,167
A Fyarl demon.
Sort of a foot-soldier type,

428
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:33,852
works for other demons lots of the time.
Very strong... And, hey, mucus.

429
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,924
Mucus?

430
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:41,290
Agent Finn. Go ahead.

431
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:44,763
- How do I kill it?
- Silver. A weapon made of silver.

432
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:46,252
Yes.

433
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:48,724
I understand.

434
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:52,967
The demon attacked Professor Walsh.
It got out of a small, grey car. A Citroen.

435
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:54,805
It stole Giles' car.

436
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:59,489
- Why would a demon steal a car?
- Why would a demon steal that car?

437
00:31:59,573 --> 00:32:03,691
A demon that steals a car has a reason.
A purpose.

438
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:08,404
But it doesn't sound like these Fyarl demons
are really big independent thinkers.

439
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:11,725
So, Will, the spells that are going wrong,

440
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:14,964
could they be caused by someone
using magics to control a demon?

441
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:17,442
Making this Fyarl demon attack Giles?

442
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:20,331
Yeah. Yes, that would
draw in a lot of dark energy.

443
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:22,843
OK. Willow, Xander, stay here.

444
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:26,369
Whoever it is may call and ask for a ransom.
Give 'em anything they want.

445
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:30,924
- You got it.
- Riley, we're going to the magic shop.

446
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:34,368
Something silver...

447
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,762
A letter opener? It's not very sharp.

448
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:39,845
Then I'll have to put some muscle behind it.

449
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:45,606
Two of them. English, like me.

450
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:48,127
But older, less attractive.

451
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:51,371
- One of them gave you his number.
- I threw it out.

452
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:55,765
I mean, I took one look and saw
he was staying at that rat-trap. No, thanks.

453
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:56,968
Which rat-trap?

454
00:32:57,053 --> 00:32:59,521
The one by the highway.
The Sunnydale Motor Inn.

455
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:00,932
Thank you.

456
00:33:03,373 --> 00:33:06,763
OK. Credit-card slips,
sales receipts... Help me look.

457
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:11,085
- You shouldn't have done that to the door.
- I do not have time to play by the rules.

458
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:14,131
I have a master key.
It opens every shop on Main Street.

459
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,648
Well, next time, absolutely.

460
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:19,963
I don't know what I'm lookin' for.

461
00:33:20,053 --> 00:33:23,170
I do. Ethan Rayne.

462
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,403
- Who's that?
- Professional bad guy.

463
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:29,452
He's gotta be the guy
that made the demon attack Giles.

464
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:32,366
- Command, are you there?
- What are you doing?

465
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:34,091
It's Finn. I need a search.

466
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:37,449
Local hotel registrations
matching the name Ethan Rayne.

467
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,922
R-a-y-n-e. Call me back.

468
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,131
- You can do that?
- It'll take a couple of minutes.

469
00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:46,204
Get in the car. I'm ready to go.

470
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:47,442
Buffy.

471
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:51,811
Earlier, when I talked to Professor Walsh,
she gave me very specific orders.

472
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:52,882
Yeah?

473
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:58,483
She said when we located the demon,
I... I'm not supposed to bring you along.

474
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:01,162
What are you doing?

475
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:03,767
- I'm going to the car.
- I can't take you with me.

476
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:07,243
You're not taking me with you.
I am going and I am letting you come along.

477
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,370
Buffy, it's not your call.
This is a military operation now.

478
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:13,968
Then call out the troops.
Because nothing less is gonna stop me.

479
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:17,966
This demon did something to Giles,
and I'm gonna kill it.

480
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:30,763
- How are you feelin', mate?
- Like snapping necks until everyone's dead.

481
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:33,890
Now that sounds like a Fyarl demon.
Good for you.

482
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:40,012
- Hey, picked up a tail.
- Yes. Just a little one. It hurts when I sit.

483
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:43,290
I mean someone's following us.
Humvee. Military.

484
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:48,851
- Well, speed up. Lose them.
- I've got it floored. Why'd you buy this car?

485
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:51,845
Do something. If they catch us,
we'll both end up in a lab.

486
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,685
It's getting closer.

487
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:58,404
- And it's got a friend.
- Damn.

488
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:01,565
Oh, sure. Dismantle the getaway car.
That'll scare 'em.

489
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:03,962
Slow down. I'll jump out. They'll follow you.

490
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:06,931
Hold on. These commandos are after me too.

491
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:09,481
Maybe I want you around
to split their attention.

492
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:11,723
I'll pay you another $100.

493
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:31,642
Giles?

494
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:37,085
Now, it... Calm down. It's OK.

495
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:39,011
Good Giles.

496
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:43,488
No. No. Don't kill me.
No. Don't kill me. Giles...

497
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:46,531
I can't undo you if you kill me.

498
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:53,729
You've gotta stop it.
It killed Ripper and now it's trying to get me.

499
00:35:53,813 --> 00:35:55,963
Don't let him go.

500
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:01,211
What did you do to him?
What did you do?

501
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:19,807
You just try and stop me,
you stupid jarheads.

502
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,487
You're only gonna make him angry.

503
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:00,369
- This is for Giles.
- For me?

504
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:06,044
Oh, God. Giles?

505
00:37:08,453 --> 00:37:10,967
Oh, God. Giles. Giles.

506
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:13,692
I'm... I'm so sorry. Please don't die.

507
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:17,562
Actually, I feel quite well. Except for the rage.

508
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:19,924
I think he's OK.

509
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:22,925
Is this thing real silver?

510
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:26,244
I've really got to learn to just do the damage
and get out of town.

511
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:29,325
It's the "stay and gloat" - gets me every time.

512
00:37:37,573 --> 00:37:39,689
You OK?

513
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:42,731
Oh, embarrassed, mostly.

514
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:46,088
Ethan's wardrobe's not helping any.

515
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:50,327
How did you know it was me?

516
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,844
Your eyes.

517
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:57,809
You're the only person in the world
that can look that annoyed with me.

518
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:03,372
This gonna go on much longer?
I'd rather like to be going.

519
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:08,562
- And why would I let you go?
- Well, maybe because you have no choice.

520
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,965
I'm human. You can't kill me.
What's a slayer gonna do to me?

521
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:18,127
The US military is taking you into custody,
pending a determination of your status.

522
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:21,567
- We'll take it from here.
- Let's go. Move it.

523
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:27,332
They'll take Mr Rayne to a secret
detention facility in the Nevada desert.

524
00:38:27,413 --> 00:38:30,530
I'm sure he'll be rehabilitated in no time.

525
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:37,248
If you don't mind, I'm just gonna go and
watch them manhandle him into a vehicle.

526
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:44,131
- Thanks.
- I told you I'd help.

527
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:45,692
You did.

528
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:49,129
If I'd gotten here any later,
and if Giles had killed Ethan,

529
00:38:49,213 --> 00:38:51,522
I never would've gotten him back.

530
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:54,362
You'd find some other way.

531
00:38:57,733 --> 00:38:59,451
You're really strong.

532
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:03,321
Like, Spider-Man strong.

533
00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:05,728
Yeah.

534
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:08,930
But I don't stick to stuff. But, yeah.

535
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,163
And you're in charge.

536
00:39:11,813 --> 00:39:14,930
You're, like, make the plan, execute the plan...

537
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:17,610
No one givin' you orders.

538
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,010
I'm the Slayer.

539
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:24,129
I like it.

540
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:27,362
Yeah?

541
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:34,127
But give me another week to get ready
and I'll take you down.

542
00:39:39,893 --> 00:39:41,485
Nice phone.

543
00:39:41,573 --> 00:39:43,609
Yes. Fabulous technology.

544
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:46,491
See, if anyone has any information
I need to know,

545
00:39:46,573 --> 00:39:52,443
they can simply tell me about it
through this ingenious speaking tube.

546
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:55,366
- I'm very excited.
- I am sorry, Giles.

547
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:58,923
I really thought I'd told you
about Riley and the Initiative.

548
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:01,447
And I know that it doesn't help.

549
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:05,811
Look, I promise it won't happen again.
I will tell you everything.

550
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:10,528
Buffy, I don't want to ask you
to betray any confidences,

551
00:40:10,613 --> 00:40:15,562
- and I certainly don't want to interfere...
- Uh-oh. You have but-face.

552
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:18,372
You look like you're gonna say "but".

553
00:40:19,493 --> 00:40:22,565
But this Initiative.

554
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:25,129
I'm a little concerned.

555
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:31,288
Ethan's not exactly a reliable source, but
I'm not sure that he's wrong about them.

556
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:35,289
I'm not dating the Initiative.
I'm dating Riley.

557
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:38,171
- He's a good guy.
- And I believe that.

558
00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:42,292
But he's part of something
that we don't really understand.

559
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:46,093
Are you saying this because
you don't like Riley's boss?

560
00:40:46,253 --> 00:40:48,642
No. No, I'm not saying that at all.

561
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:52,286
Though I do hate her quite a lot.

562
00:40:52,373 --> 00:40:56,844
But I want you to have your personal life,
but keep your eyes open.

563
00:40:57,533 --> 00:41:00,570
Make sure you know what you're getting into.

564
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:04,005
So she walks in
and the rules just suddenly break?

565
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:07,285
Pretty much.

566
00:41:07,373 --> 00:41:10,729
Be careful with her. She reacts on instinct.

567
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:13,646
There's no discipline there.
Her Ioyalties are uncertain.

568
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:16,930
You won't be disappointed in her.
She's good at what she does.

569
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:20,926
- And she is the truest soul I've ever known.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

570
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:25,723
Spontaneous poetic exclamations.
Lord, spare me college boys in love.

571
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:29,442
I'm just saying she'll work out.
You'll be proud of her.

572
00:41:30,173 --> 00:41:32,209
You want to know what I think?

573
00:41:33,013 --> 00:41:35,049
I think you're probably right.
