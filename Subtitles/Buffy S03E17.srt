2
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,703
Well.

3
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:26,580
Well.

4
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,380
That was... very...

5
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:30,852
artistic.

6
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:34,017
Yeah.

7
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:36,025
It wasn't what
I expected.

8
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:39,859
I've never actually seen...

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,591
Well, from the title,

10
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:44,190
I thought it
was about food.

11
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:46,133
Well, there was food.

12
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:51,439
Right. Th-The scene
with the... food.

13
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:57,442
So, feel like getting
some hot chocolate

14
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,244
or some cold shower?

15
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:00,544
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:03,246
I wanted to take you out
somewhere fun.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,620
It's been a long time since
I've been to the movies.

18
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:09,056
They've changed.

19
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:11,185
A little scary.

20
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:16,258
And a little not,
which is also scary.

21
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,494
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:21,970
I just don't like getting you
worked up like that.

23
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,304
We can't actually do
any of those things.

24
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,570
You'd lose your soul,

25
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:29,078
and besides, I don't
even own a kimono.

26
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:31,842
Buffy, you don't have
to worry about me.

27
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:35,579
I just don't like
to rub your nose in it.

28
00:01:35,653 --> 00:01:38,417
Suddenly wondering
where that expression comes from.

29
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:41,083
Look, I don't need to see movies
to get worked up.

30
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:42,887
Just being around you
does that just fine.

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,520
It doesn't mean that
I'm gonna lose control,

32
00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:47,996
or that I'm gonna be
frustrated around you.

33
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:50,932
It feels nice just to feel.

34
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,801
It doesn't drive you crazy
when we're close?

35
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:56,533
Watch this.

36
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,249
See?

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,312
Safe as houses.

38
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,956
Check out
the lust bunnies.

39
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:30,304
Patrol?

40
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:34,477
Council has you back
on active duty?

41
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:37,639
Finally.
They want us down by Mercer.

42
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:39,342
OK.

43
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:42,618
Good night.

44
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,182
I'll see you soon.

45
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:48,691
Don't worry, big guy.

46
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,693
Just keeping her warm for you.

47
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,138
I gotta tell you, B.

48
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,538
The willpower thing?
Nice job.

49
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:06,542
Thanks. What?

50
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,545
The "close but no cigar"
deal with Angel.

51
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:12,548
I don't know if I could
handle, you know,

52
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:14,516
the way you're
not handling it.

53
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:17,986
Faith, when it comes to Angel,
do me a favor. Duck!

54
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:18,987
[Groans]

55
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:20,489
Ow! What are you, nuts?

56
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:22,355
Going around
punching people?

57
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:24,394
People?

58
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:27,123
So what, I'm a demon.
That makes it OK?

59
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:28,562
Hold it! Whoa!

60
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:31,430
Stake me now and you'll never
find out what I got for you.

61
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,935
Huh? Think about it.

62
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,233
Demon seeks slayers.
Highly unusual?

63
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:37,939
Talk fast.

64
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,568
How'd you like
to get your hands

65
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:42,475
on the Books of Ascension, huh?

66
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:44,639
Never heard of them.

67
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,512
Books of Ascension...
very powerful works,

68
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:48,711
and I'm not talking
about the prose.

69
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,515
They deal
with some dark stuff,

70
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,749
and the mayor,
he would hate it

71
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:56,122
if somebody got ahold of them
before he... Well, you know.

72
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:58,286
Don't know.
Before he what?

73
00:03:58,362 --> 00:03:59,522
Hey, hey, read 'em
and weep.

74
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:00,894
That's all I got to say.

75
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:02,899
Tomorrow I get the books.

76
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,559
Meet me here,
and if the price is right,

77
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:06,500
well, I give the books
to you.

78
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,561
Not really looking
to trade with a demon.

79
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,539
And if this were still
a barter economy,

80
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:13,304
that would be a problem.
I want cash, princess.

81
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:15,004
5 large for the whole set.

82
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,138
So you can buy...
I'm guessing here...

83
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:18,613
some skin care products?

84
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:21,116
Plane ticket out
of the hellmouth

85
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:23,745
before it's adios, slayer loco.

86
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:26,984
So, 5 G's?
What do you say?

87
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:29,184
I think "Die, fiend,"
sums it up,

88
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,692
wouldn't you say?

89
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,126
Oh, let him go.

90
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:35,063
I don't think he falls into
the deadly threat to humanity category.

91
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:37,066
Demon's a demon.

92
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:40,194
I'd like to know more about
these Books of Ascension.

93
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,831
Anything that would pin
the mayor down would be great.

94
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,843
Yeah... it'd be great.

95
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,013
And what exactly did
this demon look like?

96
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:48,813
Demonic.

97
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:51,480
Ah. And you say he has

98
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:54,115
the Books of Ascension,
or will soon,

99
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:58,287
and he was, what,
willing to sell them?

100
00:05:58,362 --> 00:05:59,727
That's what I said.

101
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:00,728
Hmm.

102
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:02,731
You know what I wish?

103
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:05,893
I wish you'd pull
your hair back.

104
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:08,096
I know, I know, fashion
isn't exactly my thing,

105
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:12,199
but gosh darn it, you know,
you've got such a nice face.

106
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:15,006
I can't understand
why you hide it.

107
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:16,705
Yeah. Sure.

108
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,270
Whatever.

109
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:20,316
It's just a matter
of time

110
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:22,215
before this demon guy's
gonna spill.

111
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:24,447
Then Buffy
and the Super Friends...

112
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:27,217
You worry too much
for a girl your age.

113
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,223
That's unnecessary stress.

114
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,123
Luckily, I've got
just the thing.

115
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:40,068
There you go.

116
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:42,503
Now, first you load up
on calcium,

117
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:45,906
then find this demon,
kill the heck out of him,

118
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:48,069
and bring the books to me.

119
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:51,478
And if Buffy gets to him first?

120
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:55,484
Oh, well, frankly, I don't like
to think about that.

121
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:57,986
I like good, positive,
up thoughts.

122
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:00,683
If you fail me in that way,

123
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:03,521
well, you know, replacing Mr. Trick
was chore enough.

124
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:07,291
Oh, come on, don't worry.
Drink up.

125
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:10,333
There's nothing uncool about
healthy teeth and bones.

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,393
And you say
this demon wanted cash.

127
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,098
That's very unusual.

128
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:17,470
Demons after money.

129
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,066
Whatever happened to
the still-beating heart of a virgin?

130
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:22,134
No one has any
standards anymore.

131
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:24,703
Well, he said the books
were worth the price.

132
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:26,442
What's this ascension mean?

133
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:30,118
I'm not sure.

134
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:32,985
No, not really a common term
in demonology.

135
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:35,650
Ooh, ooh!
The Merenshtadt text!

136
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:38,661
I think in the section
on genocide,

137
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,788
they mention ascension.

138
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:42,661
Well, we have a winner.

139
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,724
And more importantly,
2 losers.

140
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,860
Where did you find
that volume?

141
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:49,167
In the top of
your book cabinet

142
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:52,037
with the stuff
you try to keep hidden.

143
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:55,545
Hidden? Are there any engravings
I should know about?

144
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:57,477
Frolicking nymphs
of some kind?

145
00:07:57,547 --> 00:08:01,677
No. Just magic secrets
Giles doesn't think I'm ready for.

146
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:04,482
Giles: Um... Ah, yes.
Yes, here we are.

147
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:06,749
There's a reference here

148
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:09,257
to the journal
of Desmond Kane,

149
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:11,260
pastor of a town
called Sharpsville.

150
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,193
"May 26, 1723.

151
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:14,696
"Tomorrow is
the ascension.

152
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:16,528
God help us all."

153
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:19,697
It was the last
anyone heard.

154
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,704
Of Kane?

155
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:23,205
Of Sharpsville.

156
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:26,071
The town more
or less disappeared.

157
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:28,338
So ascension possibly
not a love-in.

158
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:30,937
I think you should meet
with this demon, Buffy.

159
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:33,209
Yeah? Anybody got $5,000?

160
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:38,254
I have something
important to ask you.

161
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:39,414
Xander: Important?

162
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:41,514
Let's start calculating
those odds, people.

163
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:43,422
What are you doing
Friday night?

164
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:46,462
Uh... uh...

165
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,658
As always, my sacred duty
as a watcher

166
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,258
prevents me from... Why?

167
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:55,669
I have a paper
to write for English,

168
00:08:55,739 --> 00:09:00,199
and you're English,
so I thought... What?

169
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:02,268
Is it so wrong to be getting

170
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:03,836
an insider's perspective?

171
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:09,178
I study best
in a good restaurant...

172
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:12,050
around eightish?
Think it over?

173
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:21,194
And on the day the words
"flimsy excuse" were redefined,

174
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,425
we stood in awe
and watched.

175
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,960
Wesley: Right. Books of Ascension,
mayor, slaughter...

176
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:29,198
Tell you what.

177
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:32,207
Why don't we try
to find this demon

178
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:33,708
sooner rather
than later,

179
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:36,803
perhaps persuade him
to lend us the books free of charge?

180
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,815
I think Faith might be useful
in that persuasion part.

181
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,316
I imagine so.

182
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:43,319
Where is Faith, anyway?

183
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:54,228
Hey, slayer.

184
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:55,730
I wasn't expecting company.

185
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,232
Give me a minute,

186
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,599
and I'll have the place
tidied up for you.

187
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,830
You got the books?

188
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,338
Well, that depends.

189
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:04,931
You got my money?

190
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,746
You're tough
in negotiations,

191
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:13,407
and I respect that.

192
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,719
Check 'em out.

193
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:19,756
Now, that is quality
merchandise.

194
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:22,053
That's worth 5 grand, easy.

195
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,387
Books of Ascension.

196
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,894
Mm-hmm.
Original editions and everything.

197
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:27,259
Great condition.

198
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,764
OK, it's a little worn
on one spine,

199
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,563
some slight foxing,
but otherwise perfect.

200
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:37,471
Now, the 5 grand,
it's, you know, negotiable.

201
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,873
I don't like to haggle.

202
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:20,443
Faith.

203
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:23,510
Angel...

204
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:27,952
I got nowhere else to go.

205
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:32,757
Look, I hate asking for help,
but I'm asking,

206
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:37,027
'cause I'm in trouble,
like the real bad kind.

207
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,933
It's OK.

208
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:43,268
No, it's a couple county lines
over from OK, believe me.

209
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,140
I believe you.
Look, just talk.

210
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,142
Come on.

211
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:50,202
Start from the beginning.

212
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,713
Mind if I skip past

213
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:53,715
the "Mom never
loved me" part

214
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:55,341
and get right to it?

215
00:11:56,953 --> 00:11:59,251
I'm scaring myself.

216
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:00,914
I know the feeling.

217
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:02,720
That's why I came to you.

218
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:03,724
I don't wanna get
all 12-steppy,

219
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:05,693
but remember
when you told me

220
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:08,890
that killing people'd make me
feel like some kind of god?

221
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,832
I think I just
came down to earth.

222
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:16,236
It's not human,
if that's what you're thinking,

223
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:18,740
not that that makes me
feel any better

224
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:21,174
or this guy
any less dead.

225
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:25,010
Faith, you need help.
You can't do this alone.

226
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:29,245
I know. For real now,
I'm scared...

227
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:32,015
scared of what I am,
what I'm turning into...

228
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:35,455
cold-blooded, straight-up
killer... like you.

229
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:37,686
Not like me.
I didn't have a choice,

230
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,319
but you do.

231
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:40,988
Look, you can stop this.

232
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:44,033
Believe me, I don't wanna end up
the way everybody said I would...

233
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,863
dead or alone or a loser.

234
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:47,369
You don't have to.

235
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:48,737
I don't know.

236
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,168
Maybe it's too late for me.

237
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,570
It's not.

238
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,541
Angel, I'm so scared.

239
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:58,510
It's all right. Shh.
It's OK.

240
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:11,887
Whoa.

241
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,827
Whoa, Faith. I...

242
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:16,761
Look, I can be here for you,

243
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:19,596
but not like that,
all right?

244
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,499
I'm with Buffy.

245
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,333
Buffy, yeah.

246
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:26,301
I didn't mean it like that.

247
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:33,046
Maybe I did,
but I wouldn't press it.

248
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:38,513
You love her, don't you?

249
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:40,885
I love her.

250
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:41,945
Good for you.

251
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:44,857
The two of you,
you're lucky.

252
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:48,930
We friends?

253
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:51,022
We're friends.

254
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:52,498
Then I'm lucky, too.

255
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:56,929
I better go.

256
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:59,969
Where?

257
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,067
I need to cool down...

258
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:04,078
spend some time alone.

259
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:05,977
Don't worry about me.

260
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:09,711
You've been a big help.
Just knowing somebody cares.

261
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:16,583
Hey, I know I shouldn't
be asking this, but...

262
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:19,092
do you think if things
were different,

263
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:22,289
that things between you
and me'd be different, too?

264
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:24,332
We'll never know.

265
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,593
Right.

266
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,032
How could we?

267
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:29,260
Take care of yourself.

268
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:34,935
Faith: Lifetime of practice.

269
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,952
Faith: It's not like
I wasn't trying, OK?

270
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,920
There's no need
to convince me.

271
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,546
I'm sure you gave it
your level best.

272
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:50,853
I just don't understand
what that boy could be thinking.

273
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:52,359
Try Buffy Summers,

274
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:54,827
like in a big, fat, one-track way.

275
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:57,057
Hey, come on!
Don't be discouraged.

276
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:59,066
You're a bright,
young, energetic girl

277
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:01,068
with a whole life ahead of her,

278
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,569
and I won't tolerate brooding.

279
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:05,800
So you couldn't give him that
one moment of true happiness.

280
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:07,967
I was thinking more along the lines
of a long weekend, but OK.

281
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:09,908
And he spurned your advances.
So be it.

282
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:12,071
There's more than
one way to skin a cat,

283
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:15,378
and I happen to know
that's factually true.

284
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,577
We wanna take
Angel's soul away.

285
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:20,587
If we can't do it
by giving him happiness,

286
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:23,590
well, by golly,
we'll just have to do it

287
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:26,024
in the most painful way
imaginable.

288
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:37,270
Find anything?

289
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:39,773
A six-course banquet
of nothing

290
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:42,469
with a scoop of sod all
as a palette cleanser.

291
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,273
I've had no better luck.

292
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:50,709
There must be something about
this ascension somewhere.

293
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:53,219
Perhaps I should
contact the Council,

294
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:55,188
maybe run
a search through...

295
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:56,554
No, I don't...

296
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,388
It should be I that...

297
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:03,795
The Council isn't entirely aware
that I'm letting you work for me.

298
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:08,199
Uh... with me.

299
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,535
I don't think they'd be very happy at
the idea of the two of us collaborating.

300
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:15,372
Well, I wasn't about to burst into
glorious song about it myself.

301
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:17,377
Why don't you call them?

302
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:19,709
I think the most
expedient plan

303
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,215
would be to find these
Books of Ascension themselves.

304
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:27,688
Buffy, you and Faith
must find this demon, and soon.

305
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:31,590
I'll go back to the scene,
see if I can track him.

306
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,922
Wait for Faith.

307
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:34,655
That could be hours.

308
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:37,493
The girl makes Godot
look punctual.

309
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,897
I'll just go myself.

310
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:43,904
Buffy, this is a job
for the both of you.

311
00:16:43,972 --> 00:16:46,167
This demon could be anywhere.

312
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:50,735
If these books are as important as he says,
he has good reason to hide.

313
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:54,009
Finding him's going to be
extremely difficult.

314
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:55,208
Found your demon.

315
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:56,716
Fashion tip, Wes.

316
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:58,685
Mouth looks better closed.

317
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:00,618
Got the address.

318
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:03,852
I beat it out of
Willie the Snitch personally.

319
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,688
You beat up Willie?

320
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,727
Sure.

321
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:08,729
Well, actually let's just say

322
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:11,732
I applied some pressure,
or more accurately,

323
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,701
that I asked politely,
and then...

324
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,794
OK, I bribed him.

325
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:18,202
How much?

326
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:20,935
28 bucks. Does the Council
reimburse for that kind of stuff?

327
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,442
Did you get a receipt?

328
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,442
Damn!

329
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:24,637
I know this.

330
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:27,147
It's down by the bus station.

331
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:29,149
Not the nicest part of town.

332
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:30,149
Again, see?
No standards.

333
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,651
Any self-respecting demon

334
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,315
should be living
in a pit of filth or a nice crypt.

335
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,017
I'll remember
to mention that.

336
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:39,225
Mention what?

337
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:40,727
Where we going, girlfriend?

338
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:44,162
Actually, I can handle
this one solo.

339
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:46,427
Why should you get
to have all the fun?

340
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:48,765
Share, share,
that's fair, right?

341
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:53,772
Right. Found our demon.

342
00:17:55,277 --> 00:17:59,111
Oh. Well, let's go
look him up.

343
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:08,111
Is it me, or did it just
get really cold in here?

344
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:15,093
Faith, careful.

345
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:16,687
Right.

346
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:23,727
Missed you last night.

347
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:25,170
Yeah, I was patrolling.

348
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,142
No shortage of scum
you gotta watch in Sunnydale, right?

349
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,837
So I've heard.

350
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:41,821
Looks like somebody
got here first.

351
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,291
Bettin' they got the books, too.
Some hit.

352
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:49,162
This wasn't just a hit.

353
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,664
This is somebody's idea
of a party.

354
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:54,463
Maybe the guy put up a fight.

355
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:57,669
We gotta get going.

356
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:00,469
Come on. Nothing
we can do here now.

357
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:01,668
You coming?

358
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:11,745
Mint?

359
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:14,513
Didn't think so.

360
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:19,059
Well, scheduling a man
of your talents

361
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,925
is quite the chore,
I'll tell you.

362
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,430
Between the chanting
and the sacrifice,

363
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:26,694
my golf game is shot.

364
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:29,362
But here... you are.

365
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:32,406
You know why
I've summoned you.

366
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:33,498
Can you do it?

367
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,202
Need anything from me?

368
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:39,913
You're not much of
a people person, are you?

369
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:43,212
You have risked great danger
in calling on me.

370
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:45,218
The deadliest magics
are needed

371
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:47,642
to rob this creature
of its soul.

372
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:48,571
Big job, all right.

373
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:51,237
And so it shall be done.

374
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:52,574
Oh, that's just swell.

375
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:53,978
Listen, are you sure
you don't want any?

376
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:56,881
'Cause they're
low-calorie. Heh heh.

377
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,213
OK.

378
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,859
Are you OK?

379
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:10,897
You seem a little on edge.

380
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:13,092
Is there anything
that's wrong?

381
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,634
It's nothing.

382
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,935
It's nothing.

383
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:19,598
All right, all right.

384
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:22,108
Stop with the third degree.

385
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,973
It's Faith.

386
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:26,172
What about her?

387
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:28,681
I went to Angel's last night,

388
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,183
and Faith was there.

389
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:32,048
They looked sort of...

390
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,985
intimate.

391
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:36,546
No way. I know what
you're thinking,

392
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:37,955
and no way!

393
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:41,291
You're right.
Faith would never do that.

394
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:43,296
Faith would totally do that.

395
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:45,127
Faith was built to do that.

396
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,826
She's the "Do that" girl.

397
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:48,061
Comfort, remember?
Comfort here.

398
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:49,467
I mean, please.

399
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:52,700
Does Angel come up
to Faith's standards for a guy?

400
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:54,708
Let's see.
Is he breathing?

401
00:20:54,776 --> 00:20:57,370
Actually, no.

402
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:58,878
But, Buffy, Angel...

403
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:01,882
There's no way he
would ever do that.

404
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,681
You're the only thing
in the world to him.

405
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:07,186
Sometimes I wonder.

406
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:10,986
Angel and Faith
have a lot in common...

407
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:15,652
and there's so much
he doesn't tell me.

408
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,163
But it's so clear,

409
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,665
the way he feels about you.

410
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:23,670
Buffy, I, too, know the love
of a taciturn man,

411
00:21:23,738 --> 00:21:27,174
and you have to look
at their actions.

412
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,232
I was.

413
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,642
Well, what did he say?

414
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:37,982
Say? You mean when I straightforwardly
asked him what was going on?

415
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:39,178
So you bailed?

416
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:41,551
I couldn't.
I mean, not then...

417
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:42,554
Hey, enough.

418
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:46,059
Stop with the crazy.
Go talk to Angel.

419
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:47,560
But I just...

420
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:49,528
No. Go.
I give you leave to go.

421
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,159
Thank you.

422
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,613
Faith.

423
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:07,613
Hey.

424
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:11,049
Sorry to bust in uninvited.

425
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,916
What do you want?

426
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:15,080
Look, I'm not so good
at apologies,

427
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:17,249
mostly 'cause I think
the world's out to screw me,

428
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:19,259
so I'm generally
more owed than owing.

429
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,295
But I've been thinking
about last night,

430
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:24,456
and I want you to know
I'm really sorry.

431
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:25,965
It's all right, Faith.

432
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:27,968
No, it's not all right.

433
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:30,971
Yeah, I was freaked.
I needed somebody,

434
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,803
but you're with Buffy.
I should know better.

435
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,604
OK.

436
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,569
You don't trust me.

437
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:42,775
It's not that.

438
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,842
Hey, no problem.
Join the club.

439
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:50,056
Look, Faith...

440
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:52,558
Look, I know what
you're going through, all right?

441
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:55,095
I know how hard it can be.

442
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:59,099
It's important that you have
somebody who's been there, OK,

443
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,601
who understands what
you're going through...

444
00:23:04,505 --> 00:23:06,097
and I wanna trust you.

445
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:08,165
Chump.

446
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:20,082
Yaa shay Tann, inna nafsak
laa tatba'uk ba'd.

447
00:23:20,154 --> 00:23:22,315
Yaa rufukayl al-'aZim,
shattit nafsah fii anHaa'i...

448
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,618
Faith!

449
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:25,522
I wanted to do this
the old-fashioned way,

450
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:26,958
but hey, your loss.

451
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:28,791
I got some tricks
Buffy don't know yet.

452
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:29,955
You don't have to do this.

453
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:31,965
I know, but it's fun.

454
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:34,024
Now relax.
It'll all be over soon.

455
00:23:34,102 --> 00:23:35,592
No!

456
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,697
Yaa ruuh idhhabii!
Yaa nafs idhhabii!

457
00:23:39,774 --> 00:23:47,545
Utrukii ayyaah wa-'trukiih
naHruuman wa-najisan!

458
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:49,640
[Groaning]

459
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:21,815
Thanks... so much.

460
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:27,246
It's good to have the taste
of a slayer back in my mouth.

461
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,982
It's like cigarettes,
you know?

462
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:31,047
Just when I thought I'd quit.

463
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:34,720
No, really.
Don't get up.

464
00:24:36,797 --> 00:24:40,358
Ohh... it's good to be
back in Sunnydale.

465
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:41,731
Nice climate...

466
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:43,235
plenty to eat...

467
00:24:43,304 --> 00:24:46,501
no tortured humanity
to hold me down.

468
00:24:46,574 --> 00:24:48,565
But you know
what bothers me?

469
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:53,177
You don't seem to be getting
the big picture here, Faith.

470
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:55,715
Now, I don't know why
you turned me,

471
00:24:55,783 --> 00:24:57,751
but let me tell ya...

472
00:24:57,818 --> 00:25:00,082
I'm just glad you did.

473
00:25:01,756 --> 00:25:03,553
I got my reasons.

474
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:07,390
Let me guess. You summoned back
the true Angelus because...

475
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,190
you need a new boy toy.

476
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:11,925
Sorry. Doesn't work that way.

477
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:17,531
You wanna be smart,
you listen to me.

478
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:19,539
Funny thing about vampires,
Faith...

479
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:22,576
we don't establish
meaningful dialogue with slayers.

480
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:25,009
Not how Buffy tells it.

481
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:31,114
Heh heh heh. I should've known
you'd like it on top.

482
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:33,119
You wanna listen,
or you wanna die?

483
00:25:33,187 --> 00:25:36,418
Heh heh. As long as you're there,
I mostly want you to wriggle.

484
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,582
But I'm listening.

485
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:38,852
Last time you got like this,

486
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:40,689
Buffy kicked your ass
all the way back to hell.

487
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:42,228
Do you wanna
do better this time?

488
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:44,321
Still listening.

489
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:45,524
Good boy.

490
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,001
Now, all you gotta do
is play nice and call truce,

491
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,095
and I'll hook you up with
the real power in this town.

492
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:52,104
Interested?

493
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:53,663
Very.

494
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:56,403
Then get ready
to meet the new boss.

495
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:03,415
Wesley: Our enemy has us
at a disadvantage.

496
00:26:03,484 --> 00:26:07,113
We seem consistently
to be one step behind him.

497
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:09,088
Now he has
the Books of Ascension.

498
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:11,351
We must take definitive action.

499
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:13,222
You have the greatest voice.

500
00:26:13,294 --> 00:26:16,525
Have you ever thought about
doing books on tape?

501
00:26:16,597 --> 00:26:18,428
Way to focus, C.C.

502
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:21,468
Yes, let's try to stay on track.

503
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:23,833
We need everyone working
together here. Where's Angel?

504
00:26:23,904 --> 00:26:25,394
I don't know.

505
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:29,409
I went to the mansion,
but he wasn't there.

506
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:31,104
And Faith?

507
00:26:31,178 --> 00:26:32,372
She's missing, too.

508
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:35,210
Which means nothing.
Two unconnected events.

509
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:38,609
What should we do?

510
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:42,144
Buffy, I think you should try
to retrieve the Books of Ascension.

511
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:43,713
Check out the mayor's office.

512
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:46,726
But be damn careful.
Do not confront the mayor.

513
00:26:46,794 --> 00:26:47,886
We don't know
a thing about him.

514
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:49,793
I'll go home
and stock up on weapons.

515
00:26:49,864 --> 00:26:52,775
Slip into something
a little more break-and-enterish.

516
00:26:52,908 --> 00:26:54,466
Right. Willow,

517
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:57,103
how far did you get
with the mayor's files?

518
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,441
Excuse me.

519
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:00,982
I believe Wesley
is running this meeting.

520
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,713
It's, uh, it's quite all right.
Willow?

521
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:06,721
It's all bad news.

522
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:08,723
By the time I got through
the encryptions,

523
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,349
the files were empty.

524
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:12,394
I guess he saw me coming.

525
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:13,928
What about
the Hall of Records?

526
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:15,293
Go to the source.

527
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:18,527
Good idea. There must be
information on the mayor there.

528
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,626
Wesley, why don't you
take the group

529
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:21,635
and start looking?

530
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:23,035
Right.

531
00:27:23,105 --> 00:27:25,903
I'm in Wesley's group.

532
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:27,670
There is just the one group.

533
00:27:27,743 --> 00:27:30,234
Yes, and I am in it.

534
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:32,906
Anyone mind
if I skip the trip?

535
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,813
I'm gonna cruise town,
keep my ear to the ground.

536
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,079
And I think 5's a crowd.

537
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:38,586
It really is.

538
00:27:39,755 --> 00:27:41,279
I'll drive.

539
00:27:41,357 --> 00:27:43,655
They liked your plan.

540
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:49,464
Anyone finds anything,
check in with me.

541
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,161
Be careful.

542
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,272
So... can I keep him?

543
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:03,539
Let's just take things
step by step for a moment.

544
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:06,740
Now, then, Angelus...
May I call you Angel?

545
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:09,808
Well, actually, I'm thinking
more along the lines

546
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:12,319
of you calling me Master.

547
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:15,323
Ahh. You know, Angelus,
attitude may get you attention,

548
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,949
but courtesy wins respect.

549
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:21,622
Heh heh. I am the one responsible
for your "new" attitude.

550
00:28:21,697 --> 00:28:24,723
That's why I'm here.

551
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,361
No trouble with the transition?
No side effects?

552
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:32,305
Hmm. Had a soul.
Now I'm free.

553
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:35,002
That's terrific.
Poetic, too.

554
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:37,102
Not that I read much poetry.

555
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:39,613
Except for those little ones
in the Reader's Digest.

556
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:41,274
Some are quite catchy.

557
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,817
Hey, I don't mean
to rush things here,

558
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:45,479
but are you trying to get
to some kind of a point?

559
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:47,784
Heh. Kids today.
Rush, rush, rush.

560
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:52,794
The point, Angel, is you're a very
powerful young man. Good for Faith.

561
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:56,457
And there just may be a future
for you here in Sunnydale.

562
00:28:56,532 --> 00:28:58,500
I see you're admiring
my letter opener.

563
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:02,526
Actually, I was thinking of stabbing you
through the heart with it.

564
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:05,372
Please do.

565
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:15,883
Nice shot.

566
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:31,565
You see, I'm what
you might call...

567
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,693
impervious.

568
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:36,761
Can't be killed or harmed
in any way.

569
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,431
And that's just
a cornerstone

570
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:42,273
in my plans for this
great town of ours.

571
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:44,710
Hmm. Can't be killed,

572
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,839
but you don't like germs.

573
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:49,111
Ew. Awful things.
Unsanitary.

574
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:51,745
But my question is, now that
Faith has brought you back,

575
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,845
what are your intentions?

576
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:55,618
Well, gee, sir,

577
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:58,592
I thought I'd find that slayer
that's giving you so much trouble

578
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:01,789
and torture, maim,
and kill her.

579
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:04,230
Fine.

580
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,928
It's nice to see you're not
one of those slacker types

581
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:08,299
running around town today.

582
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,564
Heh heh heh heh.

583
00:30:09,638 --> 00:30:11,367
Torture Buffy.

584
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,203
Killing her's fine,
just make it a slow one.

585
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:14,572
My favorite kind.

586
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:15,803
Wonderful. Wonderful.

587
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:18,244
We don't want a replacement slayer
anytime soon.

588
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:22,080
They can't all turn out
like my girl Faith. Heh heh.

589
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:23,311
Have fun.

590
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:24,579
Let's do it.

591
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,350
Uh... try to have her
home by 11:00.

592
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,196
[Door Closes]

593
00:30:39,268 --> 00:30:41,566
She's not
a little girl anymore.

594
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:43,502
[Sniffles]

595
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:45,469
"I love when you talk, Wesley.

596
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,907
I love when you sing, Wesley."

597
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:50,468
Can you say the words
"jail bait," Wesley?

598
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:52,275
Limey bastard.

599
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:54,111
Hey, guys.
Man, where ya been?

600
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:58,119
You gotta find Buffy.
She's going to her place and stock up...

601
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:00,951
That guy just bugs me.

602
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:08,523
Faith, Angel.

603
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:10,258
Hi, Joyce.
Nice to see ya.

604
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:11,264
Is Buffy home?

605
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,198
Upstairs.

606
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:15,829
Please tell me it's not
some vampire thing.

607
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:17,838
The only vampire here
is me, Joyce.

608
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:21,000
Say... you change
your hair?

609
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:24,341
Highlights.

610
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:26,506
It's nice.

611
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,282
Knock, knock.

612
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:41,790
Where have you guys been?

613
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:44,799
Lookin' for you. Good thing
we found you before you left.

614
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:48,798
We got the books.

615
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:50,304
They're at the mansion.

616
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:51,930
We'd take 'em
to Giles ourselves,

617
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:54,999
but I think strength in numbers
is the way to go. Come on.

618
00:31:57,713 --> 00:31:59,943
Let me get those for you.

619
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,723
OK, let's get the books
someplace safe.

620
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:12,920
Where are they?

621
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:18,194
Actually... we have a slight
change in plan, Buff.

622
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,201
"Buff'?

623
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:21,258
You just called...

624
00:32:23,372 --> 00:32:24,964
What's the matter with you?

625
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,804
Nothing. Matter of fact,

626
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:31,334
I haven't felt this good
in a long time.

627
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:33,176
Angel?

628
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:35,910
You know, I never
properly thanked you

629
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:37,611
for sending me to hell.

630
00:32:37,686 --> 00:32:38,618
No...

631
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,177
Yeah, and I'm just wondering.

632
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:44,282
Where do I start?
Card? Fruit basket, huh?

633
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,225
- Evisceration?
- No.

634
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:47,523
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

635
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:49,587
Maybe there's still some good
deep down inside of me

636
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:51,530
that remembers
and loves you,

637
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,568
if only you could
reach me.

638
00:32:53,635 --> 00:32:56,229
Then again,
we have reality.

639
00:32:57,673 --> 00:33:00,938
I will kill you
before I let you touch me.

640
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:06,574
Faith, we need to get
out of here. Now.

641
00:33:06,648 --> 00:33:08,548
Speak for yourself, B.

642
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:12,246
Me? I like it here.

643
00:33:20,462 --> 00:33:22,726
One thing I learned
about Buffy...

644
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,266
she's so cute
when she's sleeping.

645
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:26,961
Hmm.

646
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:36,868
Hey, I know a way to make investigating
the mayor even more boring.

647
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:41,213
On second thought,
no, I don't.

648
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:42,750
Hey... whoa.

649
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:48,889
Whoa. Big "Hey, whoa."
Guys, check this out.

650
00:33:52,027 --> 00:33:53,770
Wow. Like father, like son.

651
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,896
Wow. Like father, like son.

652
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:58,407
How about like exact same guy
like exact same guy?

653
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:02,275
Mayor Wilkins
is over 100 years old.

654
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:04,074
He's not human.

655
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:06,581
I, uh, hate to
spoil the mood,

656
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:09,209
but this is so much
worse than you think.

657
00:34:09,285 --> 00:34:11,753
Xander,
what happened to you?

658
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:14,483
You know how some people
hate to say I told you so?

659
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:16,582
Not me. I told you so.

660
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:20,026
Angel's back,
in the really bad sense.

661
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:22,121
And, um, I told you so.

662
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:24,894
Angelus has turned?

663
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:28,563
Xander, this is terribly serious.
Are you sure?

664
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:29,935
Gee, let me think.

665
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:31,667
Kinda hard to tell.

666
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:33,504
Last thing I remember
is his fist.

667
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:35,476
We must contact Giles
immediately.

668
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:36,603
Good thinkin'.

669
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,874
Let's waste time
with a lively debate.

670
00:34:38,948 --> 00:34:41,109
Leave Buffy alone,
see how dead she gets.

671
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:43,652
Slow down, Xander.
This isn't Wesley's fault.

672
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,187
Actually, it is.

673
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:47,519
Faith was your responsibility.

674
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,785
Guess who's Angel's
new playmate.

675
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,191
Faith and Angel? Together?

676
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:54,924
Imagine the possibilities.

677
00:34:54,998 --> 00:34:57,159
[Chains Rattling]

678
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:00,825
[Handcuffs Lock]

679
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,933
Mornin', sleepyhead.

680
00:35:04,007 --> 00:35:06,567
You know what
I just can't believe?

681
00:35:06,643 --> 00:35:10,477
All of our time together,
we never tried chains.

682
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:13,414
Well, can't dwell on the past.

683
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:16,611
Especially with
the future we have ahead.

684
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:21,423
Bondage looks good
on you, B.

685
00:35:21,491 --> 00:35:23,459
The outfit's all wrong,
but hey...

686
00:35:23,526 --> 00:35:25,721
You don't know
what you're doing.

687
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:28,992
Really? Weird, 'cause something
about all this just feels so right.

688
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:31,966
Maybe it's one of those
unhappy childhood things.

689
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:34,833
See, when I was a kid,
I used to beg my mom for a dog.

690
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:36,872
Didn't matter what kind.

691
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,036
I just wanted, you know,
something to love.

692
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,082
A dog's all I wanted.

693
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:53,316
Well, that and toys.

694
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:58,289
But Mom was so busy,
you know,

695
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,488
enjoying the drinking and
passing out parts of life

696
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:02,690
that I never really
got what I wanted.

697
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:04,357
Until now.

698
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:06,197
Faith, listen to me
very closely.

699
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:08,430
Angel's a killer.

700
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:11,030
When he's done with me,
he'll turn on you.

701
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:12,335
She's right.

702
00:36:12,408 --> 00:36:14,740
I probably will.

703
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:16,369
Yeah?

704
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:17,708
Huh.

705
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,839
Guess we'll just have to
keep you around a while, then.

706
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:24,549
Before we get started,
I just want you to know:

00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:27,681
If you're a screamer,
feel free.

708
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:29,418
Why, Faith?

709
00:36:29,492 --> 00:36:30,959
What's in it for you?

710
00:36:31,027 --> 00:36:32,517
What isn't?

711
00:36:32,595 --> 00:36:34,961
You know, I come to
Sunnydale, I'm a slayer,

712
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:36,999
I do my job kicking ass
better than anyone.

713
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:39,364
What do I hear about
everywhere I go?

714
00:36:39,435 --> 00:36:40,959
Buffy.

715
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:43,028
So I slay, I behave,

716
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:44,403
I do the good little girl
routine,

717
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:47,875
and who does everybody
thank? Buffy.

718
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:49,741
That's not my fault.

719
00:36:49,812 --> 00:36:51,245
Everyone always asks,

720
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:53,407
"Why can't you
be more like Buffy?"

721
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,883
But did anyone ever ask
if you could be more like me?

722
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:57,385
I know I didn't.

723
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,257
You get the watcher,

724
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:03,451
you get the mom, you get
the little Scooby gang.

725
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:04,891
What do I get?
Jack squat.

726
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,690
This was supposed
to be my town.

727
00:37:06,763 --> 00:37:08,628
Faith, listen to me.

728
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:10,632
Why? So you can impart
some special Buffy wisdom?

729
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,724
That it?

730
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:13,792
Do you think you're
better than me? Do you?

731
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,065
Say it. You think
you're better than me.

732
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,504
I am.

733
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,710
Always have been.

734
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:26,078
Um, maybe you
didn't notice.

735
00:37:26,149 --> 00:37:27,980
Angel's with me.

736
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:31,783
And how did you
get him, Faith?

737
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:33,344
Magic?

738
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:35,618
You cast some sort of spell?

739
00:37:35,692 --> 00:37:37,922
Because in the real world,

740
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:41,088
Angel would never touch you,
and we both know it.

741
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:48,962
You had to tie me up
to beat me.

742
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:51,734
There's a word for people
like you, Faith.

743
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:52,832
Loser.

744
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:59,278
Uh-huh. You're just trying
to make me mad so I'll kill you.

745
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:01,510
But I'm too smart for that.

746
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:02,983
Stick around.

747
00:38:04,387 --> 00:38:07,652
For what? Your boss's
lame ascension?

748
00:38:07,724 --> 00:38:10,818
Like I couldn't stop it.

749
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:12,622
You can't.

750
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:13,821
I will.

751
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:16,490
Keep dreaming. No one
can stop the ascension.

752
00:38:16,566 --> 00:38:17,658
Mayor's got it wired, B.

753
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:19,895
He built this town
for demons to feed on,

754
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:22,164
and come graduation day,
he's gettin' paid.

755
00:38:22,238 --> 00:38:24,468
I'll be sittin'
at his right hand.

756
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,338
Assuming he has hands
after the transformation.

757
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,968
I'm not too clear
on that part.

758
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:31,377
And all your little
lame-ass friends

759
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:32,812
are gonna be
kibbles and bits.

760
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:36,978
Think about that when
your boyfriend's cutting into you.

761
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:39,988
I never knew you had
so much rage in you.

762
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:41,887
What can I say?

763
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:44,688
I'm the world's best actor.

764
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:46,661
Second best.

765
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:57,105
Graduation day.

766
00:38:57,173 --> 00:38:59,004
You think
we missed anything?

767
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,373
I think we know
everything she knows.

768
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:04,606
May I say something?

769
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:07,380
[Chains Drop]

770
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,917
Psych.

771
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:11,715
You played me.
You played me!

772
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:31,065
What are you gonna do, B?
Kill me?

773
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,540
You become me.

774
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:35,406
You're not ready for that.

775
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:37,411
Yet.

776
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:44,812
Are you OK?

777
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:55,888
The task is finished.

778
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:57,933
Yes. Thank you
for coming to me

779
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,901
and for that rather effective
light show you put on.

780
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,962
This restores the balance
between us, Rupert Giles.

781
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,476
My debt to you
is now repaid in full.

782
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:09,670
Do not call upon me again.

783
00:40:09,746 --> 00:40:10,940
I shan't.

784
00:40:11,013 --> 00:40:12,503
Peace with you.

785
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:14,982
And with you.

786
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:26,989
His debt to you is repaid?
What did you do?

787
00:40:27,063 --> 00:40:29,156
I introduced him
to his wife.

788
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:32,633
Well, I, for one, protest.

789
00:40:32,702 --> 00:40:35,136
You've pitted slayer
against slayer

790
00:40:35,204 --> 00:40:37,798
in a dangerous charade that
could've gotten them both killed.

791
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:39,705
Without informing me!

792
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:43,278
I'm telling the Council.

793
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:45,220
I think you should.

794
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,690
We have a rogue slayer
on our hands.

795
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,317
I can't think of anything
more dangerous.

796
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:51,157
At least now we know.

797
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:55,359
And we know a little bit more
about the ascension.

798
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,264
Graduation day.

799
00:40:57,335 --> 00:41:00,862
There's a big, scary un-fun.

800
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:03,737
At least Angel's
not bad, though.

801
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:05,140
That's good, right?

802
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,838
Yes. I feel so much better

803
00:41:07,913 --> 00:41:09,938
knowing that he broke my face
in the "good" way.

804
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:11,915
It's a "good" bruise.

805
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:14,008
He was only acting, Xander.

806
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:18,013
It was just an act.

807
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:20,614
Mayor: Well, you win some,
you lose some.

808
00:41:20,692 --> 00:41:23,661
From where I'm sitting,
it's batting average that counts.

809
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:26,128
So you lost some friends.

810
00:41:26,198 --> 00:41:29,133
I wouldn't exactly
call them friends.

811
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:30,793
What are you worried
about? Chin up.

812
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:33,064
You don't see me looking
disappointed, do ya?

813
00:41:33,138 --> 00:41:34,196
Heck no. You know why?

814
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:36,399
Because I know you'll
always have me, Faith.

815
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:38,874
I'm the best, the most important
friend you'll ever have.

816
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:41,708
Besides, once
the ascension starts,

817
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,510
the "in crowd" you're
so concerned about? Whoo!

818
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,813
They'll be lucky if there's enough
of them left to fill a pothole.

819
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:47,874
Promise.

820
00:41:50,922 --> 00:41:53,482
Still unhappy?

821
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:54,718
Hmm.

822
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:57,556
Okeydoke.

823
00:41:57,629 --> 00:42:00,291
I've got two words

824
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:03,664
that are gonna make
all the pain go away...

825
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,962
Miniature... golf.

826
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,025
How you doin'?

827
00:42:30,095 --> 00:42:31,653
Been better.

828
00:42:32,731 --> 00:42:34,426
Not hard to believe.

829
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:37,332
You were a real soldier
last night, Buffy.

830
00:42:37,402 --> 00:42:38,528
That's me.

831
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:40,901
One of the troops.

832
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:43,532
I know how hard
it was for you.

833
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:45,667
I really doubt that.

834
00:42:45,744 --> 00:42:49,180
If there's anything I can do
to make it better...

835
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:55,148
Look, I know you only
did what I asked,

836
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,518
and we got what we wanted.

837
00:42:57,589 --> 00:43:01,855
I never wanted it
to go that far.

838
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:03,451
I know that.

839
00:43:03,528 --> 00:43:07,555
It's not even
a question of that.

840
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:11,295
It's just after...

841
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:16,138
I need a little bit
of a break.

842
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:21,735
Please?

843
00:43:30,622 --> 00:43:32,647
You still my girl?

844
00:43:36,628 --> 00:43:38,220
Always.

845
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,424
Grr! Arrgh!
