Willow, what did you do?

4
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:08,562
We have to get you out of here
or you'll both be killed.

5
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:09,962
- What about Warren?
- She killed him.

6
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:13,962
We've gotta get out of this town. Mexico. We
should go to Mexico.

7
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:15,922
- How did you do it?
- What is she talking about?

8
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:17,362
- Nothing. Let's go.
- I can see you.

Everybody spoke Mexicoan.

the Klingon dictionary in two weeks.

51

That had much clearer
transitive and intransitive rules, OK?

52

Besides,
I can't keep having those nightmares.

write all that intense poetry about the end,

79

- Chatting you up.
- Yeah, ironic.

I knew this would
completely freak you out. It's just...

81
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:55,642
She asked that I come talk to you.
It's important.

00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,442
- She?
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you...

Remember that time on the bridge
when you sang to each other?

Well, she says even though you can't hear it
she still sings to you.

- Crazy.

So, what?
You, like, fight vampires professionally?

149
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:38,562

Since... Even in school.

151
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:44,562
I heard rumours about you back then.
You were mysterious.

152
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:46,922
- I was?
- Well, you were never around.

153
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:51,282
A lot of kids thought you were dating some
old guy, or that you were heavy religious.

154
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:55,002
- Scott Hope said you were gay.
- What?! I dated that ringworm.

155
00:11:55,042 --> 00:12:01,602
He says that about every girl he breaks up
with. And then, big surprise, he comes out.

156
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:04,962
Men. Do I know how to pick 'em.

157
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:08,722
- So, all that time you were a slayer?
- The.

158
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:13,482
- "The", like as in "the only one"?
- Pretty much.

159
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:14,562
Oh.

160
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:18,762
So... when you said "not connected",
that was kind of a telling statement.

161
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,922
- Ah, Psych 101 alert.
- Well, I'm just saying.

162

I need emotional therapy

163
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:26,442
- It was your phrase.
- I'm connected.

164

<i>- (thumping stops)</i>

174
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:37,202
- Hello?
<i>- (loud thump)</i>

175
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:41,282
Once for yes.

176
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:44,002
Once for yes.

177
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:49,162
Twice for no.

178
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:51,002
Mom?

179
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:55,202

180
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:58,122
Mom?

181
00:13:58,162 --> 00:13:59,882
It's you?

182
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:04,882
<i>(thump)</i>

183
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:07,042
Are you OK?

184
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:10,242
<i>(two thumps)</i>

185
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:15,242
You're not. Mom?

186
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:20,562
Mommy?

187
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:22,762
Are you alone?

188
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:26,842

<i>(rumbling)</i>

190
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,722
Aargh!

191
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:39,722
Why are you doing this?!

192
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:51,122
Aargh!

193
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,082
Get up, you wuss.

194
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:58,522
I have shin splints. Ow.

195
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:01,962
- We should turn on a light.
- No, they'll see it from outside.

196
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:05,202
- Right.
<i>- (breaking glass)</i>

197
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:07,842
- Maybe we should go get Buffy.
- No way.

198
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:10,282
Tell her what we know
about the Seal of Danzalthar.

199
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:13,482
Think, McFly. Why would
she believe us without any proof?

200
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:17,402
We go to her empty-handed,
we'll be in the clink in a microsecond.

201
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:21,562
I ain't going back to the big house.
That place changes a man.

202
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:23,722
That's why we need proof.

203
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:27,442
Think of it as trial by fire. A quest.

204
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:29,162
<i>Una questa.</i>

205
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:34,882
We find it. We alert the Slayer.
We help her destroy it. <i>We</i> save Sunnydale.

206
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:38,282
Then we join her gang
and possibly hang out at her house.

207
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:42,482
Right. OK, what do we do?

208
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:46,322
We should find the principal's office
and work our way down from there.

209
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,962
OK, um...

210
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:53,682
You go check down the hallway
and I'll go over there.

211
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:59,122
Check communications?

212
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:00,762
- Check. Check.
- Check. Check.

213
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:01,962
- Check.
- Check. Check.

214
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,042
- Check. Check.
- Check. Check.

215
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:08,322
- Check.
- Check.

216
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:12,762
- Echo 2 to Echo 1.
- This is Echo 1. Go ahead.

217
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:21,762
Do you think
they'll really let us join their gang?

218
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:25,842
Nice job!

219
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:30,402
- I'm scared out of my freaking gourd here.
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

220
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:32,882
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to act this cool?

221
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:37,362
Calm down, you're doing great.
All specs are within parameters.

222
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:40,562
You keep leaving me.
I hate it when you leave me.

223
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:43,042
One time you died and I ended up a Mexican.

224
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:47,522
We've been over this. Now, that death thing
was all part of the master plan.

225
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:49,682
Come on.

226
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:52,482
"If you strike me down..."

227
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:57,482
"I shall become more powerful than
you could possibly imagine." Of course.

228
00:16:57,522 --> 00:17:01,122
- You think maybe Willow could kill me, too?
- Hey, don't worry.

229
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:07,402
If Short Round pulls off his end
of the bargain, we'll both become gods.

230
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:10,562
"That boy is our last hope."

231
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:14,122
"No... there is another."

232
00:17:14,162 --> 00:17:17,642
- Really? Who's our last hope?
- No, I was just going with it.

233
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:20,442
It was a thing. No, he's our last hope.

234
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:24,922
Tara? Is it you?

235
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,802
She's sorry she couldn't come herself.

236
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:31,882
Why didn't she? I don't understand.
I mean, if you can manifest yourself...

237
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:36,122
- She just can't.
- Why not? I don't understand.

238
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:38,882
Because of what you did.

239
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:44,762
- What?
- You killed people. You can't see her.

240
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:48,762
It's just how it is. I'm sorry.

241
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,962
But... but she's talking to you?

242
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:57,042
And... and she can hear me?

243
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:59,322
Tara?

244
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:02,722
Tara, I miss you.

245
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:05,802
I miss you so much.

246
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:10,442
Can she hear me?

247
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:15,882
What's happening? Did she say anything?

248
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:19,562
What? Did she go away?

249
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:24,442
- She's crying.
- No. No, don't cry.

250
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:27,002
Don't cry, sweetie. Talk to me.

251
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:31,402
She misses you, too.
She wishes she could touch you.

252
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:35,282
Me too. Oh, me too.

253
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:40,442
Oh, God, Tara. It hurts so much.

254
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:45,762
Every day it's like this giant hole.

255
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:48,282
And it's not getting better.

256
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:52,082
It will. It can.

257
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:54,682
How? You're gone.

258
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:56,922
But you're not.

259
00:18:56,962 --> 00:19:02,162
You're strong, like an Amazon, remember?

260
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:11,162
I do. I remember.

261
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:28,322
<i>(Webster)</i> So, you meet someone,
you form a bond...

262
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:30,402
But it never lasts.

263
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:33,682
Do you mean all relationships, or just yours?

264
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:39,802
My parents weren't exactly the paragon of
stay-togetheryness. Maybe that's part of it.

265
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:43,322
I think there are people out there
who'd make it. I just...

266
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:48,762
target the impossible ones,
with deadly accuracy.

267
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:51,602
You think you do that on purpose?

268
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:54,162
Maybe you're trying to protect yourself?

269
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:56,362
Protecting myself?

270
00:19:56,402 --> 00:20:01,282
From heartbreak, misery,
sexual violence and possible death?

271
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,842
- Not so much.
- From committing.

272
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:07,562
I commit! I'm committed. I'm a committee.

273
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:11,922
So it's them. You're reaching out,
they're just not coming through.

274
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:16,122
It's different. I think you're confusing me
because you're evil.

275
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:20,682
I just think you're in some pain here.
Which I do kind of enjoy, cos I'm evil now.

276
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,762
But you should ease up on yourself.

277
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:26,402
It's not exactly like you have
the patent on bad relationships.

278
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,642
Wouldn't it be cool if I did?

279
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:32,562
And what, are you supposed to be
settling down already? At 21?

280
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,442
You know, my girlfriend at college,
she's so sweet.

281
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:40,522
But that doesn't mean I'm gonna go vampify
her just so we can be together forever.

282
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:42,842
- "Sire."
- What?

283
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:47,602
The word. When you turn a human
into a vampire, it's you "sire" them.

284
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:50,722
- Cool.
- It's a noun, too.

285
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:54,722
Oh, I have so much to learn.
Come on, isn't this insane?

286
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:59,842
I mean, I was afraid to talk to you in high
school. And now we're, like, mortal enemies.

287
00:20:59,882 --> 00:21:02,202
Wouldn't it be cool if we became nemeses?

288
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:05,082
Is that how you say the word?

289
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:07,922
We're gonna have to fight to the death,
aren't we?

290
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:11,442
- It's the time-honoured custom.
- Wow.

291
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:14,122
Reality just shows up sometimes,
doesn't it?

292
00:21:14,162 --> 00:21:17,762
But I've got the bloodlust pumping,
and I kinda get it.

293
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:20,202
I'm looking for a fight.
Nothing personal.

294
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:23,602
- Oh, no. I mean, you've been great.
- And fun catching up.

295
00:21:23,642 --> 00:21:26,882
I haven't kept in contact with
many friends from high school.

296
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:30,162
Guess I'll be looking them up pretty soon.

297
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:32,962
Yeah.

298
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:38,162
Hey, I don't mean to be Count Buttinsky here,
but you just don't seem as thrilled.

299
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:42,482
- Is it because we're gonna fight?
- It's cos I'm gonna win.

300
00:21:42,522 --> 00:21:44,482
<i>(laughs)</i>

301
00:21:44,522 --> 00:21:48,042
Hello?! Two years of tae kwon do
and vampire strength.

302
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:50,442
Somebody's counting their chickens.

303
00:21:50,482 --> 00:21:53,362
You're not leaving this graveyard.
Can't let ya.

304
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:55,842
Do the words "superiority complex"
mean anything?

305
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:57,962
You think I'm gonna let you kill people?

306
00:21:58,002 --> 00:22:00,482
I get the battle against evil.
It's not the issue.

307
00:22:00,522 --> 00:22:03,962
- There is no issue. Don't issue me!
- Just answer me this.

308
00:22:04,002 --> 00:22:06,602
Whose fault was your parents' divorce?

309
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:09,762
OK, this is beyond evil.
This is insane troll logic.

310
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:14,722
- What do my parents have to do with...?
- I'm just curious. Your opinion.

311
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:20,602
- They both had a lot of...
- Off the top of your head.

312
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:24,962
- My dad.
- Uh-huh?

313
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:26,802
He cheated.

314
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:30,002
I... I think he cheated.

315
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:34,482
So... of all of these relationships of yours,

316
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:39,002
that you knew subconsciously
were totally doomed,

317
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:41,082
whose fault is that?

318
00:22:41,122 --> 00:22:43,642
It's incredibly different.

319
00:22:43,682 --> 00:22:48,562
I was just wondering.
Is it possible, even a little bit,

320
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:51,762
that the reason you have trouble
connecting to guys

321
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:55,842
is because you think
maybe they're not worth it?

322
00:22:55,882 --> 00:22:58,042
Maybe you think you're better than them.

323
00:22:58,082 --> 00:23:01,642
- Say, there's that bloodlust I was looking for.
- Struck a nerve.

324
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:06,202
I'll strike a nerve cluster, you don't get off
this! I don't remember you being so annoying.

325
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:07,962
- You don't remember me!
- I do.

326
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:10,482
Yeah, like, after 30 minutes of reminding.

327
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:14,522
I don't take it personally - you were
in your own little world in school.

328
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:17,002
All "chosen". All "destiny".

329
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:20,962
Who could live with that for seven years
and not feel superior?

330
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:26,282
I'm not. My God, if anything...

331
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:31,922
- What?
- I just...

332
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:34,722
If you knew what I've done,

333
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:38,482
what I've let myself become.

334
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:42,602
My best friends don't even...

335
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:46,642
You'd laugh, you heard
some of the things I've done to them.

336
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:52,802
Buffy... I'm here to kill you, not to judge you.

337
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:57,922
The last guy I was with, it got really...

338
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:00,882
I behaved like a monster.

339
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:05,122
Treated him like...

340
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:08,402
And at the same time, I...

341
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:12,042
I let him completely take me over.

342
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:17,722
Do things to me that...

343
00:24:17,762 --> 00:24:20,122
<i>(sniffs)</i> I'm sorry.

344
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:23,402
I didn't mean to get
all true-confessions on you there.

345
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:27,882
I don't know what's wrong with me.

346
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:34,802
There's nothing wrong with you.

347
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:43,802
Everyone's got issues.

348
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:51,202
- You son of a bitch.
- What?!

349
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:56,522
I'm gonna kill you
just a little bit more than usual.

350
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,122
Aw, come on!

351
00:24:58,162 --> 00:25:00,482
I mean, we had a moment.
You opened up.

352
00:25:00,522 --> 00:25:03,082
It was really sweet.
It made me want to bite you.

353
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:09,442
I'm sorry if I overstepped my bounds.
I'm new to this mortal-enemy stuff.

354
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:18,442
Pretty fast learner, though, right?

355
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:24,362
<i>- (Dawn) I hear you.</i>
<i>- (beastly growl)</i>

356
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:31,802
- I hear you breathing.
<i>- (beastly growl)</i>

357
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:34,802
- Are you hurting my mother?
<i>- (beastly growl)</i>

358
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:40,642
Are you keeping her
from coming back to me?

359
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:42,162
Mom?

360
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:45,522
I... I see you.

361
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:50,082
I'm coming towards you, OK?

362
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:53,722
She's trying to talk to me.

363
00:25:53,762 --> 00:26:00,082
Get off her and let her talk to me!

364
00:26:00,122 --> 00:26:06,442
The axe!

365
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,362
Aargh!

366
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:13,642
<i>(demonic voice)</i> Get out!

367
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:19,362
- No!
<i>- (beastly growl)</i>

368
00:26:19,402 --> 00:26:24,042
She's my mother. I'm staying.

369
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:28,602
Seeing the high school again...
part of me wishes I could go back.

370
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:32,042
Everything's shifting around.
I feel like we're in <i>Hellraiser.</i>

371
00:26:32,082 --> 00:26:36,682
- I hate Pinhead.
- Let me see that.

372
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:39,522
Did we circle all the way around?

373
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:41,602
- We should start over.
- There it is.

374
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,042
What?

375
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:47,722
Are you sure?

376
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:55,322
Yeah.

377
00:26:55,362 --> 00:27:00,242
You know, I think you may be right.

378
00:27:00,282 --> 00:27:09,242
If this lines up, what we're looking for
should be right under there.

379
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,642
See? You're dead.

380
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:19,442
That enough of a moment for ya?

381
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:23,922
OK. But are you killing me cos I'm evil
or because you opened up?

382
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:32,922
Agh!

383
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:37,682
What is wrong with you?

384
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,562
Nothing. I got no worries, I'm dead.

385
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:44,562
The biggest thing on my mind is whether
Tricia Waldman came to my funeral.

386
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:47,322
Do you remember her? Ohh - biteable.

387
00:27:47,362 --> 00:27:49,882
See, this is what I hate about you vampires.

388
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:53,882
Sex and death and love and pain -
it's all the same damn thing to you.

389
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:58,242
It's kind of a guy thing.
We talk about nailing a girl, there's all this...

390
00:27:58,282 --> 00:28:02,482
No, it is not the same.
With vampires, it is completely...

391
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:04,642
Believe me, I know.

392
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,842
Oh my God!

393
00:28:06,882 --> 00:28:08,962
Oh your God, what?

394
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:14,042
Well, not my God, because I defy him
and all of his works. Does he exist?

395
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:18,482
- Is there word on that, by the way?
- Nothing solid.

396
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:21,362
I keep getting off topic
cos my mind is racing here.

397
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:24,362
All right. I'll make a deal with you.

398
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,442
We fight, to the death - great.

399
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:28,522
That last fight was exhilarating.

400
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:31,122
I had a move coming up to block that stake.

401
00:28:31,162 --> 00:28:33,442
But you have to answer one question.

402
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:38,202
If I'm right, I get to ask anything -
no secrets, no defensiveness.

403
00:28:38,242 --> 00:28:42,002
Anything I wanna know.

404
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:43,962
What's your question?

405
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:52,962
Your last relationship.
Was it with a vampire?

406
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:58,882
I don't know where to start.

407
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:03,122
After Warren shot you...
You know all about that, what happened?

408
00:29:03,162 --> 00:29:06,842
It was horrible. I was horrible.

409
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:09,962
I lost myself, the regular me.

410
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:12,162
Well, you were grieving.

411
00:29:12,202 --> 00:29:15,722
A lot of people grieve.
They don't make with the flaying.

412
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:19,282
- I hurt so many people.
- It was the power.

413
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:22,442
But I <i>am</i> the power. It's in me.

414
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:25,162
Did I mention
the random destruction of property?

415
00:29:25,202 --> 00:29:29,682
- The Magic Box is not so much a box now.
- The power is bigger than you are.

416
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:32,962
- I know, but...
- Things are more clear where Tara is.

417
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:35,282
Where we are.

418
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:39,002
We can see your path, and you have to stop.

419
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:42,282
You can't use magic again, not ever.

420
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,522
Black magic, of course.

421
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:48,802
But Giles says it isn't as simple
as quitting it all, cold turkey.

422
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:53,082
It's too dangerous. You can't
take the chance that you'll lose control.

423
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:56,002
I don't want to. I can't.

424
00:29:56,042 --> 00:30:00,082
- I never wanna cause that kind of pain.
- Of course you don't.

425
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:02,682
So, I won't.

426
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:06,042
I'm gonna be OK.

427
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:08,322
She says...

428
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:10,162
What?

429
00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:19,162
You're not gonna be OK.
You're gonna kill everybody.

430
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:33,802
- We almost got this thing uncovered.
- Yep.

431
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:38,842
I hope Buffy'll know how to destroy it.
36-19-27. That's it!

432
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:43,602
That was my locker combination.
It's been bugging me all night.

433
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:46,402
I spent years
trying to forget about high school.

434
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:51,122
- Why are you trying so hard to remember it?
- I guess I miss it. Don't you?

435
00:30:51,162 --> 00:30:54,442
- Yeah, I really miss it(!)
- I'm serious. I really miss it.

436
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:57,882
Time goes by and everything drops away.

437
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,962
All the cruelty, all the pain,
all the humiliation.

438
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:04,402
It all washes away.

439
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:07,482
I miss my friends. I miss my enemies.

440
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:12,162
I miss the people I talked to every day.
I miss the people who never knew I existed.

441
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:15,642
I miss 'em all.

442
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:17,922
I wanna talk to them, you know?

443
00:31:17,962 --> 00:31:23,282
I wanna find out how they're doing.
I wanna know what's going on in their lives.

444
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:29,042
You know what? They don't wanna talk to
you - all those people you just mentioned.

445
00:31:29,082 --> 00:31:34,762
Not one of them is sitting around going
"I wonder what Jonathan's up to right now."

446
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:38,922
Not one of them cares about you.

447
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:42,922
Well, I still care about them.

448
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:51,922
That's why I'm here.

449
00:31:51,962 --> 00:31:55,402
<i>- (growling)</i>
- <i>(Dawn)</i> I know you're there.

450
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:57,482
I will cast you out.

451
00:31:57,522 --> 00:31:59,682
My mother needs to talk to me.

452
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:06,762
<i>(growling continues)</i>

453
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:12,322
I cast you from this place.
It is your poison and your bane.

454
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:14,362
<i>(beastly growling)</i>

455
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:19,002
- It is the skin that is cut from your flesh!
<i>- (growling continues)</i>

456
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:27,802
Aargh!

457
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:31,722
And the joke is, he loved me.

458
00:32:31,762 --> 00:32:38,282
I mean, in his own sick, soulless way
he really did care for me.

459
00:32:38,322 --> 00:32:41,562
But I didn't wanna be loved.

460
00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:44,002
Didn't you?

461
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:47,202
I have all this power.

462
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:51,002
I didn't ask for it.
I don't deserve it.

463
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:56,522
It's like... I wanted to be punished.

464
00:32:56,562 --> 00:33:02,882
I wanted to hurt like I thought I deserved.

465
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:05,322
I sorta think...

466
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:09,722
You know, this is complicated.
If you'd rather just fight...

467
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:12,082
Tell me.

468
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:15,962
I feel like I'm worse than anyone.

469
00:33:16,002 --> 00:33:19,562
Honestly, I'm beneath them.

470
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:21,802
My friends, my boyfriends -

471
00:33:21,842 --> 00:33:27,402
I... feel like I'm not worthy of their love.

472
00:33:27,442 --> 00:33:29,522
Cos even though they love me,

473
00:33:29,562 --> 00:33:37,162
it doesn't mean anything
because their opinions don't matter.

474
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:39,442
They don't know.

475
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:43,042
They haven't been through
what I've been through.

476
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:45,442
They're not the Slayer.

477
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,962
I am.

478
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:52,562
Sometimes I feel...

479
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:57,882
This is awful.

480
00:33:57,922 --> 00:34:02,602
I feel like I'm better than them.

481
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:06,602
Superior.

482
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:09,322
Until you can't win.

483
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:11,442
And I thought I was diabolical.

484
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,242
Or at least I plan to be.

485
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:19,802
You do have a superiority complex. And
you've got an inferiority complex about it.

486
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:22,002
Kudos.

487
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:24,082
It doesn't make any sense.

488
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:29,162
Oh... it makes every kind of sense.

489
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:32,602
And it all adds up to you feeling alone.

490
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:35,802
But, Buffy, everybody feels alone.

491
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:41,362
Everybody is. Until you die.

492
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,722
Speaking of...

493
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:47,602
you ready for our little death match?

494
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:50,482
I suppose.

495
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,602
Uh... thanks for listening.

496
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:57,762
Oh, you know, there's some things
you can only tell a stranger.

497
00:34:57,802 --> 00:35:01,402
You're not a stranger.

498
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:04,202
- That stuff with Spike is pretty...
- Hold it.

499
00:35:04,242 --> 00:35:13,202
- What?
- Did you say Spike?

500
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:24,482
I cast you out with every prayer

501
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:29,962
from every god that walks the Earth
or crawls beneath.

502
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:34,682
I cast you out
with the strength of those who love me.

503
00:35:34,722 --> 00:35:39,082
I cast you out
with the strength I have inside me!

504
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:41,602
I cast you out into the void!

505
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:49,882
<i>- (beastly groans)</i>
- Die, you bastard!

506
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:58,882
<i>(noise and wind stop)</i>

507
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:18,522
Mom?

508
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:22,282
- I'm gonna what?
- That's why I came. We needed to warn you.

509
00:36:22,322 --> 00:36:24,482
You saw my path?

510
00:36:24,522 --> 00:36:27,482
What do you know?
What did you see?

511
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:30,602
- You don't wanna know what we saw.
- Oh, God!

512
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:33,802
But if you stop - completely, no more magic...

513
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:36,322
Right. Right, stop.

514
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,162
What about Giles?

515
00:36:38,202 --> 00:36:43,042
He made it seem like it was just as dangerous
for me to quit completely.

516
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:46,362
You can't. If you do
so much as another spell...

517
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:49,242
I tried to stop. I tried.

518
00:36:49,282 --> 00:36:51,922
- What if I can't do this?
- Don't think that way.

519
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:56,162
How can I not?! You're telling me
I'm gonna murder all my friends.

520
00:36:56,202 --> 00:37:02,322
I'm not strong.
I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me.

521
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:05,242
There is one thing.

522
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:08,642
- One thing you could do to stop it.
- What? Anything.

523
00:37:08,682 --> 00:37:13,202
Then you could see her.
You wouldn't have to talk through me.

524
00:37:13,242 --> 00:37:15,442
- Tara?
- That's what you want, isn't it?

525
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:18,042
- Of course.
- So go. Be with her.

526
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:22,322
Everybody will be safe,
and you'll be together again.

527
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:24,762
It's not that bad.

528
00:37:24,802 --> 00:37:27,162
Really.

529
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:36,162
It's just like going to sleep.

530
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:37,962
Who are you?

531
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:40,402
What do you mean?
How do you know Spike?

532
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:43,162
What do you mean, how?
He was the guy that...

533
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:45,642
- Oh, what's the word?
- Sired.

534
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:54,642
Yeah, he was the guy that sired me.

535
00:37:56,362 --> 00:38:00,202
Things are coming, Dawn.
Listen, things are on their way.

536
00:38:00,242 --> 00:38:03,122
I love you and I love Buffy.

537
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:06,002
But she won't be there for you.

538
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:08,082
What?

539
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:12,682
- Why are you...
- When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you.

540
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:19,322
She'll be against you.

541
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:20,362
No!

542
00:38:20,402 --> 00:38:22,322
No, don't go!

543
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:31,322
Please, don't go!

544
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:44,362
The suicide thing was too far, huh?

545
00:38:44,402 --> 00:38:48,962
- Hm. You seemed so ripe.
- Tell me who you are.

546
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:54,642
I stand by my opinion. The world'd be a better
place if you took a razor blade to your wrist.

547
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,282
Stop.

548
00:38:56,322 --> 00:38:58,882
I can see it now.

549
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:05,362
Candlelight, the Indigo Girls playing, picture
of your dead girlfriend on your bloody lap.

550
00:39:05,402 --> 00:39:08,202
- Stop it.
- "Oh, baby, you left such a big hole!"

551
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:11,882
"It hurts so bad!"

552
00:39:11,922 --> 00:39:16,642
This last year will seem like cake after
what I put you and your friends through,

553
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:19,562
and I am not a fan of easy death.

554
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:23,802
The whole good-versus-evil,
balancing-the-scales thing? I'm over it.

555
00:39:23,842 --> 00:39:31,402
I'm done with the mortal coil.
But believe me, I'm going for a big finish.

556
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:34,162
From beneath you, it devours.

557
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:36,722
Oh, not it.

558
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:45,722
Me.

559
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:57,122
