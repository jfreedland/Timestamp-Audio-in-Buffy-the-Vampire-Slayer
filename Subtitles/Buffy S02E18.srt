2
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,995
Non-vampire, plus two.

3
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,456
Hi.

4
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,920
Man, Buffy. My whole life just flashed
before my eyes. I gotta get me a life.

5
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:47,382
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

6
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:50,927
- I'm patrolling.
- Buffy, you're sick.

7
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:56,599
No, I feel fine. I mean, the world's spinning
a little bit, but I like it. It's kinda like a ride.

8
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:00,145
Half the school's out with this flu.
It's a serious deal.

9
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:02,730
We're all concerned
about how gross you look.

10
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,358
I'm touched. Really. But I have work to do.

11
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,903
Buffy, come on.
One night of rest is not gonna kill you.

12
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:12,532
- No. But it might kill somebody else.
- You mean Angel might.

13
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,620
Buffy, this is not the time to challenge Angel.

14
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:21,583
- He's at full strength. You're half a slayer.
- But I'm still the Slayer.

15
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,711
As long as I am,
Angel's not gonna kill anybody else.

16
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,379
Ah, come on!

17
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,382
Just one more.

18
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:38,558
Not feeling well, lover?

19
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:47,525
That helped.

20
00:01:56,743 --> 00:02:00,205
You know, you being off your game's
taken the fun out of all this.

21
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:03,583
Nope. Still fun.

22
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:17,305
Uh-oh.
This does not look good for our heroine.

23
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,818
Take a walk, overbite.

24
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:32,987
We'll have to do this again sometime.

25
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,741
Buffy, are you OK?

26
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:40,995
I told you guys to leave. I... I...

27
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,874
Buffy?!

28
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,628
Buffy?

29
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,231
- We need help!
- Somebody, please!

30
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,900
What happened?

31
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,446
- The flu, fainted and fell. She's sick.
- It's gonna be OK. Let's get her up.

32
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,537
The patient's unconscious.
Pupils are unequal and unresponsive.

33
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,582
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Please, give us some room.

34
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,543
- What do we have?
- High-grade fever, possible fractures.

35
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,380
Get her into Trauma One. Give her a CBC,
chem seven, type and screen.

36
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,927
- I'm sorry. You can't go any further.
- Someone should be with her!

37
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:28,392
I'll call Giles. Call Buffy's mom. Tell her...
not what happened. Just get her here.

38
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,620
- Where is she?
- She's still in the emergency room.

39
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:51,040
- I wanna see her.
- They won't let us in.

40
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,125
- Ms Summers?
- I'm Dr Wilkinson.

41
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,795
- Is Buffy OK?
- We were able to stabilise...

42
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,713
- Is she OK?
- She's going to be fine.

43
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:03,051
- Thank you.
- Good. Good. That's good.

44
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,681
I wanna keep her here a few days, though.
She still has some healing to do.

45
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,313
Buffy? Hi, sweetheart.

46
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,731
Hey, Buffy. We're all here.

47
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:18,984
Hey. Here we are.

48
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:23,029
It's all of we. Are we taking me home?

49
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:26,200
No. Buffy, you need to lie down, honey.

50
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:32,664
Uh... lie at home. My bed is better
than any bed that's not my bed.

51
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:38,254
- She's still a little out of it.
- Shh. Hospital zone. No singing.

52
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:42,592
- She'll feel better after being here a while.
- No. Let me go. I wanna go.

53
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:47,262
- No! No! Let me go! Stop it!
- Hold her steady!

54
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,432
Giles, tell them! The vampires!
I need to kill the vampires!

55
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:53,352
This'll help you relax.

56
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:56,772
- No! No!
- Easy.

57
00:05:57,397 --> 00:05:59,774
- Gotta be the fever.
- It made her delusional.

58
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,737
- They're out there!
- Yes, we'll, er...

59
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,614
..we'll get those vampires later.

60
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,827
- I hear it's best to play along.
- Honey, listen...

61
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:14,040
- I wanna go home.
- It's gonna be OK. I promise.

62
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,126
- Please don't make me stay here.
- I promise.

63
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,566
That was a new experience.
I'm not used to seeing Buffy scared.

64
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,734
Yeah. She just hates hospitals.

65
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,362
- Since she was a little girl.
- What happened?

66
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,492
When she was eight,
her cousin, Celia, died in a hospital.

67
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,827
- Buffy was alone with her at the time.
- Yuck.

68
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,373
- Yeah. They were very close.
- When she was eight?

69
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,255
Well, it looks like she's asleep.
I should go call her father.

70
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:05,132
Erm, I think there's a phone.

71
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,094
Thank you for coming. I really appreciate
the way you look out for her.

72
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,222
All of you.

73
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:15,560
We're, er, we're very fond of her.
The, er... the telephone.

74
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,022
I, I... I hope I'm not out of line, but...

75
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,151
..I wanted to say how sorry I am
about that teacher, Ms Calendar.

76
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:27,196
Buffy said you were close.

77
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,991
Thank you.

78
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,536
Buffy's been so down since it happened.
I mean, she never gets sick.

79
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:37,415
I'm sure she'll be... she'll be fine.

80
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:42,545
I'm sorry. I... I babble when I'm nervous.
I just wanted to...

81
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:45,714
Well, if you need anything.

82
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:50,386
Thank you. Thank you.

83
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:55,807
- D'you think she's gonna be OK?
- I don't know.

84
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:59,520
Lysette got her nose done here.
She came in for the Gwyneth Paltrow...

85
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,482
- ..and it looked more like the Mr Potato Head.
- Cordy.

86
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,611
Buffy's not in here for cosmetic surgery.

87
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,072
No, but while she's in here,
she might as well get that thing done.

88
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,699
You know, that thing on her face?

89
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,411
- You know that thing.
- Do you think Angel will attack Buffy here?

90
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,664
- He can come in. It's a public building.
- That's true.

91
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,336
Am I the only one that's noticed that thing?

92
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:06,957
Is that better?

93
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:42,200
Man, I hate it when you lose the young ones.

94
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,091
I'm just saying, step back on the
dosage until we can analyse the results.

95
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,176
There isn't time.
That should be clear to you.

96
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:04,140
- The normal course of treat...
- They aren't responding. They're worse.

97
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,809
- Raising their temperature...
- Dr Wilkinson,...

98
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,062
- ..I have the consent of the parents.
- They're desperate.

99
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,065
If you have a problem with my methods,
speak to the board.

100
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,402
I have.

101
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,616
He comes at night.
The grown-ups don't see him.

102
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,744
He was with Tina. He'll come back for us.

103
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:28,663
- Who?
- Death.

104
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:46,429
Visiting hours are over.

105
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:49,600
- Well, I'm pretty much family.
- Yeah.

106
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,896
Why don't you come back during the day?
Oh, gee, no. I guess you can't.

107
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:59,943
If I decide to walk into Buffy's room,
do you think for one microsecond...

108
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:02,654
..that you could stop me?

109
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:07,283
Maybe not.
Maybe that security guard couldn't either.

110
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:10,411
Or those cops. Or the orderlies.

111
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,916
But I'm kinda curious to find out.

112
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,460
You game?

113
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:20,838
Buffy's white knight.

114
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,593
You still love her.

115
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,351
It must just eat you up that I got there first.

116
00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:38,357
You're gonna die.

117
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,485
And I'm gonna be there.

118
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:45,488
Tell her I stopped by.

119
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,459
Help me! Help! Avalanche!
Help! Help! I'm trapped!

120
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:02,505
- Avalanche! Help!
- Power Girl to the rescue!

121
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:05,259
Help me! Help! Help!

122
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:12,724
- You saved me! Thank you, Power Girl!
- You're safe now.

123
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,791
Good morning.

124
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:44,381
- Could've fooled me.
- How are you feeling?

125
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:48,260
- Looks like your fever's gone down.
- Oh, good! Thanks for having me.

126
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:52,056
- Let's try and keep in touch.
- Not so fast.

127
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:55,893
- Hmm...
- Good "hmm" or bad "hmm"?.

128
00:14:57,226 --> 00:15:01,106
- The swelling's... gone. Does this hurt?
- No.

129
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,235
- Amazing.
- Then I should probably go.

130
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,612
No. Soon. We have to make sure
that fever is gone.

131
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:11,033
That's a strong virus you have.
Maybe not as strong as you, but...

132
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:13,953
Is that the same virus the kids have?

133
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:16,372
May we come in?

134
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:20,084
Please. Maybe you can keep
our patient from bolting.

135
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,835
Rest. Hmm?

136
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,215
Flowers for milady.

137
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:30,845
- I think they call those balloons.
- Yeah, stick 'em in water, maybe they'll grow.

138
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:33,471
Not to be outdone.

139
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:35,932
- Homework?
- It's my way of saying "get well soon".

140
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:39,143
You know, chocolate says that even better.

141
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,023
I did all your assignments,
so all you have to do is sign your name.

142
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:45,484
Chocolate means nothing to me.

143
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:52,199
Nobody told me I was supposed to bring
a gift. I was out of the loop on gifts.

144
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:56,536
It's traditional among, erm... people. Erm...

145
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:01,000
Grapes.

146
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:05,045
Well, did you pass the night well enough?

147
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,299
Not really. Something happened
I thought you...

148
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:12,678
You know what? Let's take a walk.

149
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:19,518
- Now this part I could get used to.
- Do you want me to go real fast?

150
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:23,771
- Not that I would.
- You were discussing, erm, stuff?

151
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,734
Yes, stuff. Um...

152
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,652
- You know a girl died here last night.
- How?

153
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:31,988
Well, the flu.

154
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:35,366
- Flu? Doesn't exactly sound monsterrific.
- I know.

155
00:16:35,783 --> 00:16:40,122
But there's this Dr Backer, and he's been
giving them these experimental treatments.

156
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:43,375
I'm not sure what he's up to,
but he's a little creepy.

157
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:47,004
Then there was this kid, Ryan.
He said he saw something.

158
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:49,632
- Saw what?
- Death.

159
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:53,135
- Death?
- The Death? As in "It is your time"?

160
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:57,181
- Buffy, a frightened child...
- But I thought I saw something.

161
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,309
- I'm not sure. I was really out of it, but...
- But you do know that you saw Death?

162
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:04,562
- Did it have an hourglass?
- If he asks you to play chess, don't do it.

163
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:07,774
- The guy's like a whiz.
- Maybe it wasn't Death.

164
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:11,987
- Maybe it was something else.
- This isn't about being afraid of hospitals...

165
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:16,075
..cos your friend died and you wanna
conjure up a monster you can fight...

166
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,411
..so you can save everybody
and not feel so helpless?

167
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:25,625
- Cordelia, have you ever heard of tact?
- Tact is just not saying true stuff. I'll pass.

168
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,089
- Your mom did tell us about your cousin.
- This has nothing to do with that.

169
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:33,342
This little boy, Ryan, is afraid of something.
Something real.

170
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,719
As long as I'm forced to stay here,
I'm gonna find out what.

171
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:39,807
So is this the part where we say
"What can we do to help?"

172
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:49,316
You had to ask that, didn't you?

173
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:53,487
It'll be cake. We just gotta figure out
what killed this little girl, Tina.

174
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:56,406
We'll be out. Five minutes, tops.

175
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,534
This is what happens when
you're compassionate to sick people.

176
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:02,621
They take advantage of you.

177
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:06,250
Uh-huh.
Buffy almost died just to put you out.

178
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,918
I didn't want to be the first one to say it.

179
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:13,549
- You there. Me here.
- Right.

180
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:28,354
What are you doing here?

181
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:31,482
- So, where do we start?
- Hmm?

182
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:34,945
Oh, I don't know. Er, maybe look into
the history of the hospital,...

183
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:40,534
- ..bizarre incidents, that sort of thing.
- I'm sensing less than full committal here.

184
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:42,745
I suppose so.

185
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:48,458
Cordelia may be Homerically insensitive,
but she may also be right.

186
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:53,630
Death and disease are things - possibly
the only things - that Buffy cannot fight.

187
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:57,218
It's only natural for her to try to create
a defeatable opponent.

188
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,636
Especially now, after...

189
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:02,848
..after Jenny.

190
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,895
That's true, but on the
"we live on the Hellmouth" side,...

191
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:11,440
..these kids may have seen a monster.

192
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:15,986
Well, a... a monster that grown-ups can't see?

193
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,404
Doesn't ring a bell.

194
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,702
- Unless...
- Unless?

195
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:27,873
Sometimes small children
do see something we adults don't.

196
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:31,919
Us. Our true selves. Our... our hidden faces.

197
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:36,130
So, the kids might be afraid
of a regular person?

198
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,051
- Like the weird doctor.
- Stanley Backer was his name, no?

199
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:42,179
Let's look him up.

200
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:48,268
Most people think that security guards
are just guys that failed the police exam.

201
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,521
But that's not me. This is my career.

202
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:54,733
Stereotypes are so unfair.

203
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:58,362
I did take the fireman's exam, though.
I didn't do so good.

204
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:04,201
Oh, well, you know, I think that security
guards are way sexier than firemen.

205
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:06,661
They're all sooty.

206
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:10,957
Well, this is where all the action is, anyhow.
I'm all the time restraining people.

207
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,960
Hmm. How thrilling.

208
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:17,673
Do you ever get scared?

209
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:20,551
"Fear is for the weak." That's my motto.

210
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:24,847
Either that, or "Live in the now."
I haven't decided yet.

211
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:29,976
I bet you see a lot of tragedy.
You know, like that little girl.

212
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,024
Oh, one of Dr Backer's patients.
Dr Backer's a great man.

213
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:38,818
He understands the real truth about children.

214
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,156
- What's that?
- Sometimes they die.

215
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,076
What was that?

216
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:50,748
Uh, you know, I didn't hear anything.
You know, you have the most...

217
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:54,126
..perfect nose I've ever seen.

218
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:01,257
You must work out.

219
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,720
Yeah.

220
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:13,729
Could you make just a little more
with the touchy-gropey?

221
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,315
- Jealous?
- Of Rogaine Boy?

222
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:20,069
- I don't think so. Here, take this to Giles, OK?
- What about you?

223
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:23,821
- I'm gonna stay here.
- Your obsession with protecting Buffy.

224
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,658
Have I told you how attractive that's not?

225
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:30,828
- Cordelia, someone's gotta watch her back.
- Yeah, I've seen you watch her back.

226
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:35,124
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I was using the phrase "watch her back"...

227
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,795
..as a euphemism for looking at her butt.
You know, sort of a pun.

228
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:41,130
Oh. Right.

229
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:44,801
- Hey!
- Well, you do.

230
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:47,762
Jealous?

231
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:50,724
Fine. Watch my back.

232
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:29,512
Hey. Remember me?

233
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,350
- You shouldn't be here.
- Why not?

234
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:38,896
- Contagious.
- Nah. I already got what you got.

235
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:45,070
What? You think because I'm a grown-up?
Believe me, I'm not that grown-up.

236
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:56,290
He'll come again tonight.

237
00:22:56,706 --> 00:22:58,708
Ryan, listen to me.

238
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:02,587
I'm not gonna let this thing hurt you.
Any of you.

239
00:23:02,962 --> 00:23:08,427
Grown-ups don't believe you, right? I do.
We both know that there are real monsters.

240
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:13,224
But there's also real heroes
that fight monsters. And that's me.

241
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:17,727
You can't fight Death.

242
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,947
Well, Dr Backer
has something of a rap sheet.

243
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,995
Reprimands for controversial experiments,
risky procedures, a malpractice suit...

244
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:38,957
Looks like it was dropped suddenly.

245
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:43,170
Factor in Buffy's observation
that he gives her the, erm, wiggins.

246
00:23:43,628 --> 00:23:45,880
This may be our death guy?

247
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:51,136
I just wish I knew
what he was doing to these children.

248
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:02,982
5O6...

249
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,740
Yes...

250
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:26,129
Yes.

251
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:41,181
- Well, it looks as if you were onto something.
- I know.

252
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:47,854
The, uh, the girl, Tina, erm... It's apparent
that she died of the fever, simple enough.

253
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:52,316
But her records show her improving
and then suddenly deteriorating...

254
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,568
..without any apparent cause.

255
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,656
So we checked Dr Backer out.
This guy was not a solid citizen.

256
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:01,826
It wasn't Backer. He was clean.

257
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:04,370
- What do you mean, clean?
- What do you mean, was?

258
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:07,916
He's dead. This thing killed him,
and not with kindness.

259
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,044
- You saw it?
- No, it's invisible.

260
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:15,964
I saw Backer nearly shredded
and then it knocked me down. But it's real.

261
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:18,218
Which means I get to fight it.

262
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:21,386
Er... this is your work?

263
00:27:22,013 --> 00:27:25,682
- No. One of the kids.
- Oh, er...

264
00:27:27,017 --> 00:27:30,145
Erm... well,
it would help if we knew what it was.

265
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:34,901
It's invisible to you,
but the children can see it.

266
00:27:35,151 --> 00:27:39,864
- You did see something the other night.
- I was delirious. It doesn't make any sense.

267
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:43,785
- Why would I see it then and not last night?
- Good morning.

268
00:27:45,786 --> 00:27:49,207
Ooh, looks like I interrupted a secret meeting.

269
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,500
You sure didn't.

270
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:56,088
Honey, I just talked to the doctor
and she said I can take you home.

271
00:27:57,673 --> 00:27:59,926
No. I should stay here.

272
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:04,054
- But I thought you'd be ready...
- I think my symptoms are flaring up.

273
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:07,432
- She doesn't look well.
- Cos I'm not well. I feel all ooky.

274
00:28:08,308 --> 00:28:11,145
Increased ooky-ness. That's a danger signal.

275
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:15,275
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah. But just for a day... or so.

276
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:19,195
OK, well, I'll, uh.. I'll talk to the doctor.

277
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:26,827
So, what's the drill?

278
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:30,707
Giles, see if you can get a mug shot.
I need to know what I'm fighting.

279
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:33,543
- Right.
- I'll check Backer's office.

280
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,254
See if I can find any Post-its marked
"Why a monster might want me dead."

281
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:38,756
Sounds like a plan.

282
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:41,634
If I find anything,
I won't know what it means, so, Will...

283
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:46,138
Oh, yeah, I'm good at medical stuff.
Xander and I used to play doctor all the time.

284
00:28:47,723 --> 00:28:52,227
No. She's being literal. She had these medical
volumes, and diagnosed me with stuff.

285
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:55,690
I couldn't tell her she was playing it wrong.

286
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:58,693
Wrong? Why? How did you play doctor?

287
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:00,904
I... never have.

288
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:05,282
Erm... fascinating though this is...

289
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:08,119
Yeah. Right. Go.

290
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:13,248
- We'll call you if we... know something.
- Know something soon.

291
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:16,544
I'd best head to the library.
Research beckons.

292
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,172
I'm on sentry duty.
Angel won't show till sundown, if at all.

293
00:29:20,255 --> 00:29:23,383
- Maybe I'll get lucky with this death guy.
- He's invisible.

294
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,346
Yeah, but if I see a floating pipe
and a smoking jacket, he's dropped.

295
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:30,849
- You two stay alert.
- Finding out who this thing is takes priority.

296
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:35,020
- Cordy, you should go with Giles.
- Why do I have to have...

297
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:40,276
Good thinking.
I could do with a research assistant.

298
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:42,737
Let's go, Tact Guy.

299
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:45,865
Yes.

300
00:29:47,157 --> 00:29:48,993
Be careful.

301
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:29,534
It's weird going through his things.

302
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:32,537
Look. He didn't finish his coffee.

303
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,207
- Guess he won't.
- Yep.

304
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,085
Another person I wasn't in time to save.

305
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:42,254
It's too bad Angel didn't put me
in the hospital sooner.

306
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,174
There's something
I never thought I'd hear myself say.

307
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:51,681
- Hey, wait. I think I have something.
- Mm. Sherlock.

308
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:54,601
OK, this makes sense.

309
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:56,977
Dr Backer was trying to inoculate the kids...

310
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:01,815
..with a controlled dosage
of the same virus they already had.

311
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:05,611
Raising their temperatures
to burn the fever out of them.

312
00:31:05,986 --> 00:31:09,364
- Would that work?
- According to this, it was starting to.

313
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:14,913
- So he really was trying to help the kids.
- Until that thing stopped him.

314
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,252
Eww! What does this do?

315
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:24,463
- What?
- What does this do?

316
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:30,469
Er, it, er, extracts vital organs
to replenish its own mutating cells.

317
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,846
Wow!

318
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:36,142
What does this one do?

319
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:43,066
Erm, it elongates its mouth to engulf
its victim's head with its incisors.

320
00:31:43,523 --> 00:31:46,652
Ouch. Wait, what does this one do?

321
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:51,407
It asks endless questions while it's supposed
to be working so nothing is getting done.

322
00:31:52,282 --> 00:31:54,701
Boy, there's a demon for everything.

323
00:31:58,957 --> 00:32:01,417
I don't even know if we're on the right track.

324
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:05,545
Since this, er, miscreant has only been seen
by select individuals,...

325
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:09,926
..there's a chance
we won't ever find a picture of it.

326
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:12,594
Well, it's not in here.

327
00:32:21,478 --> 00:32:23,982
- It's called "Der Kindestod".
- Who is this?

328
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:26,817
- It's me. I've got your monster.
- Where's Giles?

329
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:29,820
- Looking up stuff.
- Well, can you put him on?

330
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:33,448
- Hey, I found your guy, OK? Just listen.
- Right.

331
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:36,159
The name means "Child Death".

332
00:32:36,494 --> 00:32:39,747
It says that he feeds off of children
by sucking the life out of them,

333
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:44,501
Ugh! But anyway, afterwards, it looks like
they died because they were sick.

334
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:47,297
- So, it did kill Tina.
- That's my take,

335
00:32:47,754 --> 00:32:51,842
Cos it would be looking at the children's
ward as an all-you-can-eat kind of thing.

336
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,263
Backer was curing the kids
and taking away its food.

337
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:59,058
- Hence the sliceage.
- I got a picture of how it kills. Let me talk to...

338
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:02,020
- Oh, eww!
- What?

339
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:08,067
Oh! You should see this thing!
The way it does its thing, I mean... eww!

340
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:12,404
Why do I let you guys
drag me into this stuff?

341
00:33:14,032 --> 00:33:17,784
- Buffy? Are you still there?
- Hanging on every "eww".

342
00:33:19,036 --> 00:33:20,288
Erm, the, erm...

343
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:25,001
The Kindestod gorges by sitting atop
his prey, pinning it down helplessly.

344
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,170
Then he slowly draws out the life,

345
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,465
It must be horrifying for the victim,

346
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:36,721
Buffy? Hello?

347
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:42,768
Celia?

348
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:48,106
What's wrong?

349
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:51,276
I don't know what to do, Celia!

350
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:53,780
Help! Help! Help!

351
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:55,740
Somebody, help!

352
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:57,783
Come on, Celia!

353
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:08,795
Buffy, what is it?

354
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:13,466
Thanks.

355
00:34:13,466 --> 00:34:16,886
- It killed Celia.
- Your cousin?

356
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:20,347
We have to get this thing.
Before it gets any more kids.

357
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:24,436
- You will. We will.
- But how? I can't even see it.

358
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:28,064
- You saw it once.
- Did I?

359
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:33,986
Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me.
I was crazed with that fever. Who knows...

360
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:39,784
- Buffy, think about this.
- I have. Lots of thoughts.

361
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:44,162
- It's crazy.
- The fever. It's how you see the Kindestod.

362
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:48,834
That's why Celia could see it.
That's why Ryan still can. It's the only way.

363
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:53,256
But how are you gonna fight this thing
with a 100° temperature?

364
00:34:54,047 --> 00:34:55,924
- I guess we'll find out.
- Buffy!

365
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:57,510
I'm going to do this.

366
00:34:57,802 --> 00:35:01,598
Buffy, that's 100 per cent pure.
It'll kill you in an instant.

367
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,769
Oh. They really should put that on the label.

368
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:11,523
It needs to be diluted.

369
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,194
OK, but this better work fast.

370
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:20,700
Faster than that.

371
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,041
Here's to my health.

372
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:41,596
Oh, God.
I'm not sure this was such a good idea.

373
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:45,349
- Hang in there. You'll be OK.
- OK. I'm OK.

374
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:49,061
The kids.

375
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:51,564
They're gone.

376
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:02,699
Come on! Hurry! Keep quiet!

377
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:11,333
- What could've happened?
- I don't know. Maybe we're too late.

378
00:36:11,374 --> 00:36:15,127
Maybe they moved. Maybe I don't...
I'm burning up.

379
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:23,512
- Will?
- What?

380
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:26,098
I think it's in there.

381
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:02,550
He's going after them! We've gotta get him.

382
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:05,594
- OK, we'll get him in a second.
- What's wrong?

383
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:10,391
- Uh, uh... she's not feeling well... again.
- You should be in bed.

384
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:13,562
- No, it's not that bad.
- No, you're coming with me.

385
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:15,771
She's sorry.

386
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,902
Security. Come to the children's ward.
We have a situation.

387
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:27,074
OK, come on, now.
We can do this the easy way.

388
00:37:28,952 --> 00:37:32,581
Frogs! Frogs! Get 'em off of me!
Oh, my God! Frogs! Get them off of me!

389
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:36,585
Please help! Get 'em off! Frogs! Frogs!

390
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:40,964
- Oh, my God! Horrible frogs! Get 'em off!
- Not her! The other one!

391
00:37:42,715 --> 00:37:44,551
- No more frogs.
- Come on!

392
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:54,061
- Buffy, are you OK? Did Angel...?
- No. We need to get to the basement.

393
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,294
Come on.

394
00:38:19,753 --> 00:38:22,046
- It's cold.
- Here.

395
00:38:23,507 --> 00:38:26,968
- Here. We're gonna be safe in here.
- Look out!

396
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,553
What? Oh!

397
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,480
- You don't know how to kill this thing?
- I thought I might try violence.

398
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:42,066
Solid call.

399
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:46,155
Help!

400
00:39:26,694 --> 00:39:28,906
You make me sick.

401
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:48,341
Come on! Come on! Come on!

402
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,739
Are you OK?

403
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:57,452
Actually, I think I'm starting to feel better.

404
00:40:58,036 --> 00:40:59,872
Let's... Oh.

405
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:04,458
He's dead, right? I heard something snap.

406
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:08,379
- That would be his neck.
- You're not gonna yak on me, are ya?

407
00:41:13,385 --> 00:41:16,721
Here you go, honey. Peanut butter and jelly.
Without the crust.

408
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:19,141
- Just the way you like it.
- And the juice?

409
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:23,103
- Two parts orange, one part grapefruit.
- That's my drink.

410
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,855
I measured it exactly.

411
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:28,983
Oh, Mom?

412
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,488
- I wanted crunchy peanut butter.
- Oh. Sorry.

413
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:35,866
And I said extra jelly.

414
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,787
Anything to help my daughter get well.

415
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:44,750
Oh, and while you're up, could I get a refill?
It's just, I'm so comfortable.

416
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,209
- Of course.
- Thanks.

417
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:52,216
Oh ! Oh ! Oh !
And another bag of Chee-Zee chips.

418
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:58,137
- Uh, you ate the last one.
- Another bag's hidden behind the raisins.

419
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,350
I'm on it.

420
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,190
Your mom's trying to bogart
the Chee-Zee chips. What's that all about?

421
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:12,027
Oh, Buffy. Here. Um, this came in the mail.

422
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,947
- It's from Ryan.
- The boy from the hospital?

423
00:42:21,577 --> 00:42:24,039
Oh, he drew you a picture. How...

424
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:25,916
..nice.
