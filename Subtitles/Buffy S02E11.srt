1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,254
In every generation there is a Chosen One,

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:09,510
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness,

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,970
She is the Slayer,

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,369
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, Xander, he was obviously in charge.

5
00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:19,478
He was a puppet. She was using him.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,856
He didn't seem like the type of guy
who would let himself be used.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:27,444
That was her genius! He didn't know
he was playing second fiddle. Buffy...

8
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:31,615
Who was the real power,
the Captain or Tennille?

9
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,753
Um, who are these people?

10
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:36,909
The Captain and Tennille?!

11
00:00:36,944 --> 00:00:39,965
Boy, somebody was raised
in a culture-free environment!

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,093
- I'm sorry! I was just...
- Thinkin'?

13
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:46,847
No, not thinking.
Having a lot of happy not-thoughts.

14
00:00:46,882 --> 00:00:49,350
I love it when
things are quiet around here.

15
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:51,938
Yeah, with Spike and Drusilla
out of the way,

16
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:54,190
we've really been ridin' the mellow!

17
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:57,650
And I am really jinxin'
the hell out of us by sayin' that.

18
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,841
Yeah, but we'll let you off this time.

19
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:05,100
So, we're pretty sure there are no more
Tarakan assassins coming our way?

20
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:08,497
- Angel's sources say the contract's off.
- How is Angel?

21
00:01:08,744 --> 00:01:10,621
- Pretend I care.
- Getting better.

22
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,749
- You're loving playing nursemaid?
- Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:16,019
So is it better than
playing naughty stewardess?

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,224
Xander!

25
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,283
You guys wait here a second.

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,308
No!

27
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,440
Mom!

28
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,277
Oh, my...

29
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,047
I'm sorry. I... I heard...

30
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:47,409
Uh, I broke a wine glass.

31
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:50,031
- You're home early.
- Hi.

32
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,912
Hi.

33
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:54,698
Oh, this is my daughter Buffy.

34
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,644
Buffy, this is Ted.

35
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:54,099
"Ted"

36
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,934
OK, here we go!

37
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,975
So, all these late nights
at the gallery recently,

38
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,612
I gather you were cataloguing
more than art.

39
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:10,884
Well, I... I've been looking for
the right moment to introduce you two.

40
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,000
He's a wonderful man.

41
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:16,622
- Sprinkle that on...
- Uh, a little more. OK, more...

42
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:19,891
- How'd you meet?
- Oh, he sells, uh, computer software.

43
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:23,410
He redid my entire system at the gallery.
Freed up a lot of my time.

44
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,872
To meet new people.
And smooch them in my kitchen.

45
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:27,904
You weren't supposed to see that.

46
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,946
- I like my new nine-gig hard drive.
- But you don't love it.

47
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:34,139
'Cause without the DMA upgrade,
your computer's only half a rocket ship.

48
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:38,284
- Yeah, but who can afford the upgrades?
- You can. I get the demos for free.

49
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,892
I don't see why I shouldn't
give them to you for the same price.

50
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:42,919
Any friend of Buffy's...

51
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:44,964
- What?
- That's the sound she makes

52
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,003
when she's speechless with geeker-joy.

53
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:49,195
Can I just say, this is the finest pizza

54
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,752
ever on God's green earth.
What is your secret?

55
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:53,683
Well, after you bake it, you fry it

56
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:57,570
in herbs and olive oil,
but you gotta use a cast-iron skillet.

57
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:00,541
- No room for compromise there.
- You know, you should market these things.

58
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:03,774
I mean... you can get
200-300 bucks apiece!

59
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:09,800
- Hungry?
- No, thanks.

60
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:14,021
Buffy, I want to apologize.
That wasn't how I wanted us to meet.

61
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:16,682
I wanted it to be... perfect.

62
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:21,061
I'm very fond of your mother.
I guess that's pretty obvious.

63
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:24,189
I know you're the most
important thing in her life and...

64
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:27,808
Well, gosh, that makes you
pretty important to me, too.

65
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:30,080
Buffy, I really want you
to be OK with this.

66
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:34,908
Beg to differ.
We really want you to be OK with this.

67
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:38,413
- I'm OK.
- You are?

68
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:41,007
I am!

69
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,458
Buffy, I believe he's, um...

70
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,797
It's, it's... staking time, really,
don't you think?

71
00:05:19,244 --> 00:05:22,606
- Any others?
- For their sakes, I certainly hope not.

72
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:25,756
- What? I kill vampires. That's my job.
- True, true.

73
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:29,036
Although you don't usually beat them
into quite such a bloody pulp beforehand.

74
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:32,892
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

75
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:38,719
I killed a vampire here on Wednesday.
Why are they hanging out at the park?

76
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:43,649
Well, they're... scattered, you know. Now
their leaders are gone, with any luck dead.

77
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:47,409
In times of crisis, they usually return
to the easiest feeding grounds.

78
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:49,900
Vampires are creeps.

79
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:52,403
Yes, that's why one slays them.

80
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:56,091
I mean, people are perfectly happy
getting along, and then vampires come.

81
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:58,821
They run around and they kill people,
and they take over your whole house,

82
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:01,787
they start making these stupid little mini
pizzas and everyone's like, 'I like your...

83
00:06:01,822 --> 00:06:04,370
- But I'm telling you, I'm...
- Uh, Buffy...

84
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,708
I-I believe the... subtext here is, is,
rapidly becoming, uh...

85
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,806
uh, text.

86
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:13,190
Are you sure there's
nothing you want to share?

87
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:15,711
No. Forget it.

88
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:21,221
Think there'll be any more? I can wait.

89
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:25,119
If you say one more word,
things will become dire.

90
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,929
Did you even bother to taste 'em?
No! Well, I did.

91
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:32,228
And I'm here to tell ya,
those mini-pizzas have changed my life!

92
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:34,220
Ted is the master chef!

93
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:37,490
Fine! So he's a good cook. Well, what
does that really tell you about a person?

94
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,425
- Everything.
- You don't like him.

95
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,623
I, I mean, so far all I see is someone
who apparently has a good job,

96
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:47,767
seems nice and polite,
and my mother likes him.

97
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:49,960
What kind of a monster is he?

98
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:52,698
I'm just saying there's something
a little too clean about this clown.

99
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,965
He's a clean clown!

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,297
- I have my own fun.
- Buff, you're lacking evidence.

101
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,653
I think maybe we're
in Sigmund Freud territory.

102
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,574
He has a point.
Separation anxiety,

103
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:06,661
the mother figure being taken away,
conflict with the father figure...

104
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:09,385
- He's not my father figure.
- Having issues much?

105
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,214
- I am not!
- # You're having parental issues!

106
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,360
- # You're having parental issues!
- Xander...

107
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:17,461
What? Freud would have said
the exact same thing.

108
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:19,650
He might not have done that little dance.

109
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:23,517
OK, I admit it's weird.
Seeing my mother Frenching a guy

110
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:26,772
is definitely a ticket to therapy-land,
but it's more than that.

111
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:29,077
And I'm pretty good at sensing
what's going on around me, and there is

112
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:30,949
definitely something wrong
with this... Ted.

113
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,580
- Ted!
- Of course, Ted. Who'd you think

114
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:35,018
- I was talking about?
- Hi, Ted... Ted who's here.

115
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:37,143
- Hello, kids.
- What are you doing here?

116
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:39,359
I'm updating the software
in the guidance office.

117
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:41,887
Which reminds me. Your upgrades.

118
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:45,004
- Oh, what a day! Thank you.
- Think nothing of it.

119
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:48,227
- Buffy, do you like miniature golf?
- Who doesn't?!

120
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,642
Well, your mother and I were thinking
maybe this Saturday we could drag

121
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:53,485
the three of you out to the course,

122
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:56,899
spend some time swinging the iron
with the stuffy old people.

123
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,505
- Well...
- I'm making a picnic basket.

124
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,527
- With mini-pizzas?
- And cookies.

125
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:05,536
You know what?
We would love to, honestly, but,

126
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:08,322
um, unfortunately, we have
that thing on Saturday.

127
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:11,961
Oh, that thing! That thing.

128
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:16,922
Hey, we can do that thing any time.
I'm tired of doin' that thing. We're on.

129
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:19,115
Great!

130
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,667
Hello, Jenny.

131
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:31,170
Rupert. Hi.

132
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:35,441
Some of your, uh, textbooks
were delivered to the library. Um...

133
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,152
Do you want me to, uh, hang on to them?

134
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:42,096
Yeah, that's fine.
I'll send the kids by to pick 'em up.

135
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:44,669
Right. Good.

136
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,738
Pretty flimsy excuse
for coming by to see me.

137
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:54,668
You should have heard
the ones I threw out!

138
00:08:56,195 --> 00:09:00,475
I just, I wanted to, uh...
see how you were doing.

139
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,395
I'm doin' pretty good, actually.

140
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,498
I've stayed out of mortal danger
for three whole weeks.

141
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,850
I could get used to it.

142
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:13,172
I'm still having trouble sleeping, though.

143
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:16,732
Of course. Um, you need time.

144
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,052
Or possibly space.
Rupert, I know you're concerned.

145
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,980
But having you constantly poking around,
making little puppy dog eyes at me,

146
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,749
wondering if I'm okay...

147
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:32,592
You make me feel bad
that I don't feel better.

148
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:35,709
I don't want that responsibility.

149
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:39,745
I'm sorry.
I certainly don't mean to make...

150
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,591
dog eyes... at you.

151
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:45,488
- I'm just...
- Worried. I know.

152
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,963
I shouldn't have bothered you.

153
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,099
So mom's like, 'Do you think Ted will like
this?' and 'This is Ted's favorite show,'

154
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,380
and 'Ted's teaching me computers,'
and 'Ted said the funniest thing,'

155
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:02,042
and I'm like, 'That's really great, Mom,'
and then she said I was being sarcastic,

156
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:04,715
which I was, but I'm sorry if I don't
wanna talk about Ted all the time.

157
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,491
So you're gonna talk about
somethin' else at some point?

158
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:10,492
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,358
I just have so much to deal with.
I don't need some new guy in my life.

160
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:16,556
No? Maybe your mom does.

161
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:20,051
Well, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom!

162
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,890
Loneliness is about
the scariest thing there is.

163
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,952
OK, so my mom needs a guy in her life.

164
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:30,180
- Does it have to be Ted?
- You have somebody else in mind?

165
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:33,645
There's a guy out there
that would satisfy you?

166
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,835
My dad.

167
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:39,983
Yeah, OK, that's not gonna happen.

168
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,254
Fine, fine. I'll give Ted a chance.

169
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:48,532
I'll play minigolf and I'll smile and
curtsey and be the dutiful daughter.

170
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,673
Do I have to like him?

171
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:56,115
- Kiss me.
- Finally something I wanna do!

172
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:04,126
Ah! The dreaded five-par cuckoo clock!

173
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:08,573
Ha! So many have come,
so few have conquered.

174
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:14,052
That picnic was delicious! You know
how rare it is to find a man that cooks?

175
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:17,282
I know I've been looking
a long time for one!

176
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,670
So, Buffy, I bet the boys
are lined up around the block

177
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:23,079
- trying to get a date with you.
- Not really.

178
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,894
Oh, they are,
but she's only interested in...

179
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:28,388
Uh, her studies!

180
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:31,682
Book-cracker Buffy. It's...
kind of her nickname.

181
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:36,867
I'm glad to hear it. I bet that means
your grades will be picking up soon.

182
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:41,649
My grades?
How does he know about my grades?

183
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:45,027
I told him. He wants to know
everything about you.

184
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:47,549
He's concerned. That's a good thing.

185
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:50,497
Ooh, nice shot, Ted!

186
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:54,118
Keep your eye on the ball.
Watch those elbows!

187
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:58,077
Oh, bad luck, little lady!

188
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:01,839
- Oh, we won't count it.
- We won't?

189
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:05,424
- No, it's just miniature golf.
- It is, but the rules are the rules.

190
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:09,461
And what we teach her is what she takes
out into the world when we're not there,

191
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:13,281
whether it's at school
or an unchaperoned party.

192
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:17,086
I don't mean to overstep my bounds.
This is between you and your mother.

193
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:20,264
I just think... right is right.

194
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,336
He has a point.

195
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:28,570
Fine. I'll just go hit my ball
from the rough.

196
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,524
Hey, how about that? Got a hole in two!

197
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,550
Beg to differ.

198
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,614
OK, so fine my score or whatever.

199
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,409
I think you're missing the point here,
little lady.

200
00:12:55,743 --> 00:13:00,548
Right is right. Wrong is wrong.
Why don't people see that?

201
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,389
- It's just a game?
- Right, it's just a game,

202
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:06,156
do your own thing.
Well, I'm not wired that way.

203
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:10,354
And I'm here to tell you
it is NOT a game,

204
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,584
it does count, and I don't stand for
that kind of malarkey in my house!

205
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:17,072
Then I guess it's a good thing
I'm not in your house.

206
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:21,460
Do you want me to slap
that smart-ass mouth of yours?

207
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:26,800
Who's up for dessert?
I made chocolate-chip cookies!

208
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:29,426
- Yummy!
- Cookies!

209
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:33,906
Yeah! I-I made, uh, too many, so
you guys are gonna have to take some home!

210
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:38,672
Mm! Buffy, you've got to try one of these.
They're really good.

211
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:43,606
Mm! These are tasty!

212
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:55,680
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Hey.

213
00:13:55,803 --> 00:14:01,457
I've got juice, I've got sticky buns.
Don't they smell good? Ted made them.

214
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,900
What?

215
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:07,943
I'd just like to eat something round here
that Ted didn't make.

216
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:10,724
- What kind of an attitude is that?
- Look, mum, I know

217
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,688
- you think he's great and all...
- He went out of his way

218
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:16,023
to be nice and you couldn't say
two words to him on Saturday.

219
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:18,226
I do not expect you
to love him right away like I do,

220
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:20,679
but I do expect you
to treat him decently.

221
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,496
You love him?

222
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:27,720
I don't know.

223
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:30,394
That just slipped out...

224
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,664
But I guess.
I mean it's not exactly like

225
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:36,385
- men beat down the door...
- when you're a single parent.

226
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,533
Honey, look, I wouldn't have
anything to do with anybody

227
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:41,999
if they didn't care about you,
but he does!

228
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:44,827
I don't understand
why you can't see that.

229
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:48,644
- He threatened me.
- What?

230
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:54,778
He threatened me.
He said that he was gonna slap my face.

231
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:58,989
He said no such thing.
Honey, Ted told me what happened.

232
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:03,691
- He caught you cheating, didn't he?
- Yeah, I kicked my ball in.

233
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,585
Put me in jail.
But he totally wigged.

234
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,477
And he didn't say anything about this
in front of the others, did he?

235
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:12,951
- No, but I don't think that's...
- I thought that was pretty decent of him.

236
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,883
Ted said we have to
give you time to come round.

237
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:19,001
Oh, speaking of which,
he's making dinner for us tonight,

238
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,349
so I'd like you home, please,
promptly at six.

239
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:31,822
Mm! This is so delicious!

240
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:34,368
- What do you mean, check him out?
- I mean investigate him.

241
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:36,555
Find out his secrets,
hack into his life.

242
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,007
- Can you say "overreaction"?
- Can you say "sucking chest wound"?

243
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:44,064
Buffy, it just seems like you
want him to be corrupt or something.

244
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:46,580
The guy lost his senses over minigolf.

245
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:50,509
So he's a little uptight. Last I heard
that's not a slaying offense.

246
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:52,678
Don't gimme the look!
I'm on your side.

247
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,024
I'm just saying there are
some things in life you have to accept.

248
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,299
And I'm saying Ted ain't one of 'em.

249
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:01,384
- Hey, Cordy, nice outfit!
- Oh, very funny.

250
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,054
- Not really.
- What are you saying?

251
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:09,479
- Nice outfit?
- Why don't you just keep your mouth shut?

252
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:12,514
Would you guys excuse me for a sec?

253
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:15,015
What's up with them?

254
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,734
- What's wrong with you?
- I gave you a compliment.

255
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,845
In front of your friends.
They're gonna know!

256
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,184
- Know what?
- Please! It's too traumatic

257
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:25,544
for me to even say it!

258
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:27,447
- That we kissed?
- Uhhh!

259
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:30,627
Look, I'm not gonna tell.
They're not gonna know.

260
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:34,359
Not your friends, not my friends.

261
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:36,477
You wanna go to
the utility closet and make out?

262
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:39,907
God! Is that all you ever think about?

263
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:42,971
OK.

264
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:45,957
Will, I'm not wrong here.
Ted has a problem with me.

265
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,839
He acts like...
I'm in the way or something.

266
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,493
And Mom's been totally different
since he's around.

267
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:53,018
- Different, like happy?
- Like Stepford.

268
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,664
- Will you help me?
- You know I will.

269
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:58,273
- What do you want me to look for?
- Let's start small.

270
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:00,423
Can you find out where he works?

271
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,116
Yeah, it's a terrific product.
No PC should be without it.

272
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:14,682
No, Mrs. Lansdale, it is not
an inexpensive piece of software.

273
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:17,844
As a matter of fact,
it's a very expensive one,

274
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:20,959
which removes the risk
of crashing your whole system.

275
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:25,371
Of course, if you prefer something cheap,
I can always recommend...

276
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,766
Trust me, you won't be sorry.
Thank you very much.

277
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:44,062
Goin' to lunch!

278
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:52,247
You're new, aren't ya? I'm Neal.

279
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,833
I'm B... Linda. Belinda.

280
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:57,670
I'm just temping for the day.

281
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:01,817
Wow! That guy's a salesman.
I guess he's the one to beat around here.

282
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:05,211
Nobody beats the Machine.
The guy is a genius.

283
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:08,825
Knows everything about computers,
never loses a client.

284
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:10,972
If I sound bitter, I am.

285
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,762
Well, nobody likes an overachiever.

286
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:16,154
He's probably got
ex-wives and families to support.

287
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:20,846
He's just got a girlfriend.
I'm amazed he let her clutter his desk.

288
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,582
Thank God he's takin' off for the wedding.

289
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:28,601
- The wedding?
- He's got it set for two months from now.

290
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:31,821
Believe me, I am counting the days.

291
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:36,496
Uh-oh, the Über-Boss.
Back to the salt mines.

292
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:12,720
We thank you for what
we are about to receive,

293
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:15,413
and we ask that you bless this house

294
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:19,078
and help the people in it
to be more productive,

295
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:23,181
more considerate... and more honest.

296
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:26,197
- Amen.
- Amen.

297
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,788
Well, another great day at work.

298
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:32,081
How was school today, Buffy?
Did you learn anything?

299
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:34,746
- Quite a bit.
- Good for you.

300
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:38,737
- Well, Joycie, what do you think?
- Every home should have one of you.

301
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:41,598
It's fantastic! Don't you think?

302
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,796
- Looks good.
- Well, you know, little lady,

303
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:50,866
it's not just for looks.
It's for building strong bodies.

304
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:55,913
Honey?

305
00:19:57,206 --> 00:19:59,208
Are you two engaged?

306
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,904
Goodness, no!
Whatever gave you that idea?

307
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:04,025
Now, Joycie, let me handle this.

308
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:08,355
Buffy, your mother and I are
taking it one step at a time.

309
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:11,875
And if things go
the way I hope, maybe...

310
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,328
someday soon
I just might ask her to tie the knot.

311
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,610
How would you feel about that?

312
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:25,996
It's OK to have feelings, Buffy,
and it's OK to express them.

313
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:29,113
- I'd feel like killing myself.
- Buffy!

314
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:31,615
No, no. I told her to be honest.

315
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,369
Sweetheart, you should try and
get used to me, 'cause you know what?

316
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:38,397
I'm not going anywhere.

317
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:41,395
- May I be excused?
- You can go to your room, young lady,

318
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,778
that's where you can go.

319
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:53,568
Ted, I... I am so embarrassed!
I-I-I don't know what's wrong with her!

320
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:57,117
Joycie, you don't get to be
salesman of the year

321
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:59,078
by giving up
after a couple of rejections.

322
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:01,470
She'll come round.

323
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:20,047
Vampires!

324
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,711
Here, vampires!

325
00:21:34,803 --> 00:21:36,761
- What are you doing in here?
- Your mother told you

326
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,397
to go to your room, Buffy.
You and I both know

327
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:42,936
she didn't mean climb out a window
and go gallivanting about town.

328
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:45,698
First of all, this is my room. Second...

329
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:48,767
- You've been going through my things?
- Yes, I have.

330
00:21:48,802 --> 00:21:50,923
That's my personal property!
How dare you?!

331
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,959
I don't see how it's any different from
you snooping around my office, do you?

332
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:58,796
What exactly is a "vampire slayer"?

333
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:02,254
- It's none of your business.
- Beg to differ, little lady.

334
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:06,508
Everything you do is nothing
but my business from now on.

335
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:08,313
I think you'd better
get out of here. Now!

336
00:22:08,314 --> 00:22:11,988
Or what? You'll slay me?

337
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:17,340
I'm real. I'm not some goblin
you made up in your little diary.

338
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:21,229
Psychiatrists have a word
for something like this: delusional.

339
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:25,276
So from now on you'll do
what I say when I say, or...

340
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,356
I show this to your mother.

341
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:31,686
And you'll spend your best dating years
behind the wall of a mental institution.

342
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:34,120
Your mother and I
are going to be happy.

343
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,963
You're not going to stand in the way.

344
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:38,900
Sleep tight.

345
00:22:39,243 --> 00:22:42,746
That's mine, and you are not
leaving this room with it.

346
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:46,395
- Take your hand off me.
- No.

347
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:54,529
I was so hoping you'd do that.

348
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:05,498
Buffy, stop that! Stop it!

349
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,701
Ted...

350
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:21,784
Ted! Ted!

351
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,961
You killed him!

352
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:03,705
Ma'am, I'm Detective Stein.

353
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,397
I'm sorry, but I need to
ask you a few questions.

354
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,895
Your relationship with the deceased?

355
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:13,885
- We were, um, seeing each other.
- Can you tell me what happened?

356
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:16,048
He fell.

357
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:18,809
Down the stairs. He fell.

358
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:22,554
I see. Did he slip?
Do you know what made him fall?

359
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:25,177
I hit him.

360
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:29,475
I hit him.

361
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:48,548
He was in my room...

362
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:51,442
and we got into an argument.

363
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:56,447
- About what?
- He...

364
00:24:56,482 --> 00:25:00,407
Was this the first time that
you two had had an argument?

365
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:04,471
No.

366
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:07,850
He threatened me.
He said that he would slap me.

367
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:11,562
- That was tonight?
- No.

368
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:15,081
But he had my diary, and...
I tried to take it back,

369
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:17,853
and that's when he hit me.

370
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:19,653
Where?

371
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:26,172
No, it doesn't look like
he hit you very hard.

372
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:29,302
- I don't bruise easily.
- So, you've been hit before?

373
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:32,163
- Yes.
- But Ted never hit you?

374
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,084
- I told you...
- Before tonight?

375
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:37,140
- Ted never hit you before tonight?
- What do you want?

376
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:39,731
I told you what happened.
I didn't mean to!

377
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:44,093
I believe you. Things got out of hand.
He's a big guy.

378
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:50,166
Are you charging her with something?

379
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,653
We're not bringing anything up
against your daughter right now.

380
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:55,643
She says Mr. Buchanan struck her,
and if that's the case...

381
00:25:55,678 --> 00:25:58,629
Anyway, we've gotta examine it further.

382
00:25:58,664 --> 00:26:00,398
Right now you should take her home

383
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,727
and the two of you
should try and get some rest.

384
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:45,352
Buffy!

385
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:48,909
- Are you OK?
- How come you're here?

386
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:53,614
I couldn't stay at home.
Mom won't even look at me.

387
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:58,174
What happened?
Unless you don't wanna talk about it.

388
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:03,267
We had a fight and I lost my temper.
Really let him have it.

389
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:05,718
The paper said he fell.

390
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:08,262
He fell. Hard.

391
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:11,656
- What was he?
- What?

392
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:14,086
What was he? A demon? A giant bug?

393
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:16,562
Some kind of a dark god
with the secrets of nouvelle cuisine?

394
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:20,357
I mean, we are talking
creature-feature here, right?

395
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,344
Oh, man.

396
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:27,152
But I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
He started it.

397
00:27:27,823 --> 00:27:31,577
Yeah... that defense only works
in six-year-old court, Will.

398
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:35,220
Court? Wait, wait.
Are they charging you with something?

399
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:39,397
I don't know. Not yet.

400
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:46,254
He was a person... and I killed him.

401
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:50,571
- Don't say that.
- Why not? Everyone else is.

402
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:53,747
- And it's the truth.
- It was an accident.

403
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:57,781
I'm the Slayer.
I had no right to hit him like that.

404
00:27:57,853 --> 00:28:00,258
Look, Buffy, I don't know
what happened exactly,

405
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:04,456
but I do know you. And I know
you would never hurt anyone intentionally.

406
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:06,567
- Well, you know, unless...
- Unless...

407
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:08,921
they were dating my mother?

408
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:13,701
I gotta go.

409
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:27,216
Buffy!

410
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,887
Are you all right?

411
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:34,138
Oh, uh, stupid question,
I'm sorry. Look,

412
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:37,325
i-i-if there's anything you need,
of course, just, just ask.

413
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,720
What's going on?

414
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,210
Oh, you needn't worry about them.
They're just asking a few questions.

415
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:45,836
Your, your, your behavior and...

416
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:48,278
Um, I...

417
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:52,616
Of course, I told them you, uh...

418
00:28:56,662 --> 00:29:00,508
Man, this is killing me! That bastard
was up to something, I know it!

419
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:03,590
If I could get my hands on him...
earlier this week...

420
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,489
I thought you liked him.

421
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:07,823
I sometimes like things
that are not good for me.

422
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:11,051
Besides, no way, no how does Buffy
put the big hurt on an innocent man

423
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:15,158
- Nice Uncle Ted was dirty.
- We've gotta prove that somehow.

424
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:18,140
- Xander, do you have a pen?
- If Buffy has to go to jail

425
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:21,413
because of that creep, I'm gonna lose it.
He's gotta be in there, Will.

426
00:29:21,448 --> 00:29:25,242
A history of domestic violence,
a criminal record... Ooh! Cookies!

427
00:29:25,441 --> 00:29:27,994
I don't get it. Buffy's the Slayer.
Shouldn't she have...

428
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:30,270
- What, a license to kill?
- Well, not for fun.

429
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:33,291
But she's like this superman.
Shouldn't there be different rules for her?

430
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:37,653
- Sure, in a fascist society.
- Right! Why can't we have one of those?

431
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:40,456
Buffy's not going to jail.
It's not fair.

432
00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:43,438
Whatever the authorities have
planned for her, it can't be much worse

433
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:47,723
than what she's doing to herself.
She's taken a human life.

434
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:51,091
The guilt, it-it's, it's pretty hard
to bear, and it won't go away soon.

435
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:53,012
I guess you should know,
since you helped raise

436
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:55,100
that demon that
killed that guy that time?

437
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:58,579
Yes. Do let's bring that up
as often as possible.

438
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:03,639
- So, Giles, you takin' over tonight?
- Um, Buffy's not in any shape to patrol.

439
00:30:03,674 --> 00:30:06,087
The least I can do is pick up the slack.
Someone has to.

440
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:09,619
Giles, you shouldn't go out there
without the Slayer.

441
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:12,728
Until Buffy regains her equilibrium,
there is no Slayer.

442
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:14,603
- If you need help...
- No, uh...

443
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:17,955
Buffy needs your help more than I.
You carry on investigating,

444
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:21,585
see if you can find out as much about
this Buchanan chap as possible.

445
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:23,624
Be careful.

446
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:26,081
I will.

447
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:32,188
Ted's got no criminal record.
Damn, this guy's like citizen of the year!

448
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:34,385
Don't sweat it. It'll be fine.

449
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:37,949
- Don't sweat it?
- Yeah, cute buddy!

450
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:39,932
We'll work it out. No worries.

451
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:46,488
- What happened to "this is killing me"?
- Worrying isn't gonna solve any problems.

452
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,872
Can I help?

453
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:06,258
It's done.

454
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:11,005
I've been meaning to
clean out this junk for months.

455
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,535
Do you have homework?

456
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,639
- I didn't mean to hurt him.
- I don't wanna talk about this.

457
00:31:19,763 --> 00:31:23,517
- Mom, please, you have to know...
- I can't. Not yet.

458
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:27,513
Please, Buffy, just go to your room.

459
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:42,745
- OK...
- What do we know?

460
00:31:42,911 --> 00:31:46,648
Well, apparently the secret
ingredient is not love.

461
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:49,982
- What is it?
- I'm not positive,

462
00:31:49,983 --> 00:31:51,670
but I think it's Dematorin.

463
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:55,872
It's like a tranquillizer.
Keeps you all mellow and compliant.

464
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:58,966
It also shares a few
components with ecstasy.

465
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:03,355
This is evidence! This is real evidence
that Ted was some kind of crook!

466
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,155
Buffy's cleared. Willow,
you are the best human ever, I adore you!

467
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:11,665
That's the cookies talkin', but you rock!

468
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,154
Well, your search finally hit pay dirt.

469
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:17,613
I got some personal records,
marriage certificates, and an address.

470
00:32:17,946 --> 00:32:20,226
Well, let's check it out.
Get our Slayer back on her feet

471
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:22,786
before somebody else gets hurt.

472
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:39,727
Yeah, I get that reaction
from men all the time!

473
00:32:39,728 --> 00:32:41,684
Jenny, what are you doing here?

474
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,991
I saw your car back there.
I wanted to apologize.

475
00:32:44,026 --> 00:32:46,930
- Well, now is... not the best time to...
- No, no, please, please, let me just...

476
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,574
Let me get this out.

477
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:53,941
I was so... harsh the other day.
I am so sorry.

478
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:58,448
I mean, I know how badly you must feel
about putting me in danger before, and...

479
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:02,262
Imagine how I must f... feel now.

480
00:33:07,705 --> 00:33:09,540
Mom?

481
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:15,170
To hell with this!

482
00:33:20,217 --> 00:33:22,852
She nailed it shut.

483
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:27,716
Well, it's official.
This day can't get any worse.

484
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:31,353
Beg to differ.

485
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:42,077
- You died.
- That's right, little lady. You killed me.

486
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:46,815
Do we have something to say about that?
Are we sorry?

487
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,147
- What are you?
- I'm a salesman!

488
00:33:50,182 --> 00:33:54,775
That's what you should have remembered.
No matter how you put him down...

489
00:33:57,755 --> 00:34:00,491
a good salesman always bounces back.

490
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:08,349
My bag!

491
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:33,135
See, I had to shut down for a while
to get you off my back.

492
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,241
You should have seen the intern's face
when I got up off the table.

493
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:40,544
It was a hoot! Fun's over, though.

494
00:34:44,051 --> 00:34:45,886
Say good night, big guy!

495
00:34:49,682 --> 00:34:51,517
Oh, God!

496
00:34:52,184 --> 00:34:55,187
Oh, no!

497
00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:57,982
Nice shot, lady!

498
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,672
That wasn't playin' fair, missy!

499
00:35:20,337 --> 00:35:24,723
You're gonna find... Hell of a day!
Makes you feel like you're 18 again!

500
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:28,003
that I don't like being disobeyed!

501
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:45,434
Don't worry about me and your mother.
We're gonna be very happy.

502
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,705
Careful!

503
00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:04,726
Let's look around.

504
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:10,740
- I'll take the back.
- Check for cookies.

505
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:12,890
For evidence!

506
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:15,309
So far I've counted
four marriage certificates.

507
00:36:15,392 --> 00:36:18,688
- Any divorce papers?
- Not a one.

508
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:24,086
- So, either our boy was a Mormon, or...
- Whoa, whoa! 1957?

509
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:27,154
Ted must have married young.
Like, pre-school young.

510
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:29,068
Nothing interesting back here.

511
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:31,659
Doesn't look like anybody's
worked here, let alone lived here.

512
00:36:31,694 --> 00:36:35,495
Something's missing here.
This doesn't seem like Ted at all.

513
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,023
Yeah, and this rug,
it doesn't go with the rest of the decor.

514
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,640
Buffy...

515
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:57,832
I'm sorry. I know you didn't mean to...

516
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:01,908
- Joyce?
- Ted!

517
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:05,442
Is it really...? But you were...

518
00:37:05,477 --> 00:37:08,601
I'm OK. I'm OK.

519
00:37:09,196 --> 00:37:12,314
I don't understand this. You were dead!

520
00:37:12,324 --> 00:37:14,531
They said I must've been
dead for six minutes.

521
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,328
They said any longer and
it would've caused brain damage.

522
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:18,997
- Oh, why didn't they tell us?
- Nobody knew.

523
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:22,435
They took me to the morgue,
I was unconscious for almost a day.

524
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,920
An intern found me.
It's a miracle, Joyce, a miracle.

525
00:37:25,462 --> 00:37:28,111
- Oh, Ted!
- I know.

526
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:32,942
Oh, my God! Buffy!

527
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,727
Oh, Ted, I swear,
she never meant to hurt you.

528
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:38,089
- You have to believe me.
- You don't have to worry about Buffy.

529
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:42,182
You don't have to worry
about anything. Daddy's here.

530
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:10,041
Feels like home...
if it's the fifties and you're a psycho.

531
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:29,985
What you got in the closet, Ted?

532
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:38,561
Let's go.

533
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:40,537
- But we need evidence.
- We got it.

534
00:38:40,572 --> 00:38:44,090
- What's in there?
- His first four wives.

535
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:48,671
You know what brought me back, Joyce?
It was you.

536
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:52,123
I couldn't go into that light.
I had to come back for you.

537
00:38:52,424 --> 00:38:54,942
I'm gonna make you so happy.

538
00:38:56,178 --> 00:38:59,769
- You should sit down.
- I feel fine. Never better.

539
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:05,362
Ted, I think I should talk to Buffy first,
before she sees you,

540
00:39:05,363 --> 00:39:07,370
- 'cause I'm sure...
- Do we have to worry about Buffy

541
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:10,567
right now? How about worrying
about Teddy? He's the one who died!

542
00:39:10,602 --> 00:39:13,417
I-I-I'm, I'm sorry, I just... I...

543
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:17,725
- I don't know what to do.
- Don't I always tell you what to do?

544
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,347
I'm going to make things right.
Then you and I...

545
00:39:21,382 --> 00:39:23,209
Want a little gravy with that?

546
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:26,775
can go away where
no one will bother us again.

547
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:32,499
Ted, I... I think you might
wanna rest for a while.

548
00:39:32,534 --> 00:39:35,013
I think you might wanna
stop telling me what to do!

549
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:37,069
I don't take orders from women!

550
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:39,578
I'm not wired that way.

551
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:42,616
Oh, God. I am so sorry.

552
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:44,912
- I think I'm all right.
- No, you're just in shock.

553
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,438
No, no, really, I, uh,
I don't think it went in too deep.

554
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:52,016
The advantages of layers of tweed.
It's better than Kevlar.

555
00:39:52,484 --> 00:39:54,972
Oh, OK, alright, we have to
get you to the hospital.

556
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:57,159
- Yes, yes. Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh!
- Come on.

557
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,152
- Let's move slowly, shall we?
- Sorry. OK.

558
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:08,500
What? What is it?

559
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:10,628
Some night, huh?

560
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:14,281
Hey, you really know how
to woo a girl back, don't ya?

561
00:40:14,316 --> 00:40:16,173
- Ow! Ow!
- Hospital.

562
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,308
Yes.

563
00:40:30,022 --> 00:40:33,711
I-I think I could use a drink.
Uh, to-to-to celebrate!

564
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:36,904
- We should probably be hitting the road.
- Hitting the road?

565
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:40,417
You're going to love the house.
It's furnished just the way you like it.

566
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:44,811
I spent a lot of...
Telling me what to do!... time decorating.

567
00:40:45,037 --> 00:40:47,619
Well, then, I'd probably better go pack.

568
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,148
I already have your clothes.

569
00:40:50,183 --> 00:40:53,169
They're your size.
They're always your size.

570
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,798
You left me once,
but I keep bringing you back.

571
00:40:56,833 --> 00:41:00,564
Husband and wife is forever. Forever.

572
00:41:02,554 --> 00:41:05,943
- Let's go.
- Ted, let go, please.

573
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:07,643
Get off me!

574
00:41:10,062 --> 00:41:13,456
Fine, then. I'll have to carry you.

575
00:41:38,015 --> 00:41:39,977
Buffy, come out!

576
00:41:39,978 --> 00:41:42,920
I don't stand for
this kind of malarkey in my house!

577
00:41:42,955 --> 00:41:44,596
Uncle Teddy...

578
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,044
This house is mine.

579
00:41:58,235 --> 00:42:02,774
Buffy, how about a nice game of Parcheesi?

580
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,392
D'you wanna rent a movie tonight?

581
00:42:30,643 --> 00:42:34,652
- That sounds like fun.
- Just nothing with horror in it.

582
00:42:35,648 --> 00:42:38,402
Or romance. Or men.

583
00:42:38,776 --> 00:42:40,714
I guess we're
Thelma and Louise-ing it again?

584
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:42,984
Mm-hm. Good call.

585
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:49,486
I still think
he's gonna jump out at me...

586
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:52,268
Especially after what
the police found in his house.

587
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,773
It's just too horrible.

588
00:42:54,808 --> 00:42:57,537
I wouldn't worry. He's not coming back.

589
00:42:57,544 --> 00:42:59,929
I wish I could be so sure.

590
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,175
Trust me. He's on the scrap heap.

591
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,709
Of life.

592
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:10,081
So I'm Ted, the sickly loser.

593
00:43:10,082 --> 00:43:13,611
I'm dying and my wife dumps me.
I build a better Ted.

594
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:18,090
He brings her back, holds her hostage
in his bunker-o-love until she dies.

595
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:21,744
And then, he keeps
bringing her back, over and over.

596
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:24,785
Now. Now, that's creepy on a level
I hardly knew existed.

597
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:27,719
The sad part is,
the real Ted must've been a genius.

598
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,977
There were design features
in that robot that predate...

599
00:43:30,012 --> 00:43:33,115
Willow, tell me you didn't keep any parts.

600
00:43:33,205 --> 00:43:35,697
Not any... big ones.

601
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:39,513
Oh, Will, you're supposed
to use your powers for good.

602
00:43:39,548 --> 00:43:41,473
But I just wanna learn stuff.

603
00:43:41,474 --> 00:43:43,841
Like how to build your own serial killer?

604
00:43:43,876 --> 00:43:46,769
- Uh, it's so hard to rent one nowadays.
- Can we just drop the subject?

605
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:48,937
Absolutely.
I plan to forget the whole thing

606
00:43:48,938 --> 00:43:52,735
and pick up right where we left off.
OK, that's it. I give up.

607
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,374
Do I have to sound an air horn
every time I walk into a room?

608
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:58,193
I mean, what is it
with grown-ups these days?

609
