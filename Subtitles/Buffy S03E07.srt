1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:12,137
If I could walk out

2
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,601
You know I never lied

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,074

4
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,908
Oz! Hey.

5
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,286
Have a seat. Except we don't have any seats.

6
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,747
It's OK. I'll just scrunch in.

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,836
- Xander, why are you giving me a lap dance?
- What? I just like ya.

8
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,715
And that's very beautiful. I think it's great
when two people like two people

9
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,135
and wanna be close to them
instead of anyone else.

10
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,347
- Hear, hear!
- Yeah, well put. Can I snag a sip?

11
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,182
- Sure.
- You got it.

12
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,479
Thank you.

13
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,691
Thank you. We're here
through Saturday. Enjoy the veal.

14
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,694
Why are you guys so hyper?

15
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,199
Hey, speaking of people and things
they do that aren't like usual,

16
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,452
anyone notice Buffy acting sort of different?

17
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:22,082
Let's see, killing zombies,
torching sewer monsters and...

18
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,918
No, that's pretty much the same old Buffster.

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,590
I just mean she's off by herself a lot
more, and she's kind of distracted.

20
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,843
Think maybe she has a new honey?

21
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,138
A boyfriend? Why wouldn't she tell us?

22
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,517
Excuse me? When your last steady
killed half the class,

23
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,688
then your rebound guy sends you
a dump-a-gram? It makes a girl shy.

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,566
But we're the best of Buffy's
bestest buds. She'd tell us.

25
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,943
Tell you what?

26
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,446
About your new boyfriend,
who we made up. Unless we didn't.

27
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,783
- This was a topic of discussion?
- Raised, but never discussed.

28
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,077
So, are you dating somebody or not?

29
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,373
I wouldn't use the word "dating".

30
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,126
But I am going out with somebody.
Tonight, as a matter of fact.

31
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,463
- Really? Who?
- What's up? Time to motivate.

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,008
Really, we're just good friends.

33
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,715
- Synchronised slaying.
- New Olympic category?

34
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,343
- What do you think?
- Sloppy.

35
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,890
You telegraph punches,
leave blind sides open,

36
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,978
and, for a school-night slaying, take entirely
too much time. Which one of you is Faith?

37
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,856
It depends. Who the hell are you?

38
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,859
Gwendolyn Post. Mrs.

39
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,362
Your new watcher.

40
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,339
I'm telling you, I don't need a new watcher.

41
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,218
No offence, lady. I just have
this problem with authority figures.

42
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,263
They end up kinda dead.

43
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,516
Duly noted. Fortunately, it's not up to you.

44
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,270
Mr Giles, where do you keep
the rest of your books?

45
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,441
- I'm sorry, the rest?
- Yes, the actual library.

46
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,194
Oh. I see.

47
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,781
I assure you, Mrs Post,
this is the finest occult reference collection...

48
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,783
This side of the Atlantic. I'm sure.

49
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,870
Do you have Hume's
Paranormal Encyclopaedia?

50
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,249
the Labyrinth Maps of Malta?

51
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,168
It's on order.

52
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,546
I suppose you have Sir Robert Kane's
Twilight Compendium?

53
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,343
Yes, I... Yes, I do.

54
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,636
Yes, of course you do.

55
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,683
I have been sent by the Council
for a very important reason.

56
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,643
Faith needs a watcher.

57
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,605
I am to act in that capacity and report back.

58
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,733
Excuse me, Mary Poppins,
you don't seem to be listening...

59
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,652
Faith, if the Council feels
you need closer observation,

60
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,447
then we will all, of course, cooperate.

61
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:27,744
The Council wishes me to report on
the entire situation here, including you.

62
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,124
Academic probation's
not so funny today, huh, Giles?

63
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:38,171
The fact is there's talk in the Council
that you have become a bit too American.

64
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,590
- Me?
- Him?

65
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,301
A demon named Lagos
is coming here to the Hellmouth.

66
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,554
Mr Giles, an illustration
of Lagos, if you please.

67
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,392
Yes.

68
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,312
Perhaps later.

69
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,148
Lagos seeks the Glove of Myhnegon.

70
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,485
No record of this glove's full power exists,

71
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:05,448
but we do know it is highly dangerous
and must not fall into the hands of a demon.

72
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,909
Lagos must be stopped.

73
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,369
What do you propose?

74
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,456
Well, if it's not too radical a suggestion,
I thought we might kill him.

75
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,627
I suggest two slayers at full strength
for a coordinated hunt.

76
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,505
We believe the glove to be
buried in a tomb somewhere,

77
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,133
so Lagos will be headed for the cemetery.

78
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,093
There is more than one in Sunnydale.

79
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,721
I see. How many?

80
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,932
Twelve within the city limits.

81
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,519
Well, we'll just have
to take them one at a time.

82
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,858
Anything in your books that might pinpoint
the location of the tomb would be useful.

83
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,736
But then, we cannot ask for miracles.

84
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,740
We will begin tomorrow at sunset.

85
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,783
Faith? With me, please.

86
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,251
That was bracing.

87
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,254
Interesting lady. Can we kill her?

88
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,341
I think the Council might frown upon that.

89
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,053
Well, how do you feel
about a spot of training?

90
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,697
I'd better go.

91
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,158
Big night for us slayer types.

92
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,204
People to see, demons to kill...

93
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,417
Better hurry before somebody
figures out what we're doing.

94
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,460
What are we doing?

95
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,963
Training.

96
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,925
And almost kissing.

97
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,681
I'm sorry. It's just old habit.

98
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,019
Bad, bad habit, to be broken.

99
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,480
It's hard.

100
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:47,527
It's not hard. Cold turkey.
That's the key to quitting.

101
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,910
You think they make a patch for this?

102
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,580
- You have to go.
- I really do.

103
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:08,673
I'm gonna try and vent a little hormonal angst
by killing a Lagos, whatever that is.

104
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,258
Lagos?

105
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,553
Some demon looking for some
all-powerful thingumabob

106
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,639
and I gotta stop him
before he unleashes unholy havoc

107
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,893
and it's another Tuesday night in Sunnydale.

108
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,064
Be careful.

109
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,914
This is intolerable. There's not
a word here about Lagos or the glove.

110
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,209
We don't have time for this near-missing.

111
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,506
Just find out all you can about the demon,
its strengths, weaknesses, places of origin

112
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,760
and, most importantly, what it
plans to do with this blasted glove.

113
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,137
Hey, you're not the watcher of me.

114
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,391
Then go home. But if you
choose to stay, then work.

115
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,066
It's late, I'm tired.
What does he want from us anyway?

116
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:13,113
The number of a qualified surgeon
to remove the British flag from his butt?

117
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,121
My eyes are all blurry.

118
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,391
Stop.

119
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,976
Right.

120
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,103
Stop means no.

121
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,773
And no means no, so, uh,

122
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,818
stop.

123
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,206
Willow, Xander,
you can stop your, uh, studying.

124
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,460
I've got what I need.

125
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,421
What have you got?

126
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,174
The probable location
of the Glove of Myhnegon.

127
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,761
It's housed in the Von Hauptman family crypt.

128
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,514
Yeah, that's that big one
over at the Restfield Cemetery.

129
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,934
Well, that's great, Giles. How'd you find it?

130
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,188
I looked.

131
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,607
- Where's Buffy at?
- I'm not sure.

132
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,362
Well, I'll go check out this crypt.
Tell her heads up if she stops by.

133
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,197
Yes, by all means, go.

134
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:42,327
And I'll just keep studying. I think we're
on the verge of a big Lagos breakthrough.

135
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,372
No, I'd say we're done.

136
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,213
Ronnie, deadbeat. Steve, klepto.

137
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,341
Kenny, drummer!

138
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,637
Eventually I just had to face up
to my destiny as a loser magnet.

139
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,808
Now it's strictly "get some, get gone".
You can't trust guys.

140
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,310
You can trust some guys.

141
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,479
Really. I've read about them.

142
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,690
Yeah. So what about you?

143
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,403
You mean, like, me and guys me?
Not much to tell these days.

144
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,196
But you gotta have stories.

145
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:22,575
I mean, I've had my share of losers,
but you boinked the undead.

146
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,954
What was that like?

147
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,708
Life with Angel is... was complicated.

148
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,920
- It's still a little hard for me to talk about.
- Well, try.

149
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,884
Look, Faith, all the Angel issues are still kind
of with me, so if you don't mind I'd rather not.

150
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,596
Yeah. Yeah, whatever.

151
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,728
You know what? We're 0-for-6 tonight.
Why don't we just blow this off?

152
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,647
I am kinda beat. But Shady Hill's pretty close.

153
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,150
I'll swing through it. It's on my way anyway.

154
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,529
- Alone? I don't know if I feel...
- I got Miss Priss on my back now.

155
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,824
I don't need another baby-sitter.
I'll holler if I have any fun.

156
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,202
OK.

157
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,872
- Later.
- Thanks.

158
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,891
Son of a bitch, it's my lucky day.

159
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,149
Hey, Giles, here's a nifty idea.

160
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:23,655
Why don't I alleviate my guilt by going out
and getting myself really, really killed?

161
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,496
- Oh, God.
- Buffy...

162
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,040
What am I doing? What are you doing?

163
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,293
- I don't know.
- Shame on you.

164
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,713
Oh, God. I don't even
know why I came back here.

165
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,218
It's good you did.

166
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,346
I think I have what you're looking for.

167
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,393
Great.

168
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,979
Just, wherever this was gift wrapped,
remind me not to shop there.

169
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,693
The Glove of Myhnegon.

170
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,946
- The world's ugliest fashion accessory.
- Don't.

171
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,157
Once you put it on
the glove can never be removed.

172
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,285
So no touching.

173
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,248
Kinda like us.

174
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,211
You hold onto it. I'll tell Giles in the morning.

175
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,130
At least he'll be happy.

176
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,844
Ah, yes! There we are.

177
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:55,140
There's a wood engraving.
See? The Glove of Myhnegon.

178
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,893
Yes, engraved by
Father Theodore of Wolsham.

179
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,648
Based, I believe, on very sketchy
and unreliable folk legends.

180
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:09,320
The pictures are fun, Mr Giles, but one
really ought to read the nice words as well.

181
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,825
Yes.

182
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,785
Some tea, perhaps.

183
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,750
I know that you must find me tiresome,
but it's insidious really.

184
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,089
One slips up on the little things and soon
everything's gone to hell in a handbasket.

185
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,384
For example, Buffy, your slayer.

186
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:36,806
Mrs Post, I can assure you that Buffy
is both dedicated and industrious.

187
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,268
And I am in complete control of my slayer.

188
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:44,272
Giles, we have a big problem. It's Buffy.

189
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,777
Will you excuse us?

190
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,038
Would you like some assistance?

191
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,832
Thank you. That won't be necessary.

192
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,635
Lagos is out of luck.
I got the magic mitten thingy.

193
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,766
What's with all the tragedy masks?

194
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,812
Better take a seat, Buffy.

195
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,777
What's going on?

196
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,532
We know Angel is alive.

197
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,826
Xander saw you with him.

198
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,496
It would appear that you've been
hiding him and that you lied to us.

199
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,334
Nobody's here to blame you, Buffy.
But this is serious. You need help.

200
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,463
It's not what you think.

201
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,717
Hope not. Cos I think
you're harbouring a vicious killer.

202
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,635
This isn't about attacking Buffy.

203
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:59,514
Remember, "I" statements only.
"I feel angry", "I feel worried"...

204
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,017
Fine. Here's one.

205
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,227
I feel worried - about me!

206
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:09,149
Last time, Angel barely laid a hand on Buffy.
He was more interested in killing her friends.

207
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,736
- But he's better now.
- Better for how long, Buffy?

208
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,529
Did you even think about that?

209
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,491
What is this? Demons Anonymous?
I don't need an intervention here.

210
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,287
Don't you? You must have
known it was wrong seeing Angel,

211
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,999
or you wouldn't have
hidden it from all of us.

212
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,460
I was going to tell you. I was.

213
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,797
It was just that
I didn't know why he came back.

214
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,883
I just wanted to wait.

215
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,386
For what? For Angel to go psycho again
the next time you give him a happy?

216
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,221
I'm not going to...

217
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,725
We're not together like that.

218
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,269
But you were kissing him.

219
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,859
You were spying on me?

220
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,946
What gives you the right?

221
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,367
What gives you the right to suck face
with your demon lover again?

222
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,788
- It was an accident.
- What, you just tripped and fell on his lips?

223
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,792
It was wrong, OK? I know that,
and I know that it can't happen again.

224
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:12,170
But you guys have to believe me,
I would never put you in any danger.

225
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,173
If I thought for a second
Angel was gonna hurt anyone...

226
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,133
You would stop him.

227
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,345
Like you did last time with Ms Calendar.

228
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:28,269
Buffy, I feel that when it comes
to Angel you can't see straight.

229
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,940
And that's why we're all
gonna help you face this.

230
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:36,653
But he's better now, I swear. He's the one
that found the Glove of Myhnegon.

231
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:40,490
- He's keeping it safe in the mansion.
- Right. Great plan.

232
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:44,953
Leave tons of firepower with the scary guy
and leave us to clean up the mess.

233
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,957
- You'd love an excuse to hurt him.
- I don't need an excuse.

234
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,793
I think lots of dead people
actually constitutes a reason.

235
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,588
Right. This is all nobility
and has nothing to do with jealousy.

236
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,758
Hello? Miss Not Over Yourself Yet?

237
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,220
- Don't you start.
- Giles, no one's doing the "I" statements.

238
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,514
That's enough. Everybody.

239
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:11,688
Buffy knows our concerns, and her actions,
however ill-advised, can be understood.

240
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:18,069
Our priority right now is to retrieve
the Glove of Myhnegon and try to destroy it.

241
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,489
Now all of you, back to your classes.

242
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,263
Thanks for the bail in there.

243
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:51,102
I know this is a lot to absorb, but Angel
did find the glove, and that was a...

244
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,480
Be quiet.

245
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,609
I won't remind you that the fate
of the world often lies with the Slayer.

246
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,278
What would be the point?

247
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:04,783
Nor shall I remind you that you've
jeopardised the lives of all you hold dear

248
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,660
by harbouring a known murderer.

249
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,999
But sadly I must remind you
that Angel tortured me.

250
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,919
For hours.

251
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,004
For pleasure.

252
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,885
You should have told me
he was alive. You didn't.

253
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,430
You have no respect for me,
or the job I perform.

254
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,127
A word of advice?

255
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:00,046
Vampires rarely knock. Especially in daylight.

256
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,215
Oh, right.

257
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,218
So, this is your home.

258
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,096
Yeah. The decorator actually just left.

259
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,350
Faith, do you know who the Spartans were?

260
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,021
Wild stab, a bunch o' guys from Spart?

261
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,733
They were the fiercest warriors
known to ancient Greece.

262
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,528
And they lived in quarters very much
like these. Do you know why?

263
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:27,032
Because a true fighter needs nothing else.

264
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,952
I'm going to be very hard on you, Faith.

265
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,955
I will not brook insolence or laziness.

266
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,584
And I will not allow blunders
like last night's attack.

267
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:41,296
You will probably hate me
a great deal of the time.

268
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,506
You think?

269
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,052
But I will make you a better slayer.

270
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,347
And that will keep you alive.

271
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,974
You have to trust that I am right.

272
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,770
God knows what Mr Giles
has been filling your head with.

273
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,147
Giles is OK.

274
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,527
His methods are unfathomable to me.
I find him entirely confounding.

275
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:10,492
But that is not important. Let him
have his games and secret meetings.

276
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,077
What meetings?

277
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,789
Oh, I don't know. Something
with Buffy and her friends.

278
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:19,125
Oh. Right. I guess that doesn't include me.

279
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:23,463
And why does he let her socialise
so much? It hardly seems...

280
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,548
No matter.

281
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,719
Would you like to do some training?

282
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,807
Training? As in kicking,
punching and stabbing?

283
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,893
- Yes, that's the idea.
- I'm your girl.

284
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,320
- Hey.
- Hey.

285
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,658
So, on a scale of one to a million,
how much are you hating me right now?

286
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,578
Zero. You were scared.
You kept a secret, you know?

287
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:00,417
It's OK. I mean, secrets aren't bad,
you know? They're normal.

288
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:04,170
They're better than normal.
They're good. Secrets are good.

289
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,507
Must be a reason why we keep 'em, right?

290
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,843
Yeah, I guess.

291
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,387
So, are you goin' to the Bronze tonight?

292
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:17,183
Or are you gonna sneak away for
a not-so-secret rendezvous with Angel?

293
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:22,605
None of the above. I'm gonna try and kill
this Lagos guy. Peace offering to Giles.

294
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,483
Well, Angel has the glove now, right?

295
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,277
Yep. But Lagos doesn't know that.

296
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,780
Sooner or later he'll show up
at that crypt looking for it.

297
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:34,951
Ah, but instead he finds
a Buffy in a not-so-good mood?

298
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,746
That's my brilliant plan.

299
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,210
You look pissed.

300
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,588
- Rough day.
- Tell me about it.

301
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,466
Rather just shoot.

302
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:53,970
Don't think I don't know what you and your
pals were talking about behind my back.

303
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,972
Yeah? What was that?

304
00:25:56,181 --> 00:26:00,060
- More about this glove than you're saying.
- The Glove of Myhnegon? Right.

305
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,064
How'd you like some real news?
Angel's still alive.

306
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,693
The vampire.

307
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:13,073
Back in town. Saw him myself.
Totin' the popular and famous glove.

308
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,909
Angel.

309
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:19,537
Guy like that, that kind of glove,
could kill a whole mess of people.

310
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,958
Said the same thing to Buffy myself.
Weird how she didn't seem to care.

311
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,836
Buffy knew he was alive?

312
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,421
I can't believe her!

313
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,340
She says he's clean.

314
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:35,095
Yeah, well, I say we can't afford to find out.
I say I deal with this problem right now.

315
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,056
I say I slay.

316
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,558
Can I come?

317
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:46,856
You wanted to see me, Mr Giles?

318
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:49,901
Yes. I do apologise for
bringing you in at this late hour.

319
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,489
Please. A good watcher must be
awake and alert at all hours.

320
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,368
Would you like some tea?

321
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:01,121
God, yes, please.

322
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:05,500
I'm completely knackered. I spent
the afternoon training with Faith.

323
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,211
She doesn't lack for energy.

324
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,047
She's your first slayer, I take it?

325
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,883
If you're questioning my qualifications...

326
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,969
No, I'm not.

327
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:21,558
I have the utmost respect for your methods.
In my own American way.

328
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,521
I also have the glove.

329
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,733
Not actually on me, but I believe it's safe.

330
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:34,904
It's in a mansion on Crawford Street.
A friend of Buffy's is keeping it there.

331
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:38,116
Well, we must get to it. Immediately.

332
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:43,329
- Hide it before someone else finds it.
- Or, better still, destroy it.

333
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,291
- Destroy it?
- Yes.

334
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,586
Yes, I didn't think
it could be done either, but...

335
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:57,135
It involves transforming fire
into Living Flame and immolating the glove.

336
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:02,807
It's complex, but I believe
I have all the necessary materials.

337
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,561
Well, I must say, Mr Giles,

338
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:09,022
good show.

339
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:14,986
Good show indeed.

340
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,127
Not to downplay my own slaying abilities,

341
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,965
which in some circles are considered
formidable, but shouldn't Faith be here?

342
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,426
I tried calling, but no one was home.

343
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:42,722
Look, if you're feeling any demon-o-phobia,
please, splitting is totally an option.

344
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,433
You're not the one in trouble with Giles.

345
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,185
That's true.

346
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,355
How long do you think
he can stay angry at me anyway?

347
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:52,148
The emotional Marathon Man?

348
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:54,567
Yeah. I can't really blame him.

349
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,780
It's weird, though. Now that my secret...

350
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:04,119
Angel, it's all out in the open... I feel better.

351
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:08,456
Well, sure you do.
This big burden's been lifted.

352
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:11,793
I mean, keeping secrets is a lot of work.

353
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,588
One could hypothetically imagine.

354
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,383
You have no idea.

355
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,427
None whatsoever.

356
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,430
But can I ask you a question?

357
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:29,060
When you were with Angel
and nobody knew about it,

358
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:33,648
did that make it feel,
you know, sexier somehow?

359
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,444
Not really. It's too much pressure.

360
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:41,948
After awhile it even makes
the fun parts not so fun.

361
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:49,414
What makes you think all this
secret stuff is sexy anyway?

362
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:53,126
Nothing. Just wondering. Gotta keep
askin' the big old questions

363
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:56,296
when you're blessed with
this girl's thirst for knowledge.

364
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,549
OK, there's something I have to tell you.

365
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,469
What?

366
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,513
OK. This will make me feel better, right?

367
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,643
You know, I always
consider myself a good person.

368
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,314
Floss, do my homework, never cheat...

369
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:20,487
But lately, and please don't judge me on this,
but I want you to be the first to know that

370
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,114
that there's a demon behind you.

371
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,517
Now we're talkin'.

372
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,230
Yes.

373
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,445
Sorry about that.

374
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,072
So, what were you saying?

375
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:05,824
Oh, I...

376
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,828
I opened my SAT test booklet
five minutes early.

377
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,540
Just doesn't seem important now, does it?

378
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,002
Your secret's safe with me.

379
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:21,214
Come on, let's go bring
Giles some happiness.

380
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:29,055
Good old Sunnydale library, fully equipped
with reference books, file cards

381
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,308
and weapons. I call crossbow.

382
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,310
You got it.

383
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,566
- All right, ready to go?
- That I am.

384
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,695
- Wait.
- What?

385
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,575
Oh, my God, it's Giles.

386
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,493
Giles, can you hear me?

387
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,580
- What the hell happened?
- Let me guess.

388
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,999
Stop. Hold. Just think a minute.

389
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:59,461
- Yeah, I'm thinking: Buffy's ex-meat did this.
- It's not Angel's style.

390
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:03,173
- He's a demon. How much proof d'you need?
- Bite marks would be nice.

391
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:06,009
Yeah, I have medical emergency.
Sunnydale High.

392
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:09,137
- Screw this waiting crap.
- Faith, if we leave, Giles could die.

393
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,515
He's gonna have a lot of company
unless I do something.

394
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:14,768
- Wait.
- For what? You to grow a pair?

395
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:17,771
You handle the baby-sit and I'll kill Angel.

396
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,066
Dammit!

397
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,319
Exorere, Flamma Vitae,

398
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:28,198
Prodi ex loco tuo elementorum,

399
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:30,617
in hunc mundum vivorum,

400
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:34,120
Exorere, Flamma Vitae,

401
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:40,543
Prodi ex loco tuo elementorum,
in hunc mundum vivorum,

402
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:49,177
Giles is gonna be psyched
that we showed up stuffy old Mrs Post.

403
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,638
Oh, my God. What happened?

404
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:54,891
Caucasian male, mid-forties, head trauma.
Notify ER, we're bringing him in.

405
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,227
- What happened?
- No time for this.

406
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,561
Wait.

407
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:01,439
Buffy, you must destroy the glove.

408
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,275
You want him to live? Get out of the way.

409
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,236
Use Living Flame.

410
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,613
Move.

411
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,244
What happened?

412
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:17,497
Your boyfriend's not as cured as you thought.

413
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,459
- What makes you think Angel did this?
- We saw what you saw.

414
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:24,671
- So you just assume?
- I didn't.

415
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,507
Faith did.

416
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,637
- What did you tell her?
- Only what everyone knows.

417
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,932
She's a big girl.
Came to her own conclusions.

418
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,310
How much of a head start does she have?

419
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:41,771
Ten minutes.

420
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:46,776
Go through Giles' research.
Figure out how to destroy the glove.

421
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:52,032
Shut up and help me.

422
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:59,247
- What do you want?
- Gwen Post. Mr Giles sent me.

423
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,250
What for?

424
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:05,420
To help you destroy the glove.
Is that the Living Flame?

425
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,881
Yes.

426
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,843
Look, I'm sorry to be so abrupt,
but Lagos is on his way here now.

427
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:16,890
If you're performing the ritual incorrectly,
it will only make the glove more powerful.

428
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:18,850
All right.

429
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,562
Good. Where is the glove?

430
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,939
It's in the trunk.

431
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:32,322
That's what I love about this town.
Everyone's so helpful.

432
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,622
Bugger! Bugger!

433
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,215
OK. That hurt.

434
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,842
It was supposed to kill you.

435
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,845
If you'd been human, it would have.

436
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,765
But I believe this is your poison.

437
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:12,821
Mrs Post!

438
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,323
I can't believe how much I'm gonna kill you!

439
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,367
- You're not gettin' that glove.
- Wanna bet?

440
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:34,634
What?

441
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:36,928
Think we got it?

442
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:41,391
Well, it's either the catalyst for Living Flame
or just some really smelly sand.

443
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:44,602
- We'll have to test this.
- I'll double-check.

444
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,398
- What?
- I know what the glove does.

445
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,401
There's no time to test this.

446
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,243
- I can't let you do it, Faith.
- You're confused, twinkie.

447
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:04,247
Let me clear you up:
vampire, Slayer, dead vampire.

448
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,499
There's a lot that you don't understand.

449
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:10,920
Faith? She doesn't know.
She's blinded by love.

450
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:14,799
- Faith, no.
- Trust me.

451
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,053
We can figure this out.

452
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,781
The glove. It's in the trunk.

453
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,033
- I'll get it.
- Help Faith.

454
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:38,049
What are you...? Stop. Guys, listen.

455
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:53,440
Finally.

456
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,836
Tar chugam a chumhacht Myhnegon!

457
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,599
What's going on?

458
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,226
Faith, a word of advice.

459
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,772
You're an idiot.

460
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:36,358
Tar frim!

461
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:46,618
Tar frim!

462
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,169
Tar frim!

463
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,301
Can you draw her fire?

464
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:05,804
- You bet I can.
- Go do it.

465
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,523
Tar frim!

466
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:22,237
There's nothing you can do to me now.
I have the glove.

467
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,490
- With the glove comes the power.
- I'm getting that.

468
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,825
So there's no more glove thingy?

469
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:12,412
Well, a little Living Flame,
a little mesquite, gone for good.

470
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:15,999
- Sounds like we missed a lotta fun.
- Then we're telling it wrong.

471
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,376
What do you think Buffy and Angel will do?

472
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:20,086
Boy, do I don't know.

473
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:25,342
Well, he saved me from a horrible flamey
death - that sort of makes me like him again.

474
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:30,180
Well, as long as she and Angel
don't get pelvic, we'll be OK, I guess.

475
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,769
- What are you guys talkin' about?
- Oddly enough, your boyfriend. Again.

476
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:40,565
He's not my boyfriend.

477
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,942
Really, truly. He's...

478
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,488
I don't know.

479
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:51,910
Are we cool?

480
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,536
Yeah.

481
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:57,207
Just seein' the two of you kissing
after everything that happened,

482
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,043
I leaned toward the postal.

483
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,798
- But I trust you.
- I don't. Just for the record.

484
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:10,470
Let me guess.
Gwendolyn Post, not a watcher?

485
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:15,183
Yes, she was. She was kicked out
by the Council a couple of years ago

486
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:18,353
for misuses of dark power.

487
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:20,689
They swear there was a memo.

488
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:24,025
Well, I'd better go.
Little more damage control.

489
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:32,575
The whole Angel thing is so weird.

490
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:37,580
Yes, well, we'll have to see
how that unfolds, won't we?

491
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:47,966
Come in.

492
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:52,262
Hey.

493
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:02,897
- The place looks nice.
- Yeah, it's real Spartan.

494
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,655
How are you?

495
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:13,324
Five-by-five.

496
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:17,620
I'll interpret that as good.

497
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:24,836
Look, Gwendolyn Post, or whoever
she may be, had us all fooled.

498
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:26,796
Even Giles.

499
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:31,343
Yeah. Well, you can't trust people.
I should've learned that by now.

500
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:35,180
I realise this will sound funny

501
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:39,184
coming from someone that just spent
a lot of time kicking your face,

502
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,478
but you can trust me.

503
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:47,192
- Is that right?
- I know I kept secrets.

504
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:50,153
I didn't have a choice.

505
