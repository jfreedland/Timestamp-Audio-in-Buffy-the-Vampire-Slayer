1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,522
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:07,446
Nobody knows who I am. Not the real me.

3
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:09,967
No one understands.

4
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:12,169
No one has an older sister who's a slayer.

5
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:15,882
I know it's always been this way.
She's the baby.

6
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:20,203
But, for some reason, lately
it's just really getting to me.

7
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:22,443
Well, yeah. You're her idol, Buffy.

8
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,682
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone.

9
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:27,968
I will after you come back inside the house.

10
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:30,965
- Let go of me.
- No, it's not safe out here.

11
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:35,604
Anya.

12
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:42,324
This head wound looks bad.
We better get her to a hospital.

13
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:48,206
I wish I had some food to offer you guys,
but the hotplate's out of commission.

14
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:50,727
We think the cat peed on it.

15
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:57,008
I do have SpaghettiOs. Set 'em on the dryer
and you're a cycle from lukewarm goodness.

16
00:00:57,093 --> 00:00:59,766
I had dryer food for lunch.

17
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,924
Guess the folks are back.

18
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:09,242
No, no, I was wrong.
Just incompetent burglars.

19
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,086
Yeah, it's definitely time
to look for a new place.

20
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:25,566
Something a little nicer. Buffy, you've been
to Hell. They have one-bedrooms, right?

21
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:30,328
Buffy, how's that book?
Full of zippy dates and zesty names?

22
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:32,404
I'm fine.

23
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:37,370
I'm enjoying the studying.

24
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:40,525
Who are you lately?
Give it up and watch the movie.

25
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:43,288
It has been a long day with the Crusades.

26
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:46,604
I could take a break from the violence
for some... fighting.

27
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:53,084
If you really want, we can fight you as well.

28
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:57,007
Incompetently-dubbed kung fu.
Our most valuable Chinese import.

29
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:59,846
Much more durable than their hotplates.

30
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:03,130
Here. Just relax.

31
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:08,404
That feels good.

32
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:16,888
What are you doing?
I have a dislocated shoulder.

33
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:20,045
I'm trying to concentrate
on the kicking movie.

34
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:22,488
Rubbing went away.

35
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:25,371
Sorry. I got caught up in the action.

36
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:27,444
Yeah. It was pretty good.

37
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,567
Give me a break.

38
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:34,645
This is wrong. First you'd give
the big guy a flying kick.

39
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,963
Then you would take out all the little ones.

40
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:41,683
See? Now with the flying kick. From a dead
stop. What's powering it - raw enthusiasm?

41
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:46,801
Buff, you oughta leave the work behind
sometimes. You're not always on slayer duty.

42
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:49,885
It would drive you crazy
if this were an army movie

43
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:54,524
and they were all saluting backwards
and invading all willy-nilly.

44
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:05,408
And anyway, you can't
blame me for being critical.

45
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:10,203
Willow's the same way when we watch
a movie about witches, right, Xander?

46
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:15,606
Yeah. She's all like "What's that, a cauldron?
Who uses a cauldron any more?"

47
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:21,724
The last step in thy forging is my pain.

48
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:25,647
The price with which I purchase
the death of the Slayer.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,074

50
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,087
If you get the apartment,
we'll walk down this hall and say

51
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:32,164
"I'm on my way to Xander's."

52
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:35,609
- Xander, I probably won't be doing that.
- Really? I will.

53
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,003
We're just looking. Rent's high
so don't get your hopes carbonated.

54
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:41,561
- But you have references.
- No, I have Albert,

55
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:43,564
which is me doing an important voice.

56
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:48,010
Xander Harris? An excellent tenant.
And a very nice-Iooking fellow.

57
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,369
Big.

58
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:54,523
It's nice. And not subterranean.

59
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:57,728
It's very above-terranean.

60
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:01,167
I want it. Pay anything.

61
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:03,609
Xander Harris?

62
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:05,888
No, Riley Finn. This is Xander.

63
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:09,563
Hey.

64
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:12,813
- I brought my friends.
- I see.

65
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:17,205
- They wouldn't always be around.
- But we're clean and quiet.

66
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:22,083
We can have the Scooby meetings here. Giles
can explain the boring things over there.

67
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:27,008
There's a microwave. It would be like
having hot and cold running popcorn.

68
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,402
Phone and electricity are hooked up.

69
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:33,327
There's a private balcony,
ceiling fan, closet space.

70
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,722
And that's the bedroom.

71
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:39,163
Guys, you can't save it for the bedroom?

72
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,528
OK, good point.

73
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:49,768
- I brought an application for you to fill out.
- An application?

74
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:53,402
I can'tjust tell you my references?
Because there's Albert.

75
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:57,281
We run your credit check
based on the application.

76
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,442
Credit check.

77
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:03,084
Little check on the credit.
See how credible my cheques are.

78
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:07,086
And we'll be asking for first, last,
security and a small cleaning deposit.

79
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:09,926
The total's at the bottom of the sheet there.

80
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:14,044
He'll take it. Xander, go get
the furniture. I'll wait here.

81
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:19,526
He's living in his drunken parents' basement
where something urinated on the hotplate.

82
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:23,128
Can we talk quietly over there? Excuse us.

83
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:31,450
We like the ceiling fan.

84
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:34,923
Yes. It's very, you know, kind of Old South.

85
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,927
Without the unpleasant slavery associations.

86
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:39,924
But why can't we have it?

87
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:44,131
I told you. My construction job is ending
and I won't have any more money coming in.

88
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:46,363
And by the way, you do have your own place.

89
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:49,331
So when I visit you, I have
to be in that awful basement?

90
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,973
Not for ever. Just until things come together.

91
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:55,602
Which is when, Xander? Cos right now,
things look pretty untogether.

92
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:59,891
- You can't expect me to wait around for...
- Quiet, please, Anya.

93
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:02,362
What is this? What's going on with you?

94
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:07,447
What's going on with me
is my arm hurts and I'm tired

95
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:11,731
and I don't really feel like taking
a tour of beautiful things I can't have.

96
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:20,883
I guess I'll just start on that application.
I think you'll like it.

97
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,533
I've been told I have lovely penmanship.

98
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:32,084
"Miscellaneous curses".

99
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:37,002
Brilliant. I'll be lucky if I don't
curse my hands off at the wrist.

100
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:41,050
The Slayer is not here.

101
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:44,044
Rabbit's foot - no, wait.

102
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:51,530
That is a fertility god. Feeble man,
you are not likely to strike...

103
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:02,410
You are not the Slayer.

104
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:05,087
You do not concern me.

105
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,163
Like this, and this...

106
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:18,572
That's pretty heavy.

107
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:23,408
That's Oofdar, Goddess of Childbirth.
She's got some nice heft to her.

108
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:29,283
- How badly did you hurt him?
- Well, "hurt"... Maybe not "hurt".

109
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:31,887
Well, I'm sure he was startled.

110
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:35,045
Yes, I'd imagine it gave him rather a turn.

111
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,964
He ran away?

112
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:41,569
Sort of more turned and
swept out majestically, I suppose.

113
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:44,167
He said I didn't concern him.

114
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:47,689
So a mythic triumph over
a completely indifferent foe.

115
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:50,810
Well, I'm not dead or unconscious,
so I say bravo for me.

116
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:54,932
Some good demons in this one.
See if your guy's in here.

117
00:08:56,533 --> 00:09:00,208
So you bought the magic shop
and you were attacked before it opened.

118
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:03,012
Who's up for a chorus of
the "We Told You So" symphony?

119
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:06,165
Owning this place
does seem kinda dangerous.

120
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:08,244
- Toth.
- What?

121
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:12,482
He called you a toth. It's a British
expression. It means "moron".

122
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:15,326
No. Toth is the name of the demon.

123
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:19,122
Be careful with that.

124
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:23,923
Ancient demon. Very strong.
Last survivor of the Tothric clan.

125
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,811
It also says for a demon
he's unusually sophisticated.

126
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:31,603
Sophisticated? So I should discuss men's
fashions with him before I chop his head off?

127
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:37,529
They're referring to the fact that he does not
fight barehanded. He uses tools, devices.

128
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:40,609
He's also supposed to be very focused.

129
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,685
Since he mentioned the Slayer,
we know what the focus is.

130
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:48,051
He mentioned Buffy? Where do we
find him and how hard can I kill him?

131
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:52,968
There's no mention of the types
of places he might frequent, but...

132
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:55,613
I have an idea.

133
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:59,766
He had a very specific olfactory presence.

134
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:04,005
Well, I guess we're off to the ol' factory.
I hate that place.

135
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:08,969
I'm joking. I know what it means.
He smelled. Right?

136
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:13,285
Some demon rituals
involve anointing with oils.

137
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:16,126
Was it sort of sandalwoody?

138
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:21,244
Not even remotely.
But he was very distinctive.

139
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:31,570
The city dump. Where smells go
to relax and be themselves.

140
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:35,362
People say they're recycling.
They're not recycling.

141
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:41,050
I found a spell so you can't smell anything,
but it does it by taking your nose off, so no.

142
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,128
What are you doing here, Spike?

143
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:55,246
There's a nice lady vampire who set up a
charming tearoom over the next pile of crap.

144
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,052
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm scavenging.

145
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,646
Very pretty.

146
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:03,922
Spike, we're looking for a demon.

147
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:08,643
Tall, robed, skin sort of
hanging off, deep voice.

148
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:12,371
You mean a great tall
robey thing like that one?

149
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:18,806
- Take cover.
- Big guy. Kick her ass.

150
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:25,003
Very nice. I was on your side.

151
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,046
Watch out.

152
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,764
Are you OK?

153
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:36,124
Buffy, he's gone.

154
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,204
- I'm fine.
- Easy.

155
00:11:40,653 --> 00:11:42,644
He disappeared.

156
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,884
- That had to hurt.
- Yeah.

157
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,964
Take it slowly.

158
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:25,123
Anya, you trying to use the hotplate again?

159
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:53,966
Anya? An?

160
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:11,371
Oh, my God.

161
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:15,892
What? No way.

162
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,808
Who is... me?

163
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,684
What am I doin' in there?

164
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:24,204
Buffy. Need Buffy.

165
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,764
No, it ate my quarter.

166
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:33,241
But see, I'm having this aggressively bad day.

167
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:36,244
I found a quarter.

168
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,089
Well, ma'am, for me
it is worth getting excited about.

169
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:47,564
Come on, Buffy.

170
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:54,764
Hello?

171
00:13:58,413 --> 00:14:00,324
They hung up.

172
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:07,650
If this guy wants to fight with weapons,
I've got it covered from A to Z. From axe to...

173
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:09,724
zee other axe.

174
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:14,242
Relax.

175
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,369
Another day, another demon.

176
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,762
Right. It'll be good.

177
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:36,844
My friend Sharon's brother knows a girl
who died choking on her boyfriend's tongue.

178
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,209
- Go away, Dawn.
- I'm not in your room. I'm in the hallway.

179
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:43,808
- The hallway doesn't belong to you.
- Get out of here.

180
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:46,767
Mom, I can stand in the hallway, right?

181
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,413
She's watching us like a big freak.

182
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:53,486
This must be my "two teenage girls
in the house" headache. It felt familiar.

183
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:55,768
Good work, Dawn. You gave her a headache.

184
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,321
I did not. Did I give you a headache, Mom?

185
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:01,962
- I'm sure part of it is Buffy's.
- But part of it is Dawn's.

186
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,044
It's so nice you've learned to share.

187
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:07,569
You girls, sort this out
yourselves. It's good for you.

188
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,451
She didn't say I couldn't stand here.

189
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,124
Very posh.

190
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,445
Oh, Slayer.

191
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:51,764
One of these days...

192
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:18,048
Hey, Harris.

193
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:21,125
- Harris!
- Harris. Sorry. Yeah.

194
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:25,206
In my trailer, OK? I'm talking to
all the guys. The job's winding down.

195
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:27,124
Right. I'll be right there.

196
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,770
Welcome to payback,
Mr Evil Plan Face Stealer.

197
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:43,285
You take my life, you get
my being fired absolutely free.

198
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,366
Harris. Where's your hard hat?

199
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,404
Sit down.

200
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:08,762
- How long you worked here, Harris?
- I'm not sure.

201
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:11,447
- About three months?
- I guess, yeah.

202
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:24,569
And you haven't done much
construction work before this?

203
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:26,484
I knew they were gonna notice that.

204
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:31,522
I have to tell you, that's surprising,
cos your work here has been first-rate.

205
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:35,492
Now, we have anotherjob lined up
in Carlton when we finish here.

206
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:41,091
- You ever think about staying on full time?
- What? Why isn't he firing me? Him.

207
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:46,327
I was thinking that I'd have you head up
our interior carpentry crew. See how it goes.

208
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:50,725
- It's more responsibility, but the pay's better.
- That'd be great.

209
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:53,523
A promotion? But I...

210
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:56,411
I mean, he didn't...
Doesn't he see the shiny thing?

211
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:02,766
Congratulations, Harris. You and your girl
should go out and celebrate.

212
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:05,083
I already have an idea how.

213
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:11,972
I was going to call you, Mr Harris,
tell you your credit checked out fine. But...

214
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:13,930
I didn't think you'd be back.

215
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:16,652
"Mr Harris"? Yeah, right.

216
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,644
I'm sure you'll like the building.

217
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:22,567
I think someone said you're
currently in your parents' basement?

218
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:25,565
Right. There comes a point
where you either have to move on

219
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:28,770
orjust buy yourself
a Klingon costume and go with it.

220
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,447
Well, I hope you'll be happy here, Mr Harris.

221
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:39,003
- We're certainly happy to have you.
- Thank you.

222
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:43,166
And if you need anything, day or night,

223
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,891
please, call me.

224
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:49,171
I'm leaving my home number here.

225
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,086
She's coming on to him. Me.

226
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,012
Call me.

227
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:58,606
Even for, you know, nonbusiness stuff.

228
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:02,412
Maybe we could do something?

229
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:05,803
Please, lady. That is so not me.
He's too clean, for one thing.

230
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:08,407
And his socks are all matchy, and...

231
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,044
Remember, any time.

232
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,084
Anya, you there?

233
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,851
Look, I know you're still mad.

234
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:29,448
I figure you're pretending
you're not home but listening anyway.

235
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,410
Am not.

236
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:34,326
I have something to show you.
Meet me at the apartment.

237
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:37,211
You know the one. Nine o'clock.

238
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,893
- I won't let you do this.
- What's going on out there?

239
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:01,964
You can't do this to me.

240
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:07,123
Man, I need Buffy.

241
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:16,568
No, he looked exactly like me.

242
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:20,607
It stole my face. We have to
find it and we have to kill it.

243
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:25,084
She sees it's not me.

244
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:28,768
Please, Buffy, resist his spell.

245
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,844
Do this for me.

246
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:38,010
Don't worry, Xander. Whatever stole
your face, it has to deal with the Slayer now.

247
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:01,128
Don't be scared, Will. Just listen.

248
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:04,330
It's me - Xander. And I can prove it.

249
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:07,007
OK.

250
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:11,523
Let's see. Stuff only you and me know.

251
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,324
OK. On my seventh birthday,

252
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:18,247
I wanted a toy fire truck and I didn't
get it, and you were real nice about it.

253
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,929
Then next door burnt down and real fire
trucks came. I thought you set the fire for me.

254
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,243
And if you did, you can tell me.

255
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:32,765
Last year, I thought I was lactose-intolerant,
but it was just some bad Brie.

256
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:38,207
Every Christmas we watch Charlie Brown
together and I do the Snoopy dance.

257
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:46,404
Xander, stop dancing.

258
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:51,043
- You called me Xander.
- Xander, shut up.

259
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,567
Why wouldn't I think you were Xander?

260
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:57,844
What's goin' on?

261
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:02,610
OK. I woke up in the dump this morning.

262
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:07,324
Xander, the basement isn't a dump.
It's more like a really nice hovel.

263
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:10,723
No. The dump. The city dump.

264
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:15,682
I got hit last night, fell down...
Woke up this morning.

265
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:20,245
No. We walked you home
last night, remember?

266
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,925
You walked?

267
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:24,163
Will, did I do anything weird?

268
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,449
Did I wave any shiny things around?

269
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,842
Shiny things? What are you talking about?

270
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:34,683
Last night, that wasn't me.
There's a double out there.

271
00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:37,492
Some "thing" has stolen my face,

272
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:41,248
and it's going around pretending
to be me and it's hypnotising people.

273
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:45,724
It even got to Buffy, Giles and Riley. It's
over there right now and they have no idea.

274
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:51,730
What intrigues me is there are many demons
with the ability to mimic a simple form,

275
00:22:51,813 --> 00:22:54,043
but this sounds like more than that.

276
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:58,524
Hold up. Do we really have to figure out
what it is? Let's just go kill it.

277
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:03,164
Yeah. When the impostor's killed, the body'll
probably turn back into whatever it really is.

278
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:05,164
Toth.

279
00:23:06,413 --> 00:23:09,849
The demon with the creepy stick thing.

280
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:11,844
- Toth.
- It's gotta be.

281
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:15,448
He hit Xander with that blast and
it allowed him to take Xander's form.

282
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:19,651
- It could be what the creepy stick thing did.
- Yes, I suppose.

283
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,372
Yes, it makes sense. A shape-shifting device.

284
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:25,570
It does make sense. It must be Toth.

285
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:29,532
It's a robot. An evil robot constructed
from evil parts that look like me

286
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:31,604
designed to do evil.

287
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,888
Yes. Or it's Toth.

288
00:23:33,973 --> 00:23:35,964
Or it's Toth.

289
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:41,283
I was gonna look for Toth anyway.
Guess now I start looking for you.

290
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:44,683
Should I go with you?
I told Anya to meet me at my new place.

291
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:47,845
I'd feel a whole lot better knowing
she's safe from this creep.

292
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:51,972
Go be with her. If you were out there
looking for the double too...

293
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:55,728
Let's just say that I wouldn't wanna
run into you and kill the wrong one.

294
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:59,647
Good thinking. When you kill it,
make sure you got the one who's actually...

295
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,325
A demon.

296
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:05,088
A demon has taken my life from me
and he's living it better than I do.

297
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:12,965
Well, we're working on it. There has to be
a way to get to Buffy to unhypnotise her.

298
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:15,487
I'll find a spell to snap her out of it.

299
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:18,246
Right. Whatever.

300
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:21,927
Xander, you sound a little...

301
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:24,288
You have to help me
figure this out, you know.

302
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:27,604
But I never help. I get
in trouble and Buffy saves me.

303
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:31,163
That's not true. Sometimes
we all help to save you.

304
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:36,132
And sometimes you're not in trouble.

305
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:41,324
I'm just another great humiliation.

306
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:44,562
And this time it's even worse.

307
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:48,202
This demon is taking my life
and everyone's treating him...

308
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:50,727
Everyone's treating him like a grown-up.

309
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:53,043
Will, I'm starting to feel like...

310
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:56,170
- Like what?
- Like...

311
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:58,289
he's doing everything better.

312
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:03,686
He's smarter and... I don't know,
maybe I should just let him have it.

313
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:07,482
- Take my life, please.
- Xander, no.

314
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:10,485
You're just tired, and all soggy.

315
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:15,442
That's why it seems so hard. But you can't
let him just take your whole existence.

316
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:19,321
Why not? It's not like I was
doing anything so great with it.

317
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:21,608
When I get to the Pearly Gates, they won't go:

318
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:24,969
"Hey, what a kick-ass
comic-book collection. Come on in."

319
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:27,283
What have I got that's even worth...

320
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:30,966
- Anya.
- You think he's after her?

321
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:33,044
She won't know. He can just...

322
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:38,172
No way. He can take anything,
but he can't have her. I need her.

323
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:41,213
- Really?
- He could be with her right now.

324
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:44,410
Figure out a spell.
Something reveal-y. I gotta find her.

325
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:48,566
Xander, you already knew
he was taking over your life

326
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:51,690
and you didn't think about Anya till just now?

327
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:55,368
Wait till you have an evil twin.
See how you handle it.

328
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:00,884
I handled it fine.

329
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:05,687
Anya? An?

330
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:17,564
Meet me at the apartment.
You know the one. Nine o'clock.

331
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,762
It's gotta be here. Where is it?

332
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:31,366
You're lying. It's a trick.

333
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:33,444
No. Trust me.

334
00:26:35,813 --> 00:26:41,126
- You really got this apartment?
- I really did. And do you know why?

335
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:44,926
The ceiling fans? They're very attractive.

336
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:47,846
No. It's because I knew you wanted it.

337
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:51,204
It's all for you.

338
00:26:56,653 --> 00:26:59,725
Anya, you didn't see me today, did you?

339
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:01,849
I mean, we didn't talk?

340
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:05,562
What do you mean? I just got
your phone message, that's all.

341
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:08,604
Good.

342
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:14,404
So,

343
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:19,008
what happens next?

344
00:27:19,093 --> 00:27:21,766
Well, at some point we take off our clothes.

345
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:26,092
I mean, what happens next in our lives?

346
00:27:27,373 --> 00:27:29,568
When do we get a car?

347
00:27:29,653 --> 00:27:31,291
- A car?
- And a boat.

348
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:36,083
No, wait, I don't mean a boat. I mean a puppy.
Or a child. I have a list somewhere.

349
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:39,370
- What are you talking about?
- Just... We have to get going.

350
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:42,490
I don't have time just to
let these things happen.

351
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:46,282
- There's no hurry.
- Yes, there is. There's a hurry, Xander.

352
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,364
I'm dying.

353
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,687
I may have as few as 50 years left.

354
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:55,492
50 years? What is this?

355
00:27:56,933 --> 00:28:00,369
Wait a minute. This is about this.

356
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:03,724
What about the sling?

357
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:08,049
You haven't been hurt like this
since you became human.

358
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:13,207
Maybe it's finally hitting you
what being human means.

359
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,124
No, that's not it.

360
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:18,522
Yes, I think it is.

361
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,286
You were gonna live for thousands of years.

362
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:24,129
And now you're gonna age and die.

363
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:31,172
- That must be terrifying.
- You don't understand what it's like.

364
00:28:31,653 --> 00:28:35,931
Being suddenly human? I think
I can get what that would be like.

365
00:28:37,653 --> 00:28:39,962
And we can get through it together.

366
00:28:40,373 --> 00:28:44,252
You can't make it any different.
I'm going to get old.

367
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:47,769
And you can't promise you'll
be with me when I'm wrinkly

368
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:52,364
and my teeth are artificial and stuck
into my wrinkly mouth with an adhesive.

369
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:54,523
No, I can't promise that.

370
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:58,652
But it doesn't sound terrible.
And that's saying something.

371
00:28:59,693 --> 00:29:04,448
I promise you, Anya. Very soon
you won't be thinking about getting older.

372
00:29:10,893 --> 00:29:12,884
- Get away from her.
- Xander.

373
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:15,326
Xander?

374
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:18,530
Get out. You don't belong here.

375
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:20,604
Anya, it's me.

376
00:29:22,013 --> 00:29:26,484
It's a demon. He stole my face.
He's trying to trick you.

377
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:32,768
- Anya, you know I'm me, right?
- No.

378
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:39,286
What is it? Make it go away.

379
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:40,887
So we split up?

380
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:45,763
Yeah. You check where he might go to blend
in as Xander. I'll check where Toth might be.

381
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,803
I swear I know I had that locked.

382
00:29:48,893 --> 00:29:52,568
- Buffy, Toth looks like Xander.
- We already know. We're on our way.

383
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:54,809
Wait. How did you know about this?

384
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:59,330
He came to me. I mean Xander did. And
he's in terrible shape. We need to help him.

385
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:02,849
- He came to us, too.
- No. We each had a Xander.

386
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:06,846
I mean, you didn't have a Xander.
You had a demon in a Xander suit.

387
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:09,652
What makes you so sure
that yours is the right one?

388
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:12,088
He knew stuff. He did the Snoopy dance.

389
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:15,404
- Buffy, it was Xander and he needs us.
- Oh, dear Lord.

390
00:30:15,493 --> 00:30:17,961
Buffy, our Xander, did he seem a little...

391
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:20,647
He seemed kind of forceful and confident.

392
00:30:20,773 --> 00:30:23,526
- That's not Xander.
- I said "Oh, dear Lord".

393
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:27,242
- You always say that.
- Well, it's always important.

394
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,324
Neither Xander is a demon.

395
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:33,564
- Is one of them a robot?
- What? No.

396
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:37,246
The rod device, it's called a ferula-gemina.

397
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:41,849
It splits one person into half, distilling
personality traits into two separate bodies.

398
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:46,961
As near as I can tell, Toth was attempting
to split the Slayer into two different entities.

399
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,408
- Two Buffys?
- Yes.

400
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:55,363
One with all the qualities in Buffy Summers,
the other one with those in the Slayer alone.

401
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:59,248
The strength, the speed, the heritage.

402
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:04,407
When it hit Xander, I think it separated him
into his strongest points and his weakest.

403
00:31:04,493 --> 00:31:09,044
- But which one's the real one?
- They're both Xander. Neither of them is evil.

404
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,364
There's nothing in them
that Xander didn't already possess.

405
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,092
I still don't get the original plan.
Why do it?

406
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,290
The slayer half would be like
slayer concentrate - unkillable.

407
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:21,012
But the two halves
can't exist without each other.

408
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:24,403
Kill the weaker Buffy half,
and the slayer half dies.

409
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:28,930
So the same goes for the Xanders.
We lose one, we lose them both.

410
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:30,844
He's the demon.

411
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,810
Or possibly a robot.

412
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:36,886
Look at me. Look in my eyes.
Can't you see it's me?

413
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:44,645
- I don't know.
- Please, look at him. Listen to him.

414
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:46,405
He's all smooth.

415
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:49,007
You have to know it's me.

416
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:52,449
Don't worry, Anya. I'll get rid of this thing.

417
00:31:52,773 --> 00:31:55,731
I'm thinking this is gonna last
about 15 seconds.

418
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:58,571
I'm thinkin' less.

419
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:07,004
No. Don't shoot him.

420
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:16,206
Can't this thing go any faster?
"Ultimate driving machine", my ass.

421
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:18,284
We're pushing 70.

422
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,644
- Riley, do you wish...?
- No.

423
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:28,845
No? You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

424
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:36,491
Yes, I do. You wanted to know if I wished you
got hit by the ferula-gemina, got split in two.

425
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:42,012
Well, you have been kind of rankly
about the whole slayer gig.

426
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,847
Instead of having Slayer Buffy,
you could have Buffy Buffy.

427
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:49,164
I have Buffy Buffy.
Being the Slayer is part of who you are.

428
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:51,528
You keep thinking I don't get that, but...

429
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:55,401
It's just I know how un-fun it can be.

430
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:59,204
The bad hours, frequent bruising,
cranky monsters.

431
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:05,562
Buffy, if you led a perfectly normal life,
you wouldn't be half as crazy as you are.

432
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:09,123
I gotta have that. I gotta have it all.
I'm talkin' toes, elbows,

433
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:12,683
the whole bad ice-skating movie
obsession, everything.

434
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:16,083
There's no part of you I'm not in love with.

435
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:26,931
We better get there soon.
If Xander kills himself, he's dead.

436
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:29,887
You know what I mean.

437
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:35,088
Let go. I have to kill the demon-bot.

438
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:40,482
Anya, get out of the way.

439
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:44,327
- Xander.
- It's all right, Buffy. I have him.

440
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,973
No, Buffy. I'm me. Help me.

441
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:49,044
He's got my gun.

442
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:53,406
- You own a gun?
- Xander... Gun-holding Xander.

443
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:55,449
Give it to me.

444
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:06,609
Buffy, which one's real?

445
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:08,445
- I am.
- No, I am.

446
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:13,804
Thank you.

447
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,884
- Wild.
- Yeah.

448
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:23,084
OK, Xanders.

449
00:34:23,893 --> 00:34:26,566
You've been split in two.
But you're both Xander.

450
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:30,692
And you can't kill each other. Well,
you could, but it would be really bad.

451
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:38,166
- No way.
- He can't be me. He's all fancy.

452
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:41,051
- We can prove you're both Xander.
- Yeah. How?

453
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:47,047
- There has to be a way.
- What number am I thinking of?

454
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:49,363
- I don't think that's gonna do it.
- 11 1/2.

455
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:51,409
Wrong. But see?

456
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:56,969
No. We're not the same. We're all different.

457
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,851
You have different properties,
but you're both Xander.

458
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,528
- Different properties?
- What different properties?

459
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:09,691
You know. Sense of direction,
good night vision, stuff like that.

460
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:12,487
But he has a thing in his pocket.

461
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:15,007
A shiny disc that stuns and disorients.

462
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,849
- What disc?
- Cover your eyes.

463
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,288
- This?
- It'll melt your brain.

464
00:35:24,293 --> 00:35:25,123
Look.

465
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:27,932
It's a nickel someone flattened
on the railroad track.

466
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:32,245
I found it on the construction site.
I thought it was cool. It's not magic.

467
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,164
No, I...

468
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:38,444
It is kinda cool.

469
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:42,651
Washington's still there, but he's
all smushy. And he may be Jefferson.

470
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:45,566
Isn't anyone gonna tell me
why there are two Xanders?

471
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:47,928
I will on the way to Giles'. Let's go.

472
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:56,049
Great. Rod Boy.

473
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:59,569
- I will not miss again, Slayer.
- The gun. Pick up the gun pieces.

474
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:05,487
I just made a small cleaning deposit.

475
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:34,124
Sword.

476
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:48,811
Yeah. That cleaning deposit's gone.

477
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:51,088
I was thinkin' the same thing.

478
00:36:51,173 --> 00:36:53,767
Do you suppose we're both Xander?

479
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:54,922
Look...

480
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,569
and admire, ladies.

481
00:36:57,653 --> 00:37:01,362
Look, there's a scar there,
and there's the same one right there.

482
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:05,571
And it's all double. This zit, and this...

483
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,927
kinda funny dippy thing.

484
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:12,608
And this weird little hair
that grows in the wrong way.

485
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:14,684
OK. Back off, ladies.

486
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:17,243
Psychologically, this is fascinating.

487
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:22,009
Doesn't it make everyone wanna lock them
in separate rooms and experiment on them?

488
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,563
Just me, then.

489
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:30,647
So, you Xanders really do have
all the same memories? All the same...

490
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:33,884
physical attributes?

491
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:36,168
We're completely identical.

492
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:39,768
Yeah, we checked out some stuff
in the car on the way over.

493
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:42,164
Fingerprints.

494
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:45,290
Maybe we shouldn't do this
reintegration thing right away.

495
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:50,049
See, I can take the boys home and
we can all have sex together and then...

496
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:53,250
you know, just slap 'em
back together in the morning.

497
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,847
- She's joking.
- No, she's not.

498
00:37:55,933 --> 00:38:01,007
She entirely wants to have sex
with us together - which is wrong and...

499
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:03,731
and it would be very confusing.

500
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:06,008
We just need to arrange the candles.

501
00:38:06,093 --> 00:38:10,086
Also, we should continue to pretend
we heard none of the disturbing sex talk.

502
00:38:10,173 --> 00:38:12,243
Check. Candles and pretence.

503
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:17,289
It's not like it'd be cheating.
They're both Xander.

504
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:21,605
Hold on a sec. If you weren't putting
a whammy on people with the shiny thing,

505
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:24,810
- how'd you get the promotion?
- Well, I'm good at that stuff.

506
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:26,611
- I am?
- Yeah.

507
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:32,051
- And how about that apartment manager?
- How weird was it when she called me "Mr"?

508
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:34,124
We're ready. We should do it now.

509
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:39,849
- What'll we do if it doesn't work?
- Kill us both, Spock.

510
00:38:42,213 --> 00:38:44,044
They're kinda the same now.

511
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:47,852
Yes, he's clearly a bad influence on himself.

512
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:50,811
Summon the goddess.
Chant the chant. Let's do it.

513
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:54,806
Actually, it's not that hard.
Your natural state is to be together.

514
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:59,330
Toth's spell is doing all the work of
keeping you apart. I just have to break it.

515
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:02,610
So, you two stand right here.

516
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:08,249
Side by side. We don't want you to
end up with two fronts, now, do we?

517
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:11,243
Are you sure you know how to do this?

518
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:14,762
Here we go. Brace yourselves.

519
00:39:17,653 --> 00:39:19,962
Let the spell be ended.

520
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:23,682
You gotta be kidding. "Let the spell
be ended"? That's not gonna work.

521
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:33,045
I liked it the other way. Put 'em back.

522
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:46,969
Getting nostalgic?

523
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:53,288
I don't know. At first it's just a place,
and then you start to make memories.

524
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:56,206
Then you're like: that's where Spike slept,

525
00:39:56,293 --> 00:40:00,081
and there, that's where Anya and I
drowned the Sepavro demon.

526
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:04,052
And right there, that's where
I got my heart all ripped out.

527
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:07,124
I really hate this place.

528
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:12,248
Anya, I see you've joined
the not-sling-wearing crowd.

529
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:16,451
Yes. I'm feeling better. And I anticipate
many years before my death.

530
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:18,922
Excepting disease or airbag-failure.

531
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,530
That sounds nice.

532
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:25,842
Presents?

533
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:29,721
Not unless you want my collection
of Babylon 5 commemorative plates.

534
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:33,442
Which you cannot have. I just thought
you could help carry a little.

535
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:39,324
Me? Buffy has superstrength. Why don't we
load her up like one of those little horses?

536
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:42,405
Anya. Please.

537
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:45,485
Fine. I'm just your slave.

538
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:52,766
How is it that she can always make me feel
Suave Xander's left the building?

539
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:57,404
You two have your friction, but
she digs the whole package. It's obvious.

540
00:40:57,493 --> 00:41:01,372
Still, I do envy you sometimes.
I mean, for the sanity.

541
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:05,002
Not that I'm still into Buffy.
Not that I ever was.

542
00:41:05,093 --> 00:41:08,642
I'm well aware of how lucky I am.
Lottery lucky.

543
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:16,125
Buffy's like nobody else in the world.
When I'm with her, it's like I'm split in two.

544
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:21,006
Half of me is just on fire,
going crazy if I'm not touching her.

545
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:25,211
The other half is so still and peaceful.

546
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:27,602
Just perfectly content.

547
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,730
Just knows this is the one.

548
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,084
But she doesn't love me.

549
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:46,127
Got something else for me to carry?

550
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,283
- You can help me pack this.
- Sure.

551
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:54,924
Sure.

552
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:30,646
