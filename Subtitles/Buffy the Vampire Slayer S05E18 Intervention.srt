1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:05,922
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
- Your sister took my Key, Dawnie,

2
00:00:06,013 --> 00:00:08,925
and she won't give it back.
I bet you know where she put it.

3
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:12,244
"They had to be certain
the Slayer would protect it with her life."

4
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:15,484
"So they sent the Key to her
in the form of a sister."

5
00:00:15,573 --> 00:00:20,806
Let Glory understand this: I won't help her
find the Key. I'd never do that to an innocent.

6
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:23,289
- An innocent?
- It's not a person.

7
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:29,204
- What about the Key?
- He indicated that it was a person.

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,323
Oh, God, no.

9
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:36,607
I love you.

10
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:39,924
The only chance you had with me
was when I was unconscious.

11
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:42,004
You are not my boyfriend!

12
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,683
- I got the impression she was a...
- Robot.

13
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:47,684
- Yeah, robot.
- She's a robot.

14
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:50,731
I made her to love me. I didn't make a toy.

15
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:54,241
- I made a girlfriend.
- I'm placing an order.

16
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,565
- I'm not making any more girls.
- Sure you are. Here's your specs.

17
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:02,003
Mom?

18
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:04,448
What are you doin'?

19
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:05,727
Mommy?

20
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:09,806
We commend to Almighty God
our sister, Joyce Summers.

21
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:14,324
- But it's tomorrow that I'm worried about.
- What's tomorrow?

22
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:16,483
That's exactly what I don't know.

23
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:23,972
- Giles, you don't have to help. You cooked.
- Come on. I quite like to cook.

24
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:28,411
- Helping you two out makes me feel useful.
- Wanna clean out the garage on Saturday?

25
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:30,961
- You'd feel indispensable.
- How tempting.

26
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:36,252
Dawn, get the plates from your room before
they get furry and we have to name them.

27
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,324
I was, like, five then.

28
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:44,403
How's she doing?

29
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,928
And you?

30
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:51,843
I'm OK. Well, some minutes
are harder than others.

31
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:57,691
I'm so sorry.
All I can say is, it will get better.

32
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:01,204
It has to.

33
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:06,968
We're holding up, though.
You know, getting into a routine.

34
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:09,442
Good. Routine's good.

35
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:14,244
In fact, I was thinking that we might
return to our training schedule.

36
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:19,249
I don't know.

37
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,528
I was thinking about...

38
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:23,285
maybe...

39
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:25,841
taking a break or something.

40
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,688
Just ease off for a while.
Not get into full slay mode.

41
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:33,888
You were doing so well.

42
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,525
And you were great,
helping me with everything.

43
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:42,725
I'm just starting to feel uneasy about stuff.

44
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:46,763
- Stuff?
- Training. Slaying.

45
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:48,809
All of it.

46
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:53,610
I just... I mean, I can beat up
the demons until the cows come home.

47
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:56,924
And then I can beat up the cows.

48
00:02:57,013 --> 00:03:01,052
- But I'm not sure I like what it's doing to me.
- But you've mastered so much.

49
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:04,045
- I mean, your strength and resilience alone...
- Yeah.

50
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:08,365
Strength, resilience.
Those are all words for hardness.

51
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:16,001
I'm starting to feel like being the Slayer
is turning me into stone.

52
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:18,482
Turning you into stone? Buffy...

53
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,928
Just think about it.

54
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,608
I was never there for Riley.
Not like I was for Angel.

55
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:28,050
- I was terrible to Dawn.
- At a time like this...

56
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:31,569
- No.
- ..you're bound to feel emotionally numb.

57
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:33,964
Before that.

58
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:38,328
Riley left because I was shut down.
He's gone.

59
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,321
And now my mom is gone.

60
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:45,247
And I loved her more than anything.

61
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,242
And I don't know if she knew.

62
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,564
She knew.

63
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:56,205
- Always.
- I don't know.

64
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:59,002
To slay, to kill,

65
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:02,085
it means being hard on the inside.

66
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:07,370
Maybe being the perfect slayer
means being too hard to love at all.

67
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:10,570
I already feel like
I can hardly say the words.

68
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,371
- Buffy...
- Giles...

69
00:04:13,293 --> 00:04:14,851
I love you.

70
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,892
Love, love, love, love, love.
Giles, it feels strange.

71
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:21,646
Well, I shouldn't wonder.

72
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,531
How serious are you about this?

73
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:31,087
Ten. Serious to the amount of ten.

74
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,006
There is something in the Watchers' Diaries.

75
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:40,369
- A quest.
- A quest?

76
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:43,889
- Like finding a grail or something?
- Not a grail.

77
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:46,328
Maybe answers.

78
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:48,768
It would take a day, perhaps two.

79
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:52,852
I'm not leaving Dawn.
Not with Glory looking for her.

80
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,730
Sure you can.

81
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:57,407
What's the deal?

82
00:04:57,493 --> 00:05:01,372
Some slayers before Buffy found it
helpful in regaining their focus,

83
00:05:01,453 --> 00:05:06,402
in learning more about their role. There's
a sacred place in the desert. It's not far.

84
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:08,404
But I can't go.

85
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:10,688
I'm not leaving you, Dawn.

86
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:16,051
If you have to go learn...
I mean, if it'll help you out,

87
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:20,812
I think you should do it.
I can hang with the gang.

88
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,691
I'll be OK.

89
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:31,245
I love you, Dawn. You know that, right?

90
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,088
Yeah. I love you too.

91
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,771
I love you. Really love you.

92
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:41,205
- Gettin' weird.
- Sorry.

93
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,966
But it's important that I tell you.

94
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,125
Weird love's better than no love.

95
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,446
Some say it's better than the real thing.

96
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:54,127
Better than the real thing.

97
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,845
She looks good, but what about the rest?

98
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:01,612
A little walk, a little talk...

99
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,649
Perhaps a zippy cartwheel...

100
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:08,932
She's great. You'll be real happy,
I swear. She's got everything you asked for.

101
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:13,609
All the extra programming: real-world
knowledge, the profiles on family and friends.

102
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:16,207
All the extra programming, right?

103
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:22,846
The stuff that you wanted. The scenario
responses, you know, the special skills...

104
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:29,170
- All of it. Now, you said I could leave town...
- Wait. I'm not sure I'm a satisfied customer.

105
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:33,531
She looks a little shiny to me.
You know, a touch of Plasticine...

106
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:38,010
Spike? Spike.

107
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,361
She'll do.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,074

109
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:44,370
He's getting stronger.
I'm losing him, I'm losing control of him.

110
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:48,448
You're speaking of Ben,
Most Glamorous-Yet-Tasteful One?

111
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,089
He stabbed you in your body.

112
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:56,964
Jinx is all right, Your Highness. And we have
the new knowledge that the Key is a human.

113
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:02,803
If time runs out on us and
all we're left with is info, then we're screwed.

114
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:05,970
- Surely not.
- No, we're screwed.

115
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:09,523
But you are a god. The sacred Glorificus!

116
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:11,569
I'm a god in exile.

117
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:17,288
Far from the hellfires of home,
and sharing my body with an enemy

118
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:21,412
that stabs my boys
in their fleshy little stomachs.

119
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,164
I'm in pain.

120
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,164
How can we help?

121
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:28,289
We'll lay down our lives.

122
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:34,047
The Slayer and the Key are connected.

123
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,567
She's going to have contact with it.

124
00:08:36,653 --> 00:08:38,883
Find out who's new in her life,

125
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:41,646
who's special, who's different.

126
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:46,766
- Watch her.
- We can do that, O Thou.

127
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:50,482
I want to hear about
everyone she has contact with!

128
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,922
That girl has my Key,

129
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,725
and I'm trusting you boys to get it for me.

130
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:00,803
If you love me...

131
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:02,924
get it for me.

132
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:27,292
- What's in the trunk?
- Supplies.

133
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:31,412
Supplies? I was wondering about that.
Like food, water, maybe a compass?

134
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:34,405
What about a book, a gourd
and a bunch of twigs?

135
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:38,532
- I don't think I'll be that hungry.
- They're for me. This way. You see...

136
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:45,132
the location of the sacred place is a
guarded secret. I can't take you there myself.

137
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:53,204
I'll have to perform a ritual to transfer my
guardianship of you, temporarily, to a guide.

138
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,727
This'll do.

139
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:59,806
A guide, but no food or water?
So it leads me to the sacred place,

140
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:02,088
and a week later
leads you to my bleached bones?

141
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:05,688
Buffy, please.
It takes more than a week to bleach bones.

142
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,083
So, how's it start?

143
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:12,971
I jump out of the circle,

144
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:15,851
then I jump back in it, and then...

145
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,852
- I shake my gourd.
- I know this ritual!

146
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:23,846
"The shamans were called upon to do the
hokey-pokey and turn themselves around."

147
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,083
Go quest.

148
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,922
And that's what it's all about.

149
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:50,532
What you searching for, Slayer? A weak
spot? Try me. Give me the best you've got.

150
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:57,526
- Is that your best, Slayer?
- No.

151
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,922
- Why not?
- I wanna hurt you,

152
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:04,529
but I can't resist the sinister attraction
of your cold and muscular body.

153
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:07,924
Maybe I should repay you
for your gentleness and let you go.

154
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,890
No! No, Spike.

155
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,929
Never let me go.

156
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:15,403
You know you should be
afraid of me. I'm bad.

157
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:18,890
You are. You're very, very bad.

158
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,851
- Are you gonna do it that way?
- No.

159
00:11:31,213 --> 00:11:33,568
This way.

160
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:35,245
You can't do it.

161
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:39,486
I could never do it.
I'm helpless against you, you fiend.

162
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,567
Buffy...

163
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:25,612
Hello, kitty.

164
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:22,808
I know this place.

165
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,209
OK. Morning spell's all set.

166
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:30,648
So we're all protected up for the night?

167
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:34,487
It's probably not as good as Willow could do.
She's a natural with magic.

168
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:38,885
In just the time I've known her,
she's already blown right past me.

169
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:43,285
So when the whizz kid finishes chem lab,
can you have her bulk up the spell a little?

170
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:47,161
If you want, maybe,
while Anya and I go do a quick patrol?

171
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:51,769
I don't see why we have to patrol just cos
Buffy's away. I'd rather watch television.

172
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:55,209
Willow wants to watch this thing
on the History Channel.

173
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,171
Salem witch trial stuff,
which will only get her upset.

174
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:03,407
I was there. It wasn't that bad. If you
were a witch, you could do a spell to escape.

175
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:07,691
So it was only bad for the falsely accused,
and, well, they never have a good time.

176
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:12,726
So, guys, if this is
a real slumber party, where's the pizza?

177
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,849
You're evil.

178
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,605
And that excites you?

179
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,526
It excites me, it terrifies me...

180
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,446
I try so hard to resist you, and I can't.

181
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,444
Yeah?

182
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,763
Darn your sinister attraction.

183
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:33,527
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.

184
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:38,447
You know I can't bite you.

185
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:42,128
I think you can.
I think you can if I let you,

186
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:47,606
and I want to let you. I want you to bite me
and devour me until there's no more.

187
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:50,604
Like this?

188
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:55,203
- Spike, devour me!
- All right.

189
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:58,649
Spike, I can't help myself. I love you.

190
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:01,088
You're mine, Buffy.

191
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:05,963
- Should I start this program over?
- No programs. Don't use that word.

192
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,327
Just be Buffy.

193
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:13,569
It's got last week's notes too.
Get it back to me by Thursday.

194
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:18,443
And don't write in it,
or put a coffee mug down on it or anything.

195
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,366
And don't spill. OK.

196
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,889
And don't fold
the page corners down. Bye!

197
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,690
- Time to slay.
- Yeah...

198
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:52,282
Vampires of the world, beware.

199
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:25,048
Hey there!

200
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,964
- Buffy.
- Xander!

201
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,323
And Anya!

202
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:35,406
- How is your money?
- Fine. Thank you for asking.

203
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:40,729
Isn't it a beautiful night
for killing evil things?

204
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:44,123
- I guess.
- You're back very early.

205
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:47,405
Yeah, how was the whole
vision-quest experience?

206
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:50,883
I don't understand that question.
But thank you for asking.

207
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:54,010
You're my friend, and a carpenter.

208
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:57,608
- Are you all right? You're all...
- Wait up!

209
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:02,049
Spike! It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat.

210
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:05,291
Yes. Hello, all.

211
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:12,126
Buffy's back early, I see. Lots of
patrolling all round tonight, then, is it?

212
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:15,927
Give a fella a break, there, Slayer.

213
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:22,402
I'm glad you're all here,
cos the place is crawling with vamps tonight.

214
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,645
Tons of 'em. I think we ought to split up.

215
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,008
We haven't seen any vamps. Are you sure...?

216
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:35,045
- You're right.
- Yep, guess so.

217
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,889
Spike, be careful!

218
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,809
No! Get away from him.

219
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:12,725
I think that was probably
the big action for tonight.

220
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:16,010
You two can toddle on home if you want.

221
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:17,446
Buffy?

222
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:21,048
Yes. Spike and I will do it alone.
You guys head home.

223
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:32,890
I don't understand this.

224
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:35,851
I did the slaying. I should be...

225
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:38,049
Satisfied?

226
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:40,601
But I'm not. I'm all...

227
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:44,248
My skin is all hot.

228
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,325
- Do I look hot to you?
- Always.

229
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:50,283
You'd better feel me to make sure.

230
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:52,364
I can do that.

231
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:01,688
I breathed in, like, a quart of vampire dust.
That can't be good.

232
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,686
I wish Giles had told us they were back
from the desert. What went on there?

233
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,968
You know, Slayer/Watcher stuff.

234
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:11,568
Probably some silly ritual
with an enchanted prairie dog.

235
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:14,372
Whatever it was,
I think she's still a little spacey.

236
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,648
- She fought OK.
- Yeah.

237
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:22,126
She never asked about Dawn.

238
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:23,931
That's true.

239
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:26,288
Something's wrong.

240
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:31,644
I hear something.

241
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,601
Spike. You're the Big Bad.

242
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:38,408
You're the big bad!

243
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:43,608
Those darn Salem judges,
with their less-satanic-than-thou attitudes.

244
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:47,891
Honey, let's change it.
The Discovery Channel has koala bears.

245
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:54,127
- Where's Dawn?
- In the bedroom. She fell asleep.

246
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:55,646
- Good.
- What's goin' on?

247
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:59,442
- Buffy's gone insane.
- What? What'd she do?

248
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:03,442
- Brace yourself. You're not gonna believe it.
- Before we jump all over her,

249
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:06,890
people do strange things
when someone they love dies.

250
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:12,445
When I lost my mother, I did dumb stuff, like
lying to my family and staying out all night.

251
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,569
Buffy's boinking Spike.

252
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:21,810
Well, Tara's right. Grief can be powerful,
and we shouldn'tjudge...

253
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:24,771
What, are you kidding? She's nuts!

254
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:28,846
- Well, it's not healthy. We all agree there.
- What can we do?

255
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:31,367
In the movies,
when they go crazy they slap 'em.

256
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:36,243
I'll find her and talk to her. If she's losing it,
we gotta help her before she gets hurt.

257
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,642
You aren't really gonna slap her, are you?

258
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:44,126
No, but if I see her straddle Spike again,
I will definitely knock myself unconscious.

259
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,281
Hello? Who's there?

260
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:04,482
Who's that?

261
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:08,612
Down there. And, no matter what,
don't come out till I get you, OK?

262
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:10,684
OK.

263
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:18,285
It's you.

264
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:21,843
I saw you, in the cemetery with Buffy.

265
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:25,844
Yeah? Can't see how
it's any business of yours.

266
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:28,288
It is my business, because Buffy's my friend.

267
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:34,132
She's gone through some stuff that affected
her, and you're taking advantage of her.

268
00:21:34,213 --> 00:21:36,852
She's upset about her mum.

269
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:40,892
And if she turns to me for comfort,
well, I'm not gonna deny it to her.

270
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:44,045
- I'm not a monster.
- Yes, you are a monster.

271
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:47,489
Vampires are monsters.
They make monster movies about them.

272
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,962
Well, yeah, you got me there.

273
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:54,843
Spike, Buffy has lots of friends,
and we love her very much,

274
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:57,322
and we'll do whatever it takes to protect her.

275
00:21:57,413 --> 00:22:01,326
If that means killing you,
then, well, that's just a bonus.

276
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:02,846
Gentlemen!

277
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:08,087
I'm so sorry to intrude, but I wondered
if I might beg a moment of your time.

278
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:10,004
Friends of yours?

279
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:11,924
Guess not.

280
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:24,930
Tie his hands! Glory will want him restrained.

281
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:27,004
- Let me go!
- Careful with him.

282
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:31,484
- She will want the Key intact.
- Key? Who's the Key? I'm not the...

283
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,286
I know you. You're the first Slayer.

284
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:47,888
This is a form. I am the guide.

285
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,929
I have a few questions,
about being the Slayer.

286
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:56,767
What about love? Notjust boyfriend love.

287
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:59,208
You think you're losing your ability to love.

288
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:01,682
I didn't say that.

289
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:03,683
Yeah.

290
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:08,324
You're afraid that being the Slayer
means losing your humanity.

291
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,210
Does it?

292
00:23:12,293 --> 00:23:16,969
You are full of love.
You love with all your soul.

293
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:20,690
It's brighter than the fire. Blinding.

294
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:24,047
That's why you pull away from it.

295
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:29,131
I'm full of love? I'm not losing it?

296
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:31,204
Only if you reject it.

297
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:35,525
Love is pain,
and the Slayer forges strength from pain.

298
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:39,731
Love, give, forgive.

299
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:42,811
Risk the pain. It is your nature.

300
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,369
Love will bring you to your gift.

301
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:49,044
What?

302
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,524
Spike?

303
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:57,083
I waited like you said,
but then I missed you.

304
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,085
Spike?

305
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:03,373
- Xander, did you...?
- Spike's gone!

306
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:05,444
Buffy. Come in.

307
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,042
It's late. Everyone's asleep. Wait.

308
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:20,362
We can talk out here.

309
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:26,406
Did Xander find you? He was looking for you.

310
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:29,526
He hasn't come back. Anya sat up waiting.

311
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:32,846
I don't know where Xander is.
I haven't seen him.

312
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:36,846
And when I came out of the tunnel,
Spike was gone. I need to find him.

313
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:41,801
Buffy, this thing with Spike.
It isn't true, is it?

314
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:45,283
You didn't, you know, sleep with Spike?

315
00:24:45,573 --> 00:24:48,212
No, I had sex with Spike.

316
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:51,966
I'm sorry if it bothers you.
You're my best friend.

317
00:24:52,053 --> 00:24:56,046
I am, and I always will be,
no matter what you do.

318
00:24:56,133 --> 00:25:00,046
I'm just trying to figure out
why this happened,

319
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:04,524
and I think, with your mom and everything,

320
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:10,047
everyone was being all sympathetic,
and making you feel weak.

321
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,124
And Spike wasn't like that.

322
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:16,968
So, just this one time, you just
did somethin' kinda crazy.

323
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:21,446
It wasn't one time. It was lots of times.
And lots of different ways.

324
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:23,968
- I could make sketches.
- No!

325
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:28,365
Buffy, there is something
seriously wrong here! I mean...

326
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:34,648
OK, yeah, you've been with a vampire before,
but Angel had a soul.

327
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:38,772
Angel's lame. His hair goes straight up
and he's bloody stupid.

328
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:41,287
OK...

329
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,126
Look, I just wanna help you.

330
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:48,488
- Let me help you.
- You're my best friend.

331
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:52,325
Yeah. Again, I really am, but...

332
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:54,490
You're recently gay.

333
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:57,809
Guys! Guys, wake up.

334
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:04,523
Xander, I was scared.
Are you hurt? What happened?

335
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:06,046
Guys...

336
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:09,443
- The demony kinds of guys. Buffy...
- Yes, that's me.

337
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:13,731
The guys that work for Glory, you said
they're like hobbits with leprosy?

338
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:17,567
A whole flock of hobbits just grabbed Spike.
They're taking him to Glory.

339
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:21,441
- But he knows about Dawn.
- We have to get him back.

340
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:24,362
So how do we find him?

341
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:29,489
I fight with weapons.

342
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:33,282
Yeah. I got nothin'.
Let's hit your place. We'll stock up.

343
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:36,730
- Tara, can you stay here and watch Dawn?
- Of course.

344
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:43,922
I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused.

345
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:50,088
I'm full of love, which is nice,
and love will lead me to my gift?

346
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:52,129
Yes.

347
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:56,889
I'm getting a gift? Or do you mean that
I have a gift to give to someone else?

348
00:26:57,213 --> 00:26:59,932
Death is your gift.

349
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,246
- Death...
- Is your gift.

350
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,643
OK. No. Death is not a gift.

351
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,122
My motherjust died. I know this.

352
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:15,727
If I have to kill demons because it makes
the world a better place, then I kill demons,

353
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,083
but it's not a gift to anybody.

354
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:21,085
Your question has been answered.

355
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:34,922
What the hell is that?
Why is its hair that colour?

356
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:38,642
- Stunning One, we believe he is...
- The Key!

357
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:43,291
Really? That's fantabulous!

358
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:46,524
And impossible. He can't be the Key.

359
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:50,483
Because, see, the Key has to be pure.

360
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:55,972
This is a vampire.
Lesson number one: vampires equal impure.

361
00:27:56,053 --> 00:28:00,729
Yeah, damn right I'm impure. I'm as impure
as the driven yellow snow. Let me go.

362
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:04,727
You can't even brain-suck a vampire.
He's completely useless.

363
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:06,769
So, I'm just gonna let myself out.

364
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:11,847
Your Unholiness, we observed the Slayer.
She protected this one above all others.

365
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:15,286
She treated him as precious.

366
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:18,643
Really? Precious?

367
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:22,648
Let's take a peek at you, precious.

368
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:26,684
Sod off.

369
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,450
- He doesn't look very fancy to me.
- Easy with the lip!

370
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:39,684
But if the Slayer protects him,

371
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:42,731
maybe appearances are deceiving.

372
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:50,132
Maybe there's something on the inside.

373
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:58,489
What do you know, precious?
What can I dig out of you?

374
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:05,611
This is my house.

375
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:09,686
If we're gonna stop Spike from blabbing
about Dawn, we're gonna need these.

376
00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:13,084
The big guns.

377
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:16,210
Only not guns. Shouldn't we have guns?

378
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:19,490
Those are my weapons.
Give me something big and sharp.

379
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:22,690
Buffy, where do we go?
Where shall we look for Glory?

380
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:25,367
She's a god. She wants the Key.

381
00:29:25,453 --> 00:29:27,842
Yeah, so we should look...?

382
00:29:28,813 --> 00:29:31,043
I don't know.

383
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,169
Why are you all looking at me?

384
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:35,608
OK, you shouldn't have to know everything.

385
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:37,763
We need to rescue Spike.

386
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:43,089
Buffy, I think you have more weapons
upstairs. Why don't you go get those?

387
00:29:43,173 --> 00:29:47,132
And maybe change your clothes.
You know, something more fighty.

388
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:50,132
I can do that. I'll be right back.

389
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:55,690
This has gone too far.
She thinks we're going to rescue Spike.

390
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:59,732
- What are we gonna do?
- Keep him from talking, whatever it takes.

391
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:03,647
- What do we do with Glory?
- Whatever we do, we'll need Buffy's help.

392
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:06,770
- Then we'll have to talk to her.
- Intervention time again?

393
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:08,969
Yeah, cos what we need now is a sane Buffy.

394
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:12,045
Whoa. Group hang time?

395
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:14,844
That was quick.

396
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:17,925
Didn't seem like it to me. Death is my gift.

397
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,324
Buffy, we need to talk.

398
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:25,770
- What's wrong? Is Dawn OK?
- Dawn's fine.

399
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:30,404
Buffy, we care about you, and we're worried.
The way you're acting, things you're doing...

400
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:33,963
- It's wrong.
- Wait. This shouldn't be about blame.

401
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:37,966
- Blame? There's blame now?
- No, there's only love.

402
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:39,884
And some fear.

403
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,567
Which is thrown by the
you-having-sex-with-Spike.

404
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:45,247
The who-whatting-how-with-huh?

405
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,131
OK, that's denial.
That usually comes before anger.

406
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,602
- I am not having sex with Spike!
- Anger.

407
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:53,762
No one is judging you. It's understandable.

408
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:57,892
Spike is strong, and mysterious,
and sort of compact but well-muscled.

409
00:30:57,973 --> 00:31:02,125
I am not having sex with Spike!
But I'm starting to think that you might be.

410
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:06,088
Buffy, I saw you. Anya too.

411
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:10,009
We saw you and Spike, with the straddling.

412
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:13,365
Spike's mine. Who's straddling Spike?

413
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:17,604
- Oh, my God.
- And so say all of us.

414
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:19,684
Say! Look at you.

415
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,527
You lookjust like me!
We're very pretty.

416
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:27,765
- Two of them!
- I know this. They're both Buffy.

417
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:30,722
No, she's a robot.

418
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:36,367
She acts like that girlfriend-bot Warren made.
You guys couldn't tell me apart from a robot?

419
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:39,409
I don't think I'm a robot.

420
00:31:39,493 --> 00:31:41,688
She's very well done.

421
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:45,531
Spike must have had her built
so he could program her...

422
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:48,605
- Oh, God.
- Yikes. Imagine the things...

423
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:51,685
- No! No imagining! Any of you.
- Already got the visual.

424
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:55,362
People, friends of mine,
you're forgetting the most important thing.

425
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:58,251
Glory has Spike and she's going to harm him.

426
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:02,927
- Glory has Spike?
- We were gonna bring that up.

427
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:06,449
- We were getting weapons.
- Grab 'em. We're going now.

428
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:08,649
I have to kill him.

429
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:12,926
- We don't even know where to look.
- I know where to start.

430
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:17,128
I have a riddle for you, precious.

431
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:21,331
How is a vampire that won't talk
like an apple?

432
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:30,811
Think I can do you in one long strip?

433
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,649
Enough.

434
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:35,724
No more.

435
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:39,412
I'll tell you who the sodding Key is.

436
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:48,562
Glory's Key-sniffing snake
was about here when I killed it.

437
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:52,771
- You think she lives around here?
- It's not a lot to go on.

438
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:56,163
- It's all we got.
- It's quite extraordinary, really.

439
00:32:56,253 --> 00:32:59,882
Thank you. But I think we should be
listening to the other Buffy, Guyles.

440
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:02,441
She's very smart
and she's gonna save Spike.

441
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:05,650
"Guyles"? Spike didn't even
program my name properly!

442
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,692
Listen, Skirt Girl, we are not
going to save him. We're going to kill him.

443
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:13,209
He knows who the Key is,
and there's no way he's not telling Glory.

444
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:15,363
You're right. He's evil.

445
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:19,123
But you should see him naked. I mean, really.

446
00:33:21,253 --> 00:33:24,802
OK, split up and spread out.
Check the priciest-Iooking places first.

447
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:28,602
Xander, you come with me. Willow,
Anya, stick together. And Guyles...

448
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:31,446
Giles, you can watch it.

449
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:42,882
Is that better?

450
00:33:42,973 --> 00:33:46,090
Do you think you can try to talk again now?

451
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:49,324
Good. Because I'm tired of these games!

452
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:54,965
"I need time. I need a drink." You're a needy
little bloodsucker, and it's not very attractive!

453
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:58,608
So start talkin'.

454
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:00,843
Yeah. OK.

455
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:03,524
The Key.

456
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:06,203
Here's the thing...

457
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:10,246
It's that guy, on TV...

458
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,806
- What's his name?
- On the television?

459
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:18,284
That show, the prize show,
where they guess what stuff costs?

460
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:21,482
- The Price Is Right?
- Bob Barker.

461
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:25,327
We will bring you Bob Barker. We will
bring the limp, beaten body of Bob...

462
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:28,086
It is not Bob Barker, scabby morons!

463
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,001
The Key is new to this world.

464
00:34:31,093 --> 00:34:33,891
And Bob Barker is as old as grit.

465
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:38,165
The vampire is lying to me.

466
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,652
Yeah, but it was fun.

467
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:48,648
And guess what, bitch.
I'm not telling you jack.

468
00:34:49,493 --> 00:34:51,723
You're never gonna get your sodding Key,

469
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:56,091
cos you might be strong,
but in our world, you're an idiot.

470
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,891
I am a god.

471
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,533
The god of what? Bad home perms?

472
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,605
Shut up! I command you, shut up!

473
00:35:04,693 --> 00:35:10,165
Yeah, OK. Sorry, but I just had no idea
that gods were such prancing lightweights.

474
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:17,849
Mark my words, the Slayer is going to kick
your skanky, lopsided ass

475
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,242
back to whatever place would take

476
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:26,772
a cheap, whorish,
fashion-victim ex-god like you.

477
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:34,569
- Good plan, Spike.
- Bring him back.

478
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:42,604
Here!

479
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,332
Oh, God.

480
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,683
You do not insult Glory by escaping.

481
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:18,844
The Slayer!

482
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,289
Buffy, we're here.

483
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,051
Spike! Spike's in there!

484
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:14,045
Buffy!

485
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:32,601
- The Slayer was there.
- A lethal fighter.

486
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:35,924
- She seemed to be everywhere!
- She had friends. With weapons.

487
00:37:36,013 --> 00:37:38,208
They may have been demons.

488
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:41,321
And where's my vampire?

489
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:55,252
Is it weird?

490
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,164
Yeah.

491
00:37:57,253 --> 00:37:59,608
At least it's not a very good copy.

492
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:02,287
I mean, look at it.

493
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:06,290
Yeah.

494
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:13,808
What did you guys do with Spike?
Please let the story have a dusty ending.

495
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:17,602
- We dumped him in his crypt.
- Tried to find out if he'd told her anything,

496
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:20,161
but he was too badly beaten
to make much sense.

497
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:24,132
Even if he told her,
he'd just lie to us about it anyway, right?

498
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:26,522
Yeah, you can count on it.

499
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:29,366
But I have to know. Now.

500
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:33,651
If he gave us up, Dawn and I need to get out
of town. She could be on her way right now.

501
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:38,011
But not to worry, you know.
I'm sure we'll all be perfectly safe.

502
00:38:38,613 --> 00:38:43,641
We're safe. Right. And Spike built
a robot Buffy to play chequers with.

503
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:47,053
It sounded convincing when I thought it.

504
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:49,610
I think I found somethin'.

505
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:55,649
Looks very complicated in there.
Personally, I'd rather look at guts.

506
00:38:55,733 --> 00:39:00,568
I found where she's broken.
Some of these wires got fried extra crispy.

507
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:02,928
It's an easy fix.

508
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:05,368
I mean, not that I would.

509
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:12,011
God, I feel kind of bad for the guy. Gets all
whupped, then his best toy gets taken away.

510
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:16,371
Xander, please don't be suggesting
what I'd have to kill you for suggesting.

511
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:21,846
No, no, travesty. Completely on board.
It's just the guy was so thrashed.

512
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:37,722
Spike! You're covered in sexy wounds.

513
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:43,844
Yeah.

514
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:47,608
I feel real sexy.

515
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:51,322
Where you been?

516
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:55,247
I fell down and got confused.
Willow fixed me. She's gay.

517
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:59,643
Will fixed you?
I'd have thought they'd melt you into scrap.

518
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:02,930
They were confused too.
Do you wanna ravage me now?

519
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:07,125
Give us a minute.
Got some bones need mending.

520
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:11,485
Why did you let that Glory hurt you?

521
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,685
She wanted to know who the Key was.

522
00:40:14,773 --> 00:40:18,049
- Well, I can tell her, and then you...
- No!

523
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:23,643
You can't ever. Glory never finds out.

524
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:25,406
Why?

525
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,089
Cos Buffy,

526
00:40:28,173 --> 00:40:30,971
the other, not-so-pleasant Buffy...

527
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:34,806
Anything happened to Dawn, it'd destroy her.

528
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:38,723
I couldn't live, her bein' in that much pain.

529
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,691
I'd let Glory kill me first.

530
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,650
Nearly bloody did.

531
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:10,684
And my robot?

532
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,841
The robot is gone.
The robot was gross and obscene.

533
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,367
- It wasn't supposed to...
- Don't.

534
00:41:19,453 --> 00:41:22,843
That thing, it wasn't even real.

535
00:41:32,933 --> 00:41:35,731
What you did for me and Dawn...

536
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:38,604
that was real.

537
00:41:42,573 --> 00:41:44,768
I won't forget it.

538
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,928
