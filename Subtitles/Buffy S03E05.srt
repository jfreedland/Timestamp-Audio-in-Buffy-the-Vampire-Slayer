00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:06,622
Cordelia:
I think we should get a limo.

2
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:08,562
A limo?
A big. Expensive limo?

3
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:09,860
That sounds like fun.

4
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,629
And it is our last
homecoming dance.

5
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:13,567
so maybe we should make
a big deal of it.

6
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:16,128
You want to talk fun?
Public bus.

7
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:18,732
You meet the funnest people.
Back me up here. Oz.

8
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,505
If it's a dollar issue.
we could all take my van.

9
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,481
Van? The homecoming queen
doesn't go to the dance in a van.

10
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:26,675
Use your head.

11
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:28,719
Technically. You haven't
been elected yet...

12
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,811
although you certainly
and without a doubt will be.

13
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:32,321
Who else likes a limo?

14
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,823
A private limo!

15
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:35,791
It is pretty... cuddlesome.

16
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,829
And if we all split the cost...

17
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:41,158
Um... maybe.

18
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:43,257
You know.
if I go and all.

19
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,201
Why wouldn't you go?
You already have your tickets.

20
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,205
Unless you don't
have a da-ay or two...

21
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:50,706
to think about it.

22
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,970
We should all think about it.

23
00:00:53,043 --> 00:00:57,446
What's going on here? Did Scott not
ask her to the homecoming dance yet?

24
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,780
Thanks. Cordelia.
Humiliation's really good for my color.

25
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:03,217
Oh. Um... well. No.
I just...

26
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:06,688
assumed that you would think
it was corny or something.

27
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:10,249
but I'm in... I mean.
if you are. If you want to.

28
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:13,626
Uh. Sure... I do.
You know. If you want to.

29
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:16,029
Scott:
I do if you want to.

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,398
The judges will accept that
as a yes.

31
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:21,563
Do you want me to get you
another drink?

32
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:23,436
Um... no. Actually.

33
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:25,441
Uh... I'm a little tired.

34
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:28,307
I think I'm gonna call it a night.

35
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,745
But I'm excited
about the dance.

36
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:31,941
Me too.

Here.

42
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:18,286
How are you feeling?

43
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:21,789
It hurts...

44
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:24,764
less.

45
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:27,534
Good.

46
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:42,811
I haven't told Giles
and the others...

47
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:44,821
that you're back.

48
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,254
Giles...

49
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:49,992
And I'm not going to.

50
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:56,166
They wouldn't understand
that you're... better.

51
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:59,566
And I'm gonna keep helping you
get better.

52
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:03,763
It's just that everything's
different now.

I'm a senior.

54
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:09,873
I'm really working harder
in school.

55
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:12,381
I'm even thinking about college.

56
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,613
And I'm involved with someone.

57
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:35,638
His name is Scott.

58
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,532
He's a nice. Solid guy.

59
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:44,545
He makes me happy...

60
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:47,243
and that's what I need...

61
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:49,286
someone I can count on.

62
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:54,153
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

63
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:57,426
You don't?

64
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:03,031
When did this happen?
Where was I?

full of life.
like a force of nature.

68
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,577
Now you just seem distracted
all the time. And...

69
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,613
I'm getting better.
Honest.

70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,614
In fact. From here on.

71
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:21,412
you are gonna see
a drastic distraction reduction.

72
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:26,414
"Drastic distraction reduction."

73
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,924
Try saying that 10 times fast.

74
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:30,984
I'm really sorry.

75
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,621

I'm sorry to bother you. Sir.

00:06:58,391 --> 00:06:59,824
I'm not bothered. Allan.

81
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:03,725
Well. I'm not sure
how serious this is.

82
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:06,663
but they were spotted
in town three days ago.

83
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,166
I've just been informed.

84
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:11,226
Frederick and
Hans Gruenshtahler...

of flight 1402...

87
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:19,210
I should have brought it
to your attention sooner.

88
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,407
but I'd-I'd wanted to confirm...

89
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,578
Would you show me
your hands. Please?

90
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:27,711
Sir?

91
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:30,288
Your hands.

92
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:40,494
I think they could be cleaner.

93
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,661
Of course. Sir.
I mean. I washed them. But...

94
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:48,031
After every meal
and under your fingernails.

95
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:52,009
Dirt gets trapped there
and germs and mayonnaise.

96
00:07:52,078 --> 00:07:53,739
My dear mother said.

97
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:57,442
"Cleanliness is next to godliness."
and I believed her.

98
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:59,644
She never caught a cold.

99
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:03,211
I'd like these two to be
put under surveillance.

100
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:07,225
and I'd like to know if any other
colorful characters have come to town.

101
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:09,318
I'll take care of it.

You have all my faith.

103
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:35,719

makes Oz go. "Oh."

No problem.
I got the tux goin' on.

106
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:43,693

00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:45,128
Whatcha doin'?

108
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:49,225

use the phrase... competition.

especially those with
a letterman's jacket and a car.

113
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,137
She could give me a run.

114
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:03,580
Where's Buffy? She's gonna
miss the yearbook pictures.

115
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,915
Buffy and Faith are in the library
getting all sweaty.

116
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:08,317
They're training.

117
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:09,685
I stand by my phrase.

118
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:11,951
I don't think she was here
the day they announced them.

119
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:13,492
Did anybody tell her?

120
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,890
I'll tell her now.

121
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,861
I have to go to the nurse's office
for an ice pack anyway.

122
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:17,861
Did you hurt yourself?

123
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,954
No. Silly.

124
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:21,330
It shrinks the pores.

126
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:30,637
Man! Guys should break up
with you more often.

127
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,904
Gee. Thank you.

128
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:34,276

got some quality rage going.

Well. Screw him. All right?

133
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:44,919
You move on. And... you party heavily.
and you'll be fine.

134
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,720
You're still going
to that dance. Right?

135
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:47,987
Maybe.

136
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:50,894
You got the tix already.
Why don't we go together?

137
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:52,794
I don't know about that.

138
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:55,095
Come on. We'll find a couple studs.
we'll use them and...

139
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:56,294
discard them.

140
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:57,529
That's always fun.

141
00:09:57,603 --> 00:09:59,400
OK. I'm in.

142
00:09:59,472 --> 00:10:01,906
Not the stud-using part.

143
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:03,874

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,914
Uh. Bobby. Mashad.

you don't write.

148
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:26,931
I'm so glad that
I ran into you.

149
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:29,524
I had this little incident
last year...

150
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:31,570
of getting kicked out of school.

151
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,229
and I'm back now. Though.

152

153

but I still need one written
recommendation from a teacher...

154
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:41,809
I think the word that Principal Snyder
used was "glowing..."

155
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:45,214
to put in my file so I can prove
that I belong here.

156

00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,791
I sat by the window.

Your class...

161
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:58,057

to Maya Angelou.

165
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:12,570
Cordelia: Hi. I hope you'll
consider me for homecoming queen.

166
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:16,414
I can't believe it.

167
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:20,418
My favorite teacher. And she
didn't even remember who I was.

168
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:22,351
I'm like a nonperson.

169
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:25,391
Am I invisible?
Can you see me?

I was fiesta queen.

172
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:33,231
I was on the cheerleading squad.

173
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,200
The yearbook was. Like.
a story of me.

174
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,033
Now it's senior year. And I'm going
to be one crappy picture...

175
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,437
on 1/8 of one crappy page.

176
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:43,941
Uh. No. Actually. You're not.

177
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,637
What do you mean?

178
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:48,441
Well. You missed the picture-taking.

179
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:49,947
When? Why?

180
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,916
Oz:
We did them yesterday.

181
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:53,849
Willow:
Didn't Cordelia tell you?

182
00:11:55,822 --> 00:11:57,289
Thanks for your support.

183
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:59,881
Buffy. You look so cute
in that outfit.

184
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,722
I'm not voting for you.

185
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:03,213
Then make it snappy.

186
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:05,814
How come you didn't tell me they
were doing the yearbook pictures?

187
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:08,908
Didn't I? Oh. I guess I forgot.
What's the big?

188
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:11,749
It's just... you could've thought
about somebody else...

189
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:13,585
for 30 seconds. That's all.

190
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,989
Hey. I am under
a lot of pressure here.

191
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,619
Oh. Yeah. Campaigning.
Rough gig.

192
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,219
What would you know about it?

193
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:22,492
Just because you were guacamole queen
when you were three...

194
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,796
doesn't mean you understand
how this works.

195
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:28,269
Obviously. It involves handing out
entirely lame flyers.

196
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:30,829
No. It involves being part
of this school...

197
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:32,340
and having actual friends.

198
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:36,441
Now. If it was about monsters.
blood. And innards.

199
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:38,447
then you'd be a shoo-in.

200
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:42,076
I'd like to see you
try to win the crown.

201
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,517
You would?

202
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:44,747
[Sighs]

203
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:47,983
Then you will.

204
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,026
What does that mean?

205
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:52,561
I'm gonna show you
how it's done.

206
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:55,996
I'm gonna run for homecoming queen.
and I'm going to win.

207
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,364
This is starting to be sad.

208
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:01,893
Sorry. Cordy. But you have no idea
who you're messing with.

209
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:03,633
What? The slayer?

210
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:06,141
I'm not talking about the slayer.

211
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:07,676
I'm talking about Buffy.

212
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:11,236
You've awakened
the prom queen within.

213
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:13,748
and that crown
is going to be mine.

214
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:16,911
Man:
Competition.

215
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,751
Competition is a beautiful thing.

216
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:23,258
It makes us strive.

217
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:26,056
It... makes us accomplish.

218
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,120
Occasionally. It makes us kill.

219
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,133
We all have the desire to win.

220
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:32,634
whether we're human...

221
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,562
vampire...

222
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,774
and whatever the hell
you are. My brother.

223
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:41,777
You got them spiny-looking
head things.

224
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,779
I ain't never seen them before.

225
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:46,816
I am Kulak of the Miquot clan.

226
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:49,451
Isn't that nice.

227
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,250
Point is. You're all here
for the same reason.

228
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:56,349
It sure ain't no
philosophy class now. Is it?

229
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:58,519
Mr. Gorch.
my account statement says...

230
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:00,893
that your deposit
has not yet been made.

231
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:02,397
Me and Candy...

232
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,797
we blown our whole
honeymoon stash...

233
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:06,733
on this little game here.

234
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:10,237
They're dirty.

235
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,672
They're nonconsecutive.

236
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:17,544
The games will begin
in a few days' time.

237
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:20,549
The first target... Buffy...
you've all seen.

238
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:23,745
The second... Faith...
is a little more elusive.

239
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,018
But they will both be together
and ready for the killing.

240
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:32,152
and that is
a money-back guarantee.

241
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,992
Ladies. Gentlemen.

242
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:37,693
spiny-headed looking creatures...

243
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:42,727
welcome to SlayerFest '98.

244
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:53,141
What do you think of this?

245
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:56,646
Nice.

246
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,120
It's my first big dance.
you know?

247
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,623
Where there's a boy and a band...

248
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:04,125
and not just me
alone in my room...

249
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,560
pretending that there's
a boy and a band.

250
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,063
- I just want it to be...
- Special.

251
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:12,067
That's why I spared no expense
on the tux.

252
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:15,502
The tux? I thought you borrowed it
from your cousin Rigby.

253
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:17,540
Expense to my pride. Wil.

254
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:20,838
They're our only relations
with money. And they shun us...

255
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,343
as they should.

256
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:27,608
What do you think about this?

257
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,550
Nice.

258
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,660
What?

259
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:41,162
I was just...

260
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,426
Remember the eighth-grade cotillion?

261
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,400
You had that clip-on.

262
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:48,301
I was pretty stylin'
with the clip-on.

263
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:51,101
And now here we are.
and it's homecoming.

264
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:52,937
We should face it. Wil.

265
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,910
You and I are gonna be
in neighboring rest homes...

266
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,607
while I come over so
you can adjust my...

267
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,114
my. Uh...

268
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:03,448
Well. I can't think of anything
that's not really gross.

269
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:10,125
So. Uh... you and Oz.

270
00:16:10,193 --> 00:16:12,127
How do I put this?

271
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:15,824
Are we on first. Second.
or. Uh...

272
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,332
"Ye gods?"

273
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,392
That's none of your business.
Alexander Harris.

274
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,461
Ohh... rounding second.

275
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:24,268
You don't know that.

276
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,604
What about you and Cordelia?

277
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:30,077
Oh. A gentleman never talks
about his conquests.

278
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:33,343
Oh. Yeah? Well. Since when
did you become a...

279
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:37,944
gentleman?

280
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:41,889
I... I know. "Nice."

281
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:45,319
I was gonna go with "gorgeous."

282
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:48,594
Really?

283
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:50,428
You too.

284
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,468
In... In a guy way.

285
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:56,401
Oz is very lucky.

286
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:01,570
So is Cordelia...
in a girl way.

287
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:05,477
I don't know if I can dance in this.

288
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:07,675
I don't know if I can dace:

289
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,684
Come on.
Piece of cake.

290
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,014
Here.

291
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,657
Well. That seems to...

292
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:23,257
Yeah. This shouldn't
be a problem.

293
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,925
No.

294
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:28,060
No problem.

295
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,585
That didn't just happen!

296
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:48,488
No! I mean. It did.
but it didn't.

297
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,686
Because I respect you... and Oz...
and I would never...

298
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:55,492
I would never. Either.
It must be the clothes. It's a fluke.

299
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:58,398
It's a clothes fluke. That's what it is.
There'll be no more fluking.

300
00:17:58,468 --> 00:17:59,526
Not ever.

301
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,604
We got to get out
of these clothes.

302
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:03,866
Right now.

303
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,066
Oh. I didn't mean...

304
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:06,267
I didn't...
Me. Either!

305
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,240
Buffy:
A campaign is like a war.

306
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:10,241
It's won or lost
in the trenches.

307
00:18:10,374 --> 00:18:11,272
Holly. Michelle.

308
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:13,071
and our real competition. Cordelia.

309
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:14,907
all have big head starts.

310
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:16,378
Speaking of big heads.

311
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,644
if I had a watermelon
as big as Cordelia's. I'd be rich.

312
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:23,177
Waits for laugh...

313
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:27,480
OK. You're right.
Making fun of the competition...

314
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:29,219
only makes me seem petty.

315
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:31,488
Now. This is just like
any other popularity contest.

316
00:18:31,562 --> 00:18:33,860
I've done this before.
The only difference being...

317
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:36,092
this time.
I'm not actually popular.

318
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,101
Although. I'm not
exactly unpopular.

319
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,661
A lot of people came to
my welcome home party.

320
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,229
But they were killed
by zombies.

321
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:44,239
Good point.

322
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:45,673
OK. Here's the plan.

323
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:48,007
Willow. I need you
to make a database.

324
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,376
See who's for us.

325
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:52,678
who's on the fence. And where
our real crisis areas are.

326
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,218
Oz. You take the fringe...
musicians.

327
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:57,117
those not normally
inclined to vote.

328
00:18:57,188 --> 00:18:59,383
Xander. What...

329
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:02,085
Uh. Cordelia.
OK. Iook.

330
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,717
I know this is
a little awkward.

331
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:06,354
but I don't see any reason
why we all can't get along...

332
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,364
during this campaign time.

333
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:10,093
I mean. We're...

334
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,566
almost friends.

335
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:14,036
and we are all
riding together in the limo.

336
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:17,666
Yeah. Great.
Willow. How's that database coming?

337
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:21,269
Uh. It's... just about done.

338
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,642
Xander?

339
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:25,204
I got your new flyers.

340
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,682
Let's get cracking.

341
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:32,384
She's my girlfriend.

342
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:38,026
It's just that... she needs it
so much more than you do.

343
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:43,456
As Willow goes.
so goes my nation.

344
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:45,229
Thanks for what you said. Buffy.

345
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:47,362
I think we're getting
along great. Don't you?

346
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:05,121
Seems like a lot of fuss
for one little title.

347
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:09,125
Well. You know. It's no fun
if you don't try your best.

348
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:12,685
As long as fun
is still in the mix.

349
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:13,889
Sure.

350
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:16,763
It's not like anyone takes it
that seriously.

351
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:31,975
Well. I don't
wanna be president

352
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,917
Superman or Clark Kent

353

turns out for her.

you two did.

Cordelia together.

some temporary insanity...

I loved him.

get the chance to tell him.

you're not a man... exactly.

707
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:24,530
Mr. Trick. I've been the mayor
for quite some time.

708
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:26,729
I like things to run smoothly.

709
00:41:26,805 --> 00:41:29,501
This is a very important year
for me.

710
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:30,700
Election year.

711
00:41:30,775 --> 00:41:32,470
Something like that.

712
00:41:32,544 --> 00:41:34,603
If this is the point
where you tell me...

713
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,738
that I don't fit in here
in your quiet little neighborhood.

714
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:38,840
you can just skip it
'cause. See.

715
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:41,078
that all got old long
before I became a vampire.

716
00:41:41,152 --> 00:41:43,052
Do you know what I'm saying?

717
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,645
Do you have children?

718
00:41:45,757 --> 00:41:48,817
Children are the heart
of a community.

719
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:51,862
They need to be looked after...
controlled.

720
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,889
The more rebellious element
needs to be dealt with.

721
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,935
The children are our future.

722
00:41:58,002 --> 00:41:59,902
We need them.

723
00:41:59,971 --> 00:42:01,871
I need them.

724
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,535
If this rebellious element
means who I think it does.

725
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,205
then that problem may be
taken care of this very night.

726
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,713
So I've heard.

727
00:42:10,782 --> 00:42:13,580
That's a very enterprising idea
you have... SlayerFest.

728
00:42:13,651 --> 00:42:16,415
I love that name. By the way.

729
00:42:16,488 --> 00:42:20,857
You see. That's the kind
of initiative I need on my team.

730
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:23,018
What if I don't want to be
a part of the team?

731
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:26,029
Oh. No. That won't be an issue.

732
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:31,468
See. You and I are gonna
get along very well.

733
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:33,026
Moist towelette?

734
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:39,404
Hey. Guys. The moment
we've all been waiting for.

735
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:43,180
They're gonna announce the queen.

736
00:42:43,248 --> 00:42:45,182
Where are they?
What's keeping them?

737
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,218
I'm gonna go with mud wrestling.

738
00:42:50,522 --> 00:42:53,616
Oh. God! What did you two
do to each other?

739
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:56,353
- Long story.
- Got hunted.

740
00:42:56,428 --> 00:42:58,055
Apparently not that long.

741
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:01,395
Tell you one thing. Though...

742
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:03,400
you don't want to
mess with Cordelia.

743
00:43:03,468 --> 00:43:06,301
[Laughs]
No.

744
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:07,929
In this envelope.

745
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:11,806
I hold the name of
this year's homecoming queen.

746
00:43:11,876 --> 00:43:14,310
After all that we've
been through tonight.

747
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:17,348
this whole who-gets-to-be-queen capade
seems pretty...

748
00:43:17,415 --> 00:43:19,349
- Damn important.
- Oh. Yeah.

749
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:21,476
And the winner is...

750
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:31,161
Hey. I believe we have a first
for Sunnydale High.

751
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:32,628
We have a tie.

752
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:36,531
The winners are Holly Charleston
and Michelle Blake.

753
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:38,091
[Applause]

754
00:43:49,747 --> 00:43:52,807
I'm just so honored!

755
00:43:52,884 --> 00:43:54,283
I can't believe it!

756
00:43:54,352 --> 00:43:57,219
I mean. That you would
pick me... or us...

757
00:43:57,288 --> 00:43:59,222
out of every girl
in the whole school!

758
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,623
It's just...
It's so wonderful!

759
00:44:02,694 --> 00:44:06,562
I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry.
[Crying]

760
00:44:38,897 --> 00:44:41,331
[Growling]
