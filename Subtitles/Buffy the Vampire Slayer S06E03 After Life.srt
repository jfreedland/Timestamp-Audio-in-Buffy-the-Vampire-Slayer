1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,594
- Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
- I love you.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,837
The only chance you had with me
was when I was unconscious.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,395
Buffy. No.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,675
No.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,037
- Raising the dead, it feels wrong.
- It is wrong.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,038
She could be trapped.
I'm not gonna leave her there.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,355
Osiris, master of all fate...

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,596
Let her cross over.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,311
- Buffy?
- What's wrong with her?

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,237
- She's in shock.
- Who are they?

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,557
Road pirates. They raid towns,
use 'em up, burn 'em down.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,111
You're alive, and you're home.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,879
You're home.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,950
She's at home. She has to be.
We need to get there, and she'll be there.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,878
- This is the fastest way?
- Absolutely.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,117
I've done a lot of fleeing.
I know all the shortcuts.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,516
Look, fire. Fire is rarely
a sign of imminent safety.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,519
- I wish we were there already.
- Don't worry, I'll get us there just fine.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,871
My senses are primed for danger.
Nothing is gonna...

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,470
I'm OK. Four. Four limbs.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,398
At least the demons almost
hit you on their way out of town.

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,469
Yeah, now that their leader's gone they
seem to be making with the big skedaddle.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,188
It was Buffy, right?
We saw her and it was really Buffy?

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,518
I think we screwed it up. She's broken.

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,155
No. She's not broken.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,593
She's just disoriented from being
tormented in some hell dimension.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,554
Probably tortured and... It's, like,

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,231
we don't even know how much time
has passed there for her, possibly years.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,193
That's not something you just get over.

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,676
Oh, my God. What if she never gets over it?

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,559
- And you think of this now?
- What are you thinking?

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,356
That she's not right,
or maybe, like, dangerous?

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,110
Home. See? You're back home.

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,676
We're all OK now.

35

36
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,438
- It's different.
- A little.

37
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,836
Willow and Tara live here now,
and we didn't do much.

38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,076
We moved some of the chairs, and
took out some of the little tables, but...

39
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,673
This is the same. Except the computer stuff.

40
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,832
That's Willow's, obviously.
We eat at the other end...

41
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,790
Obviously.

42
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,116
There you are.

43
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,434
Knew you were under that dirt somewhere.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,679
You remember what Mom used to say?
"Either wash that neck or plant potatoes. "

45
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,519
Yeah, I never thought it was funny either.

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,515
You want to button that, or...?

47
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,513
- We'll take care of that after.
- OK.

48
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,513
Here, I'll do the shirt.

49
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,949
And then we'll do your hands.

50
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,556
See how nice you look?

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,156
Mom's room.

52
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,509
I know. It's really different now.

53
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,557
Willow and Tara. This is their room?

54
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,671
Yeah, well, it seemed to make the most sense.
No one was using it, and it's the biggest.

55
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,555
But, you know, now that you're here,
we'll have to figure out something to do.

56
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,436
Buffy.

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,074
You wanna, like, stop?

58
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,991
We can sit down and talk.

59
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,429
What else is different?

60
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,079
Do you mean about the house, or...?

61
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,438
Let's see. Giles.

62
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,634
It's so weird. He left today.

63
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,200
Because you were... He'll come right back.
I'll call him. Someone'll call him.

64
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,429
- What...?
- What what?

65
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,191
What will you say to him?

66
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,990
- What was that?
- It's OK. It's OK.

67
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,873
Dawn! Dawn! Are you there?

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,798
It's just Spike. I'm here!

69
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,438
Thank God. You scared me
half to death - or more to death.

70
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,790
- You... I could kill you.
- Spike.

71
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,955
I mean it. I could rip your head off
one-handed and drink from your brain stem.

72
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,551
- Look.
- Yeah?

73
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,753
I've seen the bloody bot before.
Didn't think she'd patch up so...

74
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,156
She's kind of...

75
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,432
She's been through a lot

76
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,755
with the death.

77
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,036
But I think she's OK.

78
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,914
Spike? Are you OK?

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,956
I'm...

80
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,073
- What did you do?
- Me?

81
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,436
Nothing.

82
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,549
Her hands.

83
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,593
I was gonna fix 'em.
I don't know how they got like that.

84
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,072
I do. Clawed her way
out of a coffin, that's how.

85
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,156
Isn't that right?

86
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,917
Yeah.

87
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,156
That's what I had to do.

88
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,916
Done it myself.

89
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,350
We'll take care of you. Come here.

90
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,673
- Get some stuff. Mercurochrome, bandages.
- OK.

91
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,875
How long was I gone?

92
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,476
- 147 days, yesterday.

93
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,316
- 148 today.

94
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,155
Except today doesn't count, does it?

95
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,512
How long was it for you, where you were?

96
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,076
Longer.

97
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,714
- I got the stuff.
- Is she here?

98
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,910
- She's here.
- We didn't know where you were.

99
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,838
- You ran away.
- Buffy, are you OK?

100
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,154
You knew she was back?

101
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,392
- How did you know?
- You're not a zombie, are you?

102
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,999
Anya!

103
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,078
- What do you know about what happened?
- Hey! Back off!

104
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,637
You did this. What did you do?

105
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,913
- A spell. We did a spell.
- We didn't think it worked.

106
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,670
- Is she going to be OK?
- I'm OK. I'm gonna be fine.

107
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,237
I remember. You brought me back.

108
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,715
- What was it like?
- I can't...

109
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,152
It's OK. You don't have to
talk about this, Buff.

110
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,829
Hey, do you want somethin'?
Anything. Pizza. I'll get you pizza.

111
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,669
- Buffy likes pizza.
- She doesn't want pizza.

112
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
Guys! Back off.

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,107
Right. Dawn's right.
We should just be quiet,

114
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:47,996
and let Buffy tell us what she needs.

115
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,314
I think I just wanna go to sleep.

116
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,950
- That's a good idea. You should sleep.
- Right. Long day.

117
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,992
But, Buffy, be happy.

118
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,112
We got you out. We really did it.

119
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,869
- Tired.
- Well, yeah.

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,120
I mean, jet lag from Hell has gotta be,
you know, jet lag from Hell.

121
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,317
- My room is still...?
- Yeah. Yes. It's your room.

122
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,795
Well, she's fine. Normal.
She used to go to bed all the time.

123
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,796
I think Willow's wrong.

124
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,073
I don't think she's particularly normal at all.

125
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,424
Well, she just got back. Give it time.

126
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,591
I bet in a week she'll be
our little Bufferin again.

127
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,510
Oh, yes. Six or seven days is all you really
need to get over eternal hell experiences.

128
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,596
Who's that? Spike?

129
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,790
What are you doin' out here?

130
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,392
I hope you're not gonna start your little
obsession now that she's around again.

131
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,954
- Hey!
- You didn't tell me.

132
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,878
You brought her back and you didn't tell me.

133
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,152
- Well, now you know.
- I worked beside you all summer.

134
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,716
We didn't tell you.

135
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,509
It was just... We didn't, OK?

136
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,393
Listen. I've figured it out.

137
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,628
Maybe you haven't, but I have.

138
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,389
Willow knew there was a chance
that she'd come back wrong.

139
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,749
So wrong that you'd have to...

140
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,351
That she would have to get rid of
what came back. And I wouldn't let her.

141
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,438
If any part of that was Buffy,
I wouldn't let her.

142
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,516
And that's why she shut me out.

143
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,833
What are you talkin' about?
Willow wouldn't do that.

144
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,315
Oh. Is that right?

145
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,798
Look... You're just covering.
Don't tell me you're not happy.

146
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,071
Look me in the eyes, and tell me
when you saw Buffy alive,

147
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,510
that wasn't the happiest moment
of your entire existence.

148
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,715
That's the thing about magic.

149
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,400
There's always consequences.

150
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,317
Always!

151
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,718
- Hey.
- So did you get through to London?

152
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,879
Yeah. He's gonna head back
as soon as he can.

153
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,514
I'm not sure, like, maybe a couple of days.

154
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,155
How did he take it?

155
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,795
I'm not sure. I mean, glad,

156
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,595
but kinda weirded out.
Which I get, you know?

157
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,870
Lots of "dear Lords".

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,629
And I think I actually heard him
clean his glasses.

159
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,276
Are you worried?

160
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,473
Worried? Tara, it worked fine.
It's all good.

161
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,394
Hey, Will, this is me.

162
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,512
It doesn't all have to be "good" and "fine".

163
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,235
This is the room where
you don't have to be brave.

164
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,830
And I still love you.
If you're worried, you can be worried.

165
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,749
Well, I'm not unworried.

166
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,271
I mean, what happened, that was intense.

167
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,920
That's gotta change you.

168
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,393
When Angel came back,
Buffy said he was wild.

169
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,709
Like an animal.

170
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,796
Buffy's not like that.

171
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,869
- Yeah.
- But?

172
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,356
It's just kinda noisy
up here tonight, you know?

173
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,756
Yeah?

174
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,676
Is this better?

175
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,359
Yeah.
I think it makes things quieter in here.

176
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,110
You know what I think?

177
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,959
I think we all just assumed crash positions.

178
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
It's like...

179
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,394
we were all tensed up,
like we were expecting it to screw up.

180
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,830
We weren't prepared for it
to actually go right.

181
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,516
Yeah.

182
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,116
- Tara?
- Yeah?

183
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,316
If things did go right,

184
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,914
wouldn't you think she'd be

185
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,310
happier?

186
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,117
Like, wouldn't you think she would be
so happy that we brought her out?

187
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,716
Sure she is.

188
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,355
You thought she'd say thanks.

189
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,476
Be more grateful.

190
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,639
Would I be a terrible person
if I said "yes"?

191
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,998
Give her time. She'll get there.

192
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,118
Right.

193
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,198
No need to be in a big furry hurry.

194
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,113
Exactly.

195
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,796
I'm sure it's OK.

196
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,277
- Buffy?
- What did you do?

197
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,358
Do you know what you did?
You're like children.

198
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,633
Your hands smell of death. Bitches!

199
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,877
Filthy little bitches, rattling the bones.

200
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,037
Did you cut the throat?
Did you pat its head?

201
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,914
- The blood dried on your hands, didn't it?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

202
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,556
You were stained! You still are.
I know what you did!

203
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,477
The glass. There's no glass.

204
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,557
- OK, what in the frilly heck is goin' on?
- Maybe we dreamed it.

205
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,591
Right. Right.

206
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,280
- Wrong. Different brains.
- Oh, yeah.

207
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,875
Well, what was it talking about?
Did you understand it?

208
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,833
Well, I understood the words, but... No.

209
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,989
- What was that?
- There's something in the house.

210
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,669
What is it after? Is it Buffy?

211
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,380
I don't know.

212
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:54,430
That's it, I'm gonna call.
I hope Xander's up.

213
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,717
Xander, are you up? I can't sleep.

214
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,910
Play a word game with me.

215
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,351
Xander, are you awake?

216
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,439
OK, I'm gonna describe an adjective
with accurate but misleading clues,

217
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,755
and then you have to guess what it is.

218
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,956
Xander? Xander?

219
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,469
Huh? What? Do what?

220
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,556
That oughta do it.

221
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,272
- Hello?
- Xander, it's me, Willow.

222
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,789
We were just attacked.

223
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,354
Attacked? A vampire?

224
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,597
No, it was Buffy.
Or something that looked like her.

225
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,475
Like she was possessed. Then she just
disappeared, and we saw something a bit...

226
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,509
- There's something in the house.
- In the house?

227
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,633
All right, Willow, you need to get
outta there. Just get everyone out.

228
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,433
Wake up Buffy and Dawn.
Don't make a big deal...

229
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,595
Anya!

230
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,870
- Anya!
- Xander?

231
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,156
Xander!

232
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,993
Very bad. Very, very, very bad. Bad.

233
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,076
He's all traumatised.

234
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,272
Whatever it is,
it's not the traditional haunting,

235
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,598
because it's not limited
to one specific place,

236
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,191
and there's not, you know, a dead person.

237
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,434
- Not any more.
- I bet it's a hitchhiker.

238
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,553
- A hitchhiker?
- Standard way to travel through dimensions.

239
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,992
Some demon-thing sees someone moving
between worlds, and grabs on for the ride.

240
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,193
You mean like some hell-beastie
rode in with Buffy?

241
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,880
Like we're responsible for this?

242
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,358
- Assume crash positions.
- We shouldn't have brought Buffy back.

243
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,869
I knew it was gonna end badly.
I should've said so.

244
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,865
OK, fine, but what are we gonna do?

245
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,391
I'm feelin' the need
for some vigorous doin'.

246
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,231
It's OK. We just kill the beastie and then
all is good. We're rolling in puppies!

247
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,798
- Right?
- Can we do that? Kill it?

248
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,914
- Are we killing somethin'?
- Buffy! You're not supposed to be up.

249
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,508
How are you feeling? Are you OK?

250
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,679
- So what are we killing?
- A demon you brought back with you.

251
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,676
- Oh.
- It's not like she's making it sound.

252
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,713
A little haunting-type stuff.
Boo, scary. Everything's normal.

253
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,878
You shouldn't worry about it.

254
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,232
I remembered something last night.

255
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,274
Buff?

256
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,836
The photographs. Of us.

257
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,838
- They changed.
- How did they change?

258
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,795
They were dead.

259
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,798
I mean, we were dead.

260
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,196
Like, dead bodies?

261
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,550
But then they were OK.

262
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,196
So, I just, you know, figured it was me.
That I was going crazy.

263
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,832
Well, maybe you are. Going crazy. From Hell.

264
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,035
No. You're fine.

265
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,709
You are. And, Buffy, we're so glad.

266
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,752
Yeah. This thing,
this haunting thing, we'll fix it,

267
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,758
and then we'll still
have you back, which is...

268
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,154
- It's so important.
- Yes.

269
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,589
It's wonderful.

270
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,112
We should get to work.

271
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,112
- What's the list?
- Possible hitchhikers.

272
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,755
Demons that might have come
outta Hell at the same time Buffy did.

273
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,557
"Skaggmore demons, Trellbane demons,
Skitterers, Large and Small Bone-Eaters".

274
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,955
I say we go with
the Small Bone-Eaters.

275
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,153
Well, that just means they prefer
to eat things with small bones, like you.

276
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,431
That's just what we have so far:
five species of demons

277
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,313
that have been known to move
transdimensionally.

278
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,480
Two of them may be invisible
in this dimension,

279
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,354
and two others can perform spells
to alter perception.

280
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,836
That's four. What's the other one like?

281
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,633
Like the others,
only dripping with viscous fluid.

282
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,791
So, should we concentrate on how to kill
those, or should we try to find more?

283
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,153
I'm not sure. Maybe some of us can
keep going finding more, and the others...

284
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,475
I miss Giles.

285
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,239
He's coming back. I talked to him.

286
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,115
I know I'm a kind of poor substitute,
but until then, we'll get it done.

287
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,716
I think I should patrol.

288
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,152
I know we'll find something soon.

289
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,271
Yeah.

290
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,356
- Do you want us to go with you?
- We can do that.

291
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,516
No. I need to go.

292
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,550
- Sorry.
- You should go.

293
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,190
I'll be safe here with the others.
Don't worry about me.

294
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,996
I found one of those 24-hour places
for coffee. Remember that bookstore?

295
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,159
They became one of those books-and-coffee
places, and now they're just coffee.

296
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,113
It's like evolution
without the getting-better part.

297
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,631
Coffee, coffee, coffee,
hot chocolate for Dawn.

298
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,638
- You're too young for coffee.
- Idiot.

299
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,276
You can have my coffee.

300
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,269
All of you did it. You stupid children.
Did you think the blood wouldn't reach you?

301
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,439
I smell the death on you.
Look at what you've done!

302
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,429
- Fire! Fire! Fire!
- Dawn!

303
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,799
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

304
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,236
That was it. Like Buffy, with fire.

305
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,116
- Is she OK?
- Did I look like that? I hope I didn't.

306
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,828
No, I'm sure you looked
really glamorous cutting up your face.

307
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,312
What is it? What's happening?

308
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,115
- You'll be OK.
- I bet you'll experience some dry-mouth.

309
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,235
Fire.

310
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,591
Was it...? Did the demon thing have me?

311
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,995
It's OK. It's OK.

312
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,879
- Yeah, it's gone.
- Yes, but where did it go?

313
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,717
I mean, evil things have plans.
They have things to do.

314
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,356
Buffy?

315
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,953
You should be careful.

316
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:30,357
You never know what kind of
villain's got a knife at your back.

317
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,829
Your hand is hurt.

318
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,238
Same to you.

319
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,636
Right.

320
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,598
Willow's getting pretty strong, isn't she?

321
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,872
Bringing you back. It's hard to get
a good night's death around her.

322
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,553
You can sit down. Your furniture.

323
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,714
You should see the downstairs, too.
It's quite posh.

324
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,716
I do remember what I said.

325
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,480
The promise.

326
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,556
To protect her.

327
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,238
If I'd have done that,
even if I didn't make it,

328
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,795
you wouldn't have had to jump.

329
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,114
But I want you to know I did save you.

330
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,232
Not when it counted, of course,
but after that.

331
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,556
Every night after that.

332
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,475
I'd see it all again.

333
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,114
I'd do something different.

334
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,390
Faster, more clever, you know?

335
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,548
Dozens of times, lots of different ways.

336
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,316
Every night I save you.

337
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,076
It's getting light out. Buffy's probably
on her way home from patrolling.

338
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,723
I like sunrise better when
I'm getting up early than...

339
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:37,557
when I'm staying up late, you know?

340
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,240
It's like I'm seeing it from the wrong side.

341
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,117
Hey, Tara, this is probably crazy,
but Spike got me to thinkin'.

342
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,277
This spell we did, it's having consequences,
isn't it? I mean, it sure seems like it.

343
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,516
And I was just wonderin'...

344
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,348
- Did you know that this might happen?
- No.

345
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,317
Do you think...?
Could someone have known?

346
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,716
Willow is a talented witch.
She'd never do anything to hurt anyone.

347
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,549
I know, I know, huh?
Backin' up quickly, hands in the air.

348
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,719
- I just meant that...
- Thaumogenesis!

349
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,835
- She's possessed.
- Thaumogenesis.

350
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,963
You're right.

351
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:26,591
I'm not possessed. I think I figured it out.

352
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,874
This demon, it's not a demon we let out.
It's a demon that we made.

353
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,197
We made a demon? Bad us.

354
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,639
Thaumogenesis is when
doing a spell actually creates a being.

355
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,470
In this case it was like a side effect,
I guess. Like a price.

356
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,434
What?

357
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,359
Think of it like, the world doesn't like
you getting something for free,

358
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,199
and we asked for this huge gift - Buffy.

359
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,757
And so the world said "Fine, but if
you have that, you have to take this too. "

360
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,871
And it made the demon.

361
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,152
Well, technically, that's not a price.
That's a gift with purchase.

362
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,272
But if we made the demon,
how come we can't see it?

363
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,868
I mean, all we see is us doing stuff.

364
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,272
Well, I think it's out of phase
with this dimension.

365
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,359
Its consciousness is here,
but its body is caught in the ether

366
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,550
between existing and not existing.

367
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,276
It doesn't have a body, so it's borrowing
ours. It borrowed Dawn and Anya.

368
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,313
Or it's manifesting copies of them,
like it did when Buffy came at us.

369
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,352
It's using them to do stuff.
To scare us, attack us.

370
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,483
So we need to uncreate it, right?

371
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,519
We need to send it the rest
of the way out of our world.

372
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,352
Except that it's linked to the spell.

373
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,395
So if we sent it away,
it would be like the spell didn't exist.

374
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,080
Like it never happened.

375
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,350
Like it never brought Buffy back.

376
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,913
Yes.

377
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,673
You can't do that. You can't think
for a second that you're going to do that.

378
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,119
Dawn...

379
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,631
If you think you can give her back to me
and then take her away again?

380
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,548
No. That's worse than
if you'd never brought her back.

381
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,478
You can't mess with people's lives this way!

382
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,354
- Dawn, we're not going to do it that way.
- How can you let her do this?

383
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,040
How can you even talk about letting her go?

384
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,913
Honey, you weren't listening.
We will find another way.

385
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,679
- We will.
- Then do it.

386
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,519
Wait. OK, wait. Dawn, everybody, hold on.

387
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,796
What? Why are you smiling?
That's inappropriate.

388
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,510
- Because it's temporary.
- What is?

389
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,031
The demon. It's gonna dissipate.
The only way for it to survive on this plane

390
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,357
is if it were to kill the subject
of the original spell.

391
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,990
It would live if it killed Buffy?

392
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,395
Thanks for the tip.

393
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,556
You don't belong here.

394
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,199
Did they tell you that you belonged here?

395
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,595
Did they say this was your home again?

396
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,268
Were you offered pretty lies, little girl?

397
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,631
Or did they even give you a choice?

398
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,556
- Xander! Drive faster!
- I can't!

399
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,389
- I could drive faster and I can't drive!
- She's right, you're like a snail.

400
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,476
A snail driving a car very slowly.

401
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,115
Give it the left foot! We've gotta help
Buffy with the demon you sent her.

402
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,198
I did not send the demon, I was possessed.

403
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,471
- The demon used me to eavesdrop on us.
- Great, so now what?

404
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,751
We have to talk in some
sort of anti-demon secret code?

405
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,155
Ood-gay idea-yay, An-yay.

406
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,353
Stop talking wrong in Pig Latin
and drive! Buffy's in trouble!

407
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,677
It's OK, Dawnie.
Willow and Tara are doin' a spell.

408
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,473
- You sure it won't send Buffy back?
- No, of course not.

409
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,398
It's just that she can't fight it
if it's all misty,

410
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,594
so they'll make it more solid,
so Buffy can kick its fully embodied ass.

411
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,119
You sure it'll work?

412
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,318
Child of words, hear thy makers.

413
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,000
Child of words, we entreat.

414
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,831
With our actions did we make thee,
to our voices wilt thou bend.

415
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,758
With our potions thou took motive,
with our motions came to pass.

416
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,880
We rescind no past devotions,
give thee substance, give thee mass.

417
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,431
You're the one who's barely here,
set on this earth like a bubble.

418
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,155
You won't even disturb the air when you go.

419
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,390
Go! Take Dawn out of here!

420
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,440
Child of words, hear thy makers.

421
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,711
Child of words, we entreat...

422
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,276
Solid.

423
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,593
That's probably the sort of thing
I'm not supposed to see, right?

424
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,515
- Dawn!
- What's wrong?

425
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,111
Lunch.

426
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,114
You made me lunch?

427
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,912
Wow. Thanks.

428
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,712
You'd better go. You've been
outta school since I got back.

429
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,595
And you know what they say.
Those of us who fail history?

430
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,154
Doomed to repeat it in summer school.

431
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,195
Thank you.

432
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,229
You OK?

433
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,557
I'll start charging money
for every person that asks me that.

434
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,797
- Everyone's been doin' that, huh?
- A little bit.

435
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,918
It's because they care about you a lot.

436
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,474
When you were gone...

437
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,909
It was bad when you were gone.

438
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,031
But it'll be better now.

439
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,799
Now that they can see you being happy.

440
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,275
That's all they want.

441
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,311
- Buffy! Hey!
- Hey, you get Dawn off to school all right?

442
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,238
Cos I was thinkin',
if you need help picking her up, I...

443
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,510
It's OK. I got it.

444
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,348
Look, you guys, there's this thing,

445
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,119
so I'm just gonna say it.

446
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,909
You brought me back.

447
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,429
I was in a...

448
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,994
I was in Hell.

449
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,917
I can't think too much
about what it was like.

450
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,518
But it felt like
the world abandoned me there.

451
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,872
And then suddenly
you guys did what you did.

452
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,560
It was Willow. She knew what to do.

453
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,075
OK. So you did that.

454
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,036
And the world came rushing back.

455
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,589
Thank you.

456
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,949
You guys gave me the world.

457
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,356
I can't tell you what it means to me.

458
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,479
And I should have said it before.

459
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,193
You're welcome.

460
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,071
Welcome home, Buffy.

461
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,071
Buffy.

462
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,715
- Spike, it's daylight and you're...
- Not on fire?

463
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,798
Sun's low enough. It's shady enough here.

464
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,669
I was gonna go in, but I overheard
you lot exchanging a special moment.

465
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,756
I came over a bit queasy.

466
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,792
Say, aren't you leaving a hole
in the middle of some soggy group hug?

467
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,395
I just wanted a little time alone.

468
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,354
Oh. Right, then.

469
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,429
It's OK. I can be alone with you here.

470
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,516
Thanks ever so.

471
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,156
Right.

472
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,436
Buff?

473
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,516
Slayer?

474
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,717
Are you OK?

475
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,394
I'm here. I'm good.

476
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,830
Buffy, if you're in...

477
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,117
if you're in pain, or if you need anything,

478
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,993
or if I can do anything for you...

479
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,236
You can't.

480
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,362
I haven't been to a hell dimension
just of late,

481
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,230
but I do know a thing or two about torment.

482
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,316
I was happy.

483
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,199
Wherever I was,

484
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,916
I was happy.

485
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,949
At peace.

486
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,598
I knew that everyone
I cared about was all right.

487
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,196
I knew it.

488
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,793
Time didn't mean anything.

489
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,428
Nothing had form,
but I was still me, you know?

490
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,630
And I was warm.

491
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,276
And I was loved.

492
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,355
And I was finished.

493
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,356
Complete.

494
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,810
I don't understand theology, or...

495
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:36,311
dimensions, or any of it, really,

496
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,036
but I think I was in heaven.

497
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,955
And now I'm not.

498
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,753
I was torn out of there.

499
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,997
Pulled out by my friends.

500
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,070
Everything here is

501
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,228
hard, and bright, and violent.

502
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,959
Everything I feel, everything I touch.

503
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,595
This is Hell.

504
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,720
Just getting through the next moment,
and the one after that.

505
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,915
Knowing what I've lost.

506
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,715
They can never know.
