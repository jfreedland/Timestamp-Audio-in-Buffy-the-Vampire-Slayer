2
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,468
Is it a vampire?

3
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:21,135
Mom, what are you doing here?

4
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:22,474
I brought you a snack.

5
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:24,309
I thought it was about time

6
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:27,146
for me to come out and watch.
You know, the slaying.

7
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:29,948
You know, the slaying
is kind of an alone thing.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,011
But it's such a big part
of your life,

9
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:34,250
and I'd like to understand it.

10
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,260
It's some... you know,
something we could share.

11
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,262
Actually, it's pretty dull,
you know.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,265
It's bam boom stick... poof.

13
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,163
[Grunting And Snarling]

14
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,598
Good, honey! Kill him!

15
00:00:53,544 --> 00:00:55,876
Buffy, he's over here!

16
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:57,777
Oh, my God!

17
00:00:57,848 --> 00:01:00,282
It's Mr. Sanderson from the bank.

18
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:05,547
And he's getting away!

19
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:07,352
Stay!

20
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:47,263
Oh, God.

21
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:43,076
They said we can go home now.

22
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:46,446
They were little kids.

23
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,144
Did you see them?

24
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:49,947
They're so tiny.

25
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,511
I saw.

26
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,026
Who could do something like this?

27
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,492
I just...

28
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:00,359
I'm so sorry that
you had to see this.

29
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,956
But I promise,
everything's going to be OK.

30
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,295
How?

31
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:07,303
Because I'm going
to find whatever did it.

32
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:09,305
I guess.

33
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:12,467
It's just you can't...

34
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,103
you can't make it right.

35
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:18,146
I know.

36
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:19,614
[Crying]

37
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,150
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:23,652
But I'll take care
of everything.

39
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,813
I promise.

40
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:27,652
Just try and calm down.

41
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,659
Don't tell me to calm down.

42
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,024
I... I... I only meant...

43
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:33,723
They were kids, Giles.
Little kids.

44
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:36,664
You don't know what it was like
to see them there.

45
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,827
My mom can't even talk.

46
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:42,030
I'm sorry. I...
I just want to help.

47
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:44,199
I know.

48
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,674
Do we know how? I mean...

49
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,177
it wasn't the vampire?

50
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:50,179
No. There were no marks.

51
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,179
Wait.

52
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:54,183
I mean, there...
there was a mark,

53
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,116
um, a... a symbol.

54
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,619
Oh, uh, 12th century,

55
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,121
Papal Encyclical.

56
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:00,554
Try this.

57
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,552
It was on their hands.

58
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:06,562
The cops are keeping it quiet,

59
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,427
but I got a good look at it.

60
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:09,431
There.

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,127
Find me the thing
that uses the symbol

62
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,930
and point me at it.

63
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:13,935
Hmm.

64
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,631
Hmm. What?

65
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:16,934
Giles, speak.

66
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:18,668
Oh, sorry.

67
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:20,175
Um, no, it...

68
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:23,441
I just wonder if
we're looking for a thing.

69
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:26,449
The use of a symbol
on a victim like this,

70
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:29,042
it suggests a... a ritual murder,

71
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,212
an occult sacrifice by a group.

72
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:33,984
A group of... human beings.

73
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:37,185
Someone with a soul did this?

74
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,956
Yes, I'm afraid so.

75
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,964
OK.

76
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:44,466
Then while you're looking
for the meaning that symbol thingy,

77
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:45,968
could you also find a loophole

78
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:48,061
in that "slayers don't
kill people" rule?

79
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:49,571
Buffy...

80
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:53,709
this is a dreadful crime,
I know,

81
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:56,712
and you have every right
to be upset, but...

82
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,214
I wonder if you're not
letting yourself

83
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:01,274
get a shade, uh, more personal

84
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:04,115
because of your mother's
involvement.

85
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:06,122
Oh, it's completely personal.

86
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,125
Giles, find me the people
that did this.

87
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:10,353
Please.

88
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:15,897
Hey.

89
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,058
Hey.

90
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:21,128
So, a burrito.

91
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:24,340
This is a burrito.

92
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,308
Damn straight.

93
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:31,146
Hi, Oz.

94
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:32,147
Hey.

95
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:33,148
Xander. Hi.

96
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:34,609
Hey, Amy.

97
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:35,606
Hi, guys.

98
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,144
Xander: Hey, Amy.
I like your new hair.

99
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:39,578
I haven't see you all day.
Where you been?

100
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:42,582
Not with me.
No, sir. Ask anyone.

101
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,345
No.

102
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:55,261
So, Buffy's birthday's
next week.

103
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,490
Ooh! Yeah.

104
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:57,496
Good.

105
00:06:57,565 --> 00:06:59,692
I've been pondering
gift options.

106
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,234
Shh.

107
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:02,735
Oh, come on,
we just got a topic here.

108
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:03,736
Hi, Buffy.

109
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:06,239
Buffy. What's up?

110
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:07,740
You guys didn't hear?

111
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,743
Hear what?

112
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:10,778
A murder.

113
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:13,177
Somebody killed
2 little kids.

114
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:14,442
Oh, no.

115
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:17,450
They were, like,
7 or 8 years old.

116
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:19,418
My mom found the bodies
during patrol last night.

117
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:20,852
Oh, my God.

118
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:22,116
Kids?

119
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,555
Why was your mom there?

120
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,820
More bad. She picked
last night, of all nights,

121
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,451
for a surprise bonding visit.

122
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:30,520
God, your mom would actually
take the time to do that with you?

123
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:35,563
That really wasn't the point
of the story, was it?

124
00:07:35,637 --> 00:07:38,572
No. The point is,
she's completely wigging.

125
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,870
Who's wigging?

126
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:42,375
Um...

127
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:43,375
everyone.

128
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:45,878
You know,
'cause of what happened.

129
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:47,380
Oh, it's so awful.

130
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:49,916
I had bad dreams
about it all night.

131
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:50,916
Hi, Mrs. Summers.

132
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:52,316
Oh, hi, everybody.

133
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,718
Hi.

134
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:54,846
Hi, Mrs. Summers.

135
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,356
Buffy, have you talked
to Mr. Giles yet

136
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:58,983
about who could have done this?

137
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,994
Yeah. He, uh...

138
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:04,122
he thinks it might be
something ritual.

139
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:06,257
Occult.
But he's still looking.

140
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:08,768
In the meantime,
we're gonna add to my patrol

141
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:10,428
and... and keep an eye out.

142
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:11,938
Occult.

143
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,803
Like witches.

144
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,172
[Coughing]

145
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:19,476
Sorry. Phlegm. Too much dairy.

146
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:22,983
I... I know you kids
think that stuff s cool.

147
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:24,575
Buffy told me you dabble.

148
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:26,085
Right. Absolutely. That's me.

149
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:28,019
I'm a... a dabbler.

150
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:30,523
But anybody who could
do this isn't cool.

151
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,526
Anybody who could do this
has to be a monster.

152
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:38,031
You know what? Uh, would you guys
excuse us for a little bit?

153
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,498
Uh, nice to see you.

154
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,094
What a burn.

155
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:47,039
I mean, Buff s mom was just starting
to accept the whole slayer thing,

156
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,973
and now she's going to be
double freaked.

157
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:51,477
Makes me grateful
that my mom's not interested

158
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:54,037
in my extracurricular
activities.

159
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:57,209
Or my curricular activities.

160
00:08:57,285 --> 00:09:00,721
Are your friends going to help
with the investigation, too?

161
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:03,723
Mom, I really think maybe
this isn't the best place

162
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,224
to talk about this.

163
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:08,228
Are you embarrassed
to be hanging out with your mother?

164
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:09,729
I didn't hug you.

165
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:11,992
No. It's just...

166
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,000
this hall is about school,

167
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:15,501
and you're about home.

168
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,834
Mix them,
my world dissolves.

169
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:21,500
It's just, I keep thinking about
who could have done such a thing.

170
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:23,066
I have to help.

171
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:25,612
Well, Giles can always
use help in the library.

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,113
I called everybody
I know in town.

173
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:28,614
I told them about
the dead children.

174
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:30,344
They're all just
as upset as I am.

175
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:33,285
You called everybody
that you know?

176
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:35,288
And they called
all their friends.

177
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:38,291
And guess what. We're setting up
a vigil, for tonight, for city hall.

178
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,293
The mayor is even
going to be there.

179
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,226
Now we are going to get
some action.

180
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:43,957
Uh-huh.

181
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:45,658
That's great. Uh...

182
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,325
but you know what?

183
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:50,269
A lot of times when we're

of people that know about it

an effort. My mom's probably...

you were going to be here.

Oh, hi, Bunny.

00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,072
Hi.

197

in the paper,

themselves witches

Or suffered neck rupture?

And how many of us have been
too afraid to speak out?

259
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:08,483

in a moment of silence, but...

to take Sunnydale back.

I say we start by finding
the people who did this

00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,218
Excuse me. Playboys.

365
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,811
Can we turn
the sympathy this way?

366
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,223
Hey! Get your grubby
custodial hands off that.

367
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,922
That hair spray costs $45,
and it's imported.

368
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:56,093
My locker's next. Buffy,
I didn't do anything wrong.

369
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,136
The... The symbol is harmless.

370
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,671
I used it to make
a protection spell for you,

371
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,105
for your birthday.
With Michael and Amy.

372
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,437
Only, now it's broken,

373
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:06,602
Because you know about it,
so Happy Birthday.

374
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,272
And please,
you have to believe me.

375
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:17,312
Ms. Rosenberg. My office.

376
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,728
Police Officer:
Back up. Comin' through.

377
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,201
Giles.

378
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,269
They're confiscating my books.

379
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,371
Giles, we need those books.

380
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,506
Believe me,
I tried to tell that

381
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,914
to the nice man
with the big gun.

382
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,452
No. There's something about
the symbol that we're missing.

383
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,080
Willow said she used it in
a protection spell. It's harmless.

384
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,714
Not a big bad.

385
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,555
So then why would it turn up
in a ritual sacrifice?

386
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,152
I don't know. Ordinarily,
I would say let's widen our research.

387
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,563
Using what? A dictionary
and My Friend Flicka?

388
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,601
This is intolerable.

389
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,158
Snyder has interfered before,

390
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,296
but I won't take this from that
twisted little homunculus.

391
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,308
I love the smell of desperate
librarian in the morning.

392
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,071
You get out...

393
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:15,510
and take your marauders
with you.

394
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,346
Oh, my. So fierce.

395
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,941
I suppose
I should hear you out.

396
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,920
Just how is, um...

397
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,186
"Blood Rites and Sacrifices"

398
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,659
appropriate material
for a public school library?

399
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,286
Chess club branching out?

400
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,593
This is not over.

401
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,724
Oh, I should say
it's just beginning.

402
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,267
Fight it if you want.

403
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,633
Just remember,
lift a finger against me,

404
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,695
and you'll have to answer to MOO.

405
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,968
Answer to MOO?

406
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,341
Did that sentence just make
some sense that I'm not in on?

407
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,710
Mothers Opposed to the Occult.

408
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,180
A powerful new group.

409
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,518
And who came up
with that lame name?

410
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,784
That would be the founder.

411
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,347
I believe you call her Mom.

412
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,160
Oh, sit down, honey.

413
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,967
Principal Snyder talk to you?

414
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,873
Yes. He's quite concerned.

415
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:20,410
Mom, I know what this looks like,
and I can totally...

416
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:21,809
You don't have to explain, honey.

417
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,246
This isn't exactly a surprise.

418
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,580
Why not?

419
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:29,415
Oh, well, identification
with mythical icons

420
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,478
is perfectly typical
of your age group.

421
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,820
It's a classic
adolescent response

422
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,326
to the pressures
of incipient adulthood.

423
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:38,760
Oh. Is that what it is?

424
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,889
Of course, I wish you
could have identified

425
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:43,092
with something
a little less icky,

426
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,863
but developmentally speaking...

427
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,234
Mom, I'm not an age group.

428
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,933
I'm me. Willow group.

429
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,171
Oh, honey...

430
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:54,905
I understand.

431
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:57,209
No, you don't.

432
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,843
Mom, this may be hard
for you to accept,

433
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,580
but I can do stuff.

434
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,451
Nothing bad or dangerous,

435
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:06,387
but I can do spells.

436
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,857
You think you can,

437
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,257
and that's what concerns me.

438
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,386
The delusions.

439
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,899
Mom, how would you know
what I can do?

440
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,696
I mean, the last time we had
a conversation over 3 minutes,

441
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,466
it was about the patriarchal bias
of The Mr. Rogers Show.

442
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,337
Well, with King Friday lording it
over all the lesser puppets.

443
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,842
Mom, you're not
paying attention.

444
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,140
And this is your way
of trying to get it.

445
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,443
Now, I have consulted
with some of my colleagues,

446
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,451
and they agree that this
is a cry for discipline.

447
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,077
You're grounded.

448
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,315
Grounded?

449
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,517
This is the first time ever...

450
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,425
I've done something you don't like,
and I'm grounded?

451
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,157
I'm supposed to mess up.
I'm a teenager, remember?

452
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,062
You're upset. I hear you.

453
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,693
No, Ma, hear this.

454
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:51,963
I'm a rebel.

455
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:53,401
I'm having a rebellion.

456
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:56,702
Willow, honey, you don't
need to act out like this

457
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,402
to prove your specialness.

458
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:00,967
Mom, I'm not acting out.
I'm a witch.

459
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:03,309
I can make pencils float.

460
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,679
And I can summon the 4 elements.

461
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,082
OK, 2, but 4 soon.

462
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,451
And I'm dating a musician.

463
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,615
Oh, Willow!

464
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,925
I worship Beelzebub.

465
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,792
I do his biddings.

466
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:21,991
Do you see any goats around?
No, because I sacrificed them.

467
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,897
All bow before Satan!

468
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,526
I'm not listening to this.

469
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:27,867
Prince of Night, I summon you.

470
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,601
Come fill me with your
black, naughty evil.

471
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,701
That's enough!
Is that clear?

472
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:35,040
Now, you will go to your room

473
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,843
and stay there
until I say otherwise.

474
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,180
And we're going
to make some changes.

475
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:43,243
I don't want you hanging out
with those friends of yours.

476
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,222
It's clear where this
little obsession came from.

477
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,826
You will not speak
to Bunny Summers again.

478
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:53,363
I don't want you seeing
that Willow anymore.

479
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,728
I've spoken with her mother.

480
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,859
I had no idea her forays
into the occult had gone so far.

481
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,666
You're the one who ordered
the raid on the school today.

482
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:02,968
Honey, they opened a few lockers.

483
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,066
Lockers.
First syllable, lock.

484
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,235
They're supposed to be private.

485
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,211
And they took
all of Giles' books away.

486
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,110
He'll get most of them back.

487
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:13,207
MOO just wants to weed out
the offensive material.

488
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:15,479
Everything else will be
returned to Mr. Giles soon.

489
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:18,074
If we're going to solve this,
we need those books now.

490
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:22,507
Sweetie, those books have no place
in a public school library.

491
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:23,909
Especially now.

492
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,474
Any student can waltz in there
and get all sorts of ideas.

493
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:33,545
Do you understand
how that terrifies me?

494
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:36,353
Mom, I hate that these people
scared you so much.

495
00:24:36,426 --> 00:24:38,485
And I know that you're
just trying to help,

496
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,392
but you have to let me
handle this.

497
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:41,930
It's what I do.

498
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:43,329
But is it really?

499
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,629
I mean, you patrol, you slay.

500
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:49,103
Evil pops up, you undo it.
And that's great.

501
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:51,402
But is Sunnydale
getting any better?

502
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:53,635
Are they running out
of vampires?

503
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,974
I don't think that
you run out of...

504
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,808
It's not your fault.

505
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,440
You don't have a plan.
You just react to things.

506
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:02,143
It's bound to be
kind of fruitless.

507
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,246
OK, maybe I don't have a plan.

508
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:09,086
Lord knows I don't
have lapel buttons.

509
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:10,819
Buffy.

510
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:13,157
And maybe next time that the world
is getting sucked into hell,

511
00:25:13,229 --> 00:25:15,595
I won't be able to stop it
because the anti-hell-sucking book

512
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:17,758
isn't on the approved
reading list.

513
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:20,826
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to put down...

514
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:22,165
Yeah, well, you did.

515
00:25:23,372 --> 00:25:24,703
It doesn't matter.

516
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,503
I have to go.

517
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:28,737
I have to go on one
of my pointless patrols

518
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:31,541
and react to some vampires.

519
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,981
If that's all right with MOO.

520
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:39,514
And nice acronym, Mom.

521
00:25:41,891 --> 00:25:44,485
Just trying
to make things better.

522
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,521
You are.

523
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:50,793
There's bad people out there.

524
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:53,097
And we can't sleep.

525
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,194
Not until you hurt them.

526
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:57,364
The way they hurt us.

527
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,363
Hey.

528
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:28,960
Hi.

529
00:26:38,815 --> 00:26:40,248
How are you?

530
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:41,943
I'm all right.

531
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,646
I think I'm better
than you right now.

532
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:50,389
I heard about this.

533
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:53,223
People are talking.

534
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:56,356
People are even talking to me.

535
00:26:56,432 --> 00:26:58,957
It's strange.

536
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,902
People die in Sunnydale
all the time...

537
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:04,496
and I've never seen
anything like this.

538
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:08,808

some things to me

544
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:26,923
about being the slayer.

545
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:28,964

Is Sunnydale any better
than when I first came here?

OK, so I battle evil.

551
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,877
But I don't really win.

and getting stronger.

in the story,

his finger in the duck.

OK, that story makes
a lot more sense now.

I'm still figuring things out.

I don't understand.

things worth fighting for.

You were right.

719
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:33,673
It was easy.

720
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:35,680
I told you.

721
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:37,545
It gets even easier.

722
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,552
But I'm still scared
of the bad girls.

723
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,713
You have to stop them.

724
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,280
You have to make them go away...

725
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:46,950
forever.

726
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:55,858
Willow!

727
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:11,408
Hold still.
Be a good girl.

728
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,284
No! Why are you
doing this to me? Mom?

729
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:17,687
There's no cure but the fire.

730
00:35:17,757 --> 00:35:19,156
Buffy!

731
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:20,658
Wake up!

732
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,592
This is crazy, Mom.

733
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,789
Buffy!

734
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:26,331
Buffy!

735
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,730
Cordelia: Wake up!

736
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:35,539
Cordelia?

737
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:37,405
Took you long enough
to wake up.

738
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:39,536
My hand hurts.

739
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:41,705
Pity.

740
00:35:41,781 --> 00:35:43,305
Oh. Why are you here?

741
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:45,613
Things are way out
of control, Giles.

742
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,175
First the thing at school,

743
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:48,652
and then my mom confiscates

744
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:51,656
all of my black clothes
and scented candles.

745
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:54,488
I came over here to tell Buffy
to stop this craziness

746
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,222
and found you
all unconscious... again.

747
00:35:57,297 --> 00:35:59,561
How many times have you
been knocked out, anyway?

748
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:01,691
I swear,
one of these times,

749
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:03,292
you're going to wake up
in a coma.

750
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,896
Wake up in a...
Oh, never mind.

751
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:10,067
We need to save Buffy
from Hansel and Gretel.

752
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:12,839
Now, let's be clear.

753
00:36:12,912 --> 00:36:16,040
The brain damage happened
before I hit you.

754
00:36:21,854 --> 00:36:23,344
What's with the grim?

755
00:36:23,423 --> 00:36:25,084
We're here to join you guys.

756
00:36:25,158 --> 00:36:27,592
Really. Why should you guys
have all the fun?

757
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,924
We want to be part of the hate.

758
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:31,996
Just so we're clear,

759
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,896
you guys know
you're nuts, right?

760
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:35,832
[Shouting]

761
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:38,926
Buffy!

762
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:40,836
Good morning, sleepyhead.

763
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,068
Mom, you don't want this.

764
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:44,939
Since when does it
matter what I want?

765
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:46,535
I wanted a normal,
happy daughter.

766
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:48,136
Instead I got a slayer.

767
00:36:52,218 --> 00:36:53,583
Torch.

768
00:36:53,653 --> 00:36:55,280
Thanks.

769
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:56,549
This has been so trying.

770
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:58,146
You've been such a champ.

771
00:36:58,224 --> 00:36:59,691
Oh, you, too, Joyce.

772
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,624
We should stay close,
have lunch.

773
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:03,958
Oh, I'd like that.
How nice.

774
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:06,859
Oh, you can't be serious.

775
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,594
Mom, don't!

776
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:19,205
All right.
You want to fry a witch?

777
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,905
I'll give you a witch.

778
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,540
Goddess Hecate, work thy will.

779
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,605
Uh-oh.

780
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:28,347
Before thee let
the unclean thing crawl.

[Women Scream]

783
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:48,473
She couldn't do us first?

784
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,202
You've seen what we can do.

785
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:53,973
Another step and you
will all feel my power.

786
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:56,845
What are you going to do,
float a pencil at them?

787
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:59,578
It's a really big power.

788
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,452
Yes! You will all
be turned into vermin.

789
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:05,582
And some of you will be fish.

790
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,218
Yeah, you in the back
will be fish.

791
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:10,228
Maybe we should go.

792
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:12,230
But you promised.

793
00:38:12,298 --> 00:38:14,766
You have to kill the bad girls.

794
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:19,530
Cordelia: I can't believe you had
this stuff in your apartment.

795
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:21,851
It smells foul.

796
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:24,282
Shred the wolfsbane.
That's the leafy stuff.

797
00:38:24,353 --> 00:38:28,380
And then you can crush
the satyrion root.

798

Luften sie den something.

799
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:34,326
Schlumer? Schluter?

800
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,557
What are you muttering about?

801
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:36,723
It's a part of an incantation.

802
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:39,097
It's in German,
and without my books...

803
00:38:39,168 --> 00:38:40,328
What does it mean?

804
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,200
It's about lifting a veil.

805
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:46,173
It should make the demons
appear in their true form,

806
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:49,109
which with any luck,
will negate their influence.

807
00:38:49,178 --> 00:38:51,442
And, uh, drop a toadstone
into the mixture.

808
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:53,846
This?

809
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,975
It doesn't look like a toad.

810
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:57,849
No reason it should.

811
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,353
It's from inside the toad.

812
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:02,585
I hate you.

813
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:08,862
We got to get inside.

Willow: No! Oh, God, help!

815
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:14,764
Wil?

816
00:39:14,837 --> 00:39:17,772
It sounds like
she's right above us?

Little Girl:
They hurt us.

Little Boy:
Burn them.

819
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:42,492
Mom, dead people are talking
to you. Do the math.

820
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:44,533
I'm sorry, Buffy.

821
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,726
Mom, look at me!

822
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,564
You love me.

823
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:50,800
You're not going to be able to live
with yourself if you do this.

824
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:51,805
You earned this.

825
00:39:51,874 --> 00:39:55,207
You toyed with unnatural forces.

826
00:39:55,278 --> 00:39:57,007
What kind of a mother would I be

827
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,706
if I didn't punish you?

828
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:12,089
Ouch! You got hair with that.

829
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:17,087
God, you really were the little
youthful offender, weren't you?

830
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,691
You must just look back
on that and cringe.

831
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:21,259
Shh!

832
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:34,139
Buffy, I can't take it.
It's too hot.

833
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:36,446
I'm sorry, Wil.
If it wasn't for me,

834
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,747
none of this
would have happened.

835
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,617
It wouldn't be...

00:40:45,595 --> 00:40:46,926
Stop them!

She forgot everything?

861

No. She remembered the part where
I said I was dating a musician.

Oz has to come
for dinner next week.
