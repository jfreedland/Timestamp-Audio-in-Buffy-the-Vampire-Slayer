00:00:02,275 --> 00:00:04,027
<i>Previously on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'':</i>

2
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:08,586
There's only one thing l've ever been
sure of: you. You're the one, Buffy.

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,224
- Trying to turn a bunch of girls into an army.
- <i>(Buffy) They're potential slayers.</i>

4
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:15,148
<i>(Anya) We're dealing with the Big Bad</i>
<i>that can be any dead person.</i>

5
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:17,112
Where are we going?

6
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:22,394
<i>(Buffy) ''Dearest Dawn, Don't be angry with</i>
<i>Xander. This isn't the place for either of you.''</i>

7
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:25,706
A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you.

8
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,990
Does this mean l can win?

9
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:32,114
- <i>(Caleb) l was kinda hoping it'd go this way.</i>
- <i>(man)</i> Hey!

10
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:37,265
At least you could tell me
you're glad to see me.

11
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:39,232
That bitch.

12
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:49,783
Well, l guess that qualifies
as happy to see me.

13
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:52,390
Angel, what are you doing here?

14
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:55,512
Don't even. l just wanna bask.

15
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,625
OK, l'm basked. What are you doing here?

16
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:03,468
Not savin' a damsel in distress,
that's for sure.

17
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:07,150
Oh, you know me.
Not much with the damselling.

18
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,432
- Got your share of distress, though.
- You heard?

19
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:13,746
l got coverage on the whole thing.
lt's very gripping.

20
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:16,349
- lt needs a third act.
- You have to leave LA.

21
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:18,585
lt's the First, right?

22
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:22,748
The First Evil. The power that tried
to convince me to kill myself.

23
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:26,464
Yeah. lt's gotten more ambitious
since then. lt's raising an army.

24
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:29,865
Yeah, well, it failed once,
and l'm here to tell you...

25
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:34,231
Are you ready to finish this, bitch?

27
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:36,624
OK.

28
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:39,912
How many times do l have to kill you?
Ballpark figure.

29
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:42,429
You understand nothing.

30
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:49,429
Aah!

31
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:55,589
You think you have power over me?

32
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:02,708
Stupid girl. You'll never stop me.
You don't have the...

33
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:03,864
<i>(crunch)</i>

34
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:05,308
<i>(gasps)</i>

35
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:08,355
Who does nowadays?

36
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:12,110
- <i>(halves of body fall)</i>
- OK.

37
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:14,755
Now l'm pissed. Where is he?

38
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:20,630
He had to split.

39
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:24,632
Yeah, she needs you real bad.

40
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:29,027
l'll have the guys go through that.
See if there's anything new. Reliable source?

41
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:32,505
- Not remotely.
- Well, any port in an apocalypse.

42
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:35,393
l, uh, brought somethin' else as well.

43
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:38,592
l can already tell you,
l have nothing that goes with that.

44
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:41,314
- lt's not for you.
- Splainy?

45
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:45,434
l don't know everything. lt's very powerful
and probably very dangerous.

46
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:48,746
lt has a purifying power, a cleansing power...

47
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:52,871
possibly scrubbing bubbles.
The translation is, uh...

48
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:55,708
lt bestows strength
to the right person who wears it.

49
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:58,514
- And the right person is?
- Someone ensouled,

50
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:02,065
but stronger than human.
A champion. As in me.

51
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,349
- Or me.
- No.

52
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:06,188
l don't know enough about this
to risk you wearing it.

53
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:11,747
Besides, you got that
real cool axe thing going for you.

54
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,629
So you're gonna be with me in this?

55
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:18,946
Shoulder to shoulder. l'm yours.

56
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:21,434
No.

57
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,346
- No, what?
- No.

58
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:26,108
You're not gonna be in this fight.

59
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:28,629
- Why the hell not?
- Because l can't risk you.

60
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:31,627
- You need me in this.
- No, l need you gone.

61
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:33,307
Why?

62
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:38,033
lf l lose, if this thing gets past Sunnydale,

63
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:41,949
then it's days - maybe hours -
before the rest of the world goes.

64
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:45,505
- l need a second front, and you to run it.
- OK.

65
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:49,752
That's one reason. What's the other?

66
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:53,995
There is no other.

67
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:57,426
ls it Spike?

68
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:00,991
You're not tellin' me something.

69
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:04,067
His scent - l remember it pretty well.

70
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:08,148
Vampires. Anybody ever tell you
the smelling-people thing's a little gross?

71
00:05:08,235 --> 00:05:11,511
- ls he your boyfriend?
- ls that your business?

72
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:18,227
Are you in love with him? OK. Maybe l'm out
of line, but this is a curve ball for me.

73
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:20,954
l mean, we are talking about Spike here.

74
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:23,833
lt's different. He's different.

75
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:26,509
- He has a soul now.
- Oh.

76
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,991
- Well.
- What?

77
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:34,751
- That's great. Everyone's got a soul now.
- He'll make a difference.

78
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,032
l started it. The whole having a soul.

79
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,504
- Before it was all the cool new thing.
- Oh, my God.

80
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:45,587
- Are you 12?
- l get the brushoff for Captain Peroxide.

81
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:49,509
- lt doesn't bring out the champion in me.
- You're not getting the brushoff.

82
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:53,383
Are you gonna go all Dawson on me
every time l have a boyfriend?

83
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:55,591
Aha! Boyfriend.

84
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:57,984
He's not.

85
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:00,707
But...

86
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:05,952
he is in my heart.

87
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:08,469
That'll end well.

88
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:11,023
What was the highlight of <i>our</i> relationship?

89
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:14,312
When you broke up with me
or when l killed you?

90
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:18,671
l'm well aware of my stellar history with guys.

91
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:20,784
<i>(sighs)</i>

92
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:25,471
And, no, l don't see fat grandchildren
in the offing with Spike.

93
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:30,305
But l don't think that really matters right now.

94
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:38,547
ln the midst of all this insanity, a couple
of things are actually starting to make sense.

95
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,869
And the guy thing...

96
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:43,547
<i>(sighs)</i>

97
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:50,547
l always feared there was something wrong
with me, because l couldn't make it work.

98
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:54,628
- But maybe l'm not supposed to.
- Because you're the Slayer?

99
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,471
Because...

100
00:06:57,555 --> 00:06:59,034
OK.

101
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:01,675
l'm cookie dough.

102
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,427
l'm not done baking.

103
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:10,272
l'm not finished becoming whoever
the hell it is l'm gonna turn out to be.

104
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:16,344
l make it through this,
and the next thing, and the next thing,

105
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:20,986
and... maybe one day,
l turn around and realise l'm ready.

106
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:23,831
l'm cookies.

107
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:27,590
And then, you know,
if l want someone to eat m...

108
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:32,829
or... enjoy warm... delicious cookie me,

109
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:36,353
then... that's fine.

110
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:40,029
That'll be then.

111
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:42,265
When l'm done.

112
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:45,825
Any thoughts on who might enjoy...

113
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:50,914
Do l have to go with the cookie analogy?

114
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:54,865
l'm not really thinking that far ahead.

115
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:57,628
That's kind of the point.

116
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:13,027
l'll go start workin' on the second front.
Make sure l don't have to use it.

117
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:17,829
Angel.

118
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,389
l do...

119
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:26,909
sometimes think that far ahead.

120
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,105
Sometimes is something.

121
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:33,267
Be a long time coming.

122
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,664
Years, if ever.

123
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:38,349
l ain't gettin' any older.

124
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:54,068
Ow.

125
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:55,508
Dumbass.

126
00:08:56,755 --> 00:09:01,306
Don't look at me. This is a Summers thing.
lt's all very violent.

127
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:04,989
lf you get killed, l'm telling.

128
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:08,904
Did you find out anything about the scythe?

129
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:12,146
lt slices, dices, and makes julienne preacher.

130
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:13,588
Caleb?

131
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:15,666
- l cut him in half.
- All right!

132
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:20,465
- <i>(Anya)</i> He had that coming.
- Party in my eye socket. Everyone's invited!

133
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:24,784
Sometimes l shouldn't say words.

134
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:31,787
So, where's Tall, Dark and Forehead?

135
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,708
Let me guess. You can smell him?

136
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:40,233
Yeah, that and l also used my enhanced
vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing him.

137
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,784
lt was... a hello.

138
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,435
Most people don't use
their tongues to say hello.

139
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:51,830
- Or l guess they do, but...
- There were no tongues.

140
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:56,511
- Besides, he's gone.
- Oh, just popped by for a quickie, then?

141
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:59,871
Good. l haven't had enough
jealous-vampire crap for one night.

142
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:02,549
He wears lifts, you know.

143
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:07,423
One of these days l'm gonna put you two
in a room and let you wrestle it out.

144
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:09,904
- No problem at this end.
- Hm.

145
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:13,590
- There could be oil of some kind involved.
- Where's the trinket?

146
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:16,314
- The who-ket?
- The necklace your sweetie gave you.

147
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:19,592
The one with all the power.
l believe it's mine now.

148
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:26,071
- How do you figure?
- Someone with a soul but more than human?

149
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:30,751
Angel meant to wear it.
That means l'm the qualified party.

150
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:34,589
- lt's volatile. We don't know...
- You need someone strong to bear it then.

151
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,473
You were planning on givin' it to Andrew?

152
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:44,024
Angel said the amulet was meant
to be worn by a champion.

153
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:04,666
Been called a lot of things in my time.

154
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,514
Faith still has my room.

155
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:10,825
Well, you're not stayin' here.

156
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:14,032
You can't buy me off
with shiny beads and sweet talk.

157
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:18,870
You got Angel breath. l'm not gonna let you
whack me back and forth like a rubber ball.

158
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:21,310
l've got my pride, you know.

159
00:11:21,395 --> 00:11:23,351
l understand.

160
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:28,072
Clearly you don't, cos the whole ''having
my pride'' thing was just a smoke screen.

161
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,066
Oh, thank God.

162
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:37,945
l don't know what l would have done
if you'd have gone up those stairs.

163
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,506
Pretty, ain't it?

164
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:20,348
- You're not him.
- No, you killed him right and proper.

165
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:24,223
Terrible loss.
This man was my good right arm.

166
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:30,234
Course, it don't pain me too much.
Don't need an arm. Got an army.

167
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:35,150
- An army of vampires. However will l fight...?
- Every day our numbers swell.

168
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,430
But then you do have an army of your own.

169
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:41,064
30-odd pimply faced girls,
don't know the pointy end of a stake.

170
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:44,067
- Maybe l should call this off.
- Ever considered a cool name?

171
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:48,387
Since you're incorporeal and basically
powerless. How about ''The Taunter''?

172
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:51,672
- Strikes fear in the heart...
- l will overrun this earth.

173
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:56,192
When my army outnumbers the humans
on this earth, the scales will tip...

174
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,914
and l will be made flesh.

175
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:02,385
Talk on. l'm not afraid of you.

176
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:06,263
Then why aren't you asleep
in your dead lover's arms?

177
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:12,832
Cos he can't help you.

178
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:19,627
Nor Faith, nor your friends,
certainly not your wannaslay brigade.

179
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:25,472
None of those girlies will ever know real
power unless you're dead. You know the drill.

180
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,149
''lnto every generation, a slayer is born.''

181
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:34,272
''One girl in all the world. She alone
will have the strength and skill to...''

182
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,471
There's that word again.

183
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:39,069
What you are. How you'll die.

184
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,031
Alone.

185
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:46,585
Where's your snappy comeback?

186
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,714
- You're right.
- Hm. Not your best.

187
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,551
l'm drowning in footwear!

188
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:00,306
Weird dream.

189
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:03,347
Buffy?

190
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:09,232
- ls there something wrong?
- No. Yeah.

191
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:13,023
l just realised something.

192
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:16,903
Something that really never
occurred to me before.

193
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:22,273
We're gonna win.

194
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:33,546
What do you think?

195
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:37,787
That depends. Are you in any way... kidding?

196
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:41,951
- You don't think it's a good idea?
- lt's pretty radical, B.

197
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:44,026
lt's a lot more than that.

198
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:48,506
Buffy, what you said,
it flies in the face of everything we've ever...

199
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:52,554
every generation has ever done
in the fight against evil.

200
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:56,074
l think it's bloody brilliant.

201
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,268
- You mean that?
- lf you want my opinion.

202
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:01,869
- l really do.
- Whoa, hey.

203
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:06,107
Not to poop on the party, but l'm the guy
that's gonna have to pull this thing off.

204
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:10,507
- lt is beaucoup de mojo.
- This goes beyond anything l've ever done.

205
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:12,950
lt's a total loss of control,

206
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:17,790
and not in a nice, wholesome, ''my girlfriend
has a pierced tongue'' kind of way.

207
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,435
l wouldn't ask if l didn't think you could do it.

208
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:24,986
- l'm not sure that l'm stable enough.
- You can do this, Willow.

209
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:28,863
We'll get the coven on the line,
and we'll find out how they can help.

210
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:31,105
- l'll...
- Oh!

211
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:34,348
- Pierced tongue.
- Dawn needs to do research.

212
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:38,713
- Yes, you do.
- lt's cool. Watcherjunior to the library.

213
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:41,593
l'll go dig up my sources. Quite literally.

214
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:44,792
- Some of them are dead.
- Let's assemble the cannon fodder.

215
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:51,428
- That's not what we're calling 'em, sweetie.
- Not to their faces. What am l, insensitive?

216
00:15:56,475 --> 00:16:01,026
<i>(Buffy)</i> l hate this. l hate being here.

217
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:04,187
l hate that you have to be here.

218
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:09,110
l hate that there's evil,
and that l was chosen to fight it.

219
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:12,267
l wish, a whole lot of the time,
that l hadn't been.

220
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:15,347
l know a lot of you wish l hadn't been either.

221
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:19,149
But this isn't about wishes.

222
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,544
This is about choices.

223
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:23,910
l believe we can beat this evil.

224
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:27,590
Not when it comes,
not when its army is ready.

225
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:29,028
Now.

226
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:32,187
Tomorrow morning l'm opening the seal.

227
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:38,112
l'm going down into the Hellmouth,
and l'm finishing this once and for all.

228
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:42,268
Right now you're asking yourself
''What makes this different?''

229
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:47,145
''What makes us anything more than a bunch
of girls being picked off one by one?''

230
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:51,383
lt's true none of you have
the power that Faith and l do.

231
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,469
So here's the part where you make a choice.

232
00:16:57,675 --> 00:17:01,270
- lt's one hell of a risky idea.
- Buffy's wacky that way.

233
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:06,907
Yeah. There's one more vent by the stairs.
We block that, they got no sewer access.

234
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:10,544
- Should drive them up into the school.
- Assuming they get past us.

235
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:15,265
- Which, no offence, l am.
- Come on, you gotta have a little faith.

236
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:20,190
- l think l've had my share, thanks.
- l trundled right into that one, didn't l?

237
00:17:20,835 --> 00:17:24,623
Look, l'm sorry if it seemed like
l was blowing you off the other day.

238
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:27,434
l was just trying to, you know, blow you off.

239
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:31,952
- Yeah, l figured that one out all by myself.
- lt's nothing personal.

240
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:36,950
lt's just after l get bouncy with a guy, there's
not much more l need to know about him.

241
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,105
- That's bleak.
- Way of the world.

242
00:17:39,195 --> 00:17:43,985
That's good to know cos l thought it was
a more defensive, isolationist slayer crap.

243
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:46,066
And he comes out swingin'.

244
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:50,114
Faith, there's a whole world out there
that you don't even know about,

245
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:55,223
and a lot of the men in it are pretty
decent guys. They'd surprise you.

246
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:59,308
A guy looks at me,
let's just say his priorities shift.

247
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:02,467
- Why, because you're so hot?
- lt is what it is, yo.

248
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:05,752
Oh, please.
l am so much prettier than you are.

249
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,554
Oh, and, uh... for the record,

250
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:12,947
our little encounter didn't
exactly change my world.

251
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:15,754
You're trippin'. That was rock 'em, sock 'em.

252
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:19,623
No, no, no, no. lt was nice enough,
you know, and you're...

253
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:25,585
you're very, um... enthused,
and l think with a little more experience...

254
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:28,030
Dude, l got mad skills.

255
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:32,870
- Yeah, of course. Let's finish up.
- No, hell with that. We're goin' again, baby.

256
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:37,506
- You're gonna learn a little respect here, pal.
- Faith... make me a deal, all right?

257
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:42,066
We live through this,
you give me the chance to surprise you.

258
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,150
What would be the surprise?

259
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:48,830
You do know the meaning of the word, right?

260
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:53,348
- Fine. Deal.
- Good enough.

261
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,868
- No way you're prettier than me.
- A little bit, yeah.

262
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:03,394
l really wish she hadn't said that about me.

263
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,670
What, the thing Buffy said?

264
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:08,394
- l think it's true.
- <i>(whimpers)</i>

265
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:12,347
l'll be with you. To keep you grounded.

266
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:17,429
Yeah, well, you might have to keep me
stab-ded, if l go to the bad place.

267
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:22,186
- You're saying l might have to kill you.
- l am.

268
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,505
- Bite me.
- l will.

269
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,109
l mean, l do... mean it.

270
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:34,155
The darkest place l've ever been -
this is what lies beyond that.

271
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:37,910
- This is too important for me to...
- Buffy believes in you.

272
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:41,305
You know, Buffy - sweet girl, not that bright.

273
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:45,308
Hey, l'm the first one to call her out
when she's not making sense.

274
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:51,743
ln fact, this may have escaped
your keen notice, but l'm... kind of a brat.

275
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:55,191
l've always sort of gotten my way.

276
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:59,951
So you're gonna make it through this,
no matter how dark it gets.

277
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:02,026
Because now...

278
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,986
<i>you're</i> my way.

279
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,513
l'd better go over this again.

280
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,709
l'm all turned around. You're here, yeah?

281
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:27,629
- By the pillar. l'm protecting this area.
- That puts me over by the door.

282
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:30,946
Demons around the perimeter.
Right. l open the door.

283
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:34,744
You go through the door and
are confronted by Trogdor the Burninator.

284
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,030
Bugger it. Fight.

285
00:20:37,115 --> 00:20:40,266
Adios to five hit points.
Trogdor has badly wounded you.

286
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:43,745
Wait a minute.
What about my, uh... bag of illusions?

287
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:48,192
lllusions against a Burninator?
Silly, silly British man.

288
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:52,427
- l invoke a time flux on Trogdor.
- Step down, girlfriend, you can'tjust...

289
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:55,871
Ninth-level sorcerer,
and l carry the emerald chalice.

290
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,389
Trogdor is frozen in time. Deal with it.

291
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:01,069
Smackdown on Red Riding Hood.
This could get ugly.

292
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:04,113
Could it get uglier?
l was a highly respected watcher,

293
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:08,552
and now l'm a wounded dwarf
with the mystical strength of a doily.

294
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,626
l just wish l could sleep.

295
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:13,946
What kind of person could sleep
on a night like this?

296
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:16,708
- Only the crazy ones.
- <i>(snores)</i>

297
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:39,067
<i>(footsteps)</i>

298
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:03,869
Welcome to Sunnydale High.

299
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:07,265
There's no running in the halls,
no yelling, no gum chewing.

300
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:09,630
Apart from that, there's only one rule.

301
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:13,147
- lf they move, kill them.
- Potentials, in the basement.

302
00:22:13,235 --> 00:22:16,432
- Follow Faith and Spike.
- lf you need the bathroom, it's left.

303
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:21,111
lf you don't, picture what you're
about to face. Better to go now.

304
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,747
- My office is through there.
- <i>(Buffy)</i> lt's over the seal.

305
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:28,474
- l'll start getting you set up.
- Thanks.

306
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,705
OK, civilians.

307
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:35,027
lf vampires get upstairs, we've three areas
they could get through to another building,

308
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:39,745
then down into the sewers. Down the hall
in the atrium, the north hall here,

309
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:42,474
and through the lounge
to the science building.

310
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:45,149
Now, odds are, most of them will head there.

311
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:48,227
Teams of two, then.
l suggest you and l take the lounge.

312
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:51,030
- l concur.
- Xander, l want you with Dawn.

313
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:53,948
- l concur.
- We'll check out the atrium.

314
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:57,152
So that leaves me and
the dungeon master in the north hall?

315
00:22:57,235 --> 00:23:01,911
- We will defend it with our very lives.
- Yes. We will defend it with his very life.

316
00:23:01,995 --> 00:23:05,704
- Don't be afraid to use him as a shield.
- Good, yes, thanks.

317
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:12,030
l just wanna say how proud l am to die
for this very special cause with you guys.

318
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:14,185
There's some, um...

319
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:19,747
there's some people l'd like to thank,
both good and evil. Um...

320
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:21,905
A shout out to my brother Tucker,

321
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:26,034
who gave me the inspiration
to summon demons and also...

322
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:29,187
Nobody cares, you little monkey.

323
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:32,904
l'm gonna check out our field of engagement.

324
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:36,066
- Dawn...
- No.

325
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:42,225
Anything you say is gonna
sound like goodbye.

326
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:09,465
So, what do you guys wanna do tomorrow?

327
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:12,353
- Nothing strenuous.
- Mini golf is first to mind.

328
00:24:12,435 --> 00:24:15,950
- We can do better than that.
- l was thinking about shopping. As usual.

329
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,754
- There's an Arden B in the mall.
- l could use a few items.

330
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:21,395
Are we gonna discuss this?
Save the world to shop?

331
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:23,466
- l crave shoes.
- Aren't you on the patch?

332
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:25,671
- Those never work.
- Here l am, invisible...

333
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,588
See, l need a new look.
lt's this eye-patch thing.

334
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:32,793
- <i>(Buffy)</i> Go with the secret-agent look.
- <i>(Willow)</i> Or the puffy shirt, pirate...

335
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,389
The earth is definitely doomed.

336
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:06,546
You first, B.

337
00:25:31,995 --> 00:25:36,989
- <i>(Kennedy)</i> They should be in place.
- OK. Magic time.

338
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:39,794
You ready to... <i>(laughs)</i> kill me?

339
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,230
Starting to be.

340
00:25:42,315 --> 00:25:44,909
Good. Fun. Great.

341
00:25:46,155 --> 00:25:48,385
Brace yourself.

342
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,868
Come on, Red.

343
00:25:51,955 --> 00:25:53,866
Make it happen.

344
00:25:54,995 --> 00:25:59,989
Not to be a buzzkill, love, but my fabulous
accessory isn't exactly tingling with power.

345
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,224
l'm not worried.

346
00:26:01,315 --> 00:26:04,830
l'm getting zero juice here,
and l look like Elizabeth Taylor.

347
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:10,273
<i>(Faith)</i> Cheer up, Liz. Willow's big spell
doesn't work, it won't matter what you wear.

348
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:12,346
l'm not worried.

349
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:17,713
<i>(shouting and weapons clanging)</i>

350
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:42,545
- l'm not worried.
- <i>(Rona)</i> Really?

351
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,990
l'm flashing back
to Xander's bathroom speech.

352
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:47,464
- Buffy.
- l'm not worried.

353
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:51,230
As long as Willow
can work her spell before they...

354
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:52,987
see us.

355
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:03,385
Willow.

356
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,754
<i>(breathes heavily)</i>

357
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:13,032
Oh... my... Goddess!

358
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:18,352
So here's the part where you make a choice.

359
00:27:18,435 --> 00:27:21,586
What if you could have that power... now?

360
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,951
ln every generation, one slayer is born...

361
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:30,390
because a bunch of men who died
thousands of years ago made up that rule.

362
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:36,789
They were powerful men. This woman is
more powerful than all of them combined.

363
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:40,874
So l say we change the rule.

364
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:44,027
l say my power should be <i>our</i> power.

365
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:52,074
Tomorrow, Willow will use the essence
of this scythe to change our destiny.

366
00:27:53,155 --> 00:28:00,106
From now on, every girl in the world
who might be a slayer, will be a slayer.

367
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:04,313
<i>Every girl who could have the power,</i>
<i>will have the power.</i>

368
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:08,350
<i>Can stand up. Will stand up.</i>

369
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:10,346
Slayers.

370
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:12,949
<i>Every one of us.</i>

371
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:15,993
<i>Make your choice.</i>

372
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:18,509
<i>Are you ready to be strong?</i>

373
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:26,069
These guys are dust.

374
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:48,234
Willow?

375
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:04,272
You... are a goddess.

376
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:06,949
And you're a slayer.

377
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:10,669
Get this to Buffy.

378
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:17,505
Hah! That was nifty.

379
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:29,468
Buffy!

380
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:31,307
Catch!

381
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,191
l could get used to this.

382
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:01,430
<i>(Kennedy)</i> They're retreating.

383
00:30:01,515 --> 00:30:02,345
<i>(growling)</i>

384
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:05,074
l think they're coming.

385
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:08,386
Oh, God. l'm terrified. l didn't think.

386
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:12,946
l mean, l... l just figured <i>you'd</i> be terrified,
and l would be sarcastic about it.

387
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:17,108
Picture happy things - a lake, candy canes...

388
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:19,629
bunnies.

389
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:21,751
Bunnies!

390
00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:26,545
Floppy... hoppy... bunnies.

391
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:45,585
l have swimmer's ear!

392
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:56,146
<i>(sizzling)</i>

393
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:58,226
Buffy!

394
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,948
Whatever this thing does, l think it's...

395
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:04,151
Aargh!

396
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:08,865
Keep the line together!
Drive them to the edge! We can't let them...

397
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:29,952
Buffy!

398
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:38,466
Hold the line.

399
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:46,668
Uh! Ah!

400
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:06,712
They call that the greenhouse effect.
Very dangerous.

401
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:26,632
Rona!

402
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,429
Oh, no! Ow!

403
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:49,228
Mommy, this mortal wound is all... itchy.

404
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:57,190
You pulled a nice trick.
You came pretty close to smacking me down.

405
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,584
What more do you want?

406
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:04,154
l want you...

407
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:09,347
to get out of my face.

408
00:33:52,635 --> 00:33:54,785
Oh, bollocks.

409
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:01,433
Buffy!

410
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:03,312
Spike!

411
00:34:09,995 --> 00:34:12,145
Everybody out, now!

412
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:19,905
- l can feel it, Buffy.
- What?

413
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:23,186
My soul.

414
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,866
lt's really there.

415
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,744
Kinda stings.

416
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,952
- <i>(girl)</i> Get out of the way!
- What?

417
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:48,946
<i>(girl)</i> Hurry up!

418
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,865
The bus. Get 'em on the bus.

419
00:34:54,955 --> 00:34:57,708
Everybody, this way!

420
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:01,347
Anya!

421
00:35:02,635 --> 00:35:04,227
Anya!

422
00:35:10,395 --> 00:35:12,465
- Go on, then.
- No, you've done enough.

423
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,944
- You could still...
- You've beat them back.

424
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:17,469
lt's for me to do the cleanup.

425
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:20,226
Buffy, come on!

426
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:27,153
Gotta move, lamb. l think it's fair
to say school's out for bloody summer.

427
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:30,707
- Spike!
- l mean it! l gotta do this.

428
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:02,666
l love you.

429
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:07,786
No, you don't.

430
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:12,027
But thanks for sayin' it.

431
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:15,546
<i>(rumbling)</i>

432
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:18,786
Now go!

433
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:24,189
l wanna see how it ends.

434
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:53,027
<i>(laughs)</i>

435
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:12,467
Look at me! This is nothing!
Stay awake! This is nothing!

436
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:17,909
Why didn't l die?

437
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:54,586
Ease off. We're clear.

438
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:24,113
l don't understand. What did this?

439
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:28,867
Spike.

440
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:47,273
So, did you see?

441
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:50,313
- l was scared. l'm sorry.
- Did you see what happened?

442
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,784
l mean, was she...?

443
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,668
She was incredible.

444
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,223
She died saving my life.

445
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:07,226
That's my girl.

446
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:09,988
Always doing the stupid thing.

447
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:17,110
<i>(Faith)</i> lt's not bad. You just sit here.

448
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:19,993
- l'll get someone to...
- Hey.

449
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:22,669
Did... did we make it?

450
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:29,787
We made it. We won.

451
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:50,747
<i>(coughs)</i>

452
00:39:58,275 --> 00:39:59,833
Surprise.

453
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:15,471
Looks like the Hellmouth
is officially closed for business.

454
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:18,115
There is another one in Cleveland.

455
00:40:18,195 --> 00:40:20,755
Not to spoil the moment.

456
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,144
We saved the world.

457
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:26,147
We changed the world.

458
00:40:26,235 --> 00:40:30,114
l can feel them, Buffy. All over.

459
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:33,232
Slayers are awakening everywhere.

460
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:35,670
- We'll have to find them.
- We will.

461
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:39,873
Yes, because the mall was in Sunnydale,
so there's no hope of going there tomorrow.

462
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:43,186
We destroyed the mall?
l fought on the wrong side.

463
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:47,871
All those shops gone.
The Gap, Starbucks, Toys ''R'' Us.

464
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:51,186
Who will remember those landmarks
unless we tell the world?

465
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:54,392
- We have a lot of work ahead of us.
- Can l push him in?

466
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:58,707
- You've got my vote.
- l just wanna sleep, yo, for, like, a week.

467
00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:01,263
l guess we all could, if we wanted to.

468
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:02,424
Yeah.

469
00:41:02,515 --> 00:41:04,983
The First is scrunched, so...

470
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:07,589
What do you think we should do, Buffy?

471
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:10,189
You're not the one-and-only
chosen any more.

472
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:13,665
Just gotta live like a person. How's that feel?

473
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:17,031
<i>(Dawn)</i> Yeah, Buffy.
What are we gonna do now?
