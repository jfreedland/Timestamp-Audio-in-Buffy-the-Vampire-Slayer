2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:06,369
- You're just scared.
- Of course l'm scared.

3
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:09,809
Last time we were here,
33.3 bar per cent of us were flayed alive.

4
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:11,042
Nice job.

5
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,693
Do you have any idea
how hard it's been to act this cool?

6
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:16,367
That death thing was all part
of the master plan.

7
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:20,729
lf Short Round pulls off his end
of the bargain, we'll both become gods.

8
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:29,568
<i>(Dawn) l saw Mom.</i>

9
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:32,008
- Things are coming, Dawn.
- Why are you...?

10
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:35,085
When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you.

11
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:37,767
- lt wasn't her.
- What?

12
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:41,812
lt's the Big Bad, Dawn.
The one we knew was coming.

13
00:00:41,893 --> 00:00:42,803
What the hell happened?

14
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:47,762
This big evil that's been promising to devour
us - well, l think it's started chomping.

15
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:51,129
- Oh, God.
- Buffy, this thing knows us.

16
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:53,966
lt made us think
that we were talking to people we knew.

17
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:57,204
l'm just a guy with his ear to the ground,
but even l can feel it.

18
00:00:57,293 --> 00:01:01,047
<i>Something's coming. l don't know</i>
<i>what exactly, but something's brewing.</i>

19
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:05,411
<i>And it's so big, ugly and damned, it makes</i>
<i>you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces.</i>

20
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,282
Buffy, he's been feeding... on human blood.
That's gotta do stuff.

21
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:14,446
l think there was something there,
talking to him, making him do things.

22
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:18,082
<i>#</i> How could you use a poor maiden...

23
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:19,492
Spike!

24
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:25,970
l remember.

25
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:31,730
l've killed, and l can feel 'em.
l can feel every one of 'em.

26
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,365
There's something playing with us.

27
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:39,923
- Why is it doing this to me?
- l don't know.

28
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,971
- Help me.
- l'll help you.

29
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:44,362
This thing has been closer to Spike
than any of us.

30
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:49,322
- And if you wanna understand it....
- l'm gonna have to get close to Spike.

31
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:52,487
Robson, are you here?

32
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:55,121
Robson!

33
00:01:58,213 --> 00:02:01,011
- Dear God, l thought you...
- Gather them.

34
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:03,732
- What?
- lt's started.

35
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:07,605
lt's all right. l understand. l'll take care...

36
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:13,126
- So the basement was filled with bodies?
- Apparently.

37
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:19,608
And Spike could've sired countless others
and buried them around town.

38
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:23,962
And we're waiting for him to do what,
exactly? Do something crazy?

39
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,884
lt's not that simple.

40
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:30,967
Shouldn't we stab him in the chest? lsn't that
what we do when these things happen?

41
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:35,729
- Look, Buffy knows what she's doing.
- Xander, you know what we're talking about.

42
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:38,452
You've always been part
of the "Spike is evil" faction.

43
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,967
l've got a house to put back together.

44
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:44,409
Fine. You guys keep your heads
buried in the sand,

45
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:48,611
but we should prepare for the possibility
that William the Bloody is back.

47
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:01,529
Right. Looking good.
How do you feel?

48
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:04,366
- Good.
- Excellent. We've got work to do.

49
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:08,332
Do l have to do work right now? Can't l
just walk around for a while in my coat?

50
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:13,726
Don't go soft on me now. We're right in
the trench, and the exhaust port's in sight.

51
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:18,409
l thought that was it. l did what you told me.
lt's not my fault it didn't work.

52
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:21,371
- Why do l have to do all the wet work?
- Hey!

53
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:25,969
You know the rules.
l can't take corporeal form. Here. Feel.

54
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:32,926
- Cool.
- Pretty bitchin', right?

55
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:36,051
- l'm like Obi-Wan.
- Or Patrick Swayze.

56
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:40,166
Believe me,
l would do this stuff if l could.

57
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,005
l can't.

58
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:45,005
l need you. You're my iron fist.

59
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:48,292
l just don't think l can kill anybody else.

60
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:52,332
- Will you stop worrying about that?
- l didn't want to kill you. Warren made me.

61
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:56,645
Hey, l'm glad he did. This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

62
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,850
lt didn't hurt too much?
l'm not very good at stabbing.

63
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,685
You know, it wasn't that bad.

64
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:06,449
lt was like a sharp pain, then a burning,
then a general queasiness.

65
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:11,049
lt was like getting ulcers in high school, only
at the end l became one with light and hope.

66
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,169
l can't do it. l can't do it any more.

67
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,450
Hey, this isn't your fault, OK?

68
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,252
lt's my fault the ritual didn't work.
l screwed up.

69
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,689
l'm little. l don't have
as much blood as other people.

70
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:26,129
And l probably should've
told someone l was anaemic.

71
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:29,011
Don't worry. We're gonna fix it.

72
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,687
You gotta trust us.
We know what we're doing.

73
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:37,643
- l can't kill anybody else.
- OK, calm down. We can work around that.

74
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:49,206
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
We just can't take any chances.

75
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:51,124
Don't.

76
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:55,005
Make it tighter. The knots will give.

77
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:58,691
lf l get free, someone's gonna die.

78
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:58,364
Now, guys, look,
we can settle this one of two ways.

79
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:01,251
You can repaint the walls, or...

80
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:06,407
l can suspend you and report this
little incident on your permanent record.

81
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,927
Fine. Do that.

82
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:13,362
OK, l was bluffing.
l hadn't really thought that one through.

83
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:17,366
Listen, this whole
permanent-record thing is a myth.

84
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:19,921
Colleges never ask for
anything past SAT scores.

85
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:25,371
lt's not like employers are gonna call to check
how many days you missed in high school.

86
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:28,843
So, listen, l could suspend you,

87
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:32,528
but that would mean calling your parents,
alerting your teachers,

88
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:36,572
filling out paperwork and quite possibly
having to talk to the school board.

89
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:40,248
All of which sounds
positively exhausting to me.

90
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:42,770
No.

91
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:46,562
No, l think it would be much easier
if l just called the police.

92
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:49,611
Let them deal with it.

93
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:52,491
Oh, and, in case you were wondering,

94
00:06:52,573 --> 00:06:56,486
this is the part where l'm not bluffing.

95
00:06:56,573 --> 00:06:59,645
- We'll repaint it.
- Good job.

96
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,724
<i>(knock at door)</i>

97
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:04,604
Excuse me.

98
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,205
Miss Summers. l'm with students.

99
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:14,323
l just wanted to tell you that Buffy
won't be in today. She's sick.

100
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,766
Oh, no.

101
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,641
Yeah. Last night she was vomiting.
This morning she was vomiting more,

102
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:24,204
and then, just when we thought
she was done, she started vomiting again.

103
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,488
Yeah, we got that stomach flu going around.

104
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:30,805
Her exact words were
"l've got stuff coming out of both ends."

105
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:32,372
Thank you.

106
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,808
That's... very helpful.

107
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,282
Sure. No problem.

108
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,046
- Hey, guys. How's it going?
- Pretty good.

109
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:44,012
Tell your sister not to worry about it.
We'll soldier on without her here.

110
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:47,085
Just... tell her to concentrate
on getting better.

111
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:51,724
Yeah, she'll be fine. She just needs
to get some stuff out of her system.

112
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:55,728
l need to find him as soon as possible.
He's not answering any of his numbers.

113
00:07:55,813 --> 00:08:01,729
Miss Summers, the Watchers' Council does
not keep track of our lapsed employees.

114
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,930
Ever since Mr Giles
pulled up his stake in Sunnydale,

115
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:08,528
we've not made it our business
to follow his every move.

116
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:13,971
You don't need to get all British and dodgy.
l know you have ways of finding him.

117
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:17,329
l suppose if you feel the matter's urgent,
we can look into it.

118
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,723
- l'd appreciate it. Thank you.
- <i>Not at all. Good day.</i>

119
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,727
The girl knows nothing.

120
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:32,092
And we need to find Rupert Giles.

121
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:37,968
As soon as possible.

122
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:41,084
<i>(breathes jerkily)</i>

123
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,568
Can l do something?

124
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:03,962
l think you should probably g...

125
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,645
<i>(groans)</i>

126
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:08,045

00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:11,922
<i>(snarls and growls)</i>

128
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:22,283
He's been feasting on humans for weeks.
He's having some pretty bad withdrawals.

129
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:26,571
- l think we need to get him some blood.
- Do you want me to kill Anya?

130
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,847
No.

131
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,527
We should probably try
to wean him off humans.

132
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,810
- He'll have to make do with animal blood.
- l'll go get some.

133
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:37,044
- You don't mind?
- No, l have to get out of the house.

134
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:42,287
Xander's installing the new windows and he
keeps giving lectures on tool maintenance.

135
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,967
Tool talk - not my thing.

136
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,883
Thank you.

137
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:51,526
How are you doin' in there?

138
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:56,564
He's in pretty bad shape, past the point
where he can tell me anything.

139
00:09:56,653 --> 00:10:01,169
- l wasn't asking about him.
- l'll be OK.

140
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,844
<i>(Warren)</i> She won't feel a thing.
Just do it. Fast.

141
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:10,285
Cut her deep. Cut her quick.
lt'll be over before she knows what hit her.

142
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:14,286
- What if she squeals?
- Better go for her throat first.

143
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:15,647
<i>(squeals)</i>

144
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:18,008
<i>Babe 2: Pig in the City</i> was underrated.

145
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:20,084
- Don't think about Babe.
- Right.

146
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:23,006
You're Conan. You're the Destroyer.

147
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:28,006
lt's you against nature.
You're the hunter. You're primal.

148
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:30,891
You live off the land. You're Andrew.

149
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:33,362
Everyone knows you.
You play by your own rules.

150
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:36,251
- lt's kill or be killed.
- That'll do, pig!

<i>(pig squeals)</i>

152
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,367
You gotta corner it.

- Stay between it and the hall, or...
- <i>(pig squeals)</i>

154
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:53,692
That's the worst attempted
pig slaughtering l've ever seen.

155
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:57,971
l'm not very good at stabbing. lsn't there
some other way we could get blood?

156
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:00,521
Number 87.

157
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:05,206
l'd like 12 pork chops...

158
00:11:05,973 --> 00:11:08,282
two pounds of sausage...

159
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:12,084
eight quarts of pig's blood,
three steaks, um...

160
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:15,812
halibut, and uh...

161
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,043
some toothpaste...

162
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:23,242
This is a butcher's shop, Neo.
We don't sell toothpaste.

163
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,051
Um...

164
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,601
OK, just the other stuff then.

165
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:30,644
You got it.

166
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,283
Hi.

167
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,364
Ooh, steak sauce.

168
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:49,404
<i>(butcher)</i> Number 88.

169
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,684
Wait a minute!

170
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,524
- Don't kill me!
- l'm not gonna kill you.

171
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:03,366
Don't send me
to an eternal pain dimension.

172
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:05,762
- l'm not gonna.
- Warren killed Tara.

173
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:09,368
l didn't do it.
And he was aiming for Buffy anyway.

174
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:13,329
- Not making it better.
- And you got your revenge.

175
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:15,643
You killed my best friend. We're even.

176
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:19,772
Even? You think l get satisfaction
from what l did?

177
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:25,966
Maybe not, but let me keep my skin, OK?
l'm not bad. l'm not bad any more.

178
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:29,045
l'm good. l do good things now.

179
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,693
Then why do you need
lots and lots of blood?

180
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:38,728
l am bad. l'm bad, l'm evil,
but l'm protected by powerful forces.

181
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:42,886
Forces you can't even begin
to imagine... little girl.

182
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:46,761
lf you harm me you shall know the wrath
of he that is darkness and terror.

183
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:49,492
Your blood will boil.
You will know true suffering.

184
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:52,485
Stand down, she-witch.
Your defeat is at hand...

185
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:54,803
Shut your mouth.

186
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:57,043
l <i>am</i> a she-witch.

187
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,601
A very powerful she-witch.

188
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:03,891
Or "witch", as is more accurate.
l am not to be trifled with...

189
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:06,692
- But l...
- l'm talking. Don't interrupt me.

190
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:08,764
lnsignificant man.

191
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:12,652
l am Willow. l am death.

192
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:18,046
lf you dare defy me, l will call down my fury,
exact fresh vengeance,

193
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,966
and make your worst fears come true.

194
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,125
OK?

195
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:30,768
- Look who l found.
- Oh, this can't be good.

196
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,731
Guess who was buying
mass amounts of blood.

197
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,772
- Your hair's not even black any more.
- What're you doing back in town?

198
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:42,324
- You'll get nothin' out of me, carpenter.
- We'll see about that.

199
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:47,732
- Careful with my coat. lt's expensive.
- ls it new?

200
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:50,088
Hey. Ow!

201
00:13:50,173 --> 00:13:53,882
Now, we can do this
the hard way, if you want.

202
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:58,652
But believe me when l tell you,
this will go much easier

203
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:03,329
- if you just tell us what... you... know.
- Ow!

204
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:06,564
You're barkin' up the wrong asparagus.
l don't know anything.

205
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:10,328
Here's the thing. l don't believe you.

206
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,007
l haven't done anything wrong.

207
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:15,288
Then you won't mind
if we ask a few questions.

208
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:17,011
Yeah, OK.

209
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:20,165
Why were you buying blood
at the butcher shop?

210
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:22,289
l fell in love with a vampire in Mexico.

211
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:27,322
Now we're trying to make a go of it on
the straight and narrow, here in Sunnydale.

212
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:30,928
You think this is a game, junior?
People are dying.

213
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,846
- Friends' lives are in danger.
- Hey, Anya.

214
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:37,767
Now you wanna waste my time
with deceptions? Not on my watch!

215
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:39,684
Hey, Anya!

216
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:42,571
Can l talk to you outside for a second?

217
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:01,923
Did you see that?
l actually made him cry.

218
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:05,323
You were perfect. l worried l overdid it
with the "hard way" thing.

219
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,211
No, you were great!
l wasn't sure if l should slap him,

220
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:10,761
but then he made me want to,
so l thought "OK."

221
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:13,208
- He'll be singing in no time.
- What do we do now?

222
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:17,002
We let him stew in his own juices for a bit,
then we give him the hard brace.

223
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:19,891
Right. What's the status with your guy?

224
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,641
He's not talking yet.
We'll get there. How's your guy?

225
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,088
The weasel wants to sing.
He just needs a tune.

226
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:30,085
He's primed.
l'll be pumping him in no time.

227
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:34,003
He'll give us information soon.

228
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:43,485
Better?

229
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,603
Good.

230
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,402
l don't remember anything.

231
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:55,362
- You were having a pretty bad withdrawal.
- No, not that.

232
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:59,802
l don't remember... what l did.

233
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,530
- Nothing?
- Some flashes here and there.

234
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:10,523
lt's like l'm watching someone else...
do it, kill people.

235
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:16,449
l've been losing time for a while now.
Waking up in strange places.

236
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,006
When did your chip stop working?

237
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:25,324
l wasn't aware that it had, you know.
Not till now.

238
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:30,172
And the losing time?
How long has that been going on?

239
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:35,168
Oh, things have been wonky for me
ever since l got back. Ever since...

240
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:37,323
You got your soul.

241
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,964
l figured that's what it was like.
Been so long since l had one.

242
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:45,841
How did you do it?
How'd you get your soul back?

243
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,806
Saw a man about a girl.

244
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:56,127
l went to seek a legend out.

245
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:02,643
Travelled to the other side of the world,
made a deal with a demon.

246
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:07,124
- Just like that?
- No, notjust like that. There was a price.

247
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:09,329
There were trials.

248
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,369
Torture.

249
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:15,765
Pain and suffering... of sorts.

250
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:18,526
- Of sorts?
- Well, it's all relative, isn't it?

251
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:20,683
Meaning?

252
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:26,086
l have come to redefine the words "pain
and suffering" since l fell in love with you.

253
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,527
How can you say that?

254
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:38,083
l just slaughtered half of Sunnydale. l'm not
really worried about being polite any more.

255
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:40,687
So that's what this is about.

256
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:45,164
- You're feeling sorry for yourself, Spike?
- l'm feeling honest with myself.

257
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:47,369
You used me.

258
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:48,886
Yes.

259
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:52,171
You told me that, of course.

260
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,483
l never understood it though.

261
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,882
Not until now.

262
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,122
You hated yourself,
and you took it out on me.

263
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:05,368
You figured that outjust now?

264
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:10,603
A soul's not all about moonbeams
and penny whistles, love.

265
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:13,287
lt's about self-loathing.

266
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:16,763
l get it. l had to travel
around the world, but...

267
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:21,167
l understand you now.

268
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:25,371
- l understand the violence inside.
- Violence?

269
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:29,162
William the Bloody
now has insight into violence?

270
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:31,244
Not the same.

271
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:38,971
As bad as l was, as evil and as wretched
as l was, l never truly hated myself back then.

272
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,692
Not like l do now.

273
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:55,607
- How's your face?
- OK.

274
00:18:57,253 --> 00:19:00,643
Sorry about that.
She shouldn't have hit you.

275
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,365
OK.

276
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,804
Thirsty? Go on.

277
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,161
That chick's psycho.

278
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:17,767
You don't know the half of it.

279
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:20,242
She's a vengeance demon, you know.

280
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,324
She's bad news.

281
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:26,370
This one time
l saw her having sex with Spike.

282
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:31,163
- She's killed more men than smallpox.
- Does it still kill people?

283
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,802
She's killed a lot of men.
She tortures them.

284
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:37,771
Anyone who incurs her wrath.

285
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:40,321
One time she...

286
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,687
- Never mind.
- What?

287
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:44,492
- lt's not important.
- What did she do?

288
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:47,371
Well, there was this one guy.

289
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:52,083
There was this one guy.
He hurt her real bad, so she paid him back.

290
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:55,688
She killed him, but she did it real slow.

291
00:19:57,053 --> 00:20:01,683
See, first she stopped his heart,
and then she replaced it with darkness,

292
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:03,843
then made him live his life like that.

293
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:07,812
But he still had to go do his job
and see his friends

294
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:10,327
and wake up in the morning
and go to bed at night,

295
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:13,723
but he had to do it all... empty.

296
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:17,924
Without anything to look forward to. Ever.

297
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:21,892
- Sounds bad.
- Well, then she tore out his intestines,

298
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:24,362
- rubbed it in his face and took pictures.
- God.

299
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:26,967
But she's downstairs.
Don't worry about her.

300
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,487
- What if...
- See, the thing is,

301
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:31,768
we've all been a little on edge lately.

302
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:36,324
Bad things have been happening. The girls
are all looking for someone to blame.

303
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:39,291
- l didn't do anything.
- <i>(Anya)</i> You lying son of a bitch!

304
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,728
You're gonna tell us
what we need to know, now!

305
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:44,088
- Anya, no!
- Stop it!

306
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:47,290
Get off me, Harris!

307
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:53,248
- Come here, you pipsqueak!
- Xander, get her off me! l'll tell you!

308
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,405
l'll tell you what you need to know!

309
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:59,684
Excuse me.

310
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:07,645
Well.

311
00:21:10,213 --> 00:21:13,011
We've got ourselves a problem.

312
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,688
<i>(Andrew)</i> Somebody help. Ow!

313
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:18,843
Everything OK?

314
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:20,571
Fine.

315
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,482
OK.

316
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:30,322
<i>(Spike)</i> What'd l do, get it half-done?
Never send a boy to do a man's job.

317
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:33,923
<i>è</i> Oh, don't deceive me

318
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:36,163
<i>è</i> Oh, never leave me

319
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:47,213
- Who were you talking to?
- What's that?

320
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:49,648
l heard you.
Who were you talking to?

321
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:53,043
Nobody. l was just
keeping myself company.

322
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:56,841
- Are you OK?
- Fine.

323
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,530
How are you?

324
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:04,084
You could talk, or l could keep hitting you.
Believe me, l'd love to keep hitting you.

325
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:08,089
- Spike?
- l'm fine, Buffy. Really.

326
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:12,689
l'm just... feeling a bit peckish,
l suppose.

327
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:14,764
Do you mind?

328
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,562
We needed more blood
to activate the Seal of Dan...

329
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,489
Argh! Argh!

330
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:12,763
He didn't seem to want
anything to do with me.

331
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:15,242
He just pushed me aside
and charged at the wall.

332
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,927
- Are you hurt?
- Not really.

333
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,644
How's whatshisname?

334
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,725
He's got a chunk taken out of his neck
but he'll be all right.

335
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:27,931
Had to tie him up again but mainly to
keep him from scratching at his bandages.

336
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:31,528
- What the hell happened up there?
- l don't know.

337
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:34,650
Spike and l were having a conversation,
and he was fine.

338
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:38,362
l mean, you know, fine as Spike can be.
Then l went to check on you guys,

339
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:42,492
and when l got back, it was...
like he was a completely different person.

340
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:45,485
Different like
William-the-Bloody-type different?

341
00:23:45,573 --> 00:23:50,044
He was talking to someone. l heard through
the door. He was having this conversation.

342
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:53,808
- And then he started singing.
- Maybe it's another musical.

343
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:59,491
- A much crappier musical.
- He mentioned a song in the cellar.

344
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:02,485
He changed there too.
lnstantly became another person.

345
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:04,211
Trigger.

346
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:07,330
- The horse?
- No, in his head.

347
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,007
lt's a trigger.
lt's a brainwashing term.

348
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:12,732
lt's how the military makes sleeper agents.

349
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:19,082
They brainwash operatives and condition
them with a specific trigger, like a song,

350
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:22,324
that makes 'em drastically change
at a moment's notice.

351
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:24,973
ls this left over from your days in the army?

352
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:29,604
No, this is left over from every army movie
l've ever seen. But it makes sense.

353
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:32,685
We've had ghosts
or something haunting us, right?

354
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:36,846
Well, what if Spike's ghosts have figured out
a way to - not only haunt him -

355
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,322
what if they figured out how to control him?

356
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:42,723
Spike's been seeing things
since l found him in the basement.

357
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:48,922
So he gets his soul back, he starts seeing
spooky things, and he goes extra-extra-crazy.

358
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:52,801
This trigger. How do we...
holster or... safety or...

359
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:55,805
l don't know guns.
How do we make it stop?

360
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:58,043
Usually, the operative completes his task

361
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:01,603
and either blows his head off
or steals a submarine.

362
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:06,692
l need information. lf Spike's a bomb,
l need to know how to defuse him.

363
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:10,846
l wanna know what did this to him.
Spirits, ghosts, demons - check the lot.

364
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:14,403
Look for anything that could haunt
or possibly control like this.

365
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:16,529
l need to know what we're dealing with.

366
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:27,007
Did l hurt anybody?

367
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:29,527
You took a good bite out of Andrew.

368
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:32,085
Who?

369
00:27:32,173 --> 00:27:34,368
Tucker's brother.

370
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,523
Oh.

371
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,446
He'll be OK.

372
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,649
l don't remember.

373
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,884
lt's OK.

374
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:48,843
Buffy, l don't know why.

375
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:51,564
We think we do.

376
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:53,484
Something's playing you.

377
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:57,930
Some ghost or demon
has figured out how to control you.

378
00:27:58,453 --> 00:28:01,525
Got the gang researching it right now.

379
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:05,401
Xander has this theory
that you're being triggered.

380
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,409
Kill mm.

381
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:12,411
- What?
- Buffy, you have to kill me.

382
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:17,208
You don't understand.
When l left the room, l heard you talking to...

383
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:20,569
Do you have any idea what l'm capable of?

384
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:26,852
l was in the cellar with you.
l saw what you did.

385
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:31,449
l'm not talking about the cellar.
The people in the cellar got off easy.

386
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:34,730
l'm talking about me.

387
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,123
Buffy, you've never met the real me.

388
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:45,052
- l'm well aware of what you're capable of.
- No. You got off easy too.

389
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:56,165
Do you know how much blood you can drink
from a girl before she'll die? l do.

390
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:59,370
You see, the trick is to drinkjust enough,

391
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:03,287
to know how to damage them just enough

392
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:06,410
so that they'll still cry when you...

393
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:12,045
Cos it's not worth it if they don't cry.

394
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:15,810
lt's not your fault.
You're not the one doing this.

395
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:18,965
l already did it. lt's already done.

396
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:23,930
You wanna know
what l've done to girls Dawn's age?

397
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:29,483
This is me, Buffy.

398
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:32,326
You've got to kill me before l get out.

399
00:29:33,893 --> 00:29:37,283
We can keep you locked up.
Keep you here and we'll figure it out.

400
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:41,412
Have you ever really asked yourself
why you can't do it? Off me?

401
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:45,725
After everything l've done to you,
to people around you.

402
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:48,646
lt's not love. We both know that.

403
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:52,203
You fought by my side.
You've saved lives. You've helped...

404
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:54,284
Don't do that.

405
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:58,928
Don't rationalise this into some noble act.

406
00:30:00,053 --> 00:30:03,045
Because we both know the truth of it.

407
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,607
You like men who hurt you.

408
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:11,524
No.

409
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:15,806
You need the pain we cause you.

410
00:30:15,893 --> 00:30:19,442
You need the hate.
You need it to do yourjob, to be the Slayer.

411
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,330
No.

412
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:25,084
l don't hate like that.

413
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:29,171
Not you... or myself.

414
00:30:30,893 --> 00:30:33,487
Not any more.

415
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:38,363
You think you have insight now
because your soul's drenched in blood?

416
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:41,286
You don't know me.

417
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,523
You don't even know you.

418
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:48,892
Was that you who killed those people in the
cellar? Was it you who waited for those girls?

419
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,771
- There's no one else.
- That's not true.

420
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:55,050
Listen to me.

421
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:58,728
You're not alive because of hate or pain.

422
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:05,613
You're alive because l saw you change.
Because l saw your penance.

423
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:07,884
Window-dressing.

424
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:10,806
Be easier, wouldn't it, if it were an act.

425
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:12,884
But it's not.

426
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:19,125
You faced the monster inside of you
and you fought back.

427
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,125
- You risked everything to be a better man.
- Buffy...

428
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,965
And you can be.

429
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,612
You are.

430
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:30,603
You may not see it, but l do.

431
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:33,724
l do.

432
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:38,092
l believe in you, Spike.

433
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,725
- <i>(Xander)</i> Buffy!
- Dawn?

434
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,692
She's OK. ls this it?
l thought there was more of 'em.

435
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:14,126
Spike.

436
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:34,211
<i>(Xander)</i> They were so fast.

437
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:35,487
And organised.

438
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,565
They were after Spike all along.

439
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:41,451
And we were just in the way.

440
00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:49,486
l know these guys.

441
00:34:49,573 --> 00:34:52,167
l've fought them before.

442
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:55,368
We aren't being haunted.

443
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:59,605
This isn't some demon.
lt's all the same thing.

444
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:05,404
Spike's ghosts, the people
that you guys saw, "from beneath us..."

445
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:09,844
lt's all the same thing.

446
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:12,003
l know what we're up against.

447
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:15,884
The First.

448
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:24,564
<i>(man)</i> They took our files,
wiped out our records.

449
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:28,692
We've lost contact with operations
in Munich, Switzerland and Rome.

450
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:33,324
We've got casualty confirmations
coming in from as far away as Melbourne.

451
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:36,007
Sir, we are crippled.

452
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:41,003
lt's all right, Lydia.

453
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:44,369
We are still masters of our fate.

454
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:47,411
We are still captains of our souls.

455
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,324
Yes, sir.

456
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,526
Ladies and gentlemen.

457
00:35:58,613 --> 00:36:01,173
Our fears have been confirmed.

458
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:06,044
The First Evil has declared
all-out war on this institution.

459
00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:10,089
The first volleys proved most effective.

460
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:15,361
l, for one, think it's time we struck back.

461
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:21,287
Get me confirmations
on all remaining operatives.

462
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:24,648
Visuals and tacticals.

463
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:28,844
Highest alert.
Get them here as soon as possible.

464
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:31,493
Begin preparations for mobilisation.

465
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:34,883
Once we're accounted for,
l want to be ready to move.

466
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:38,409
- Sir?
- We'll be paying a visit to the Hellmouth.

467
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:44,364
"My friends,
these are the times that define us."

468
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,324
Proverbs 24:6.

"For by wise counsel
you shall make your war."

470
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:11,605
You'll have to excuse the spectacle,

471
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:15,891
but l've always been
a bit of a sucker for the old classics.

472
00:37:24,293 --> 00:37:26,090
Argh!

473
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:28,842
Oh!

474
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:36,001
Oh, don't look at me that way.

475
00:37:36,093 --> 00:37:38,288
l wanted to do this more subtle-like.

476
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:42,730
My harbingers have a tendency
to call attention to themselves.

477
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:44,405
Argh!

478
00:37:48,453 --> 00:37:51,525
You're the one who couldn't hold
his end of the bargain,

479
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:54,047
who couldn't take care of whatshisname,

480
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:57,842
who had to make breakthroughs
and learn something about himself.

481
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:59,969
Oh!

482
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:06,049
So now, fittingly, you're the one
who gets to do the honours.

483
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:09,726
l have to admit,
l'm glad it worked out this way.

484
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:15,171
l was going to bleed Andrew,
but you look a lot better with your shirt off.

485
00:38:20,493 --> 00:38:24,691
To be honest,
l'm getting a little tired of subtle.

486
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:31,926
l think it's about time we brought
some authority to our presence.

487
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:35,642
Now, Spike, you wanna see
what a real vampire looks like?
