00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:23,809
Obscurate nos
non diutius.

3
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,523
Now!

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,625
Aaaaah!

5
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,770
I think that
was the last.

6
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:58,943
Willow, you OK?

7
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:00,108
Yeah, I'm fine.

8
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:03,278
Th-The shaking is a side effect
of the fear.

9
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,343
Thank you.

10
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:06,185
If it wasn't for
that clouding spell...

11
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:10,318
Yeah, it went good.
Nothing melted like last time.

12
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:11,918
These babes were
wicked rowdy.

13
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:13,122
What's their deal?

14
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:14,459
I wish I knew.

15
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,729
Most of my sources
have dried up

16
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:21,601
since the Council
has relieved me of my duties.

17
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:23,606
I was aware there
was a nest here...

18
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,801
but quite frankly,
I expected it to be vampires.

19
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:26,808
These are new.

20
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:28,037
And improved.

21
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:29,511
Yes. I'm sorry.

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,172
I should've had you
better prepared...

23
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:33,580
and I should never
have allowed Willow and, uh...

24
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:36,313
and, uh...

25
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:41,583
I'm good...
We're fine.

26
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:44,919
Just a little bit dirty.

27
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:47,020
Good show, everyone.
Just great.

28
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,494
I think we have a hit.

29
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,728
Are you OK?

30
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:54,498
Tip-top, really.

31
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,767
If anyone sees
my spine laying around...

32
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:58,866
just try not
to step on it.

33
00:01:58,943 --> 00:02:01,173
Xander, one of these days,
you're gonna get yourself hurt.

34
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,270
- Or killed.
- Or both.

35
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:06,248
And, you know,
with the pain and the death...

36
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:08,911
maybe you shouldn't be
leaping into the fray like that.

37
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:11,386
Maybe you should be...
fray-adjacent.

38
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:13,218
Excuse me?
Who, at a crucial moment...

39
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,416
distracted the lead demon

40
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:16,756
by allowing her
to pummel him about the head?

41
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:20,058
Yeah. That was real manly
how you shrieked and all.

42
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,064
I think you'll find
that was more of a bellow.

43
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:25,067
What do we do with the trio here?
Should we burn them?

44
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:27,763
I brought marshmallows.

45
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:30,568
Occasionally,
I'm callous and strange.

46
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,131
I expect we can leave them.

47
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,871
I'm more interested
in finding out what they are...

48
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,709
and whether we can expect
more of their kind.

49
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,874
I hope not.
They're way too fit.

50
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:42,649
I say bring 'em on!

51
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,620
Uh, Xander,
I think in the future

52
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:49,148
perhaps it would be best if you
hung back to the rear of the battle...

53
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,625
for your own sake.

54
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:51,718
But, gee, Mr. White...

55
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:54,127
if Clark and Lois
get all the good stories...

56
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:55,722
I'll never be
a good reporter.

57
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:56,731
Hmm?

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,732
Jimmy Olsen joke, sir.

59
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,234
Pretty much gonna
be lost on you.

60
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:00,235
Sorry.

61
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:01,464
Hey, it's OK.

62
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,514
[Howling]

63
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:09,902
Hey, Doug, toss me one!

64
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:13,475
Les-man, I'm open!

65
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,035
Les, buddy!

66
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:17,048
Doug, right here, man.

67
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:18,276
Right here.

68
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,375
Doug, please.

69
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,612
All right!
It's all me!

70
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,163
Boy, I am so sorry.

71
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,631
Doug's arm is kinda
like spaghetti.

72
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,725
We're all so
very sad for him.

73
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:38,235
Is your lunch OK?

74
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:40,237
What are you, retarded?

75
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:42,830
No. No, I had to take
that test when I was 7.

76
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,170
A little slow
in some stuff...

77
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,835
mostly math and
spatial relations...

78
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,776
but certainly not challenged
or anything.

79
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:49,438
Can I get you
another soda?

80
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:51,745
I ought to cut
your face open.

81
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:54,877
Hey, hey, whoa. It was an accident.
Cool down.

82
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:00,458
You wanna be
startin' somethin'?

83
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:02,460
What?
Starting something?

84
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:04,792
Like that
MichaelJackson song, right?

85
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:06,490
That was a lot of fun.

86
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:09,159
* Too high to get over,
yeah, yeah *

87
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:10,496
Remember
that fun song?

88
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,503
I get my buddies
together...

89
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:16,007
we're gonna kick your ass
till it's a brand-new shape.

90
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:18,474
Now, get outta here.

91
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:29,345
Boy, of all the humiliations
you've had I've witnessed...

92
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,683
that was the latest.

93
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:32,018
I could've taken him.

94
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,684
Oh, please.
O'Toole would macramé your face.

95
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,022
He is a psycho...

96
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:38,722
which is still a lot cooler
than being a wuss.

97
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,061
Why is it that I've
come face-to-face

98
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,625
with vampires, demons, the most
hideous creatures hell ever spit out...

99
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:47,729
and I'm still afraid
of a little bully likeJack O'Toole?

100
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,207
Because, unlike all those creatures
you've come face-to-face with...

101
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,574
Jack actually noticed
you were there.

102
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,806
Why am I surprised
by how comforting you're not?

103
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:59,783
It must be really hard when
all your friends have superpowers...

104
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:02,047
slayer, werewolf,
witches, vampires...

105
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,883
and you're, like,
this little nothing.

106
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:07,983
You must feel
likeJimmy Olsen.

107
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,893
I was just talking to...
Hey, mind your own business.

108
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:12,396
Ooh, I struck a nerve.

109
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,432
The boy that had no cool.

110
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,558
I happen to be an integral part
of that group.

111
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:18,068
I have a lot to offer.

112
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:19,569
- Oh, please.
- I do!

113
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,435
"Integral part"
of the group?

114
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,942
Xander, you're the useless part
of the group.

115
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,443
You're the Zeppo.

116
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,207
"Cool." Look it up.

117
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:34,344
It's something that a subliterate that's
repeated 12th grade 3 times has...

118
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:35,443
and you don't.

119
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:42,188
There was no part of that
that wasn't fun.

120
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:51,302
But it's just that it's bugging me...
this "cool" thing.

121
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,134
I mean, what is it?
How do you get it?

122
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,231
Who doesn't have it?

123
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:58,572
And who decides
who doesn't have it?

124
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:00,703
What is the essence
of cool?

125
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:03,046
Not sure.

126
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:04,707
I mean, you yourself, Oz...

127
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,717
are considered
more or less cool.

128
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:08,082
Why is that?

129
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:09,085
Am I?

130
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,553
Is it about the talking?

131
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:13,147
You know, the way
you tend to express yourself

132
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,318
in short,
noncommittal phrases?

133
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,656
Could be.

134
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,992
No. You're in a band.

135
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,328
That's like
a business-class ticket to cool

136
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,334
with complimentary
mojo after takeoff.

137
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,733
I gotta learn
an instrument.

138
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:26,566
Is it hard
to play guitar?

139
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:28,299
Not the way I play it.

140
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:30,466
But on the other hand...
eighth grade.

141
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:33,136
I'm taking the flugelhorn
and getting zero trim...

142
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,805
so the whole instrument thing
could be a mislead.

143
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,473
But you need a thing...

144
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:40,143
one thing
nobody else has.

145
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:41,515
What do I have?

146
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,349
An exciting new obsession...

147
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,913
which I feel makes
you very special.

148
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,754
Now with the mocking.

149
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:51,262
Which I can handle because
I know I'm right about this.

150
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,767
I'm on the track.
I just need to find my thing.

151
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,825
It seems like you're
overthinking it.

152
00:07:57,903 --> 00:08:00,428
You got some identity issues.
It's not...

153
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:02,097
The end of the world?

154
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:03,436
Can they do that?

155
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:04,770
They seem fairly committed.

156
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:10,038
The Sisterhood ofJhe
is an apocalypse cult.

157
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,983
They exist solely to bring about
the world's destruction...

158
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:16,885
and we've not seen the last of them.
More will follow.

159
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,822
And they're here in Sunnydale
for what, Demon Expo?

160
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:22,189
Buffy, this is
no laughing matter.

161
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,194
Hence my no laughing.

162
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:26,789
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:30,130
I know I'm no longer
your official Watcher, but...

164
00:08:31,236 --> 00:08:32,328
Hey.

165
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:33,462
Hey.

166
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:36,405
Um, you're cutting it a bit close.

167
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,238
Well, you know me.

168
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:45,311
Well, do we know
why they're here?

169
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:49,753
I think so. Based on
some artifacts I found with them...

170
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:54,724
and taking into account
the current astral cycle...

171
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:57,557
Giles, I don't need
to see the math.

172
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,866
They intend
to open the hellmouth.

173
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,136
The hellmouth.

174
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:10,504
The one that opens...

175
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:13,908
About 20 feet from
where you're standing.

176
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,211
[Howling]

177
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,721
And if it opens?

178
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,249
Do you remember the demon that
almost got out the night I died?

179
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:30,589
Every nightmare I have

180
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:33,426
that doesn't revolve
around academic failure

181
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:35,591
or public nudity
is about that thing.

182
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:38,261
In fact, once I dreamt
that it attacked me

183
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,930
while I was late
for a test and naked.

184
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:43,338
Well, it'll be
the first to come out...

185
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:46,969
and Giles says it won't
be the worst by a long shot.

186
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,981
The world will be overrun
with demons if we don't stop it.

187
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,813
Do we know when this
is supposed to happen?

188
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,978
Giles is trying
to narrow it down.

189
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,990
If you're up for it,
we're heading into deep research mode.

190
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,323
I'd be offended if
you haven't already counted me in.

191
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:08,662
Thanks, Wil. There's something
about this one that... scares me.

192
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,166
I need my Willow.

193
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,226
Oh, you don't have
to be afraid...

194
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,236
[Beep Beep]

195
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:14,602
You girls need a lift?

196
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,842
What is this?

197
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,707
What do you mean,
what is it?

198
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:21,711
It's my thing.

199
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,180
Your thing?

200
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,739
My thing!

201
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:27,307
Is this a penis metaphor?

202
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,649
It's my thing
that makes me cool.

203
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:31,484
You know,
that makes me unique.

204
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,581
I'm "car guy"...
guy with the car.

205
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:35,250
How can you afford it?

206
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,090
Uncle Roary,
stacking up the DUIs...

207
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:41,826
let me rent this bad boy
till he's mobile again.

208
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,698
Well... it's nice.

209
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,465
Could you sound
a little less enthused?

210
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:48,938
- Sorry.
- Evil.

211
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,497
- Big?
- Biggest.

212
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:52,440
Maybe more than
I can handle.

213
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,945
Then we'll handle it
together.

214
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:57,277
You know I'm here for you.

215
00:10:57,349 --> 00:11:00,045
Just tell me
what I can do.

216
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,983
I'll take 2 glazed,
2 cinnamon...

217
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,816
couple cream-filled
and a jelly.

218
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,823
No. Let's round that out
to 4 jellies.

219
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:07,483
Ooh, is some evil
going on?

220
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,493
Must be big for them
to entrust you

221
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:11,153
with this
daredevil mission.

222
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,992
Cordelia.
Feel free to drop dead

223
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:15,498
of a wasting disease
in the next 20 seconds.

224
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,194
Ooh, again,
I strike the nerve.

225
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,237
I am the surgeon of mean.

226
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,737
I'm kinda busy
right now, OK?

227
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,033
Right.
Buffy need your help?

228
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:24,041
Can you say "expendable"?

229
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:25,701
You think
you know everything.

230
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:27,677
I think I know you.

231
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:28,838
That's a laugh.

232
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:30,541
What, you got a shiny car...

233
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:31,912
and now you're someone new?

234
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,178
Like anybody
even cares about...

235
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:36,982
Is that your car?

236
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:40,388
Why, uh... yes, it is.

237
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,188
'57 Chevy Bel Aire...

238
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:44,888
283 C.I. D...

239
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:48,490
solid lifter...
fuel-injected V-8.

240
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,866
Uh... very possibly.

241
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:53,427
How does she handle?

242
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,997
Like a dream about
warm, sticky things.

243
00:11:57,075 --> 00:12:00,340
Would you like to go
for a little drive?

244
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,573
You busy?

245
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:04,581
Just gotta drop
this stuff off...

246
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,709
and then I would describe myself
as... expendable.

247
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:32,245
...and then I started
seeing Dave Peck.

248
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,542
Had a Thunderbird,
engine completely tricked out...

249
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:36,707
but the upholstery
was kind of shot.

250
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:38,842
So then I started
seeing his friend Mike.

251
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,352
Not the Mike
with the Mercedes.

252
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,785
The Mike with the Mustang...

253
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,323
An '82 V-6.
You know the look.

254
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:46,018
Angel!

255
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:47,081
Buddy!

256
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,926
Friend-buddy.
You wanna sit and talk?

257
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:52,123
I'm looking for Buffy.

258
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,928
Library last I saw.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,094
Something's happening.
I've seen portents.

260
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,502
The apocalypse.
They're on top of it.

261
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:01,871
I don't think they know
what they're dealing with.

262
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:03,967
Let's go there...
and tell them that.

263
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,706
No. It's best
you stay out of harm's way.

264
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,214
But I can help.

265
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:12,647
Hey, you wanna go
for another drive?

266
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,885
You know, it's not like
I haven't helped before.

267
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:23,555
I've done some quality violence
for those people.

268
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,564
Do they even
think about that?

269
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:30,228
I mean...

270
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:32,897
they act like I'm
some sort of klutz.

271
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:34,565
[Metal Crunching]

272
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:36,404
Oh, God!
Are you all right?

273
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:38,409
Oh, God!

274
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:41,079
Stay calm.

275
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:44,310
Little fender bender.
It's not...

276
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:51,052
the end of the world.

277
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,072
He's cranky.

278
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,869
It's a good night for it.

279
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:13,743
Can't dogs sense when there's
an earthquake, and they bark?

280
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:16,873
Or cows lie down
or something?

281
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,884
"Sisterhood ofJhe."

282
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:21,819
"Race of female demons,
fierce warriors..."

283
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:25,847
Eww. "...celebrate victory
in battle by eating their foes."

284
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:27,894
They couldn't just pour Gatorade
on each other?

285
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:31,658
Wouldn't even take
my calls. Idiots.

286
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:34,359
- Anything useful in the books?
- Not wildly.

287
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:37,335
We still have the Books of Pherion
to go through.

288
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:39,395
I'm getting
itchy feet, Giles.

289
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:40,939
We don't turn up
something soon...

290
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:42,565
I'm gonna hit
the streets.

291
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:43,574
Maybe check out Willy's.

292
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:45,736
Fine.
Where are you going?

293
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:48,747
Um, to try and contact
the spirit guides.

294
00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:52,376
They exist out of time,
but have knowledge of the future.

295
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:57,219
I have no idea if they will respond
to my efforts, but I have to try.

296
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,953
All we know is that the fate
of the entire world rests on it.

297
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,858
Did you eat
all the jellies?

298
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:08,561
- Did you want a jelly?
- I always have a jelly.

299
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:11,536
I'm always the one that says
"Let's have a jelly in the mix."

300
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:14,233
We're sorry. Buffy had 3.

301
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:19,335
No matter.
If Xander makes another run...

302
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:21,346
No. Xander's out of this.

303
00:15:21,414 --> 00:15:23,348
He nearly got killed
last time we fought.

304
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,351
This whole thing will be easier
if we know he's safe.

305
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:29,115
Oh, gosh, Jack,
are... are you OK?

306
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,123
I am really sorry
about that...

307
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,421
but your car came
out of nowhere.

308
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:36,090
I was parked.

309
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:38,722
Exactly.
Look, I can cover the damages.

310
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:42,256
I don't have insurance
in the strictest sense of the word...

311
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,269
but I have
a little money.

312
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:46,601
The important thing
is that we're all right

313
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:49,107
and we can work this out
like two reasonable...

314
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:51,040
frontiersmen.

315
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,203
Where do you want it?

316
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:54,109
What?

317
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,579
Where do you want it?

318
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:58,413
I'm fairly certain
I don't want it at all...

319
00:15:58,485 --> 00:15:59,747
but, uh, thank you.

320
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:02,219
Wow. Cool knife.

321
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,157
Yeah. Great knife.

322
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:08,956
Although I think
it may technically be a sword.

323
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,553
She's called "Katie."

324
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,564
You gave it
a girl's name.

325
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:15,226
How very serial killer
of you.

326
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:18,134
Listen, I think
we should be going.

327
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:21,230
Are you scared?

328
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:23,571
Would that
make you happy?

329
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:27,306
Your woman looking on,
you can't stand up to me?

330
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,280
Don't you feel pathetic?

331
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:32,113
Mostly I feel Katie.

332
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:37,387
You know what the difference
between you and me is?

333
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:40,688
Again... Katie's
springing to mind.

334
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,785
Fear.

335
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,130
Who has the least fear.

336
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,928
And it has
nothing to do

337
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:50,333
with who has
the big, sharp...

338
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:53,038
Come on.

339
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:55,972
I want to go
for a drive.

340
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,339
I'm bored.

341
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,277
Oh, gee, I'm really sorry
my life-and-death situation

342
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:02,041
isn't exciting enough
for you...

343
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:06,177
Hey!

344
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,854
What's going on?

345
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:12,289
Nothing. Just rasslin'.

346
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,661
O'Toole. Heh heh.

347
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:18,630
What a surprise.

348
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:22,167
He attack you?

349
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:28,533
No. Just
blowing off steam.

350
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:30,576
Two guys rasslin'.

351
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,577
But not in a gay way.

352
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:34,306
Do it somewhere else, huh?

353
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:39,577
What?

354
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:41,210
That was all right.

355
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:43,778
Could've narked on me.
Didn't do it.

356
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:45,518
That's decent of you.

357
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:49,691
I like you.

358
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:51,996
Yea?

359
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:54,727
You two wanna
have some fun?

360
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:56,769
Like, with driving?

361
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:57,996
Yeah.

362
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:00,096
What do you have
in mind?

363
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:04,940
I was on my way to get the boys.
Gonna cruise around.

364
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:08,276
We'll take your wheels.

365
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,748
What about your car?

366
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,079
It ain't mine.

367
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:17,418
Great. Where to?

368
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,082
Gonna get the boys!

369
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,219
Yeah.

370
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,691
So, where're the boys?

371
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,637
Jack: He calls forth
the spirit of Uurthu, the restless.

372
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:35,299
No one shall speak.

373
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,434
He shall arise!

374
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,777
Hear me. The blood of the earth
shall restore him...

375
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:50,388
and he shall arise.

376
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,053
Shall arise.

377
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,303
Buddy.

378
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,804
Bob...

379
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:10,274
you big, hideous corpse...
come here!

380
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,744
Aaah!

381
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:17,010
Ha ha ha ha!

382
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,983
I'll call ya!

383
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:21,520
Man, you raised me!

384
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:24,079
I told you Grandpappy
could work that mojo.

385
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:26,819
- Big Bob is back in action!
- Yes!

386
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,827
- D-aah!
- D-aah!

387
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,523
Oh, man, I can't believe
you raised me.

388
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:32,860
That is so awesome!

389
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,262
You're the coolest.

390
00:19:36,336 --> 00:19:39,169
Maybe I should just let you guys
catch up.

391
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:42,868
Bob, this is Xander.
He's our wheel man.

392
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:43,931
Hey.

393
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:46,838
Howdy.

394
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,540
Dude, where are
the other guys?

395
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:49,877
We gotta go get 'em.

396
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:51,211
- Absolutely.
- All right.

397
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:54,219
Are, um...
Are all your friends dead?

398
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:55,379
Xander, let's roll.

399
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:56,717
How long I been down?

400
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:59,451
8 months. I had to wait
till the stars aligned.

401
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,459
8 months. I got some
catching up to do.

402
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:03,461
Walker, Texas Ranger...
You been taping 'em?

403
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:04,461
- Every ep.
- All right.

404
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,293
We're gonna get
the guys together...

405
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:07,799
and we're gonna party, man!

406
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,301
It's gonna be a night to remember!
Yeah!

407
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,133
I'm sensing that.

408
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:15,140
Jack: The blood of the earth
shall restore him...

409
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,470
and he shall arise.

410
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:20,902
Dudes!

411
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,914
Beer!

412
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,108
[Speaking Latin]

413
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:08,551
Giles, hey...

414
00:21:08,622 --> 00:21:10,920
what's going on?

415
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:16,588
Oh, uh, I was just trying
to gain access to the spirit guides.

416
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:18,631
Not going very well,
I'm afraid.

417
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:20,792
What are you doing here?

418
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:24,359
Oh, we were just raising,
um... some heck.

419
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:25,996
Xander!

420
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:27,005
Let's go!

421
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:31,943
Listen, do you guys
need any help?

422
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:35,004
Hmm? Oh, no.
Thank you.

423
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:38,643
Probably best if you stay out
of trouble.

424
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,243
No chance of that.

425
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,584
Xander! Motor!

426
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:48,026
There's something...
different about this menace.

427
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:52,088
Something in the air...
the stench of death.

428
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:53,655
Yeah, I think it's Bob.

429
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:56,464
We may all be called upon
to fight when it happens.

430
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:59,437
When what happens,
exactly?

431
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:01,599
- Come on!
- I'd better go.

432
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:05,304
Hopefully, we shall have time
to prepare. All we need is a few weeks.

433
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,639
Tonight?

434
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:08,704
Before sunrise.

435
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:11,546
That's what they said.

436
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:13,210
Why did they do this?

437
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:14,981
They were looking for Angel.

438
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:15,987
Angel? Why?

439
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:19,287
Said they were coming
after you, too...

440
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,455
and nothing could stand in their way
because tonight was the night...

441
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,555
Oh, man.

442
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:27,566
The ambulance is on its way.

443
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:30,034
Look, kid, my clientele

444
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:32,367
ain't exactly
nuns and orphans...

445
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:35,340
but I never seen anything
like these demons.

446
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:38,935
I'm gonna stop them.

447
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:41,606
That hellmouth opens...

448
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:47,620
they're gonna be the least of
your problems is my train of thought.

449
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:51,714
If I were you...
I'd go find Angel...

450
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:55,057
go somewhere
quiet together.

451
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:59,497
I'd be thinking about how
I wanna spend my last night on Earth.

452
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:03,525
Let's get some beer!

453
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:04,865
Yeah!

454
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:07,873
Let's go
pick up some girls, man.

455
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:10,705
We'll hang out
at Taco Bell...

456
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:13,177
get some girls,
go cruise around.

457
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:14,941
I wanna bake a cake.

458
00:23:15,015 --> 00:23:16,880
Hey, we need
some beers, though.

459
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,046
I can't believe you got shot, man.
Was it them Jackals?

460
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:22,782
Are you kidding?
We wiped them out

461
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:24,687
after they threw you
off the bridge.

462
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:26,851
Oh, man.
You guys are the best, man.

463
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,394
The best!
I mean that.

464
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:29,723
There's a liquor store.

465
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:31,525
Little Armenian guy
runs the place?

466
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:33,623
He had a gun
behind the counter.

467
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:40,635
Hey... we should
go kick his ass!

468
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:42,937
- Yeah!
- Yeaaaaah!

469
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:46,410
If you guys want me
to drop you off somewhere, that's...

470
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:48,106
Nah. You're with us now.

471
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:50,945
Yeah, you on the team now,
baby. Whoo-hoo!

472
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:53,977
What're we gonna do?

473
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:55,453
I've heard
some interesting suggestions...

474
00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:58,650
but I'm gonna have to go with Dickie's.
Let's bake a cake.

475
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:02,593
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Ha ha ha!

476
00:24:05,732 --> 00:24:09,429
All right. You stay here
and keep the motor running.

477
00:24:09,502 --> 00:24:12,938
This time of night,
I'm pretty sure nothing's open.

478
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:18,309
But they're always
open for crime.

479
00:24:22,382 --> 00:24:26,318
OK... now
I'm involved in crime.

480
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:27,978
I'm the criminal element.

481
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:30,181
Having a car sure is cool.

482
00:24:30,257 --> 00:24:33,488
Willow: Thank you.
Sorry to wake you.

483
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,255
Wil!

484
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:40,362
Xander, what are
you doing here?

485
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,697
Nothing.
Certainly not crime.

486
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:44,202
Wh-What about you?

487
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:47,206
I needed supplies for
a protection spell.

488
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:50,471
Buffy called from Angel's.
It's happening tonight.

489
00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:53,205
And that thing that's happening
would be...?

490
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,612
I can't stay.
Buffy'll need this.

491
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:02,445
I love you, Xander.

492
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:09,157
OK, that's it.
I'm gonna...

493
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:11,322
Where you going?

494
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:13,161
Look, something's
just come up.

495
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,963
You gonna bail on me,
is that it?

496
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:19,028
- We got cake mix.
- Where you wanna bake it?

497
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:21,073
Xander's looking to leave.

498
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:22,631
No way.

499
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:24,677
We need a wheel man.

500
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:26,974
Xander doesn't feel like
he's part of the group.

501
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,412
No. It's just I'm kinda busy.

502
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:30,244
He doesn't feel
like part of the group

503
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:32,683
because he hasn't
been initiated.

504
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:33,741
Do you think he's ready?

505
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,220
I think he's earned his stripes.

506
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:38,553
I say we let him in, boys.

507
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:42,186
Great. I wanna be
in the gang, sure.

508
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:43,923
All right! Yeah.

509
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:45,828
- That's the spirit.
- Yeah.

510
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:48,424
What do I gotta do?

511
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,932
You gotta die.

512
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:00,879
All right, guys,
what...

513
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:02,676
Let's just talk about this.

514
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:04,910
You want to be part
of the gang now, don't you?

515
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:06,418
Yes, yes...

516
00:26:06,486 --> 00:26:08,579
but I'm not dying
to be in the gang...

517
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:10,589
if you get the, um...

518
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:12,522
the pun there.

519
00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:16,392
What, are you...
are you too good to be dead?

520
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:19,789
You got a problem
with dead people?

521
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:22,733
What aboutJack?
Jack's not dead.

522
00:26:25,138 --> 00:26:26,628
[Jack Laughs]

523
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:30,966
Drive-by 3 weeks ago.

524
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:32,636
Oh, boy.

525
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:34,509
Grandpappy found my body.

526
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:37,948
I wasn't gone but 10 minutes
before he raised me.

527
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:39,815
It's a rush, man.

528
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:42,320
Let's kill Xander.
It'll be fun.

529
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:44,721
Yeah, man. You could be
a full-fledged member.

530
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:48,784
Come on, Xander.
Take it like a man.

531
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:50,193
All right. Enough.

532
00:26:50,263 --> 00:26:51,525
You guys have had your fun...

533
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:53,589
but you forgot
about one thing.

534
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:56,593
Get him!

535
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:11,643
Rrr. Damn him!

536
00:27:11,718 --> 00:27:13,652
There goes the wheels.

537
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,880
He took all our stuff, man.

538
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:16,785
I want to bake a cake.

539
00:27:16,856 --> 00:27:18,346
It's all right.

540
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:20,359
We'll get more.

541
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:22,452
The night is young.

542
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:26,663
I'd say that's pretty much

543
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:28,462
enough excitement
for one evening.

544
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:31,265
Aah. Ooh.

545
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,027
Get in!

546
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,365
Rrr!

547
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:18,378
You think demon mama
followed us?

548
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:19,821
No, we're cool.

549
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,155
The bitch dislocated
my shoulder, though.

550
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:25,752
Hold me.

551
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,471
That's better.

552
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,105
She got me
really wound up.

553
00:28:48,953 --> 00:28:52,980
A fight like that
and no kill...

554
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:57,889
I'm about ready to pop.

555
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:59,896
Really?

556
00:29:01,432 --> 00:29:02,626
Pop?

557
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,634
You up for it?

558
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,034
Oh, I'm up.

559
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:15,005
I'm suddenly very up.

560
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,479
It's just, um...

561
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,779
I've never been up
with people before.

562
00:29:26,524 --> 00:29:28,287
Just relax...

563
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,293
and take your pants off.

564
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:32,488
Those two concepts

565
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,326
are antithetical.

566
00:29:47,144 --> 00:29:48,168
Don't worry.

567
00:29:50,147 --> 00:29:52,012
I'll steer you
around the curves.

568
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,608
Did I mention that I'm having
a very strange night?

569
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:18,575
That was great.
I got to shower.

570
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,343
I've never seen him
like this.

571
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,252
It's the hellmouth.
He can sense it's going to open.

572
00:30:32,323 --> 00:30:34,154
Be ready just in case.

573
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,591
Now, don't hesitate.

574
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,253
Do it.

575
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:41,263
Now, Oz...

576
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:42,424
[Growls]

577
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:45,194
Again!

578
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:53,875
Ah.

579
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:58,543
We've got to move him
before he wakes up.

580
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:00,379
Sorry.

581
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:04,114
I hope you're not mad at me
in the morning.

582
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:36,043
Hey.

583
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,918
They're not baking
any cake.

584
00:31:46,997 --> 00:31:48,931
Long gone.

585
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:52,162
Probably loaded with supplies.
Got to think.

586
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:55,569
I can't believe
I had sex.

587
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:56,765
OK. Bombs.

588
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,673
Already-dead guys
with bombs.

589
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:01,973
Oh, man.
I'm out of my league.

590
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,946
Buffy will know what to do.

591
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:05,947
I don't know what to do.

592
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:07,813
Then let me
decide for you.

593
00:32:09,253 --> 00:32:11,949
- I can face this thing.
- You can't.

594
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:13,319
Look, I can at least
buy you enough time

595
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,324
for Willow's spell
to bind it.

596
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:19,886
Buffy, this is worse
than anything we've ever faced.

597
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:22,762
Honey,
it's the only way.

598
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,961
I can't watch you die
again.

599
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:30,674
I love you.

600
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,134
I love you.

601
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,700
Nothing can change that.

602
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,803
Not even death.

603
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,280
Don't talk to me like that.

604
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,817
You may be ready to go...

605
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:43,045
but I am not ready
to lose you.

606
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,451
OK, this is my fight...

607
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:46,489
and if you won't do it
my way, then you're...

608
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:48,491
[Throat Clears]

609
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:51,791
Hey.

610
00:32:51,862 --> 00:32:53,989
I've got this, um...

611
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:57,056
There's this, uh...

612
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,131
It's probably a bad time.

613
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:07,034
Can I help?

614
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:12,811
OK.

615
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:25,985
OK, I can work this out.

616
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:27,291
I just got to figure out

617
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:28,991
what they'd
be likely to bomb.

618
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:36,701
Giles: Terra, vente,
ignis et pluvia.

619
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:38,969
Cuncta quattuor numina...

620
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:41,841
vos obsecro.

621
00:33:41,912 --> 00:33:43,846
Defendete nos

622
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:47,315
a recente malo resoluto.

623
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:49,477
OK.

624
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:50,850
Oz is moved.

625
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:52,946
He could barely walk
after that mickey I gave him...

626
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:55,116
but we made it.

627
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:57,126
Is he going to be
all right there?

628
00:33:57,194 --> 00:33:58,786
Anywhere is safer
than here.

629
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,659
Help me
with the candles.

630
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:03,196
We're doing
the binding spell

631
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:04,700
from the Hebron's Almanac?

632
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:06,201
Yes, but once it's ready...

633
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,966
you're to stay back
and let me finish the recitation.

634
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,031
Don't argue.
I want you safe.

635
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:14,168
Who knows what's going
to come up from beneath us.

636
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,653
[Laughter]

637
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,014
Whoo!

638
00:34:34,164 --> 00:34:36,655
[Laughs]

639
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:39,066
This is going
to be large.

640
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:41,070
Oh, yeah.
[Laughs]

641
00:34:47,644 --> 00:34:50,579
Giles will know what to do.

642
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:53,639
He's way more calm
than Buffy.

643
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:56,482
[Laughing]

644
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,521
OK, I need a plan.

645
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:04,955
Hey, our wheels.
[Laughs]

646
00:35:06,797 --> 00:35:09,595
Hey. Hey. Hey!

647
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,040
- Stop. Come on, man. Stop.
- Where's the bomb?

648
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,635
It's in the high school.

649
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:24,010
In the school where?

650
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,311
Oh, God.
This really, really hurts.

651
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:29,310
Stop!

652
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:31,217
It's in the... It's
in the boiler room.

653
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:32,380
All right.

654
00:35:32,456 --> 00:35:33,923
Now I'm going
to ask you this once...

655
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:35,515
and you better pray
you get the answer right.

656
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,524
OK, OK.

657
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,992
How do I defuse...

658
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:39,028
Aah!

659
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,328
I probably should've
left out that whole middle part.

660
00:35:45,469 --> 00:35:48,233
He's headed
for the school!

661
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,237
There he is!

662
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,567
Where's a slayer
when you need one?

663
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:05,878
Oh, my God.
It's grown.

664
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:18,921
Wow.

665
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:22,694
Jack: Come on, man!

666
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:30,296
Bob: Which way?

667
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:32,704
He couldn't have
gotten far.

668
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,469
Let's split up.

669
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,779
Good for chopping.

670
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,399
Now, this is what
I call fun.

671
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:23,617
Should've learned by now.
If you're gonna play with fire...

672
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:26,183
you gotta expect
sooner or later...

673
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:28,320
I wasn't finished!

674
00:37:28,397 --> 00:37:30,194
Note to self: Less talk.

675
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,097
Faith, go for the heart!

676
00:37:58,894 --> 00:38:01,089
[Screaming]

677
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:08,195
OK, boiler room.

678
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,795
Other way.

679
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:27,316
Hello, nasty.

680
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,024
Less than 2 minutes.

681
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:44,869
Dumb guy. Little bomb.
How hard can it be?

682
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:55,081
It just got harder.

683
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,015
I'm not leaving till
that thing's disarmed.

684
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,280
I guess you're not leaving.

685
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:09,462
I'm gonna carve you up
and serve you with gravy.

686
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:13,023
You piss me off, boy.
Now you pay the price.

687
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,535
First the eyes,
then the tongue.

688
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,538
I'm gonna break every
one of your fingers.

689
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,540
You gonna do all that
in 49 seconds?

690
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:36,385
I know what you're thinkin'.
Can I get by him?

691
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,449
Get up the stairs,
out of the building?

692
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:41,553
Seconds ticking away.
I don't love your chances.

693
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,495
Then you'll die too.

694
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,055
Yeah, looks like.

695
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,829
So I guess the question
really is...

696
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:50,303
Who has less fear?

697
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:53,808
I'm not afraid to die.
I'm already dead.

698
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:56,343
Yeah, but this is different.

699
00:39:56,411 --> 00:40:00,541
Being blowed up isn't walking around
and drinking with your buddies dead.

700
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:02,913
It's little bits being
swept up by a janitor dead...

701
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,475
and I don't think
you're ready for that.

702
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:18,095
Are you?

703
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:23,131
I like the quiet.

704
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:28,743
Omnia...

705
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,004
vasa...

706
00:40:30,078 --> 00:40:31,340
veritatis!

707
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:33,005
Now, Buffy!

708
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:09,507
Good boy.

709
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:22,358
I don't think I wanna be seeing you
on campus anymore, Jack.

710
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,682
I'm not going
anywhere, Harris.

711
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:45,948
The first time
you turn your back...

712
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:47,352
Aah!

713
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,807
Even after the hellmouth
was closed...

714
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:58,439
we could still
hear it screaming.

715
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:05,019
But Angel's gonna be OK?

716
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:07,579
He was only out
for a few minutes.

717
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:09,682
Longest of my life.

718
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:12,455
I will never forget
that thing's face.

719
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,827
Its real face, I mean.

720
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:15,830
Giles: Yes.

721
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:19,164
I don't know
how you managed.

722
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:23,865
It was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

723
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:26,909
Stupidest.

724
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,037
But the world
continues to turn.

725
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:33,548
No one will ever know

726
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,448
how close it came
to stopping.

727
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:38,282
Never know what we did.

728
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,585
Guys.

729
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:42,022
Oz: Hey.

730
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,584
Xander. Boy, you're lucky
you weren't at school last night.

731
00:42:45,662 --> 00:42:47,687
It was crazed.

732
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:52,132
Well, uh,
give me the quiet life.

733
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,534
I'm gonna grab a snack.
Anyone want?

734
00:42:54,604 --> 00:42:55,935
No, thank you.

735
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:56,938
Oz?

736
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,737
No. Oddly full today.

737
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,209
OK.

738
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:08,716
Ooh, look,
it's Mr. Excitement.

739
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:10,582
On another life-or-death
doughnut mission...

740
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,952
or are we just cruising
for bimbos again...

741
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,389
giving them lessons
in lack of cool?

742
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:19,959
What?

743
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,031
What?

744
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,160
What?

745
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:34,557
