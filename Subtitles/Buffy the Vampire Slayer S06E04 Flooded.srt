Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,792
Mom?

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,551
I'm sorry. Your mother's dead.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,148
Anya, you wanna marry me?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,074

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,352
"I've gone. Not one for long goodbyes,
I thought it best to slip out quietly. "

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,993
"Love to you all. Giles. "

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,509
There he goes.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,710
Guys, I need you on board here.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,833
This is deep stuff, Willow.
We're talking about raising the dead.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,359
It's time we stopped talking.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,993
What if something does go wrong?

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,078
I can do this, I promise.
But not without you.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,510
Osiris, here lies the warrior of the people.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,198
Let her cross over.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,436
Release her.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,469
It was Buffy, right?
We saw her and it was really Buffy?

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,397
- I think we screwed it up.
- No.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,514
She's just disoriented from being
tormented in some Hell dimension.

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,789
She's been through a lot.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,069
What did you do?

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,453
I haven't been to a Hell dimension
just of late,

23
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:04,591
but I do know a thing or two about torment.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,553
Wherever I was...

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,029
I was happy.

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,912
I think I was in Heaven.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,271
I was torn out of there by my friends.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,518
Everything here is hard... and violent.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,198
This is Hell.

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,835
So... we meet at last, Mr Drippy.

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,232
- Want me to call a plumber?
- No.

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,191
- You sure?
- Yes.

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,676
- Got the number.
- Dawn, I'm on it, OK?

34
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,718
There. All better.

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,990
Man. How much water
can they fit in one set of pipes?

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,389
If I understand right,
the entire city water supply.

37
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,275
- It's like little clown cars in the circus.
- Told you we should've called the plumber.

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,235
You were right.
Plumber will make everything good.

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,079
Dawnie, you're not eating breakfast.

40
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,874
Dawn, breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,468
It's unbelievably important.

42
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,877
You should eat breakfast
at least three times a day.

43
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,074
I'll, um... grab something before school.

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,075
And a big Sunnydale round of applause for
Tito the Amazing, plumber extraordinaire.

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,792
How's it look down there?

46
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,559
Like we should start gathering up
two of every animal.

47
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,117
Basically, your pipes are shot. The whole
system's gonna have to be replaced.

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,470
What you need is a full copper re-pipe job.

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,559
Full copper re-pipe?
That sounds potentially pricey.

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,150
Well, if you have any questions,
our number's on the invoice.

51
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,030
That's a weird phone number.

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,352
Oh, wait. Is that the bill?

53
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,075
Hey. Tito cut you a good deal.
Those are his bargain prices.

54
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,919
- I did a little haggling for you.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,114
So we'll pay him. What's the big deal?

56
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,110
Buffy, I know you're still
getting back on your feet after...

57
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,629
Lying flat on my back?

58
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,709
Yeah. But there's some money stuff
we're gonna have to talk to you about.

59
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,912
OK. So you're telling me I'm broke?

60
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,275
- Not yet, but...
- Money's definitely becoming an issue.

61
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,755
As in your being almost out of it.

62
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,032
But I haven't spent any money.
I was all dead and frugal.

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,280
I know this comes as a bit of a shock
after... a bit of a shock.

64
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,516
It took us by surprise too.

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,556
Your mother prepared everything really well.
She had insurance... life insurance.

66
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,309
Which should have left you covered,
but... hospital bills.

67
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,878
- Pretty much sucked up all the money.
- Which you're still haemorrhaging.

68
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,917
- How am I doing that?
- No, not you. The house.

69
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,273
See, this house, just sitting here,
doing nothing, by itself costs money.

70
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,876
So what do we do?

71
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,992
Easy. We burn the house to the ground
and collect the insurance.

72
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,515
Plus, fire - pretty.

73
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,750
You guys, I'm kidding.

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
OK, it's bills, it's money.

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,188
It's pieces of paper sent by bureaucrats
that we've never even met.

76
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,675
It's not like it's the end of the world.

77
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,718
Which is too bad, you know,
cos that I'm really good at.

78
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,520
I'll take care of this. I promise.

79
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,669
I... just don't know how yet.

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,794
I know how.

81
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,955
If you wanna pay every bill here,
and every bill coming,

82
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,517
and have enough to start
a nice college fund for Dawn,

83
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,515
start charging.

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,879
- For what?
- Slaying vampires!

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,074
You're providing a valuable service
to the whole community. I say cash in.

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,558
Well, that's an idea... you would have.

87
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,795
Any other suggestions?

88
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,993
Well, I mean, it's not so crazy.

89
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,352
Yes, it is! You can't charge innocent people
for saving their lives.

90
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,516
- Spider-Man does.
- He does not!

91
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,756
- Does too.
- Does no...

92
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,557
Xander?

93
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,435
"Action is his reward. "

94
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,358
Why don't you ever take my side?

95
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,553
What are you talking about, taking
your side? Anya, I am your side!

96
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,636
You're throwin' away a gold mine.

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,516
Come on.

98
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,392
Wait up.

99
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,636
Anya! What's wrong with you?

100
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,718
Ask your best friend Spider-Man.
If you won't support me...

101
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,116
I'm totally supportive!
I'm a flying buttress of support!

102
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,196
No, you're not.

103
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,433
This is because I haven't told them
about the engagement.

104
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,916
No... Maybe...

105
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,476
Yes. It's painful and confusing!

106
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,558
I mean, first you give me
this beautiful ring,

107
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,671
and then I can't wear it in public.

108
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,439
Do you know how depressing that is?

109
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,439
Anya, I promise,
your waiting days are almost over.

110
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,596
I know it's frustrating,

111
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,111
but the way I understand this marriage
thing, it's kind of a forever deal.

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,948
Not if you never get started.

113
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,393
Don't you wanna get married?

114
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,435
Yes.

115
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,313
So then why won't you tell them?

116
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,191
Because... I'm still getting used
to the miracle of a steady paycheck

117
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,118
and getting out of my parents' house.

118
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,196
And this...

119
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,630
this husband thing, it's a big step.

120
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,558
Or... a lot of little ones.

121
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,756
And... I love you so much.

122
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,749
I just want... every step to be just right.

123
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,590
Really?

124
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,351
Hey! You tricked me!

125
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,790
Just now, with your fancy talk and lips!

126
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,799
You keep doing this, and I keep forgetting,
and you keep stalling!

127
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,753
- Anya!
- When are you gonna grow up, Xander?

128
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,471
There's a first time for everything
is my philosophy.

129
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,716
This is my first big loan.

130
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,510
Collateral? No problem.

131
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,232
No problem. No problem.

132
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,273
I love that tie. I'm a problem solver.
Let's crunch those numbers!

133
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,836
Stupid skirt.

134
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,836
- Hello.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

135
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,431
- Carl Savitsky, loan officer.
- Buffy Summers, loan applier-for.

136
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,277
I didn't know what you would need,
so I brought everything.

137
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,233
- I'm very responsible in that way.
- OK.

138
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,710
I don't think I'll need this... or these.

139
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,239
Old report cards... definitely not.

140
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,520
So, about my getting a loan...

141
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,634
Yes, well, um... it looks as if,
financially,

142
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,844
we have a bit of a tangle.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,393
I know. And I figured you could just
cut through that tangle with scissors.

144
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,318
You know, where the loan is the scissors?

145
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,477
Ms Summers, the only collateral
you have is your house,

146
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,266
which was never fully leveraged
and has been losing equity...

147
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:00,957
over the last several years.

148
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,550
For some reason, Sunnydale property
values aren't competitive.

149
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,717
Refinancing's out of the question.

150
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,155
Are you saying you won't give me my loan?

151
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,876
Well, the problem is
you have no income. No job.

152
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,836
No job?

153
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,511
I wish.

154
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,712
Hey! Are you in the wrong line?

155
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,990
That's for deposits, that's withdrawals,

156
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,112
and this one... is for
getting kicked in the face.

157
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,436
Stupid skirt.

158
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,598
May I?

159
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,919
Put the girl down.

160
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,755
These things? Never helpful.

161
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,589
Now, about my loan.

162
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,554
I'm not saying I'm charging you
for saving your life or anything, but...

163
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,750
let's talk rates.

164
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,349
He still turned you down? That's crazy!

165
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,474
Even if the bank did get robbed, which
you battling demons couldn't possibly know,

166
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,398
you would think there would be
some kind of reward.

167
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,354
They're, like, "We won't give you money
unless you prove you don't need it. "

168
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,755
What kind of system is that?

169
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,155
You're askin' the wrong gal.

170
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,639
Buffy, you're mad.

171
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,355
You noticed. It'll pass.

172
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,872
No. Anger is a big, powerful emotion
you should feel.

173
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,950
Well, that's good then.

174
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,948
- It's gone now.
- OK, let me make you mad again.

175
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,399
Uh... Ready?

176
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,072
Last semester, I slept with Riley.

177
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,231
- And, you know, I really doubt it.
- Caught me. Big fib.

178
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,194
To cover up the sleazy affair
I had with Angel.

179
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,992
Will, what the hell are you doing?

180
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,354
- Pissing you off.
- Yes, true.

181
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,471
Why?

182
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,479
Well, cos... you know...
since you've been back,

183
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,913
you haven't exactly been big with
the whole range of human emotions thing.

184
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,237
What do you mean?

185
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,351
Well, you haven't...

186
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,277
No, I mean, it's just, um...

187
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,988
You know, this is really my problem.
I'm just... I'm all over the place.

188
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,240
You should just forget
I even said anything, cos...

189
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,591
Well, cos... you know... banks, man.

190
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,753
Don't be such a wiener dog. Look at them.

191
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,118
Researching demons for the billionth time.

192
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,835
They could use a peppy boost of happy news.

193
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,394
You're right. I'll tell them.

194
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,475
- As soon as Buffy and Willow come in.
- Chicken.

195
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,033
- Will you stop?
- Dare you.

196
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,357
Anya, if I tell them we're engaged
right after you dared me to,

197
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,234
wouldn't you always wonder
if that's the only reason I did it?

198
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,476
Score one for Captain Logic.

199
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,993
No, no. Captain Logic is not steering this
tugboat. I smell Captain Fear at the wheel.

200
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,963
God, I hate this. This tone in my voice?

201
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:24,353
I dislike it more than you,
and I'm closer to it.

202
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,314
Oh, come on, Tara.
I am so old enough to do research.

203
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,829
Do you really think I'm not mature enough?

204
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,033
I think you're very mature for your age,
but you're still only 15.

205
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Right. 15, as in teenager. You know,
if you don't let me look at the pictures,

206
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,438
I'm gonna learn everything
I know about demons on the street.

207
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,039
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

208
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,277
See? No biggie. I can totally handle it.

209
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,314
That's a weird place for a horn.

210
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,593
That's not a horn.

211
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,512
You know, I still don't get it.
What kind of a demon would rob a bank?

212
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,598
- The kind that wants money.
- What do you even call that?

213
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,870
This?

214
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,118
I'm guessing on how you say it.
It's got an apostrophe.

215
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,756
I think it's M'Fashnik. Like "Mmm, cookies."

216
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,115
Or maybe M'Fashnik. Like "Muh... Fashnik."

217
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,996
This your guy?

218
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,756
You do research now? Want a cappuccino
and a pack of cigarettes to go with it?

219
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,527
Would you just look at the picture?

220
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:46,635
Not the profile
for your typical bank robber.

221
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,354
Maybe they turned down his loan application.

222
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,868
That's him. Big bad.
This thing was strong, guys.

223
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,276
No weapons that I could see, but still...

224
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,039
.. real... dangerous.

225
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,670
Oh, God, Buffy!

226
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,750
You're alive. You're here.

227
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,276
And you're still... remarkably strong.

228
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,951
Oh. Sorry.

229
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,753
Willow told me,
but I didn't let myself believe it.

230
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,270
I take a little getting used to.
I'm still getting used to me.

231
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,710
It's... You're...

232
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,395
- A miracle.
- Yes.

233
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,751
But then I always thought so.

234
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,116
So...

235
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,558
I can start. How was England?

236
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,311
How was... life?

237
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,798
I'm not really sure how to answer that.

238
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,913
Well, I arrived home.
I, uh, met with the Council...

239
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,508
- Always a good time.
- Yes.

240
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,472
Otherwise, there's nothing really to report.
I, um... keep a flat in Bath.

241
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,558
I... met with a few old friends.

242
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,847
Almost made a new one, which I think is...

243
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,638
statistically impossible
for a man of my age.

244
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,559
- And now you're back.
- Yes.

245
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,632
Wow.

246
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,355
Giles, are you miserable about it,
or just really British?

247
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,835
I can't lie to you, Buffy.

248
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,948
Leaving Sunnydale was... difficult.

249
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,548
And, uh... coming back is...

250
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,437
I'm guessing the word is "inconvenient"?

251
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,516
No.

252
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,950
Bewildering?

253
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,632
And how are you... really?

254
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,238
- You look tired.
- Me? Nah. Fine.

255
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,549
I mean, you know, sleeping's hard,

256
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,717
but just because of the whole
waking up in a box thing.

257
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,278
So maybe waking up's the problem -
but just for a second.

258
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,474
I sleep OK. Great, even.

259
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,989
Except, you know, for the dreams.

260
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,753
You seem to be doing remarkably well
under extreme circumstances.

261
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,836
I'm proud of you.

262
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,312
Well, actually it wasn't me.
Willow brought me back. I just lay there.

263
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,591
- No, I meant...
- I know what you meant.

264
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,675
It was just a little post-postmortem comedy.

265
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,436
Well, I... better start prepping. Slayage.

266
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,235
- Yes, there is always that, isn't there?
- Seems that way.

267
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,153
Giles!

268
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,594
We're so glad to see you. We missed you.

269
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,110
- You can't have the store back.
- I know.

270
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,111
Do we have information on this
new demon that I...

271
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:58,109
suddenly find desperately interesting?

272
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,391
- That we do.
- This one robs banks.

273
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,915
I found him.

274
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,069
- M'Fashnik. Oh.
- Aha! Like "Mm, cookies. "

275
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,120
- No, quite different, actually.
- You know it?

276
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,277
By reputation. They come from
a long line of mercenary demons

277
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,712
that perform acts of slaughter
and mayhem for the highest bidder.

278
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,956
Well, it is the American way.

279
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,038
Yes, but the question now becomes

280
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,118
what's powerful enough
to control one of those things?

281
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,269
We had a deal. You got what you wanted,
now give me what I want -

282
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,834
the head of the Slayer.

283
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,359
- OK.
- Sure.

284
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,550
We can do that.

285
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,077
You hired me to create
chaos and carnage for you.

286
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,236
Told me you were powerful men,

287
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,036
commanding machines, magics,
the demon realms below.

288
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,958
- We are.
- We're, like, supervillains.

289
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,758
- Which one of you is the leader?
- I am.

290
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,434
- I will kill the leader.
- He is.

291
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,314
- I will kill you all.
- Wait!

292
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,916
No fair!

293
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,429
It's not our fault the Slayer was there.

294
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,233
- We said we'd pay you, and we're gonna.
- Yes!

295
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,710
Truly, Lord Jonathan
is the wisest of us all.

296
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,832
Yeah, long live our noble lord and master.

297
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,190
You guys suck.

298
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,271
You can't pay me with paper, tiny king.
You pitted me against the Slayer.

299
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,834
For that, I must kill you.

300
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:47,317
Then I will suck dry your bones
and use them to beat your subjects to death.

301
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,558
Whoa, whoa! Big guy, hey.
Let's back things up a parsec.

302
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,558
You kill us... everybody loses.

303
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,592
You let us live, we give you...

304
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,712
- Give me what?
- Name it!

305
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,831
Well, between the three of us,
we can pretty much do anything.

306
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,829
Like if you want a spell to make you look
supercool to the other demons?

307
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,410
I'm all over that action, my friend.

308
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:20,031
Or, just throwin' it out, robot girlfriend?

309
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,869
For those long, lonely nights
after a hard day's slaughter?

310
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,070
You could do this?

311
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,589
Don't trust him.
Robo pimp-daddy's all mouth.

312
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,996
Shut up! You're just mad
I wouldn't build you Christina Ricci.

313
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,917
- You owe me, man.
- Or else what?

314
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,192
You'll train another pack of devil dogs
to ruin my prom? Graduated!

315
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,709
That wasn't me.
How many times do I have to say it?

316
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,879
- The prom thing was my brother Tucker.
- Yeah, well, tell him I was at that prom.

317
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,834
Hello! Screen wipe, new scene.
I had nothing to do with the devil dogs.

318
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,317
I trained flying demon monkeys to
attack the school play. School play, dude!

319
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,393
- That was cool. That was kinda cool.
- Everyone was, like, "Run, Juliet!"

320
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,956
Enough!

321
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,195
Nothing you can offer me
will satisfy your debt to me.

322
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,518
I don't want your toys, or your spells,
flying monkey demons...

323
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,551
I want the Slayer dead!

324
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,669
- OK.
- Done.

325
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,678
One dead Slayer comin' up.
Could you give us a minute?

326
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,950
For what?

327
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,679
Well, we really wanna nail down
the optimum method...

328
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:27,080
for us to wipe out the Slayer for you.

329
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,718
Make sure it involves... pain.

330
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,556
I know they're so cute you could die,
but... it's all I got.

331
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,797
Think nothing of it. It's, um... whimsical.

332
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,593
They were mine when I was little.
Couldn't find the guest sheets.

333
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,075
Mom always did this stuff.

334
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,436
They don't actually fit.

335
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,791
I blame the sofa.
We need one of those pull-out kinds.

336
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,791
The kind with no payments
till two-thousand-and-infinity.

337
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,273
What?

338
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,278
Oh, it's... just money stuff.

339
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,195
It turns out Mom left me some,

340
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,031
and, while I was dead, it got squandered
on luxuries like food and clothing.

341
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,355
How bad is it?

342
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,758
Anya says pretty bad.
I'm kinda taking her word for it.

343
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,479
Actually, I'm trying to
not think about it.

344
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,079
Sound policy. At least for tonight.

345
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,950
Figured I'd put it out of my mind,
you know, take a break,

346
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,230
get some perspective.

347
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,477
And then wake up at 4am terrified.

348
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,508
You're putting too much
pressure on yourself.

349
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,713
I mean, to return from
some unknown level of Hell...

350
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,674
It's only natural that coming back
will be a process.

351
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,635
In the meantime, I'm scaring people.

352
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,639
Well, that can take time too.

353
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,669
Well, if it's any consolation,
life can be pretty overwhelming

354
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,156
even for people
who haven't been... where you have.

355
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,952
I guess.

356
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,516
Tomorrow morning, you and I will
sit down and go through everything.

357
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,111
Every bill, one by one.
We'll work it out together.

358
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,030
I'm glad you're back.

359
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,196
Well, I'm glad you are too.

360
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,351
Are we really gonna kill her?

361
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,870
- That's so sad.
- Shut up, Whine-athan.

362
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,833
But... I don't want to kill Buffy either.

363
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,748
Yeah, she saved my life a bunch of times.
Plus, she's hot.

364
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,270
- It's her or us. We have to do it.
- We're talking about murder.

365
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,235
No, we're talking about staying alive, and
as this is my mom's house, what I say goes.

366
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,275
But aside from the moral issues, and
the mess, we can get in trouble for murder.

367
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,269
Duh! The last I checked, the authorities
also frown on bank robbery too, you genius!

368
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,710
I don't even know if we could kill Buffy.
She's got superstrength.

369
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,276
Killing people... this is not why
we got together in the first place.

370
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,313
Yeah. We teamed up with one clear,
supercool mission statement. Remember?

371
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,788
So... you guys wanna team up
and take over Sunnydale?

372
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,439
OK.

373
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,032
- Of course I remember. It was last month.
- Then you know we have a mission!

374
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,993
Shrink rays, trained gorillas.

375
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,110
Workable prototype jetpacks,

376
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,708
and chicks, chicks, chicks.

377
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,470
- I know that's the action I signed on for.
- Me too. Ixnay on the urder-may.

378
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,316
- Vote.
- OK. Who's for not killing Buffy?

379
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,676
Agreed.

380
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,756
So what are we gonna do
about this M'Fashnik guy?

381
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,156
Ah! Wait here, OK? I got an idea.

382
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,911
Here's the Slayer's name and address.
You wanna kill her, make it so.

383
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,550
How'd you make him do that?

384
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,875
What are you, some kind of... Jedi?

385
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,875
The Force can sometimes
have great power on the weak-minded.

386
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,275
Hey, Giles.

387
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,358
You have a good talk with Buffy?

388
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,436
Yes, now she's back.

389
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,949
Isn't it awesome?

390
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,680
Tell me about the spell you performed.

391
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,268
Oh, OK. First of all, so scary.

392
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,189
Like, the Blair Witch
would have had to watch like this.

393
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,270
And this giant snake came out of my mouth,
and there was all this energy crackling,

394
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,995
and this pack of demons interrupted,
but I totally kept it together.

395
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,998
And then, next thing you know, Buffy.

396
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,035
You're a very stupid girl.

397
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,195
What? Giles...

398
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,311
Do you have any idea what you've done?

399
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,512
The forces you've harnessed,
the lines you've crossed?

400
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,074
I thought you'd be impressed or something.

401
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,954
Oh, don't worry, you've...
made a very deep impression.

402
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,513
Of everyone here,

403
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,792
you were the one that I trusted most
to respect the forces of nature.

404
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,831
Are you saying you don't trust me?

405
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,474
Think what you've done to Buffy.

406
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,068
- I brought her back.
- At incredible risk!

407
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,153
Risk? Of what? Making her deader?

408
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,836
Of killing us all, unleashing Hell on Earth.
Shall I go on?

409
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,632
No!

410
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,469
Giles, I did what I had to do.
I did what nobody else could do.

411
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,388
Oh, others in this world can do what
you did. You just don't wanna meet them.

412
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,838
No, probably not, but...
well, they're the bad guys.

413
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,076
I'm not a bad guy.

414
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,270
I brought Buffy back into this world,

415
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,916
and maybe the word you should be
looking for is "congratulations".

416
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,519
Having Buffy back in this world
makes me feel indescribably wonderful,

417
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,110
but I wouldn't congratulate you
if you'd jumped off a cliff and survived.

418
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,232
- That's not what I did, Giles.
- You were lucky.

419
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,994
I wasn't lucky. I was amazing.

420
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,510
- How would you know? You weren't there.
- I'd have stopped you.

421
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,031
The magics you channelled are more
ferocious than anything you can understand,

422
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,869
and you are lucky to be alive,
you rank, arrogant amateur!

423
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,309
You're right.

424
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,910
The magics I used are very powerful.
I'm very powerful.

425
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,157
And maybe it's not such a good idea
for you to piss me off.

426
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,475
Come on, Giles. I don't wanna fight.
Let's not, OK?

427
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,277
I'll think about what you said,
and you... try to be happy Buffy's back.

428
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,837
We still don't know where she was...
or what happened to her.

429
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,072
And I'm far from convinced
she's come out of all this undamaged.

430
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,791
Hello, Spike.

431
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,999
You hear all that noise?

432
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,630
Just enough to make me feel crappy.

433
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,555
You know Watcher-boy
doesn't mean anything by it.

434
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,350
I guess.

435
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,310
Everyone...

436
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,436
They all care.

437
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,477
They all care so much, it...
makes it all harder.

438
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,875
I'm not sure I followed you
round that bend, love.

439
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,230
I don't know...

440
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,677
I just... I feel like I'm spending
all of my time trying to be OK,

441
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:08,028
so they don't worry.

442
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,116
It's exhausting.

443
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,716
And then I...

444
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,718
And that makes them worry even more.

445
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,468
You want me to take them out?

446
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,151
Give me a hell of a headache,
but I could probably thin the herd a little.

447
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,954
Knew I could get a grin.

448
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,472
Why are you always around
when I'm miserable?

449
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,318
Cos that's when you're alone, I reckon.

450
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,591
I'm not one for crowds myself these days.

451
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,790
Me, neither.

452
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,229
That works out nicely then.

453
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,029
So what do you know about finances?

454
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,196
Dawn?

455
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,396
- Couldn't sleep?
- Not really. You?

456
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,556
Evidently not.

457
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,592
You ever try mixing parts
of every cereal you got in one bowl?

458
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,157
Does it work?

459
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,078
Gonna find out.
Wanna come join the experiment?

460
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:52,953
Why don't I be your control group? I find as
you get older that you lose patience with...

461
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,676
throwing up.

462
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,398
- Is that locked?
- It should be.

463
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,796
You're not the Slayer.
But you'll do for a start.

464
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,395
You're payin' for that door, buddy.

465
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,910
Oh! Table!

466
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,916
- You have cost me, Slayer.
- I cost you?

467
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,076
That's a designer lamp, you mook!

468
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,389
Spike, no! I want him in the kitchen!

469
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,836
Open the door! The basement!

470
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,196
I'm takin' him down.

471
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,789
No!

472
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,118
Full... copper... re-pipe!

473
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,631
No... more...

474
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,797
full... copper... re-pipe!

475
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,669
Did you know this place was flooded?

476
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,314
I think we got a lot to feel good about.

477
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,472
We got the money, we got the lair...

478
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,958
And our one loose end
has been taken care of... by the Slayer.

479
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,716
Flame-thrower's up.

480
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,069
Periscope's working.

481
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,033
Looks like your mom's weeding tulips again.

482
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,072
Action figures... fully deployed.

483
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,553
I still can't believe it. We did it!
We can do anything.

484
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,274
- We could stay up all night if we wanna.
- Whoa, whoa!

485
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,710
- Don't get all crazy on us, Andrew.
- I was only saying.

486
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,072
What are we gonna do about Buffy? Sooner
or later, the Slayer's gotta come after us.

487
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,395
- Bring her on.
- We could hypnotise her.

488
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,875
Make her our willing sex bunny.

489
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,875
I'm putting that on the list!

490
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,278
Is this the life, or what? I mean,
we got all the stuff we ever wanted,

491
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,550
and we didn't even have to...

492
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,512
- Earn it?
- Exactamundo.

493
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,476
It's true, my friends. The way I see it,
life is like an interstellar journey.

494
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,149
Some people go into hypersleep
and travel at sub-light speeds,

495
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,957
only to get where they're going after years
of struggle, toil and hard, hard work.

496
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,552
- We, on the other hand...
- Blast through space-time in a wormhole?

497
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,639
Gentlemen, crime is our wormhole.

498
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,232
But everyone knows,
if the width of a wormhole cavity

499
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,238
is a whole number of wavelengths
plus a fraction of one,

500
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,557
the coinciding particle activity
collapses the infrastructure.

501
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,671
Dude, don't be a geek.

502
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,038
- This is gonna take forever, isn't it?
- Not forever. Just a very long time.

503
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,233
Here it is. Your first approximation
of your spanking new debt.

504
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,835
I've trashed this house so many times.
How did Mom pay for this?

505
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,396
For starters, she saved money
with this crappy-ass coffee table.

506
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,034
- Well, there's always that charging option.
- No!

507
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,153
I will definitely...
probably not be doing that.

508
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,678
Well, I know I'm back in America
now I've been knocked unconscious.

509
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,915
Thank you.

510
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,156
Poor lumpy Giles.

511
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,431
What do you think
the demon wanted anyway?

512
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,949
Aside from costing you a bundle.

513
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,198
Don't know. Now he's way too dead
to answer that question.

514
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,711
- Wish I knew who hired him.
- Ooh, I could do a locator spell.

515
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,068
Or not.

516
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,758
That's it.

517
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,440
It's been four hours.
I'm calling it, people.

518
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,269
This coffee table, it's gone. Damn it!

519
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,274
Also, this lamp's in critical condition.

520
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,554
Well, let's take these things out to the
trash and give 'em a decent throwin' out.

521
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,795
Buffy...

522
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,356
- I don't think I can do this.
- Yes, you can.

523
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,756
Your mother dealt with
this sort of thing all the time.

524
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,000
She took one crisis at a time,
without the aid of any superpowers,

525
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,675
and got through it all. So can you.

526
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,588
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

527
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,958
Who's calling me?
Everybody I know lives here.

528
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,719
I'll be back.

529
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,636
I bet it's creditors.

530
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,399
The hounding's begun. I read about it.

531
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,115
- So you think we'll starve?
- I very much doubt it.

532
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,151
No chance I'd have to quit school to
work in a poorly ventilated sweatshop?

533
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,909
Poorly ventilated...
What have you been reading?

534
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,316
Buffy, what is it?

535
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,073
Angel.

536
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,118
- Is he in trouble?
- He knows that I'm...

537
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,189
He needs to see me. I have to see him.

538
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,788
Of course. You'll leave for LA tomorrow.

539
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,669
Not LA. And not here.

540
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,351
Somewhere in the middle.

541
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,153
- There's a place.
- I see.

542
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,194
Well, we should get these bills
out of the way...

543
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,197
I have to go now.

544
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,592
Um... Thanks for taking care of this for me.

545
