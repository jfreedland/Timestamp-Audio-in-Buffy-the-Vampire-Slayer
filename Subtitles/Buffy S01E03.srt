1
00:00:02,062 --> 00:00:04,462
In every generation there is a Chosen One.

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:10,093
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness.

3
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,621
She is the Slayer.

4
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:16,900
This is madness.

5
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,445
What can you have been thinking?

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,906
You are the Slayer. Lives depend upon you.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,503
I make allowances for your youth,

8
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:27,419
but I expect
a certain amount of responsibility.

9
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:32,000
Instead of which,
you enslave yourself to this-this... cult?

10
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:36,044
- You don't like the colour?
- I d...

11
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:41,550
Do you, erm... do you ignore
everything I say, as a rule?

12
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:44,554
No. I believe that's your trick.

13
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:47,806
I told you, I'm trying out
for the cheerleading squad.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,934
You have a sacred birthright, Buffy.

15
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:54,689
You were chosen to destroy vampires,
not to wave pompoms at people.

16
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:58,193
And as the Watcher, I forbid it.

17
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,987
And you'll be stopping me how?

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,238
Well, I...

19
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:06,326
By appealing to your common sense,
if such a creature exists.

20
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,788
I will still have time
to fight the forces of evil, OK?

21
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:14,375
I just wanna have a life.
I wanna do something normal.

22
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,294
Something safe.

23
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:01,506
Giles didn't approve, huh?

24
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:05,552
He totally lost his water.
We haven't seen a vampire in over a week.

25
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,136
I'd say he should get a girlfriend
if he wasn't so old.

26
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,592
We're behind you.

27
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,888
People scoff at things
like school spirit, but...

28
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:15,796
look at these girls
giving their all like this!

29
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:18,273
Ooh, stretchy!

30
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,732
Where was I?

31
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:23,024
Pretending to see scantily clad girls
in revealing postures

32
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:24,525
as a spiritual experience.

33
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:26,489
Who said I was pretending?

34
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:29,554
Hey! Here's a good-luck thing for try-outs.

35
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:31,344
- What's this?
- What's that?

36
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:34,805
- Oh, how sweet. "Yours, always".

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,542
It came that way. Really.
They all said that.

38
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:41,588
Just look at that Amber.

39
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:45,508
- Who does she think she is? A Laker Girl?
- I heard she turned them down.

40
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:49,053
OK, listen up. Let's begin with...

41
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:50,555
Amber Grove.

42
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:54,559
- If you're not auditioning, move off the floor.
- Amy! Hi.

43
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,519
Hi!

44
00:02:56,603 --> 00:03:00,690
I didn't know you wanted to be
a cheerleader. You lost a lot of weight.

45
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:01,941
Had to.

46
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,776
- Do you know Buffy?
- Hi.

47
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,822
- Hi.
- How I hate this. Let me count the ways.

48
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:31,387
She trained with Benson.
He's one of the best coaches money can buy.

49
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:34,891
- They have cheerleading coaches?
- Oh, yeah! Don't you have?

50
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:38,143
I train with my mom -
three hours in the morning, three at night.

51
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:42,398
Hm. That much quality time with my mom'd
probably lead to some quality matricide.

52
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:46,026
Yeah... Well, I know it's hokey,
but she's really great.

53
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:03,669
What the...?

54
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:08,591
That girl's on fire!

55
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:10,635
Enough of the hyperbole!

56
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:32,824
It's OK. It's OK. You're gonna be... OK!

57
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,409
God!

58
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,382
I've been slaying vampires
for more than a year now,

59
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:33,719
and I have seen some
pretty cringeworthy things, but...

60
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:38,139
- nobody's hands ever got toasted before.
- I imagine not.

61
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:42,394
- So, this isn't a vampire problem.
- No.

62
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,522
But it is funky, right? Not of the norm?

63
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:50,193
Quite. Spontaneous human combustion
is rare and scientifically unexplainable.

64
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,521
But there... have been cases
for hundreds of years.

65
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:54,811
Usually all that's left is a pile of ashes.

66
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:57,973
That's all that would have been left
if it hadn't been for Buffy.

67
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:01,679
So we have no idea what caused this?
That's a comfort!

68
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:04,582
But that's the thrill
of living on the Hellmouth.

69
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:09,662
There's a veritable cornucopia of fiends
and devils and ghouls to engage.

70
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,092
Pardon me for finding the glass half full.

71
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:17,637
Any common denominators
in cases of spontaneous combustion?

72
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,184
Er, rage. In most cases, the person who
combusted was terribly angry, or... or upset.

73
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:26,856
So maybe Amber's got this power
to make herself be on fire.

74
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,859
- It's like the Human Torch, only it hurts.
- I need get the skinny on Amber.

75
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:33,570
Find out if she's had
colourful episodes before.

76
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:36,685
That means hacking illegaly
into the school's computer system.

77
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:38,423
At last something I can do.

78
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,994
- I'll ask around about her.
- You guys don't have to get involved.

79
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:44,456
What do you mean? We're a team.
Aren't we a team?

80
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,960
Yeah. You're the Slayer,
and we're, like, the Slayerettes.

81
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,797
I just don't like putting you guys in danger.

82
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:56,134
I laugh in the face of danger.
Then I hide until it goes away.

83
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:00,179
OK. Just walk softly,
at least until we know a little more.

84
00:07:00,263 --> 00:07:02,808
I mean, what if Amber isn't
causing these problems herself?

85
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:06,477
Well, then we have to determine
who or what did.

86
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:09,773
And, er, deal with it accordingly.

87
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,822
- Hey!
- Hi. How was school?

88
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:20,326
Mm. A reverentjoy!

89
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:24,287
- What's all this?
- It's for the tribal art display.

90
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,830
Cool!

91
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:31,461
- We had try-outs today.
- Oh, great. How'd it go?

92
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:34,965
I didn't actually get to try out.
There was an accident.

93
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:38,344
- Pretty fierce competition, though.
- Oh, I know you'll do fine.

94
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:41,555
Keep on pluggin'.
Just have to get back on the horse.

95
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,389
- Mom?
- Yeah?

96
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:46,060
- What was I trying out for?
- Oh, uh...

97
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:50,773
..some activity? I have no idea. I'm sorry.

98
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:55,150
That's OK. Your platitudes
are good for all occasions.

99
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:57,529
I'm distracted.

100
00:07:57,612 --> 00:08:00,573
I've got a lot of inventory
to go through here.

101
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:03,034
This is my gallery's first major show.

102
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:08,540
You know, it might not physically kill you
to give me a hand here.

103
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:15,213
- It was cheerleading.
- Oh, good!

104
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:18,967
I'm glad you're taking that up again.
It'll keep you out of trouble.

105
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,553
- I'm not in trouble.
- No, not yet.

106
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:28,101
I mean, you stopped cheerleading
just before the trouble.

107
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:31,104
So it's good you're going back.

108
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:35,483
- Oh, dear.
- What?

109
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,118
A fertility statue.
You don't need to see it.

110
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:41,844
You know, there's this girl,
Amy, and, um...

111
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,426
she trains with her mom,
like, three hours a day.

112
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:48,170
- Uh-huh?
- Sounds like her mom's pretty into it.

113
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:51,750
Sounds like her mom
doesn't have a lot to do.

114
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:00,091
Jeepers!

115
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:03,057
Despite the terrible thing
that happened yesterday,

116
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:05,568
we still have to pick new cheerleaders.

117
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,436
If you make the team, you'll find
your names posted in the quad after lunch.

118
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,023
Let's begin with group performance.

119
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:16,525
Why do my hands have to sweat
when I get nervous?

120
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,610
Don't worry. You'll do great.

121
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:20,679
Five, six, seven, eight!

122
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:24,824
Sunnydale! Sunnydale!
We never fail! We never fail!

123
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:30,038
Jump and shoot, swish and score,
the other team is such a bore. Yeah!

124
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:34,251
You saw that, right? That wasn't me.

125
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,586
You saw that, right?

126
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,672
Right?

127
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:51,018
- That's my mom.
- No?

128
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:54,606
Catherine Madison.
Get down with your bad self!

129
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,044
Her nickname was "Catherine the Great".

130
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:59,457
She took that team and
made them Tri-County Champions.

131
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:02,696
You know, no one'd ever done that before.
Or since.

132
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,616
She and my dad were
Homecoming King and Queen.

133
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:09,536
- They got married right after graduation.
- That's kinda romantic.

134
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:12,623
Well, he was a big loser.
Never made any money.

135
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:16,209
Ran off with Miss Trailer Trash
when I was 12.

136
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:19,838
OK. That part's less romantic.

137
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:23,925
- My folks split up, too.
- Drag, huh?

138
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:28,972
He left my mom with nothing.
She put herself through cosmetology school.

139
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:34,143
Bought me everything I ever wanted.
And never once gained a single pound.

140
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:38,357
She sounds really great, Amy. But, um...

141
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,028
it doesn't mean you need to lock step
as far as this cheerleading thing.

142
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:45,196
She was the best.

143
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,618
And I can't get my body to move like hers.
I choked in there so bad!

144
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:51,744
No, Amy, you did fine.

145
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:55,249
- I'm gonna get changed.
- Wait! No, uh...

146
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:57,834
Hey, Amy!

147
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:01,672
- Is she OK?
- Oh, she's... wiggin' about her mom.

148
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:03,799
The big "cheer queen" back when.

149
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:07,344
- Yeah. Her mom's kinda...
- Nazi-like?

150
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,721
Heil.

151
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:11,266
If she gains an ounce,
she padlocks the fridge

152
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:13,362
and won't eat anything but broth.

153
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:17,228
So, mommy dearest is really
Mommy Dearest?

154
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:21,650
There's a bitter streak. But Amy's nice.
We used to hang in junior high.

155
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:23,406
When her mom would go on a broth kick,

156
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:27,288
Amy'd come to my house
and we'd stuff ourselves brownies.

157
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:30,159
Hm! Hey, any word on Amber?

158
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:35,371
Nothing thrilling. Average student,
got detention once for smoking.

159
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:39,501
Regular smoking, with a cigarette -
not, like, being smoky.

160
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:42,504
- Hm.
- All pretty normal.

161
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:45,216
So we'll just have to wait
and see what happens.

162
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:48,010
Maybe nothing will.

163
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:21,000
I have a dream.

164
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,279
It's me on the cheerleading squad, adored

165
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,574
by every varsity male
as far as the eye can see.

166
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:33,596
We have to achieve our dreams, Amy.
Otherwise, we wither and die.

167
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,055
- Look, I'm sorry about...
- Sh...

168
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,021
If your supreme klutziness out there today
takes me out of the running,

169
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:45,360
you're gonna be so very beyond sorry.

170
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:47,987
Have a nice day.

171
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:02,167
- I told Buffy about Amber.
- Cool. Was she wearing it?

172
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:06,213
The bracelet. She was wearing it, right?
Pretty much like we're going out.

173
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:10,216
Except without the hugging or kissing
or her knowing about it.

174
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,511
So I'm just a figure of fun.

175
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:16,264
- I should ask her out, right?
- You won't know till you ask.

176
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:18,699
That's why you're so cool.
You're like a guy.

177
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,192
You're my guy friend
that knows about girls' stuff.

178
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,772
Oh, great! I'm a guy!

179
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:26,984
Oh, hey, they're posting the list!

180
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:32,198
I can't take this.

181
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:33,908
Yes!

182
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,870
Cover me, I'm going in.

183
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,713
- You're lucky.
- I made it?

184
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:50,424
- Ooh!
- I made it.

185
00:13:50,507 --> 00:13:54,053
One of those girls hit me really hard.
We should test for steroids.

186
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:57,293
Not only did you make the team, but
you, Miss Summers, are the first alternate.

187
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,629
Amy's number three.

188
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:01,894
What better way to celebrate
than a romantic drive through...

189
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:04,898
Xander, alternates are the ones
who didn't make the team.

190
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:08,859
They only fill in if something happens
to the ones who did.

191
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:10,862
Excuse me.

192
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:15,324
For I am Xander, King of Cretins.
May all lesser cretins bow before me.

193
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:19,411
At least it's over. And you know
what I think we should do about it?

194
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:22,290
Brownie pig-out. My house. After school.

195
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:25,501
Just how many more hours a day
can I practise?

196
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:28,296
You know, how much more can I do?

197
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,006
This would've never
happened to my mother.

198
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,174
Never.

199
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:59,410
Give me the power.

200
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:02,496
Give me the dark.

201
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:04,915
I call on you,

202
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,668
the Laughing Gods.

203
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,088
Let your blackness crawl beneath my skin.

204
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:14,383
Accept this sacrifice.

205
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:17,177
Cordelia.

206
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:20,598
Feed on her.

207
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:35,362
Look what I've found.

208
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:39,116
It's my yearbook from junior year.

209
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,744
Oh, look! There I am.

210
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:45,688
Mom, I've accepted that you've had sex.

211
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:48,303
I am not ready to know
that you had Farrah hair.

212
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:51,588
This is Gidget hair.
Don't they teach you anything in history?

213
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:55,716
- Well, it's really cool, but I gotta book.
- Well, I was thinking.

214
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,720
I know the cheerleading thing
didn't work out.

215
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:01,186
Maybe you should think about
joining the yearbook staff.

216
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:03,896
I did. It was a lot of fun.

217
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:06,143
Not really my tip, Mom.

218
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:08,089
I was, uh, photo editor.

219
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,967
I got to be on every page.
Made me look much more popular than I was.

220
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:13,886
And have you seen the kids
that do yearbook?

221
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:16,374
Nerds pick on them.

222
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,115
Some of the best times I had in school
were working on the yearbook.

223
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:23,897
Oh, this just in. I'm not you.
I'm into my own thing.

224
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:26,606
"Your own thing", whatever it is,
got you kicked out of school...

225
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,252
..and we had to move here to find
a decent school that would take you.

226
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:33,630
Honey...?

227
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,052
Oh! Great parenting form!

228
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:42,012
A little shaky on the dismount.

229
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,727
Cordelia! You haven't been mean to me
all day. Is it something I've done?

230
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:52,426
See how she has no clue that I'm a man,
much less a human being?

231
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:55,276
- I see that.
- This is the Invisible Man Syndrome.

232
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:58,654
A blessing in Cordelia's case.
A curse in Buffy's.

233
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:01,532
- You're not invisible to Buffy.
- It's worse.

234
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:04,118
I'm part of the scenery. Like an old shoe.

235
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:07,204
Or a rug that you walk on every day,
but don't even really see it.

236
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:11,959
Like a pen that's chewed up - you know
you should throw it away, but you don't.

237
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:14,880
Not 'cause you like it,
more 'cause you're just used to...

238
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:16,420
Well, yeah. That is the point.

239
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:19,333
You don't have to drive it through my head
like a railroad spike.

240
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,512
I've gotta take your advice
and not beat around the bush.

241
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:28,142
Or, I could be wrong. Maybe you should
beat around the bush more.

242
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:30,519
Nah, I've gotta be a man and ask her out.

243
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:32,074
You know what I've gotta stop?

244
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:35,338
Giving her ID bracelets, subtle innuendoes,

245
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:37,443
taking Polaroids outside
her bedroom window late at night.

246
00:17:37,526 --> 00:17:41,582
That last part is a joke to relieve
the tension. Because here she comes.

247
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:45,076
Into battle I go.
Would you ask her out for me?

248
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,203
No.

249
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:49,998
Man. Me battle.

250
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:51,249
Buffy?

251
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,294
- Would you like to...
- Is that even Cordelia's locker?

252
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:59,256
Huh? Oh, I don't know. What I'm saying is,
accompany me Friday ni...

253
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,017
Xander, I have to, um...
We can make this up later.

254
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:04,933
You don't mind, do you?

255
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:32,017
Nice of you to join us, Cordelia.

256
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:33,735
We didn't keep you waiting,
or anything, did we?

257
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,753
Your turn to drive.
OK, people, let's buckle up.

258
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,548
I don't wanna drive today, Mr Pole.

259
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:41,304
You've flunked driver's ed twice, already.

260
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:44,250
Show me some moves,
or you'll be taking the bus to college.

261
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:52,560
OK, check the brake.

262
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:54,770
Check the mirror.

263
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:56,689
Start the engine.

264
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:59,483
Hello? Put the car in drive.

265
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:05,489
Let's move forward through the cones
with a gentle, even turn to the...

266
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,624
Slow down! Slow... slow... Turn right!

267
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,041
- Turn right!
- Aargh!

268
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:19,129
Brakes!

269
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:25,802
Brakes! Brakes!

270
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:29,513
Brakes! Brakes!

271
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,311
Everybody out!

272
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:00,879
- Oh, my God! I can't see anything!
- It's OK. Oh, God!

273
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:04,299
What's happening? I can't see anything!

274
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:11,139
Witchcraft. Blinding your enemy
to disorient and disable them - it's a classic.

275
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,308
First vampires, now witches.

276
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:16,561
No wonder you can still afford
a house in Sunnydale.

277
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:21,024
- Why should someone harm Cordelia?
- Maybe because they met her?

278
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:22,776
Did I say that?

279
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:24,945
And setting Amber ablaze?

280
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:28,365
- Yeah, they don't hang.
- They're both cheerleaders.

281
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:31,743
- Someone doesn't like cheerleading?
- Or likes it too much.

282
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,119
Amy!

283
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:35,539
- Amy.
- So, you, guys, are leaning towards Amy?

284
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:36,911
She's desperate to get on that team.

285
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:40,209
I've got this feeling she'd do just about
anything to make her mom's dream come true.

286
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,088
Let me make sure I have this right.

287
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:46,340
This witch is casting
horrible and disfiguring spells

288
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:48,898
so that she can become a cheerleader?

289
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,597
I think you're underestimating the amount
of pressure a parent can lay on you.

290
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:55,600
If you're not a picture of
perfect carbon copy, they tend to wig.

291
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:58,537
Cheerleading was kind of
her mom's last hurrah.

292
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,107
Look, we still have to stop Amy.
We should grab her and...

293
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,276
I think we should be sure she's the witch
before we arouse her suspicions.

294
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,752
She's capable of
some very unpleasant things.

295
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:09,523
OK. All right. So...

296
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:13,243
You're in high school. You are desperate
to make the team and please your mom.

297
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:17,079
So you turn to witchcraft.
What's the first thing you're gonna do?

298
00:21:17,162 --> 00:21:19,915
Check out the books on witchcraft.

299
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,853
No! That would be the last thing you'd do.
You don't wanna leave a paper trail.

300
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:26,298
- Forget that.
- It'll just take a minute.

301
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:30,218
We don't have a minute!
Cheerleaders are in danger! Buffy's in danger!

302
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:33,547
You were the first alternate.
You're on the team now that Cordelia's out.

303
00:21:33,548 --> 00:21:35,744
You could be next.
We gotta get you to a safe house.

304
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:39,131
- Xander?
- Yeah?

305
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:44,941
Witches: Historic Roots to Modern Practice.
Checked out by Alexander Harris.

306
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:49,696
- The Pagan Rites. Checked out by...
- All right, it's not what you think.

307
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:52,323
You like to look at
the semi-nude engravings?

308
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:55,368
Oh, well, I guess it is what you think.

309
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:59,330
Have you all quite finished?
We have to find a conclusive test.

310
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:02,375
There may be something in here.

311
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:04,169
Yes, this should do it.

312
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:08,924
You'll need some of her hair,
a little quicksilver and...

313
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:10,717
some aqua fortis.

314
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,596
That's just mercury and nitric acid.
You can get that at the science lab.

315
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:17,140
"Heat ingredients and apply to witch."

316
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:22,312
"If the spell has been cast in the previous
48 hours, the witch's skin turns blue."

317
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:24,898
Oh, and you'll need some eye of newt.

318
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:30,987
Those of you in track one
may begin your dissections now.

319
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,406
Those of you in track two,

320
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,203
take your hydrochloric acid
and your ammonium hydroxide

321
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:40,372
and carefully

322
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:42,541
pour them into

323
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:43,917
your beakers.

324
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,336
- Now, slow. Slow.
- I can't.

325
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:49,810
Capping one, and being safe. And you get...

326
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:53,469
- Eye of newt.
- ...that.

327
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:55,387
How's Buffy doing with the hair?

328
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:58,933
- Isn't this exciting?!
- Oh, yeah!

329
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,401
Amy, help me. Um... Which is the...

330
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:04,617
hydrochloric acid and which is
the ammonium hydroxide?

331
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:07,168
Well, the bottle that says
hydrochloric acid

332
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:09,503
is usually the hydrochloric acid.

333
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:12,076
Read the bottles! Concept!

334
00:23:12,111 --> 00:23:13,305
Oops!

335
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:39,862
Wave hi to the nice little witch.

336
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:54,797
All set. Do you have a plan?

337
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:57,694
Spill it on her,
try and make it look natural.

338
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,911
We're right behind you, only...
further back.

339
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:05,540
Lishanne, can you tell me
why these chemicals have this reaction?

340
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:09,502
Lishanne? Are you...?

341
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:12,005
Oh, my God!

342
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:15,300
(muffled cries)

343
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,773
Did you see?
Amy was as freaked out as the rest of us.

344
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:33,109
- So it's not her.
- The test was positive. She's our Sabrina.

345
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:35,270
I just don't think
she realises what she's doing.

346
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:37,201
Well, should we talk to her?

347
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:40,785
Maybe we should talk to her mother.
I wander if she knows what she's created.

348
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:06,143
Where are you?

349
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:13,692
Another productive day in front of the TV?

350
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:17,738
I got a history report due tomorrow.

351
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:20,198
Write it.

352
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:27,162
I should be on that team by now.

353
00:25:27,246 --> 00:25:32,334
But instead, Miss Buffy and friends
are sneaking around stealing bits of my hair.

354
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,094
I'll be upstairs.

355
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:22,594
<i># Macho, macho, man!
# I want to be a macho man. Macho... </i>

356
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:24,888
Ooh, hey, juice! Mmm!

357
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:29,100
Quality juice. Not from concentrate.

358
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:31,269
- You're in a good mood.
- I am!

359
00:26:31,353 --> 00:26:32,836
I'm on the squad! Which is great 'cause

360
00:26:32,837 --> 00:26:35,579
I feel like cheering
and leading others to cheer.

361
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,619
Ooh, hey, juice!

362
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:39,664
Listen, honey, about yesterday? I really...

363
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,641
That is totally yester.

364
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,126
Besides, it's not like
you were wrong, you know?

365
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:47,620
I did get kicked outta school.
I'm just wacky that way!

366
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:51,249
Still, I just want you to know
that despite the problems you've had...

367
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:55,710
Mom, you just don't get it.
And believe me, you don't want it.

368
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:58,659
There are some things
about being a vampire slayer that...

369
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,845
- ...the older generation...
- Being a what?

370
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,855
- It's a long story.
- Are you feeling well?

371
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,654
What? Oh, I'm fine, you know.
What? Like I can't be in a good mood?

372
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:11,811
Is it like a new house rule? Fine, you know,
that's just fine, fine, fine. 'Cause...

373
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:14,197
<i># I'm a macho, macho man!</i>

374
00:27:14,198 --> 00:27:19,028
<i># I want to be a macho man!
Macho, macho man!</i>

375
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:22,339
<i># I want to be a macho man!</i>

376
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,500
Five, six, seven, eight!

377
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:32,540
Turn up the music!

378
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:57,689
Get it together, Buffy!
We have a game in less than four hours!

379
00:27:57,772 --> 00:27:59,649
Willow! Xander!

380
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:01,986
My buds are here! I love my buds!

381
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:03,820
Hi!

382
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:05,488
Hi! Oh!

383
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,868
Is it me, or is Buffy a bit looped?

384
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:16,166
We'd better get her out of there.

385
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:18,912
Yeah, before she...

386
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,525
hurts someone.

387
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,297
- Did I do that?
- You are so outta here.

388
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,742
It's not her fault!

389
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:30,963
- She's on medication.
- What?

390
00:28:30,998 --> 00:28:34,602
Obviously, not enough.
Who's our next alternate?

391
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:35,727
Oh.

392
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,980
Amy, you just made cheerleader.

393
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:41,107
No, no, no! You don't want her, she's a w...

394
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:43,382
A wise choice indeed.

395
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:49,236
- She's a witchy!
- Buffy.

396
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:52,603
- I just got kicked off the team, didn't I?
- I don't think it was your fault.

397
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,937
I know you don't.
That's 'cause you're my friend.

398
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:57,763
You're my Xander-shaped friend!

399
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:00,434
Do you have any idea
why I love you so, Xander?

400
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:02,181
- We've got to get her to a...
- Let her speak.

401
00:29:02,216 --> 00:29:06,504
I'll tell you.
You're not like other boys at all.

402
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,138
- Well...
- You are totally and completely...

403
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:12,224
...one of the girls!
I'm that comfy with him.

404
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,585
That's great!

405
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:19,021
Any other guy who'd give me a bracelet,
they'd... wanna date me. It'd be like a...

406
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,901
- Oh. I-I don't... feel so good.
- Buffy?

407
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:28,114
We've gotta get her to a hospital.

408
00:29:28,197 --> 00:29:31,784
They can't help her.
This is a bloodstone vengeance spell.

409
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:37,040
Hits the body hard like a quart of alcohol
and it eradicates the immune system.

410
00:29:37,124 --> 00:29:39,174
Vengeance spell?
Like she's trying to get even with Buffy?

411
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:41,245
'Cause she knows I know she's a witch.

412
00:29:41,286 --> 00:29:44,714
The others, she just wanted out
of the running. You, she intends to, erm...

413
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:47,758
- Kill.
- How much time do we have?

414
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,925
- Ooh, er, I'm sure, er...
- Truth.

415
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:54,069
Please?

416
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:58,602
- A couple of hours. Three at most.
- How do we reverse the spell?

417
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:03,732
Well, I've been researching that,
and we can reverse all the spells if,

418
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:07,069
we can just lay our hands
on Amy's spell book.

419
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:09,336
And if we can't get a hold of it?

420
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,715
Well, the other way is
to cut the witch's head off.

421
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:13,201
Show of hands.

422
00:30:13,284 --> 00:30:15,309
It's not Amy's fault.

423
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,736
She only became a witch
to survive her mother.

424
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:20,875
Look, I don't care why.
I just care that you go on breathing.

425
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,081
Giles, where would she be
casting these spells?

426
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:25,881
She needs a... a sacred space.

427
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:29,132
- A pentagram. A large pot.
- Her home.

428
00:30:29,216 --> 00:30:31,344
OK, help me up.

429
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:36,097
We'll just go to her house,
and we'll get her book.

430
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:38,851
- OK, we'll go with you.
- No.

431
00:30:38,935 --> 00:30:41,478
You guys stay here and keep an eye on Amy.

432
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:47,359
And keep her away from the science lab.
We'll need it to cast our counterspells.

433
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,202
Who are you?
Is there something wrong?

434
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:20,518
Mrs. Madison, we need to talk to you
about your daughter.

435
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:23,521
I'm not allow... You'll have to come back later.

436
00:31:24,022 --> 00:31:26,482
- Excuse me.
- What?

437
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:29,694
Are you all right? Erm... in here.

438
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:32,905
Your daughter is meddling with something
very dangerous. Are you aware of that?

439
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:36,034
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you know only too well.

440
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:38,920
You've got to go.
She'll be home soon, and you...

441
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:42,583
This girl is very sick. Now
you will shut up and you will listen to me.

442
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:45,210
Your daughter has access
to some very powerful magics,

443
00:31:45,211 --> 00:31:47,772
and somehow
your obsession with cheerleading...

444
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:50,339
I don't care about cheerleading!

445
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:52,884
It's not my fault she's doing stuff.

446
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:57,388
As her mother, you should assume
some responsibility for her actions.

447
00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:01,767
Yeah, well, you know these kids today. I...

448
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:04,978
She's out of her mind.

449
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:09,441
Ever since Dad... her dad left,
I can't control her.

450
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:11,402
- You're afraid of her.
- Amy?

451
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:19,702
- Are you Amy?
- I don't understand.

452
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:24,290
She switched.
She switched your bodies, didn't she?

453
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:31,214
- Good Lord!
- She wanted to relive her glory days.

454
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:36,844
She said I was wasting my youth.

455
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:40,388
So she took it.

456
00:32:43,392 --> 00:32:47,271
I didn't know anything about her powers.

457
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:52,318
I mean, when Dad was here, they would fight
and... yell, he would... call her a witch,

458
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:55,530
and I just thought he meant...

459
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:58,533
Oh, God, when he left,
I wanted to go with him.

460
00:32:58,616 --> 00:33:00,826
But she wouldn't even let me call.

461
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,372
She went crazy. I mean,
she'd lock herself upstairs for days,

462
00:33:04,455 --> 00:33:07,198
and she was always coming down on me,

463
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:09,293
telling me I didn't deserve
to have it so easy

464
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:13,422
and that I didn't know
how hard it was to be her and...

465
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:16,677
I guess she showed me, huh?

466
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:22,683
Amy, it's gonna be OK.

467
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:26,561
A few months ago,

468
00:33:26,644 --> 00:33:29,273
I woke up in her bed.

469
00:33:30,315 --> 00:33:32,650
I didn't know where I was.

470
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:36,488
- Then I looked in the mirror.
- She locked herself upstairs?

471
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:37,905
- Yes.
- Where?

472
00:33:43,411 --> 00:33:46,122
No. If she finds out I've been here,
she'll kill me!

473
00:33:57,842 --> 00:33:59,511
My God!

474
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:06,226
I believe we can
reverse your mother's spell.

475
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,395
- Well, all of them, in fact.
- You could?

476
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:13,191
- Really, you could?
- We need to find her books.

477
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:19,030
There'd be specific volumes she'd need
for this kind of casting.

478
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:25,661
Collect those dolls and any other personal...

479
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:32,043
Nice... kitty.

480
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:36,839
Let's see what you were guarding.

481
00:34:37,882 --> 00:34:39,550
Ah, yes.

482
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:44,055
This is it.

483
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:50,228
- Did we find?
- We found.

484
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:52,313
Come on.

485
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:56,400
- But where are you going?
- We're going to school.

486
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:59,237
And you're coming with us.

487
00:35:35,858 --> 00:35:39,026
I'm gonna stop this. I promise.

488
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,116
You just hang on.

489
00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:51,582
How is she?

490
00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:54,418
We only have a few minutes left.

491
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:57,754
Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go, Sunnydale, go! Go!

492
00:35:57,838 --> 00:35:59,464
Five, six, seven, eight!

493
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:04,344
Go, Sunnydale, go! Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go, Sunnydale, go! Go!

494
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:05,804
Six, seven, eight!

495
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:09,057
Go, Sunnydale, go! Go, Sunnydale, go!

496
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:12,311
- Go!
- Six, seven, eight!

497
00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:17,858
Go, Sunnydale, go! Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go, Sunnydale, go! Go!

498
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:32,663
Right, here we go.

499
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:36,167
The centre is dark.

500
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,336
Centrum est obscurus.

501
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:42,340
The darkness breathes.
Tenebrae respiratis.

502
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:44,885
The listener hears.

503
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:48,554
Hear me!

504
00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:53,017
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

505
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,269
One, two, three...

506
00:37:00,525 --> 00:37:04,112
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

507
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:06,781
Oh, it's working!

508
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:14,038
Unlock the gate. Let the darkness shine.
Cover us with holy fear.

509
00:37:14,121 --> 00:37:15,249
Show me...

510
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,899
Amy, what's your problem?

511
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:57,583
She's coming!

512
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:02,129
- Amy?
- Get out of my way.

513
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:05,507
Wait. I need to talk to you.
I can help you.

514
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:08,427
Help me? With what?

515
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,471
Well, you know, all your witchcraft.

516
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:15,809
I know this really good cauldron.
Do you actually ride a broom?

517
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:21,773
Xander!

518
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,656
Corsheth and Gilail, the gate is closed.

519
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,826
Receive the dark.

520
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,410
Release the unworthy.

521
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:37,915
Take of mine energy and be sated.

522
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:53,513
Be sated. Release the unworthy.

523
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,815
Release!

524
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:08,820
Release!

525
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:17,995
Release!!!

526
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:37,766
- Buffy?
- Amy?

527
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:41,311
You...

528
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:51,238
You...

529
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:54,032
You little brat.

530
00:39:54,116 --> 00:39:56,660
Mom, please?

531
00:39:59,454 --> 00:40:02,374
How dare you raise your hand
to your mother?

532
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:05,221
I gave you birth. I gave up my life

533
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:09,256
so you could drag that worthless
carcass around and call it living.

534
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,719
You've never been anything but trouble.

535
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:15,929
I'll put you
where you can't make trouble again.

536
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,723
Guess what.

537
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:19,100
I feel better.

538
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,607
That body was mine!

539
00:40:27,065 --> 00:40:29,735
- Mine!
- Oh, grow up!

540
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:39,995
I shall look upon my enemy.

541
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:47,001
I shall look upon her,
and the dark place will have her soul!

542
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:51,172
Corsheth, take her!

543
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:20,202
Well, that was, erm... interesting.

544
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:25,707
You guys OK?

545
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:28,834
- I'm fine.
- I assume the, er...

546
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:32,798
..all the spells are reversed?
It was my first casting, so

547
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:36,969
- I may have got it wrong.
- You saved my life. You are a god.

548
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:40,389
- I didn't think you'd pull it off.
- I got her! Cut her head off!

549
00:41:40,472 --> 00:41:43,517
- Xander, what are you doing?
- Saving you?

550
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:47,521
- Get your hands off of her.
- But she's evil.

551
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:51,859
- It wasn't exactly her.
- I was my mom.

552
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:52,985
Oh!

553
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:56,238
- Where is she?
- Hey, Willow, it's cool!

554
00:41:56,864 --> 00:41:59,074
- It is?
- Yeah, I took care of it.

555
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:08,625
I don't get it.

556
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,544
What?

557
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:13,297
I've been doing a lot of thinking about

558
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,508
where you're coming from,
how to relate to you,

559
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:19,887
and I've come to a very simple conclusion.
I don't get it.

560
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,431
I'm inscrutable, huh?

561
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:25,559
You're 16. I think there's a

562
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:31,024
a biological imperative whereby
I can't understand you because I'm not 16.

563
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:34,443
Do you ever wish you could be 16 again?

564
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:39,990
Oh, that's a frightful notion.
Go through all that again?

565
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:43,912
Not even if it'd help me understand you.

566
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,079
I love you, Mom.

567
00:42:50,918 --> 00:42:52,711
I don't get it!

568
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:57,340
My dad is so impossible!
He doesn't ever want me going anywhere.

569
00:42:57,423 --> 00:43:00,052
He wants to spend
total quantity time together.

570
00:43:00,135 --> 00:43:03,179
And I'm, like,
"Dad, I can go out. It's perfectly safe."

571
00:43:03,262 --> 00:43:05,840
But he's got all this guilt
about leaving me with my mom.

572
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:07,768
And he's being a total pain.

573
00:43:07,803 --> 00:43:10,896
- You're loving it.
- Every single minute.

574
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,942
This Saturday night,
he wants to stay in and make brownies.

575
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:19,071
Well, the brownies were my idea.

576
00:43:19,154 --> 00:43:23,116
Hey, I'm really sorry you guys
got bumped back to alternate.

577
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,119
Hold it. Wait. No, I'm not.

578
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:30,916
Well, I know I'll miss the intellectual
thrill of spelling out words with my arms!

579
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:33,961
Ooh! These grapes are sour.

580
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,587
Oh, I'm sorry!

581
00:43:35,671 --> 00:43:39,174
- I forgot you wanted to be on the squad.
- Oh, that's OK.

582
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:44,680
- Cheerleading's a little too hairy these days.
- Yeah. That's for sure.

583
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:48,642
"Catherine the Great."

584
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:51,270
And there's been no sign of her?

585
00:43:51,353 --> 00:43:55,858
That last spell?
She said I'd never make trouble again.

586
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:59,153
Wherever she is,
I don't think we'll have to worry.

587
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,490
Twisted.

588
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:07,119
I'm just happy to have my body back.

589
00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:08,968
I'm thinking of getting fat.

590
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:12,752
You know, I hear
that look's in for spring.
