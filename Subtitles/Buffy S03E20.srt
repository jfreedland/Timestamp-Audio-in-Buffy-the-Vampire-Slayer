2
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,800
Hmm.

3
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:25,643
What? Do I have funny
bed hair or something?

4
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:28,310
- Or something.
- Hmm.

5
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:31,253
I guess we got
a little carried away...

6
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:35,281
with the whole
post-slayage nap thing.

7
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,384
Hmm.

8
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:39,395
Oh, not good.

9
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:40,623
Ha ha ha.

10
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:43,531
- Where you going?
- To go kill a cat on my head.

11
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:45,159
No mirrors.

12
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:46,601
Oof.

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,468
You know, this place really
isn't girl friendly.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,167
No mirrors,
no natural light.

15
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:52,834
I think you look perfect.

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,344
Oh, yeah,
I really look... OK.

17
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:57,677
Mmm. Mmm.

18
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:03,914
Maybe we should think about
getting a few mirrors.

19
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:08,618
And maybe a drawer, you know,
for some of my stuff.

20
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:10,683
Because that's what couples do...

21
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,456
they have drawers.

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,124
Hmm. That's right.

23
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:17,133
You know,
I-I figure, that way,

24
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,897
sometimes I could
spend the night.

25
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,870
Like, after the prom,

26
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,567
it would be nice
to be able to just...

27
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:28,772
come back here and spend
some time together.

28
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:30,780
The prom?

29
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:33,408
End of high school,
rite of passage thingy.

30
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:36,749
Think cotillion with spiked punch
and electric slide.

31
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:38,083
Right.

32
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:40,146
Don't worry.
It's at night.

33
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,818
And lots of girls
have older boyfriends.

34
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:44,485
You'll blend.

35
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:49,532
I think maybe you should
get going, huh?

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,127
Hmm. There must be
a few more hours before sunrise.

37
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:57,740
Aah! Aah!

38
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:59,935
Oh! Sorry.

39
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,274
I guess it's later
than we thought.

40
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,970
Xander.

41
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:09,945
Well, hey, it's Demon Anya,
punisher of evil males.

42
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:12,380
Still haven't got your powers back?

43
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:14,940
- You haven't, right?
- No.

44
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,487
I will, though.
It's just a matter of time.

45
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,420
So, now, how did that work?

46
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,890
Women would wish horrible things
on their ex-boyfriends.

47
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,894
- You'd show up and make it happen.
- That's right.

48
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:28,693
The power of the wish made me a
righteous sword to smite the unfaithful.

49
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:31,894
Well, hey, good luck with that.
Hope it works out for you.

50
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,903
You know, you can laugh,
but I have witnessed...

51
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:36,496
a millennium of treachery and oppression
from the males of the species,

52
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:39,372
and I have nothing but contempt
for the whole libidinous lot of them.

53
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:41,206
Then why are you talking to me?

54
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:46,016
I don't have a date
for the prom.

55
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,382
Well, gosh,
I wonder why not.

56
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:52,047
It couldn't possibly have anything
to do with your sales pitch.

57
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:55,353
Men are evil.
Will you go with me?

58
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:58,327
One of us is very confused,
and I honestly don't know which.

59
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:00,420
You know, this happens
to be all your fault.

60
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:01,896
My fault?

61
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,558
You were unfaithful to Cordelia,

62
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:06,967
so I took on the guise of a 12th grader
to tempt her with the wish.

63
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,369
When I lost my powers,
I got stuck in this persona,

64
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,374
and now I have
all these "feelings."

65
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,433
I don't understand it.
I don't like it.

66
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,877
All I know is I really wanna go to this
dance, and I want someone to go with me.

67
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:21,884
Be still, my heart. Oh, wait, it is.
How come I got the short straw?

68
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:25,979
Y-You're not quite as obnoxious as most
of the alpha males around here.

69
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:29,116
- Plus I know you don't have a date.
- I haven't settled on anyone yet.

70
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:31,787
Fine. Look, I know
you find me attractive.

71
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:34,228
I've seen you looking
at my breasts.

72
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:37,756
Nothing personal, but when a guy does
that, just means his eyes are open.

73
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:38,927
Whatever.

74
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,631
Look, do you wanna go
with me or not?

75
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:46,570
Anya, huh?
Interesting choice.

76
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,841
Choice is kind of a broad term
for my situation.

77
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:54,543
See, it's either Anya or
the sock puppet of love for this boy.

78
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:56,483
[High Voice]
I love you, Xander.

79
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,919
I'll never leave you.

80
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:02,755
If Anya tries to get you killed,
put me down for a big "I told you so."

81
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:06,262
[High Voice] Who's this Anya?
Is she prettier than me?

82
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,766
She just better not try to cross me,
that's all I'm saying.

83
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,267
Well, at least we all have someone
to go with now.

84
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:15,669
Some of us are going with demons, but
I think that's a valid lifestyle choice.

85
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:19,231
More importantly,
I have the kick dress.

86
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,742
Ooh, the pink one?

87
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:24,110
Angel's gonna lose it,
but not his soul.

88
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:26,445
I mean, he's gonna lose it.
His it.

89
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:40,159
[Knock On Door]

90
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:53,000
Ms. Summers.

91
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:54,601
I'm sorry to, uh...

92
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:57,476
Well, I would have called,
but I don't have your number.

93
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,516
Please.
You're always welcome.

94
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:04,514
My goodness.
Your place is amazing.

95
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:06,112
Yeah. I like a lot of space.

96
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,125
- I don't get out much in the day.
- No, you wouldn't.

97
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:14,560
Can I get you something?
I don't have any coffee.

98
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,327
Oh, no, thank you. I...

99
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:20,035
You don't drink?
Beverages, I mean.

100
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:21,601
No, I do.

101
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,968
It's just the caffeine.
It makes me jittery.

102
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,472
Oh.

103
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,139
I understand
Buffy spent the night.

104
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:32,612
I'm sorry about that.
We came back after patrolling...

105
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:34,706
I'm... I'm not interested
in the details.

106
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,250
That's not why I'm here.

107
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:38,446
OK.

108
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,455
I'm here because
I'm worried about you two.

109
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:43,150
In general.

110
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:46,058
What happened before, when I changed,
it won't happen again.

111
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:49,393
That's not all
I'm concerned about.

112
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:52,661
I don't have to tell you that you
and Buffy are from different worlds.

113
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:55,532
No, you don't.

114
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:57,799
She's had to deal with a lot,

115
00:06:57,873 --> 00:06:59,534
grow up fast.

116
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:03,772
Sometimes even I forget
that she's still just a girl.

117
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:06,313
I'm old enough
to be her ancestor.

118
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:09,509
She's just starting
out in life.

119
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:11,017
I know.

120
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:16,253
I think about it more now
that she's staying in Sunnydale.

121
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:19,091
Good.

122
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,095
Because when it
comes to you, Angel,

123
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:24,257
she's just like
any other young woman in love.

124
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:27,426
You're all she can see of tomorrow,

125
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:30,699
but I think we both know
that there are some hard choices ahead.

126
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:34,708
If she can't make them,
you're gonna have to.

127
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:39,944
I know you care about her.

128
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:42,279
I just hope you care enough.

129
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:47,413
- So it was blue and sort of short?
- Not too short. Medium.

130
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:51,516
And it had this weird sort
of, uh, fringy stuff on its arms.

131
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:54,892
- What's that, a demon?
- A prom dress Wil was
thinking of getting.

132
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:57,295
Can't you ever get your mind
out of the Hellmouth?

133
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:59,959
I'd be delighted to, however
the day of the mayor's ascension...

134
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:02,833
is fast approaching,
and we don't know what to expect.

135
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:05,031
What about the pages Wil stole
from the mayor's book?

136
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:07,337
She put her life on the line there, pal.
Don't tell me they're useless.

137
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:08,842
On the contrary, no.

138
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,902
We-We-We know that
the ascension refers to...

139
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,914
a human transforming
into a demon,

140
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:17,543
becoming the living embodiment
of an immortal, and graduation day...

141
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,553
our Mayor Wilkins
is scheduled to do just that.

142
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:22,351
The trouble is we don't know
which demon he's going to become.

143
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:26,383
- There are thousands of species.
- So it's safe to say...

144
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:29,828
we shouldn't waste any time on such
trifling matters as a school dance.

145
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:31,866
Cordelia:
Well, that's too bad,

146
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:35,562
because I bet you would look way
double-07 in a tux.

147
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:38,367
Except of course
on the actual night,

148
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,534
when I will be aiding Mr. Giles
in his chaperoning duties.

149
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,910
What? Excuse me?
Fine, fine, fine.

150
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:48,211
We'll get you a dress.
You know, we should check April Fools.

151
00:08:48,283 --> 00:08:50,342
Don't go there.

152
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:51,783
I shop there.

153
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:55,380
I, myself, am dipping
into my hard-earned road trip fund...

154
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:58,449
to procure a shiny new tux,
so look for me to dazzle.

155
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:00,461
And I shall be wearing
pink taffeta,

156
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,463
as Chenille will not
go with my complexion.

157
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:05,022
Can we please
talk about the ascension?

158
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,762
Giles, we get it.
Miles to go before we sleep.

159
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:11,101
But especially if we're all going to
vaporize or something on graduation day,

160
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:13,198
we deserve a little "promy" fun.

161
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:16,267
One night of glory,
not too much to ask.

162
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:45,767
Into this holy estate,
these two persons present...

163
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,706
now come to be joined.

164
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:49,937
If any man can show
just cause...

165
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:52,343
why they should not
be lawfully joined together,

166
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:54,075
let him speak now...

167
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,676
or else here and after
hold his peace.

168
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:59,583
Bless, O Lord, this ring,

169
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:02,680
that he who gives it
and she who wears it...

170
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:04,486
shall abide in thy peace...

171
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,288
and continue in thy favor...

172
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:08,295
through Christ our Lord.

173
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:09,591
Amen.

174
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,156
Angel?

175
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,677
I always say patrol's not complete
without a trip to the stinky sewers.

176
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:40,812
I'm sure I saw him
come down here.

177
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,119
Couldn't we just let this
be the vamp that got away?

178
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:45,125
We could say he was this big.

179
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:47,161
What can I say?
I need closure.

180
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:50,356
You need clothes.
You don't have a tux, do you?

181
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:53,401
Since when did patrolling
go black tie?

182
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:55,800
For the prom, silly.

183
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,431
We have more important things to think
about right now than a dance, Buffy.

184
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:01,338
Sorry, Giles.
I'll just be quiet.

185
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,345
Come on.
Don't be that way.

186
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:08,805
Not now.

187
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:11,078
I'm not being that way.

188
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:15,145
- Every time I say the word "prom,"
you get grouchy.
- I'm sorry.

189
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:18,386
I'm just worried that you're getting
too invested in this whole thing.

190
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,018
What whole thing?

191
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,962
Isn't this the stuff that I'm supposed
to get invested in...

192
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:25,829
going to a formal,
graduating, growing up?

193
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:28,367
I know.

194
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,972
Then what?
What's with the dire?

195
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:41,947
It's, uh...

196
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:45,680
- It's nothing.
- No. You have "something" face.

197
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:49,523
I think we need to talk.

198
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:53,145
But not now, not here.

199
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,714
No. No. If you have
something to say, then say it.

200
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:02,711
Angel, drop the cryptic.
You're scaring me.

201
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:08,451
I've been thinking
about our future.

202
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:12,994
And the more I do,
the more I feel like us,

203
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:16,330
you and me being together,

204
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:18,801
is unfair to you.

205
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:21,465
Is this about
what the mayor said?

206
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,976
- Because he was just
trying to shake us up.
- He was right.

207
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:29,070
No. No, he wasn't.
He's the bad guy.

208
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:37,585
[Sighs Deeply]

209
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:40,318
You deserve more.

210
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:44,590
You deserve something outside
of demons and darkness.

211
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:48,331
I mean,

212
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,836
you should be with someone
who can take you into the light,

213
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:55,439
someone who can
make love to you.

214
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:57,270
I don't care about that.

215
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:59,708
You will.
And children.

216
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:03,509
Children? Can you say jumping the gun?
I kill my goldfish.

217
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:07,018
Today, but you have no idea
how fast it goes, Buffy.

218
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:10,111
Before you know it,
you'll want it all... a normal life...

219
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:11,986
I'll never have a normal life.

220
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:15,026
Oh, right.
You'll always be a slayer,

221
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:17,721
but that's all the more reason why
you should have a real relationship...

222
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,889
instead of this...
this freak show.

223
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:26,637
I didn't mean that.

224
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,900
I'm gonna go.

225
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:32,341
I'm sorry.
All right, Buffy?

226
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:36,006
You know how much I love you.
It kills me to say this.

227
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:39,642
Then don't. Who are you
to tell me what's right for me?

228
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:42,312
- You think I haven't
thought about this?
- Have you?

229
00:14:42,387 --> 00:14:44,753
- Rationally?
- No.

230
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:48,020
No, of course not. I'm just some
swoony little schoolgirl, right?

231
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:50,027
I'm trying to do
what's right here, OK?

232
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:52,256
I'm trying to think with my head
instead of my heart.

233
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:55,664
Heart?
You have a heart?

234
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:57,861
It isn't even beating.

235
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:03,630
- Don't.
- Don't what? Don't love you?

236
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:07,668
I'm sorry. You know what? I didn't know
that I got a choice in that.

237
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:10,772
I'm never gonna change.
I can't change.

238
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:16,787
I want my life to be with you.

239
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:21,550
[Whispers]
I don't.

240
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,055
You don't wanna be with me?

241
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,935
I can't believe
you're breaking up with me.

242
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,246
It doesn't mean
that I don't...

243
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,982
How am I supposed
to stay away from you?

244
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:58,723
I'm leaving.

245
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,395
After the ascension.

246
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,933
After it's finished
with the mayor and Faith,

247
00:16:08,674 --> 00:16:11,108
if we survive, I'll go.

248
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:15,846
Where?

249
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:18,572
I don't know.

250
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,158
Is this really happening?

251
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:16,640
So, that's it?

252
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,142
That's it.

253
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:21,975
Assuming we survive
this ascension thing,

254
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:24,242
he's gonna leave town.

255
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:28,144
Oh, he's a fool.

256
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,919
He's just a big, dumb jerk person,
if you ask me.

257
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:35,323
And he's a super-maxi jerk...

258
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:37,328
for doing it right
before the prom.

259
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:39,455
That's not his fault.

260
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:41,328
He's 243 years old.

261
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,425
He doesn't exactly get the prom.

262
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,561
- But he should if he...
- Wil, it's OK.

263
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:50,698
You don't have to
make him the bad guy.

264
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:54,075
But that's the best friend's job,

265
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:56,171
vilifying and grousing.

266
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:59,046
Usually, yeah.

267
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,449
But he's right.

268
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,889
I mean, I think maybe,
in the long run, that he's right.

269
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:11,958
Yeah, I think he is.

270
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,090
I mean, I tried to hope
for the best, but...

271
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,264
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,463
It must be horrible.

273
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:25,175
I think horrible
is still coming.

274
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:27,177
Right now, it's worse.

275
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,872
Right now, I'm just trying
to keep from dying.

276
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:34,578
Oh, Buffy.

277
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:39,822
I can't breathe, Wil.

278
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:42,291
I feel like I can't breathe.

279
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:28,135
OK. How long does it take you
to buy a damn dress?

280
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:30,003
Xander!

281
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:33,738
I, uh... I'm considering things
a little more carefully nowadays.

282
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:36,940
I don't want to get stuck
with another dud.

283
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:38,607
Well, this should work for you.

284
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:41,345
It positively screams nympho.

285
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:43,182
Is this a customer or a friend?

286
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:46,156
Neither. Just stopped by
for my daily helping of bile.

287
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:48,249
So you better get back to work
and quit goofing.

288
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:51,557
Mrs. Finkle so has it in for you.

289
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,000
- You work here?
- [Sighs Deeply]

290
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,731
Yes. Yes, I work here.

291
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:01,569
But, uh, why?

292
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:03,871
I'm trying to buy a dress.

293
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:07,279
But don't you already
have all the dresses?

294
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:10,407
I have nothing, OK?
No dresses,

295
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:12,417
no cell phone, no car.

296
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:14,112
Everything has been taken away...

297
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:17,281
because Daddy made
a little mistake on his taxes...

298
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:20,053
for the last 12 years.

299
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:23,289
Satisfied?
Are you a happy Xander now?

300
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:24,694
I'm broke.

301
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:28,564
I can't go to any of the colleges
that accepted me,

302
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:31,195
and I can't stay home
because we no longer have one.

303
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,075
Uh, wow.

304
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:37,803
Yeah, neato!

305
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:41,177
Now you can run along and tell all of
your friends how Cordy finally got hers.

306
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:45,082
How she has to work part-time just
to get a lousy prom dress on layaway!

307
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,154
And how she has
to wear a name tag.

308
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:52,555
Oh, I'm a name-tag person.
Don't leave that out.

309
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,753
The story just wouldn't
have the same punch.

310
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,859
And you say the creature
just stopped?

311
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,556
Yeah.

312
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,858
Right there.

313
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:33,991
See, it's like he just realized...

314
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:36,433
he forgot to put money
in the meter or something.

315
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,472
The other part that totally weirded
me out, that thing had good taste.

316
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,303
He chucked Xander
and went right for the formal wear.

317
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:46,038
That's right. He left behind his copy
of Monster's Wear Daily.

318
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,309
I'm serious. Look at the outfit
that Xander's wearing.

319
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:52,146
Now look at the kid that
the monster went after.

320
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:56,712
- Very smooth lines,
till he was shredded.
- [Tape Rewinds]

321
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,849
I don't wanna see it again.

322
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:01,416
Buffy, it's horrible,

323
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:04,088
but you're gonna
hunt this creature.

324
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:06,997
- You should study it.
- Think I got it.

325
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:09,001
She's right.
I mean,

326
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,470
you've seen one big hairy bringer
of death, you've seen them all.

327
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,870
Not really.

328
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,374
If I'm not mistaken,
this is a hellhound.

329
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:19,503
Yes. It's particularly vicious.

330
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:23,208
It's a sort of
a demon foot soldier...

331
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:26,980
bred during the Mahkash wars.

332
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:29,920
Trained solely to kill, they...

333
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,356
feed off the brains
of their foes.

334
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:34,916
- Look! Right there! Zoom in on that.
- It's a videotape.

335
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,589
So? They do it on television
all the time.

336
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:39,427
Not with a regular VCR,
they don't.

337
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:42,764
Perhaps we could stay
on the topic for once.

338
00:22:42,836 --> 00:22:45,430
What, uh, were you
doing with Xander?

339
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:47,029
Cordelia:

"Tucker Wells." He was in my chem lab.

349
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:17,598
Let me guess.
He was quiet, kept to himself,

350
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,604
but always seemed like
a nice young man.

351
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:22,800
Well, he didn't seem
the murderous type, anyway.

352
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,935
Something must've happened to him.

Everything cool?

Coolest. Devil dogs are history.
How's the prom?

517
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:40,899
Strangely affecting. I got all teared up
when they played "We Are Family."
