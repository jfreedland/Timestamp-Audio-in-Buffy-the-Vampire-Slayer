<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:08,396
- Robson! Dear God, l thought you...
- Gather them.

3
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:09,955
l understand.

4
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:11,230
l saw Mom.

5
00:00:11,316 --> 00:00:14,911
lt's the Big Bad, Dawn.
The one we knew was coming.

6
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:20,149
l did what you told me.
lt's not my fault it didn't work.

7
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:23,706
- l would do this stuff if l could.
- l don't think l can kill anybody else.

8
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:26,788
lt's my fault the ritual didn't work.
l don't have enough blood.

9
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:30,312
Look who l found, buying
mass amounts of blood at the butcher shop.

10
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:33,513
- Just tell us what... you... know.
- Ow!

11
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:36,064
l believe in you, Spike.

12
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:42,512
They were after Spike all along.

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,634
l'm getting tired of subtle.

14
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:49,504
lt's about time we bring
some authority to our presence.

15
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:52,508
Now, Spike, you wanna see
what a real vampire looks like?

16
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:02,627
lt's a loop, like the mummy hand. l'm doomed
to replace these windows for eternity.

17
00:01:02,716 --> 00:01:06,311
We should board these up
until things are less Hellmouthy.

18
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:10,071
Nothing, and nothing.
Cliffs Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged.

19
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:13,705
Yeah, my search
isn't turning anything up either.

20
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:17,027
Are you sure this thing called itself the First?

21
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:21,985
Pretty sure. lt claimed to be the original evil,
the one that came before anything else.

22
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:24,351
How many times
have l heard that as a demon?

23
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:27,030
"l'm so rotten, they don't have a word for it."

24
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:31,109
"l'm bad. Baddy bad bad bad.
Does it make you horny?"

25
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:35,113
- Or terrified. Whatever.
- <i>(Buffy)</i> lt wasn't a line.

26
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,506
When l came up against this thing, l felt it.

27
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:43,909
lt was... ancient and enormous.
lt nearly got Angel to kill himself.

28
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:48,151
lf we don't rescue Spike soon,
God knows what the First'll get him to do.

29
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:51,626
l wish Sleeping Ugly would come to.
He's been out all night.

30
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:55,231
Yes, he was just starting to squeal
when the spooky SWAT attacked.

31
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:59,707
Said the First was held up
at the Seal of... Danzar something?

32
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:07,145
Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't
have to answer any more questions.

33
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:11,828
- Hm. Or maybe he's in a fugue state.
- <i>(Buffy)</i> Dawn.

34
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,635
- What?
- He'll come to when he comes to.

35
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:20,268
Keep reading. lf we're gonna rescue Spike,
we need to figure out how to fight this thing.

36
00:02:20,356 --> 00:02:22,665
Anya gets to hit him.

37
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:27,466
Hey! Here, the First! Bank of Delaware. Sorry.

38
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,394
Hand me the Watchers' Codex again.

39
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:37,510
<i>(Joyce)</i> Can l get you anything else, baby?

40
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:40,110
How about some tea?

41
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:43,714
Mom?

42
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:47,666
You're not real.

43
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:51,271
OK, is that slang, like you're not <i>for</i> real, or...

44
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:53,824
You're the First.

45
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,625
Oh, baby, you're so tired,
you're not making sense.

46
00:02:57,716 --> 00:03:00,310
- Maybe you should get some sleep.
- No.

47
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:02,387
You can't win against this thing.

48
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:05,195
- Not if you don't rest.
- Stop.

49
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:07,585
Stop being like this.

50
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,908
lt's a lie.

51
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:15,069
l don't want to scare you,
but l want you to take care.

52
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:18,432
You <i>need</i> to wake up.

53
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:21,189
- What?
- <i>(Xander) You're dreaming.</i>

54
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:23,915
Buff, wake up.

55
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,954
- Did you see it?
- There's nothing to see.

56
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:31,314
You were just doing
a little dream-talking, that's all.

57
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:32,795
Oh.

58
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:35,436
You OK?

59
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:38,909
- What'd you see?
- Nothing.

60
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,827
lt was nothing.

61
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,066

<i>(Spike's voice)</i> Go on. Give him a kick, then.

64
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:06,434
You always liked that, didn't you?

65
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:12,672
Kick a dolly when he's down.
That was always your style.

66
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:20,589
Has buckets of energy, poor dear.

67
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:26,273
He's been laying in wait for his moment
since before the bug walked.

68
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:35,146
There, there, pet. Soon as the moon comes,
you'll have your carnage.

69
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:41,668
Little girls tear so easily, like pink paper.

70
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:45,032
Till then, we'll have our way with this one.

71
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,710
Got it coming, he does.

72
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:54,386
- <i>(thud)</i>
- Aargh!

73
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,191
That was something.

74
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,471
Maybe if you threw hot water on him.

75
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:55,467
Good thinking.

76
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,070
- Whoa, hey.
- Hi.

77
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:02,828
- Nothing.
- What?

78
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:07,194
Oh, l thought you were gonna ask us
what we were doing.

79
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:10,474
- No, l was going to ask...
- <i>(coughs)</i>

80
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:13,024
Oh! Look who's awake.

81
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:16,665
Silly Andrew, you drooled all over yourself.

82
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:20,554
l'm... l was about to be dead.

83
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,273
You saved me.

84
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:26,392
For the time being.

85
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:28,751
But if you don't tell us what we need to know,

86
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:34,468
then l'm gonna offer you to the First on a
platter and let him chop you into tiny pieces.

87
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:35,750
The first what?

88
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:38,748
The evil thing posing as Warren
to get you to kill Jonathan.

89
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:42,465
- Not very ominous-sounding.
- lt is if you understand the context.

90
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:46,674
No, an evil name should be
like Lex or Voldemort or...

91
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,509
Hey, l was intimidating here.

92
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:53,713
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

93
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,870
Forget it. Where's the seal?

94
00:06:57,956 --> 00:07:00,026
lt's around this corner, l think.

95
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:03,233
- You'd better be right this time.
- l told you, l'm not sure.

96
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:06,626
Maybe you should get sure.
l'm sick of all the run-around with you.

97
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:09,708
Whoa. Check out the goat-headed badness.

98
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:14,192
- What's it do?
- l don't know. Something not good.

99
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:18,315
lt didn't work cos...
there wasn't enough blood.

100
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,068
OK.

101
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:26,746
There's blood on this. Lots.

102
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:30,431
Looks like the First made
another sacrifice. Or a music video.

103
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,711
The seal could've been activated.

104
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:36,391
- Maybe that's what it needed Spike for.
- That wasn't there before.

105
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:39,513
- l had nothing to do with that.
- Thanks for clearing that up.

106
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:42,827
We thought you were up to no good
at this satanic manhole cover.

107
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,952
You killed your best friend!

108
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:47,345
He's in a place ofjoy and peace. He told me.

109
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:50,951
No, nobody told you.
You got tricked by a fake ghost.

110
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:54,711
Can we save the encounter session?
We need to cover this thing up.

111
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:58,311
Whatever it does,
we can't leave it exposed like this.

112
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:11,990
This place gives me the creeps.
lt's like in <i>Wonder Woman,</i> issue 297-299.

113
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:15,591
- "Catacombs". Yeah, with the skeletons.
- <i>(both)</i> That was cool.

114
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:17,667
Move it. This way.

115
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:22,510
So what next?
We found the seal, but no Spike.

116
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:26,350
l don't know. The First was camped
underground last time l found him...

117
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:27,789
Buffy?

118
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:30,068
- Hey!
- Hey.

119
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:33,826
l... thought that you were...

120
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:38,114
Sick? She was. Vomiting and oozing
from various places and...

121
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:41,905
Yeah, l remember, so please don't go on.

122
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,267
Oh, but now it's amazing.

123
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:48,587
- The doctor gave her some cream.
- Some pills.

124
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:51,270
And a cream. And l'm all better.

125
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:57,150
Oh, yeah. Um...

126
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:01,673
Apparently somebody left this
in the courtyard, and l was just returning it.

127
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:05,192
That's some full-service principalling.

128
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:07,267
l try.

129
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:10,946
Oh!

130
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:14,267
l was down here helping Dawn
with a school project.

131
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:18,793
- For science.
- We buried a... time capsule.

132
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:24,234
"Hello, people of the future.
Kids today like Red Bull and <i>Jackass!"</i>

133
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:26,876
- We'd better go.
- Buffy?

134
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:30,827
lf you are feeling better,
l could really use you back at work.

135
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,953
l've been waitlisting kids
who really wanna see you.

136
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:38,746
Oh, yeah. l'm sorry, you know,
l just... l've been ill and stuff.

137
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:43,466
No, it's fine, and l understand.
lt's just... things are starting to back up.

138
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:49,028
Well, l'll be there tomorrow.
No problem. 100<i>%</i> ooze-free.

139
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:51,107
Good.

140
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:52,993
OK.

141
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:07,993
How's it going?

142
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:10,988
Dawn's trying to find out
about the Seal of Danzalthar.

143
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:14,591
Will's about to do a locator spell,
see if we can find the First.

144
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:17,873
Why don't you go get some rest?
You haven't slept for two days.

145
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:22,108
- We'll call you if we find anything.
- Nah, l couldn't sleep. Too much going on.

146
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:25,825
lt'll be OK, Buff.
We've faced this kind of stuff before.

147
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:31,309
You didn't see the First. l did.
l felt it. lt was like...

148
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:41,711
Aargh!

149
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:43,309
Will!

150
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:48,751
<i>(demonic voice)</i> You only make me stronger!

151
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:53,669
Will!

152
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:57,192
- lt's still in me, l feel it!
- No, it's not. lt's gone. You're OK.

153
00:10:57,276 --> 00:11:00,234
l don't wanna hurt anybody.
Please don't let it make me!

154
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:04,832
We won't, l promise. We won't use magic
to fight this until we know what we're doing.

155
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,113
l can't. l can't. l'm sorry.

156
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:14,311
- Let me come with you.
- l'm going alone.

157
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:17,194
You don't know how
to fight the First, or where it is.

158
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,632
lt's out there.
lt's hurting my friends. l'll find it.

159
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:23,310
- Buffy.
- Giles!

160
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,792
Nice place. Bit of a mess.

161
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:30,676
This is the Slayer?

162
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:32,664
Huh!

163
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:37,386
Sorry to barge in.
l'm afraid we have a slight... apocalypse.

164
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,667
- They're all slayers?
- <i>(Giles)</i> Potential slayers.

165
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:51,626
Waiting for one to be called. There were
many more like them all over the world, but...

166
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:54,833
now there's just a handful,
all on their way to Sunnydale.

167
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,749
The others were murdered.

168
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:02,067
<i>(Giles) ln cold blood.</i>

169
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:07,549
As well as their watchers.

170
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:09,991
<i>We always feared this day would come,</i>

171
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:14,194
<i>when there'd be an attack against</i>
<i>not just one slayer, but the whole line.</i>

172
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,267
lt's started.

173
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:19,075
The First. That's what it wants.

174
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:26,267
Yes, to erase all the slayers-in-training
and their watchers, along with their methods.

175
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:29,268
And then Faith, and then me.

176
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:37,032
And with all the potentials gone
and no way of making another, it's the end.

177
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:39,710
No more Slayer.

178
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:42,026
Ever.

179
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:48,071
But we haven't found any information
on the First. No documentation...

180
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:51,512
That's because it predates any written history.

181
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:55,555
And... it rarely shows its true face.

182
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:58,275
The only record l know
was in the Council library.

183
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:02,235
What about the Council?
What do they say about this?

184
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,544
Gone.

185
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,111
- <i>(Willow)</i> What?
- Obliterated.

186
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:11,512
They were in session,
and there was an explosion.

187
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:15,111
That means all the Council's records
are destroyed?

188
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:17,989
Annabelle?

189
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:31,315
That's what's left of
the mystic secrets of the watchers.

190
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,113
And whatever l could find on the First.

191
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:39,030
When l learned what was happening, l...

192
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:42,153
- l stole them.
- And you blew the Council up!

193
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:45,865
This is what happens when you're
stuffy and repressed. You overreact.

194
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:48,516
Not... <i>l</i> didn't.

195
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:54,225
Must've been an agent of the First,
after my little burglary session.

196
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:58,867
The knowledge contained in these files
had to be protected,

197
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:03,393
and there wasn't time
for bureaucracy or debate.

198
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:07,594
- The Council knows no other way.
- And it cost them their lives!

199
00:14:09,956 --> 00:14:12,072
Go on.

200
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:14,750
Can we gag him?

201
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:20,867
But what do these records
say about the First?

202
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:24,426
<i>(Giles)</i> Very little. lt can change form.

203
00:14:25,276 --> 00:14:29,792
lt only appears in the guise
of someone who has passed away.

204
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:32,834
- Our ghosts.
- Also it's not corporeal.

205
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,989
lt can't touch or fight on its own.
lt only works through those it manipulates.

206
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,226
And its followers, the Bringers.

207
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:44,185
- Those freaks in the black robes.
- With the hoodies and crazy alphabet eyes.

208
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:46,744
- l never saw 'em, l just heard...
- Sh! Molly.

209
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:50,033
Mr Giles doesn't need us prattling on.

210
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:53,870
The First is unlike
anything we've faced before.

211
00:14:53,956 --> 00:14:58,984
There's evil and then there's...
the thing that created evil.

212
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:02,629
- The source.
- That's what this thing claims to be?

213
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:04,752
That's what it is.

214
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:08,192
lt has eternities to act, endless resources.

215
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:12,310
How to defeat it, l...

216
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:17,505
Honestly, l don't know.
But we have to find a way.

217
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:23,385
lf the slayer line is eliminated,
then the Hellmouth has no guardian.

218
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:26,070
The balance is destroyed.

219
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:31,668
l'm afraid it falls to you, Buffy.
Sorry. l mean, we'll do what we can.

220
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:36,876
But... you're the only one who has
the strength to protect these girls -

221
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:39,470
and the world - against what's coming.

222
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:44,667
But no pressure.

223
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:47,350
<i>(Kennedy)</i> That's it? That's the plan?

224
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:50,553
l don't see how one person,
even a slayer, could protect us.

225
00:15:50,636 --> 00:15:54,072
l saw what those Bringers can do.
They tore apart my watcher.

226
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:57,751
- We'll use all our resources...
- lf this thing is the root of all evil,

227
00:15:57,836 --> 00:16:00,828
isn't the Hellmouth
its number-one vacation spot?

228
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,953
Shouldn't we be hiding
on the other side of the globe?

229
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:07,073
- Kennedy!
- No, she's not wrong.

230
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:10,831
We need more muscle.
That's why we need to find Spike.

231
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:16,354
Yeah, he'll help. lf he's not crazy or...
off killing people or... dead.

232
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:20,633
Or, you know, all of the above.

233
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:36,551
That's why our kind make such good dollies.

234
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:47,592
Hard to kill.

235
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,144
Tried to enlighten little Buffy, didn't you?

236
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:55,434
Spilled, spilled, spilled our secrets like seed.

237
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,586
But you forgot.

238
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:02,270
l say what you tell and what you know.

239
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:05,307
l say when this is over.

240
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:09,832
And l'm not done with you yet.

241
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:14,145
Not nearly.

242
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:16,227
<i>(clicks tongue)</i>

243
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:30,394
This place you originally saw the First,
you say it was... a Christmas tree lot?

244
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:35,311
Under it. There was a hidden cavern.
Just happened to be under a tree lot.

245
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:38,468
The Bringers were doing some kind of ritual.

246
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:45,785
- Giles, this is bad, isn't it? A new kind of bad.
- Just in time for Christmas.

247
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:48,754
You know, l didn't even realise
it was December.

248
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:52,545
Maybe when we get home,
we should decorate the rubble.

249
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:58,312
Think you'll ever show up for a real visit?
The kind where the world isn't about to end?

250
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,990
lf we survive this, l promise.

251
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:03,670
Good. Cos l miss you.

252
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:07,507
l miss you too.

253
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:11,116
So, how long have you followed Buffy?

254
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:13,915
l don't "follow" her. She's my best friend.

255
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,315
Huh.

256
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:18,433
She seems like a good leader.
Her hair is shiny.

257
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:21,836
Does she make you stab things?

258
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,635
OK, so Annabelle can sleep down here,

259
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:29,153
- Molly can sleep in Dawn's room...
- Not if Dawn actually wants to sleep.

260
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:32,308
- Molly will talk her ear off.
- OK, then Molly down here,

261
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:35,229
you with Dawn, and Annabelle in my room.

262
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:37,147
Bad idea. Annabelle snores.

263
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:39,750
- You wanna do the sleeping arrangements?
- OK.

264
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:42,828
You... better not hog the covers.

265
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:47,426
- Does she wanna eat?
- What?

266
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:50,428
Oh, she's... she's new.

267
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:53,633
Annabelle and Molly are starved.
l burnt the mac and cheese.

268
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,629
l'll put hot sauce on it, tell 'em
it's an American thing. Say it's blackened.

269
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,832
lt's not blackened so much as ruined.

270
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,384
Or we can order pizza.

271
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:06,674
- As long as it's plain. l'm veggie.
- Cracked, you mean.

272
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:12,467
- Just because you'll eat any kind of trash.
- Oh, brill! Biscuits!

273
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:16,469
You don't mind, do you? l got a case
of the nerves after Mr Giles' lecture.

274
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:21,630
Knock yourself out.
l feel a cookie problem coming on myself.

275
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:32,990
<i>(Giles)</i> So the entrance to the cave...
was above ground here?

276
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:36,751
Yeah, l'm pretty sure
it was around here somewhere.

277
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:38,872
Well, we'll just keep...

278
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:40,947
- Argh!
- <i>(crash)</i>

279
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:43,507
<i>(Buffy)</i> Found it!

280
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:50,632
- Good lord, are you all right?
- Peachy.

281
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:53,833
Except my knees bend backwards now.

282
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,147
Giles, stay up there.
l'm gonna check it out.

283
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:58,988
Right.

284
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:29,989
<i>(growls)</i>

285
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:12,107
..the others just yet. lt'll give us a chance to...

286
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:17,345
- Sorry about the British invasion.
- We've been up for hours.

287
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,392
4pm, London time.

288
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:21,467
Are you all right? You look...

289
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:26,425
Oh. Yeah, l'm OK.
l just... got into a fight is all.

290
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:29,188
You wanna tell me with what?

291
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:33,394
Yes, Buffy, but don't you think
we should discuss this privately?

292
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:38,709
You mean, not in front
of the next generation?

293
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:43,312
No time to coddle them, Giles.
Welcome to the war room, guys.

294
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:47,673
What you fought was a vampire,
but it was more than that.

295
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:50,953
lt was a... Turok-Han.

296
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:55,348
As Neanderthals are to human beings,
the Turok-Han are to vampires.

297
00:22:55,436 --> 00:23:00,351
Primordial, ferociously powerful killing
machines, as single-minded as animals.

298
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:06,352
They are the vampires that vampires fear.
An ancient and entirely different race.

299
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:09,587
Until this morning,
l thought they were a myth.

300
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:14,033
So, the First shows up, and now this.
You think it's a coincidence?

301
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:18,667
l think it's more likely that the Turok-Han
is here as an agent of the First.

302
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:20,792
Erm...

303
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:23,151
Did you slay it?

304
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:27,705
No, it's still out there. Somewhere.

305
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:29,787
What's it want?

306
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:33,992
All of us dead.

307
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,227
For now it looks like sunlight's
keeping this Ubervamp away.

308
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,945
<i>(Giles)</i> So, until sunset,
l suggest you get some rest.

309
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:45,665
A few hours sleep
will do a world of difference.

310
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,986
No sleep today. Can't.

311
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:51,432
- Oh, come on, you're exhausted.
- lt comes with the gig.

312
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:56,385
Somehow l don't think taking on
prehistoric evil comes with nap time.

313
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:01,789
Sorry, potential guys. l know you came
a long way, and you wanna get into it,

314
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:06,506
but the best thing you can do now
is just sit tight. Wait it out.

315
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:12,626
l'm gonna go to work, see what l can find out.
l'll be back before sunset.

316
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:17,506
How do you plan to research
something as ill-defined as the First?

317
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,506
l have the best plan ever.

318
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,906
l already rechecked the basement.

319
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:26,386
Wait, you know, hold on,
l'm gonna try something.

320
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:29,991
Maybe the First isn't ready
for modern technology.

321
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:35,070
"Displaying results 1 through 10 of... 900,517."

322
00:24:36,436 --> 00:24:39,553
OK, l gotta narrow this down.
l'll call you back?

323
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:41,433
Yeah.

324
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:48,269
"Manifestations of evil"?

325
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:53,987
"..in... the... movies."

326
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,667
You're searching for evil movies?

327
00:24:56,756 --> 00:25:00,749
l know it's not the all-time
most kosher use of my office hours,

328
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:03,304
but, you know, looking at some downtime.

329
00:25:03,396 --> 00:25:07,594
What can l say?
l just love those evil, evil movies.

330
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:12,026
Like <i>Exorcist,</i> you know, <i>Blair Witch...</i>

331
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:15,472
As opposed to, say, Rob Schneider's <i>oeuvre.</i>

332
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:18,954
- Different kind of evil.
- Yeah.

333
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:23,029
Buffy, l'm not that big a fan of scary movies,
even the hokey ones.

334
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:28,349
Sometimes they go to a place
that l think kids could stand to avoid.

335
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,751
- Well, it's not for the kids.
- Yeah.

336
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:36,592
Yeah, l'm only saying
that once you see true evil,

337
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:42,194
it can have some serious afterburn,
and then you can't unsee what you saw.

338
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:45,632
Ever.

339
00:25:47,836 --> 00:25:50,145
That's just one opinion.

340
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:52,830
l better get back to work.

341
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:58,556
What kind of movies do you like?

342
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:00,945
Oh, me? Mysteries.

343
00:26:01,956 --> 00:26:06,825
l love finding out
what's underneath it all at the very end.

344
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:12,075
<i>(Drusilla)</i> Think of it as a game.
A fun, funny game.

345
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:17,752
Without all the rules,
or any of the bothersome winning part.

346
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:22,830
But still, there are sides.
You have to choose a side, Spike.

347
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:27,312
Then we can fly.
Be free and visit all our friends

348
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:31,071
as they come squirming up
from out the earth.

349
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:37,435
l know you like a good wriggle
and a giggle and a squiggle.

350
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:40,547
You're not Drusilla.

351
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:46,628
- No, l'm really not.
- She was crazier than you.

352
00:26:46,716 --> 00:26:48,911
Mmm, daddy.

353
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:55,070
No kicking. lt's almost Christmas Day today
and you've gone spoiling it.

354
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:58,790
l've been so very good all year.

355
00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:01,271
<i>(growls)</i>

356
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:03,426
But l could be bad if you like.

357
00:27:10,356 --> 00:27:12,745
Bad daddy. Needs a caning.

358
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:18,875
Never learned his headmaster's lesson
while all the school bells ring

359
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:22,073
and ring and ring

360
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,715
and ring and ring.

361
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:32,073
Choose a side. Choose <i>our</i> side.

362
00:27:32,156 --> 00:27:34,750
You know that it's delicious.

363
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:39,792
What do you say?

364
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:43,714
- Dru, love...
- Hm?

365
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,071
Get bent.

366
00:27:49,316 --> 00:27:53,355
Stupid, stubborn... daddy.

367
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:02,110
And ring and ring...

368
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:05,114
<i>(bell)</i>

369
00:28:08,596 --> 00:28:10,587
Ow.

370
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:19,190
Buffy, what happened?

371
00:28:21,756 --> 00:28:25,874
- lt's OK, Mom.
- l tried to warn you, but...

372
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:31,394
Right. The last thing you need now
is one of helpful Mom's guilt trips.

373
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,944
- l'll get you some ice.
- No.

374
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:36,152
Mom, l can't.

375
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:39,388
- Buffy, you have to heal.
- l don't have time.

376
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:41,706
Are you worried about the sun going down?

377
00:28:41,796 --> 00:28:43,912
There's some things you can't control.

378
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:46,908
The sun always goes down,
the sun always comes up.

379
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:50,272
- Everyone's counting on me.
- They do that.

380
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:54,713
l'm sorry, but these friends of yours put too
much pressure on you. They always have.

381
00:28:54,796 --> 00:29:00,075
- Something evil is coming.
- Buffy, evil isn't coming, it's already here.

382
00:29:00,636 --> 00:29:02,786
Evil is always here.

383
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:06,585
- Don't you know? lt's everywhere.
- And l have to stop it.

384
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:10,510
- How are you gonna do that?
- l don't know yet, but...

385
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:16,705
Buffy, no matter what your friends
expect of you, evil is a part of us. All of us.

386
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:22,914
lt's natural. And no one can stop that.
No one can stop nature, not even...

387
00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:24,873
<i>(bell)</i>

388
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,309
Oh, l'm sorry. What were we talking about?

389
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:33,230
- Only my life. You're just like all the others.
- No. No, no. l'm different.

390
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:36,114
l'm hip, l relate to the young people.

391
00:29:36,196 --> 00:29:38,664
No, don't go...

392
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:42,427
- Roger.
- Roger! See? l knew that!

393
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,427
Oh!

394
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:52,029
This day's almost over.

395
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:55,553
And the sun will go down in 17 minutes.

396
00:29:55,636 --> 00:29:58,025
Hey, junior slayers, don't look so worried.

397
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:00,755
We don't know where Spike is
or how to fight the First,

398
00:30:00,836 --> 00:30:03,794
or if and when the superstyle vampire
is gonna attack us.

399
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:06,674
However, house - boarded up.

400
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:11,750
Now all we gotta do is trap this Ubervamp
in the pantry, and it's game over.

401
00:30:11,836 --> 00:30:17,513
Xander, newbies. Let's ease them in to
the whole "jokes in the face of death" thing.

402
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:20,827
Who's joking? That pantry thing could work.

403
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:23,908
Are you saying
M Night Shyamalan lied to us?

404
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:25,429
You'll be OK.

405
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:29,191
OK, or even better. lt's like our guarantee.

406
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:36,226
Buffy, l just... l want you to know
that l'm really sorry for letting you down.

407
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:41,151
You know, here before, with the magic
going all "argh" and me going all "eee"

408
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:46,026
and everything getting all "rrr".
l wish l could help out.

409
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:48,710
No one expects you to make everything right.

410
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:53,506
l can't do everything, but l should
at least be able to do something.

411
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:56,633
l have so much power,
but when l try to use it...

412
00:30:56,716 --> 00:31:00,504
- Don't, OK?
- OK.

413
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:05,188
But... you need help, Buffy.

414
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:10,350
l know you, and l know you'll
never admit it, but you need help.

415
00:31:11,356 --> 00:31:15,747
l'll be OK. OK, or better.
lt's like my guarantee.

416
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:18,304
Hey, are we getting weapons?

417
00:31:18,396 --> 00:31:22,025
Trained fighters? Patton is coming?
l've heard worse ideas.

418
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:24,550
We'll be armed
when the Slayer feels we're ready.

419
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:26,991
l feel ready.

420
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:30,466
You're frightened.
You must learn to control your fear.

421
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,787
You know what would help with that?
Weapons.

422
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:38,356
- l don't know.
- We're sitting ducks without them.

423
00:31:38,436 --> 00:31:40,996
We're with the Slayer. Safe as houses.

424
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:44,750
Do you see the house we're in?

425
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:52,592
lt'll come straight for us, won't it?

426
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:56,430
We should load them up, Giles.

427
00:31:57,436 --> 00:32:00,109
Listen to me.
l've got a bad feeling about this.

428
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:03,427
Of course you've got a bad feeling.
You're tied to a chair.

429
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:08,067
No. Yeah, but above and beyond that,
l'm telling you my Spider-Sense is tingling.

430
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:13,276
This is gonna get hairy. l'm talking
weird with a beard. Better untie me.

431
00:32:13,356 --> 00:32:15,745
And that'll help us how?

432
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:22,108
OK, l know what you're thinking.
"Andrew, bad guy."

433
00:32:22,196 --> 00:32:28,066
You think l'm a super-villain like
Dr Doom or Apocalypse or The Riddler.

434
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,590
l admit l went over to the dark side,

435
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:35,147
butjust to pick up a few things,
and now l'm back. l've learned.

436
00:32:35,236 --> 00:32:38,433
- l'm good again.
- And when were you good before?

437
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:41,189
OK, technically, never. Touché.

438
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:46,714
But l'm like Vader in the last five minutes
of <i>Jedi,</i> with redemptive powers, and...

439
00:32:46,796 --> 00:32:51,187
mine is a redemptive struggle... of...

440
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:57,829
epic redemption which chronicles...
These ropes itch.

441
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:04,867
How are we doing on time?

442
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:07,629
Sunset should be any minute now.

443
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:10,666
Done everything we can.

444
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:15,546
And don't worry, everyone here
understands that you're calling the shots.

445
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:19,788
- l just hope l'm calling the right ones.
- You have all my faith.

446
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:21,867
And they're depending on you.

447
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,106
That's not exactly what l needed to hear.

448
00:33:26,196 --> 00:33:28,664
Guys?

449
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,394
Annabelle split.

450
00:36:24,436 --> 00:36:26,427
<i>(Xander)</i> Buffy!

451
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:33,906
Oh, God almighty.

452
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:39,713
<i>(Drusilla)</i> Do you know why you're alive?

453
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:46,235
Never figured you for...
existential thought, love.

454
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:48,989
l mean, you hated Paris.

455
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:53,831
You're alive for one reason,
and one reason only.

456
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:56,271
Because l wish it.

457
00:36:56,356 --> 00:36:58,950
Do you know why l wish it?

458
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:03,551
- Because l'm not done with you.
- Give it up.

459
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:09,029
Whatever you are,
whatever you get away with, l'm out.

460
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:13,392
You can't pull this puppet's strings any more.

461
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:15,785
And what makes you think
you have a choice?

462
00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:20,347
What makes you think you will ever
be any good at all in this world?

463
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:23,075
She does.

464
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,585
Because she believes in me.

465
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:37,025
<i>(Giles) We could make plans</i>
<i>as we always do, but Buffy was our plan.</i>

466
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:41,348
- <i>There is no backup.</i>
- <i>(Willow) Giles, she looks bad.</i>

467
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:46,829
<i>(Giles) She does.</i>
<i>l'm afraid there may be internal bleeding.</i>

468
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:53,992
- <i>(Willow) What does that mean? Will she...</i>
- <i>(Giles) Die? l don't think so. l don't know.</i>

469
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:59,867
<i>(Willow) What do we do if she can't fight?</i>
<i>If she can't beat this thing?</i>

470
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:06,116
- We're back at square one.
- Which square would that be, exactly?

471
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:08,391
l'm not sure.

472
00:38:08,476 --> 00:38:11,866
The First predates
everything we've ever known.

473
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,505
Or can know. lt's everywhere, it's pure.

474
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:21,036
l don't know if we can fight it.

475
00:38:21,116 --> 00:38:23,676
You're right.

476
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:29,948
We don't know how to fight it.

477
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:32,186
We don't know when it'll come.

478
00:38:33,356 --> 00:38:36,109
We can't run, can't hide.

479
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,986
Can't pretend it's not the end, cos it is.

480
00:38:42,836 --> 00:38:47,512
Something's always been there
to try and destroy the world.

481
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:50,190
We've beaten them back.

482
00:38:51,316 --> 00:38:54,388
But we're not dealing with them any more.

483
00:38:54,476 --> 00:38:58,105
We're dealing with the reason they exist.

484
00:38:58,196 --> 00:39:01,586
Evil. The strongest.

485
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:05,714
The First.

486
00:39:05,796 --> 00:39:07,388
Buffy, um...

487
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:11,264
- l know you're very tired...
- l'm beyond tired.

488
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:14,267
l'm beyond scared.

489
00:39:15,276 --> 00:39:20,304
l'm standing on the mouth of hell,
and it is gonna swallow me whole.

490
00:39:20,396 --> 00:39:23,274
And it'll choke on me.

491
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,266
We're not ready?

492
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:30,950
They're not ready.

493
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:35,791
They think we're gonna wait
for the end to come, like we always do.

494
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,787
l'm done waiting.

495
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,551
They want an apocalypse?
Well, we'll give 'em one.

496
00:39:43,156 --> 00:39:48,992
Anyone else who wants to run, do it now.
Cos we just became an army.

497
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:52,865
We just declared war.

498
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:59,268
From now on, we won'tjust face
our worst fears, we will seek them out.

499
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:03,110
We will find them
and cut out their hearts one by one,

500
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:07,865
until the First shows itself
for what it really is.

501
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:11,515
And l'll kill it myself.

502
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:20,390
There is only one thing on this earth
more powerful than evil, and that's us.

503
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:25,707
Any questions?

504
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:47,231
