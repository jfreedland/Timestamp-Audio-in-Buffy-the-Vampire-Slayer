1
00:00:02,546 --> 00:00:06,312
- So what do you think?
- It's nice.

2
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:08,697
But do you think Cordelia will like it?

3
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:13,257
I don't know.
Does she know what one of these is?

4
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:14,831
OK, big yucks.

5
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:17,220
When are you, guys, gonna
stop making fun of me for dating Cordelia?

6
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:20,040
I'm sorry. But never.

7
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:23,925
I just think you could find
somebody more... Better.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,397
Uh. Parallel universe, maybe.

9
00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:30,847
Here the only other person
I'm interested in is, um, unavailable.

10
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:33,357
Besides, Cordy and I
are really gettin' along.

11
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:36,664
We're not fighting as much, and yesterday
we just sat together, not even speakin'.

12
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:41,110
You know, just, uh,
enjoying comfortable silence.

13
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:43,971
Man, that was dull.

14
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:47,631
I'm glad that you guys are getting along.
Almost really.

15
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,470
And don't stress over the gift.

16
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,034
Well, this is new territory for me.

17
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:54,653
I mean, my valentines are usually
met with heartfelt restraining orders.

18
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,224
She'll love it.

19
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,092
I wish dating was like slaying, you know?

20
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:01,837
simple, direct, stake to the heart,
no muss, no fuss.

21
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:35,925
Sorry to say, Xand.

22
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:38,512
Slaying is a tad
more perilous than dating.

23
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:41,669
Well, you're obviously
not dating Cordelia.

24
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:39,606
<b>"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"</b>

25
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:51,959
Wait up!

26
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:53,589
Hey, wait up!

27
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:58,348
Excuse me? Where's the fire sale?

28
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:00,848
Oh, sorry. Didn't see you.

29
00:03:00,883 --> 00:03:02,428
Well, why didn't you
call me back last night?

30
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,071
We need to talk about
our outfits for the dance.

31
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:06,788
I'm gonna wear red and black,
so you need to switch.

32
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:10,216
Red and black?
Is that what Xander likes?

33
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:12,372
Xander?
What does he have to do with this?

34
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:15,553
Well, a girl wants to look good
for her geek.

35
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,312
Xander's just...

36
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:20,141
When are you two gonna start wearing
cute little matching outfits?

37
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:23,505
'Cause I'm planning to vomit.
Let's go.

38
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,787
Papers on my desk.

39
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:32,853
Anybody tries to leave without giving me
a paper is looking at a failing grade.

40
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:37,086
This time I'm ready for ya.
No F for Xander today.

41
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:40,957
No, this baby's my ticket
to a sweet D minus.

42
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:43,546
- Hey, Amy.
- Hey.

43
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:46,242
You, guys, going to the
Valentine's Day dance at the Bronze?

44
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:48,973
- I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
- Go ahead, you know you wanna say it.

45
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:51,002
My boyfriend's in the band.

46
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:53,726
- Cool!
- I think you've now told everybody.

47
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:57,201
- Only in this hemisphere.
- What about you?

48
00:03:57,236 --> 00:04:01,880
Oh, Valentine's Day is just a cheap gimmick
to sell cards and chocolate.

49
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:04,580
Bad break-up, huh?

50
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:06,916
Believe me when I say "Uh-huh".

51
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,934
Thank you. Thank you.

52
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,140
Thank you, Amy.

53
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:30,342
I just hate to think of you solo
on Valentine's Day.

54
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:33,963
I'll be fine. Mom and I are gonna have
a pig-out and vid fest.

55
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:36,046
It's a time-honored tradition
among the loveless.

56
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,087
- Did you, guys, see that?
- See what?

57
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,122
In class. I think Amy just worked
some magic on Miss Beakman.

58
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:42,865
You mean like witchcraft?

59
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,224
- You know, her mom's a witch.
- And an amateur psycho.

60
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,807
Amy's the last person
that should be messing with that stuff.

61
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:50,641
- Maybe I should go talk to her.
- Buffy? Buffy?

62
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,086
- Might I have a word?
- Have a sentence even.

63
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:57,553
- Oh, good. Well...
- Back it up before you leave.

64
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:06,631
- Rupert.
- Ms Calendar.

65
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:13,361
I'm glad we ran into each other, actually.
I was hoping that we could, uh...

66
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:16,846
- Do you have a minute?
- Erm...

67
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:19,466
Actually, not, not just now. Um...

68
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:23,261
I, uh, have a matter
to discuss with, with Buffy.

69
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:26,866
Right. Let's go.

70
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:48,370
Are you OK?

71
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:51,776
Me? I'll... I'll be fine.

72
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:54,980
Um, I was more concerned about you,
actually.

73
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:58,910
Since Angel, erm, turned...

74
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:03,367
I've, um, been reading up on,
on his earlier activities.

75
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,543
Y'know, uh, feeding patterns
a-and the like.

76
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,065
And?

77
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:13,326
Around Valentine's Day, he, he,
he's rather prone to, uh...

78
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:16,448
well, erm, brutal displays of, uh...

79
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,365
He would think of it
as affection, I suppose.

80
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,179
- Like what?
- No... no, uh, need to go into details.

81
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:26,692
- That bad?
- Suffice it to say, I...

82
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:29,481
I, I think it would be best
if you stayed off the streets...

83
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:31,621
For a few nights.

84
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:33,872
I, I'll, erm...

85
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:37,081
I'll patrol.
You know, keep an eye on things.

86
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:41,874
Better safe than sorry.

87
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:46,172
It's a little late for both.

88
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,261
Fancy it, pet?

89
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:59,324
It's beautiful.

90
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:04,232
Nothing but the best for my gir...

91
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:10,140
Happy Valentine's Day, Dru.

92
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:15,070
Angel!

93
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:17,395
It's still warm.

94
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,806
I knew you'd like it.

95
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:23,713
I found it in a quaint little shopgirl.

96
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,892
Cute.

97
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:36,202
Here.

98
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,637
I'll get it.

99
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:44,194
Done.

100
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:46,867
I know Dru gives you pity access...

101
00:07:47,164 --> 00:07:50,630
but you have to admit it's so much
easier when I do things for her!

102
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:54,333
You would do well
to worry less about Dru...

103
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:57,960
and more about that slayer
you've been tramping around with.

104
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:00,345
Dear Buffy. Hm.

105
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,566
I'm still trying to decide
the best way to send my regards.

106
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:07,725
Why don't you rip her lungs out?
That might make an impression.

107
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,187
Lacks... poetry.

108
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:12,357
It doesn't have to.

109
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,835
What rhymes with lungs?

110
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:19,257
Don't worry, Spike.

111
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,659
Angel always knows...

112
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:27,129
what speaks to a girl's heart.

OK, clearly the fact
that I please you visually

143
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:15,293
- has got us off on the wrong foot here.
- Xander...

144
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:17,216
Let me finish.

145
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:20,088
I've been thinking a lot
about us lately.

146
00:11:20,194 --> 00:11:22,604
The why and the wherefore.

147
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:27,335
You know, once, twice.
A kissy here, a kissy there.

148
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,865
And you can chalk it all up to hormones.

149
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,258
And maybe that's all we have here -
tawdry, teen lust.

150
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,141
But maybe not.

151
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:42,116
Maybe something in you sees something
special inside me, and vice versa.

152
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:46,110
I mean, I think I do. See something.

153
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,275
So...

154
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:51,452
Xander.

155
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:56,148
Thank you.

156
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,690
It's beautiful.

157
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:03,280
I wanna break up.

158
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:08,675
OK, not quite the reaction
I was lookin' for.

159
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,589
I know. I'm sorry. It's just...

160
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,518
Who are we kidding?
Even if parts of us do see specialness...

161
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,462
We don't fit.

162
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,588
Yeah.

163
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,673
OK.

164
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,209
Do you know what's a good day
to break up with somebody?

165
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,041
Any day besides Valentine's Day!

166
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,405
I mean, what?
Were you runnin' low on dramatic irony?

167
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:35,314
I know.
I didn't mean to do it this way. I...

168
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:37,405
Well, you did.

169
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:54,245
Dude! Way to get dumped!

170
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:04,520
- Buffy, my bud, you would not believe...
- Can't talk right now. Angel.

171
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:07,372
- Do you need help?
- It's all right.

172
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:20,208
Gee, Xander, maybe
you should learn a second language,

173
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:23,597
so that even more girls
can reject you.

174
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:40,505
What are you doing?

175
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,696
Amy. Good to see ya.

176
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:46,489
You're a witch.

177
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:50,187
No, I'm not.
That... that was my mom, remember?

178
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:52,105
Yeah. I'm thinkin'
that runs in the family.

179
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,642
I saw you working
that mojo on Miss Beakman.

180
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:58,188
- Maybe I should go tell somebody.
- That's not even... That is so mean!

181
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:01,963
- Blackmail is such an ugly word.
- I didn't say blackmail.

182
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:06,323
Yeah, but I'm about to blackmail you,
so I thought I'd bring it up.

183
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,708
What do you want?

184
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,966
What do I want?

185
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,849
I want some respect around here.

186
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,696
I want, for once, to come out ahead.

187
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,651
I want the Hellmouth
to be workin' for me.

188
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:22,516
You and me, Amy.

189
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:28,836
We're gonna cast a little spell.

190
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,788
- A love spell?
- Yeah.

191
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:38,158
You know, just the basic.
Can't eat, can't sleep,

192
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,462
can't breathe anything
but little old moi.

193
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:43,012
Well, that kind of thing
is the hardest, I mean...

194
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:45,436
to make someone...
love you for all eternity?

195
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:49,520
Whoa! Whoa! Back up.
Who said anything about eternity?

196
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,831
A man can only talk self-tanning lotion
for so long before his head explodes.

197
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,439
Well then, I don't get it.

198
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,771
If you don't wanna be
with her for ever, what's the point?

199
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:58,670
The point is, I want her to want me,

200
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:00,731
desperately,
so I can break up with her...

201
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,997
and subject her to the same hell
she's been puttin' me through.

202
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:07,637
Oh, I don't know, Xander.

203
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:12,504
- Intent has to be pure with love spells.
- Right. I intend revenge.

204
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:14,063
Pure as the driven snow.

205
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:16,280
Now, are you gonna play, or

206
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:19,970
do we need to have another chat
about invisible homework?

207
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:26,074
I'll need something of hers.
A personal object.

208
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:28,015
Right.

209
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:37,052
"Soon" what, Giles?

210
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:40,592
You never held out on me until the big,
bad thing in the dark became my ex-honey.

211
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:43,178
- Where's this from?
- He said it with flowers.

212
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:46,181
This isn't the time to start
becoming Mr. Protective Guy.

213
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:49,354
I can't just hang around and I can't
prepare when I don't know what's coming.

214
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:52,457
No. Of course. You're right.

215
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,779
S-sit down.

216
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,455
Oh, come on! Don't flatter yourself.

217
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:07,421
I'm not gonna make a big scene.
I just want the necklace back.

218
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:09,589
What? I thought it was a gift!

219
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,242
No, last night it was a gift.
Today it's scrap metal.

220
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:15,484
I figure I can melt it down
and sell it for fillings or something.

221
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,028
- You're pathetic!
- Come on.

222
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:21,037
I'm not gonna add to
the Cordelia Chase Cast-Off Collection.

223
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,234
It's in my locker.

224
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:26,935
I can wait.

225
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:52,394
Here. It's a good thing we broke up.

226
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:55,290
Now I don't have to pretend I like it.

227
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:08,362
Diana!

228
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,444
Goddess of love and the hunt...

229
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:14,407
I pray to thee.

230
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:18,459
Let my cries bind the heart
of Xander's beloved.

231
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:23,095
May she neither rest nor sleep...

232
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,206
until she submits to his will only.

233
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,968
Diana!

234
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,472
Bring about this love and bless it!

235
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,040
Blow out the candle now!

236
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,353
Remember? I don't remember.

237
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:01,909
- What?
- Morning, ladies.

238
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:05,350
Some kind of weather
we've been havin', huh?

239
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,026
What do you want?

240
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:09,832
You can't be sniffing around
for more jewellery to melt,

241
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:13,759
'cause all you ever gave me
was that Smallmart-looking thing.

242
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:18,654
Is this love? 'Cause maybe on you
it doesn't look that different.

243
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:22,510
What are you doing? Are you going,
like, stalker boy on me now?

244
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:30,072
- Sorry, my mistake.
- Yeah, I should say so.

245
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:34,353
What is his deal?

246
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,821
Oh, here's another. Here.

247
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:42,471
Um, 'Valentine's Day.' Yes, uh...
'Angel nails a puppy to the...

248
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:45,144
- Skip it.
- Uh, but it...

249
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,041
I don't wanna know.
I don't have a puppy. Skip it.

250
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:52,337
Right you are. I'll get another batch.

251
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,557
I have a plan.

252
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:58,607
- We use me as bait.
- You mean make Angel come after you?

253
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:00,467
No, I mean chop me into little pieces

254
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:02,255
and stick me on hooks
for fish to nibble at

255
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,042
'cause it would be more fun
than my life.

256
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,075
Yeah. I heard about you and Cordy.

257
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,800
- That's her loss.
- Yeah.

258
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:14,050
Not really the popular theory.

259
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:18,229
You know what I'd like?

260
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:21,452
Why don't you and I do something
together tonight? Just the two of us.

261
00:19:22,968 --> 00:19:26,911
- Really?
- Yeah. We can comfort each other.

262
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:29,862
Well, would lap dancing
enter into that scenario at all?

263
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:32,399
'Cause I find that very comforting.

264
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:37,572
Play your cards right...

265
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,140
OK, uh... you do know
that I'm Xander, right?

266
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:45,103
I don't know, I just...

267
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:48,200
heard that you and Cordy
broke up, and...

268
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:51,997
I guess I was just surprised
how glad I was.

269
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:57,332
It's funny... how you can
see someone every day,

270
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:01,489
but... not really see them. You know?

271
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,950
Yeah, it's funny.

272
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:07,251
And it's just gettin' funnier.

273
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,686
Xander,
can I talk to you for a minute?

274
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,142
Yeah, OK.

275
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,349
Oh! This is interesting!

276
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:28,044
- Xander?
- Yeah.

277
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,481
- I don't think the spell worked out right.
- Oh, yeah, it bombed. No biggie.

278
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:35,175
Well, we can always try again.
I am still pretty new at this.

279
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,762
Oh, no, no. It's OK. You know what?
It was wrong

280
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:40,697
to meddle with the forces of darkness.
I see that now.

281
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:44,284
- I think we've all grown. I gotta go.
- Oh, we don't have to cast any spells.

282
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:47,073
We can just... hang out.

283
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:49,254
Sure.

284
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:53,324
- What?
- Well, I liked spending time with you.

285
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:55,797
You're so sweet.

286
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:58,734
You know, it's funny how you can...
you can see a person every day and...

287
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:01,637
Not really see them?

288
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:03,888
Exactly.

289
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,065
So, anyway, I thought it may be...

290
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,608
- Hi, Xander.
- What?

291
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,582
You're in Mr. Baird's
history class, right?

292
00:21:10,624 --> 00:21:12,158
- Yeah.
- I thought, maybe

293
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,357
- we could study together tonight.
- Do you mind? We were talking.

294
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,743
I really gotta go.

295
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:20,877
Right now.

296
00:21:36,987 --> 00:21:40,460
Sorry. I wanted to surprise you.

297
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:43,590
Good job! High marks.

298
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,438
Don't be so jumpy.
I've been in your bed before.

299
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:50,635
Yeah, but, Will,
we were both in footie pajamas.

300
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:53,140
Xand, I've been thinking.

301
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:55,378
Will, I... I think I know
what you've been thinking.

302
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:57,264
But this is all my fault.

303
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,837
- I cast a spell and it sort of backfired.
- How long have we been friends?

304
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:02,871
A long, long time.

305
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,893
Too long to do anything
that might change that now.

306
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:08,118
But friendships change all the time.

307
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,434
People grow apart. They grow closer.

308
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:14,619
This is good - how close we are now.

309
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,044
I feel comfortable
with this amount of closeness.

310
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:20,487
In fact, I can even back up
a few paces and still be happy.

311
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,223
See?

312
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:27,031
I want you, Xander...

313
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,154
- to be my first.
- Baseman?

314
00:22:30,189 --> 00:22:32,413
Please, tell me we're talking baseball.

315
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:37,618
We both know it's right.

316
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:39,969
It's not that I don't find you sexy.

317
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:43,308
Is it Oz? Don't worry about him.

318
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:46,456
He's sweet, but... he's not you.

319
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:50,643
Yes, he is! And you should go to him.
'Cause he's me!

320
00:22:53,987 --> 00:22:56,193
I-I-I don't wanna use force.

321
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:58,874
Force is OK.

322
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,855
That's it! This has gotta stop!

323
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:04,858
It's time for me to act like a man!

324
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:06,699
And hide!

325
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:19,584
Ha, very funny. What did I do now?
Wear red and purple together?

326
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:23,366
You know what you did.
Xander is wounded because of you.

327
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:27,481
Are you tripping? I thought
you wanted me to break up with him.

328
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:32,762
Only a sick pup would let Xander get away,
no matter what her friends said.

329
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:37,106
What does it take to make you people happy?

<i># Not all the time in the world</i>

341
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:20,630
<i># But we got a lot</i>

342
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,724
<i># Now, there's much more
than a ghost of a chance</i>

343
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:30,547
<i># We can make it</i>

344
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:35,168
<i># Right this time</i>

345
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:37,660
<i># 'Cause you've got to stay mine</i>

346
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:41,016
<i># Yeah, I got the love</i>

347
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:44,146
<i># Got the love, got the love...</i>

348
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,683
<i># We got to make it work</i>

349
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,087
<i># Got the love, got the love...</i>

350
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:49,167
Xander.

351
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,875
- What is it?
- It's... it's me.

352
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:56,305
- Throwing myself at your mercy.
- What? Why?

353
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:57,863
I made a mess, Giles.

354
00:24:57,864 --> 00:25:01,243
See, I found out that Amy's into
witchcraft, and... I was hurt I guess.

355
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,863
So I... made her put the love whammy
on Cordy, but it backfired.

356
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:07,461
And now every woman in Sunnydale
wants to make me her cuddle monkey.

357
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:09,121
Which may sound swell on paper, but...

358
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:12,627
Rupert, we need to talk. Hey, Xander.

359
00:25:12,662 --> 00:25:14,346
Nice shirt.

360
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:16,400
Look, Rupert,
I know you're angry at me,

361
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:20,049
and I don't blame you,
but I am not just gonna go away.

362
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,636
I mean, I care far too much about you to...

363
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:26,211
Have you been working out?

364
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:34,688
I cannot believe
you were fool enough to do this.

365
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:38,333
Oh, no. I'm twice the fool it takes
to do something like this.

366
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:43,416
Has, erm...
Has Amy tried to reverse the spell?

367
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:46,513
I get around Amy and all she wants
to do is talk honeymoon plans.

368
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,882
Rupert, maybe I need to
talk to Xander alone.

369
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,914
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

370
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,361
People under a love spell,
Xander, are deadly.

371
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,311
They lose all capacity for reason.

372
00:25:57,346 --> 00:26:02,161
And if what you say is true, and the
entire female population is affected...

373
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,424
Don't leave the library.

374
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:08,931
I'll find Amy and see
if we can put a stop to this thing.

375
00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:18,322
No.

376
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:39,285
Alone at last.

377
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:43,509
- Buff! Give me a heart attack!
- Oh...

378
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:45,688
I'm gonna give you more than that.

379
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:50,187
Buff, for the love of God,
don't open that raincoat.

380
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,716
Come on, it's a party.

381
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:56,559
Aren't you gonna open your present?

382
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:59,009
It's not that I don't want to.

383
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,530
Sometimes the remote impossible
possibility that you might like me...

384
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:04,315
was all that sustained me. But not now.

385
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:06,609
Not like this.

386
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:10,747
This isn't real to you.
You're only here because of a spell.

387
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,145
I mean, if I thought you had one clue
what it would mean to me...

388
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,284
But you don't.

389
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:22,173
So I can't.

390
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,556
So you're saying this is all a game?

391
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:28,319
A game? I... No!

392
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:31,521
You make me feel this way
and then you reject me?

393
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:34,214
- What am I, a toy?
- Buffy, please calm down!

394
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:36,745
I'll calm down
when you explain yourself!

395
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,038
Get away from him.

396
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:41,758
He's mine.

397
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:45,693
Oh, I don't think so.

398
00:27:45,728 --> 00:27:49,459
- Xander, tell her.
- What? I... uh...

399
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:53,225
He doesn't have to say.
I know what his heart wants.

400
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,246
Funny. I know what your face wants.

401
00:27:58,874 --> 00:28:01,477
What is this? You're two-timing me?!

402
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:05,107
Goddess Hecate, work thy will!

403
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:09,531
Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!

404
00:28:10,464 --> 00:28:12,862
Buffy!

405
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,284
Oh, my God!

406
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,017
- Wh-what just happened?
- Buffy.

407
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:32,188
Where... where is she?

408
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,779
- Oh, my God!
- Why is she here?

409
00:28:39,814 --> 00:28:43,182
Can you focus for a minute?
You just turned Buffy into a rat!

410
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,339
Buffy can take care of herself.

411
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:50,167
- Why don't we go someplace private?
- Can you...

412
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:52,701
I'm not going anywhere
until you change her back.

413
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:56,854
You heard him. So why don't you
undo your magic trick and get lost?

414
00:28:56,889 --> 00:28:59,000
Who made you queen of the world?

415
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:00,850
Well, you're old enough to be.

416
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:02,696
Well, what can I say?

417
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:06,562
I guess Xander's just too much man
for the pimple squad.

418
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:11,019
Goddess Hecate, to you I pray...

419
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:13,823
- with this...
- Quit with the Hecate!

420
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:19,932
OK, what now?
You don't like my locker combination?

421
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:25,153
It's just not right.
You never loved him. You just used him.

422
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:28,174
- You make me sick.
- OK, Harmony,

423
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:31,096
if you need to borrow my Midol,
just ask.

424
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,707
You two, sit!

425
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,241
Be quiet.

426
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:45,924
We have to catch the Buffy-rat.

427
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,751
Ooh, there!

428
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,308
Good, Buffy.

429
00:29:58,038 --> 00:29:59,838
Just...

430
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:11,358
- That kinda hurt.
- Kinda? What was that for?

431
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,047
I was on the phone all night
listening to Willow cry about you.

432
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:17,456
Now, I don't know exactly what happened,

433
00:30:17,457 --> 00:30:21,383
but I was left
with the strong urge to... hit you.

434
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:28,301
- I didn't touch her, I swear.
- Xander!

435
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:30,131
Where's Buffy?

436
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,890
Amy turned her into a rat.

437
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:43,121
I don't see her.
If anything happens to her, I'll...

438
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:46,008
Oh, just go home. Lock yourself away.

439
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:47,894
You're only going to
cause more problems here.

440
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,855
Um, Amy, Jenny and I will try
and break the spell.

441
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:57,666
Oz, if you could aid us in finding, erm...
Buffy?

442
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:59,925
Sure. Absolutely.

443
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,904
- If...
- Just go. Get out of my sight.

444
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,239
Buffy?

445
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:22,746
What are you doing?
You guys are crazy!

446
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,081
You thought you could do better,
is that it?

447
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:28,868
We'll knock that snotty attitude
right out of you!

448
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:53,272
You must have...
botched the ritual so that

449
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:56,368
Cordelia's necklace actually
protected her from the spell.

450
00:31:56,403 --> 00:32:00,269
It should be easily reversible.
Where did you learn animal transformation?

451
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:03,445
Why did you send Xander away?
He needs me.

452
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:06,263
- That's a laugh.
- He loves me.

453
00:32:06,264 --> 00:32:08,404
We look into each other's souls.

454
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:10,390
No one can love two people at once.

455
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:12,089
What we have, is real.

456
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,232
Instead of making me ill,
why doesn't one of you try to help me?

457
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:17,876
- You have no idea what I'm going through.
- I know it's not love!

458
00:32:17,963 --> 00:32:21,463
It's obsession - selfish, banal obsession.

459
00:32:21,498 --> 00:32:23,447
Xander has put himself
in very grave danger.

460
00:32:23,613 --> 00:32:25,381
If you cared at all about him,
you'd help save him

461
00:32:25,382 --> 00:32:28,391
rather than wittering on
about your feelings.

462
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:31,995
Now, let's get on with some work.
Now, Jenny...

463
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:34,673
Great.

464
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,385
I think we...

465
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,510
- lost 'em.
- I should have known

466
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:41,615
I'd find you with her.

467
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,175
Will. Come on,
you don't wanna hurt me.

468
00:32:44,176 --> 00:32:45,852
Oh, no?

469
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:50,642
You don't know how hard this is for me.
I love you so much.

470
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:54,290
I'd rather see you dead
than with that bitch!

471
00:33:39,358 --> 00:33:43,076
- OK, now I really think we've lost 'em.
- Dammit, Xander, what's going on?

472
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:45,323
- Who died and made you Elvis?
- Buffy's house.

473
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,791
Let's get inside. I'll explain later.

474
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:54,700
- Come on!
- Xander? Cordelia?

475
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:57,008
Yeah. Hi.

476
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,599
What happened?
Why are you all scratched up?

477
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:03,805
- Where's Buffy?
- She's, um...

478
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:05,292
around.

479
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:07,404
Well, sit down and tell me about it.

480
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:11,778
Why don't you run upstairs and grab
some bandages out of the bathroom?

481
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:15,030
Let me, uh, get you something to drink.

482
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:18,373
You in the mood for cold or hot?

483
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:19,603
I-I...

484
00:34:19,728 --> 00:34:24,027
I think it's more of
a hot night, don't you?

485
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:30,348
- Whatever.
- You are so tense. Mmm.

486
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,524
What are you doing? Make me yak!

487
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,948
Cordelia, go back upstairs.
This is between us.

488
00:34:35,983 --> 00:34:39,061
- Gross. I think not. Let's go.
- What are you doing?

489
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:42,264
Hey, get your hands off me!

490
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:46,470
And keep your mom-aged mitts
off my boyfriend.

491
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:48,038
Former!

492
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:50,206
Why has everyone gone insane?

493
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:53,733
Insane? Is it so impossible
for you to believe

494
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:55,716
that other women find me attractive?

495
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:59,054
The only way you could get girls
to want you would be witchcraft.

496
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:01,427
That is such a...

497
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:03,945
Well, yeah, OK. Good point.

498
00:35:04,782 --> 00:35:06,788
Oh, my God!

499
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,592
Xander, honey, let Joycie in.
Hon, let Joycie in.

500
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:12,839
- Upstairs! Buffy's room!
- Sweetheart?

501
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:23,233
Good. The mob still hasn't found us.
We should be safer up here.

502
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,233
Works in theory.

503
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,145
Xander!

504
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:50,150
- Where's Buffy?
- Cordy, get outta here!

505
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:57,763
Perfect.

506
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,730
I wanted to do
something special for Buffy.

507
00:36:00,765 --> 00:36:04,408
Actually, to Buffy.
But this is so much better.

508
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:13,284
If it's any consolation,
I feel very close to you right now.

509
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:19,939
- Buffy, how...?
- Don't fret, kitten.

510
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:24,643
Mummy's here.

511
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:27,780
I don't know what you're up to,
Dru, but it doesn't amuse!

512
00:36:29,807 --> 00:36:35,470
If you harm one hair
on this boy's head...

513
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:38,532
You've gotta be kidding. Him?

514
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:43,209
Just because
I've finally found a real man...

515
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:49,983
- I guess I really did drive you crazy.
- Your face is a poem.

516
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:54,296
I can read it.

517
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:58,725
Really? It doesn't say
"Spare me" by any chance?

518
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,463
How do you feel about eternal life?

519
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:12,058
We couldn't just start with a coffee?

520
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:14,286
A movie maybe?

521
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:19,119
- There he is! He's mine!
- Get off!

522
00:37:29,154 --> 00:37:31,296
All you had to do was love me!

523
00:37:31,636 --> 00:37:33,165
No!

524
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,505
Get out of the way! Get off him!

525
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,990
Back off!

526
00:37:49,448 --> 00:37:51,877
Ah, sorry, Dru.

527
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:55,476
Guess you're not invited.

528
00:37:57,686 --> 00:38:01,331
It's never gonna work for us, Xander.
We have to end it.

529
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:11,451
Here, Buffy.

530
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:27,006
Right.

531
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:30,081
Go on. You first.

532
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:32,929
- Xander!
- Gimme a nail.

533
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:37,453
If we die in here,
I'm gonna kick your ass. I mean it.

534
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:40,145
None of this would've happened
if you hadn't broken up with me.

535
00:38:40,146 --> 00:38:42,102
But no, you're so desperate
to be popular!

536
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:46,273
Me? I'm not the one who embraced the black
arts just to get the girls to like me.

537
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:48,634
Well, congratulations. It worked.

538
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:53,353
It would've worked fine, except your hide's
so thick not even magic can penetrate it!

539
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:59,316
You mean the spell was for me?

540
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,579
Xander, let me touch you!

541
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:19,188
Goddess of creatures great and small,
I conjure thee to withdraw.

542
00:39:25,102 --> 00:39:26,630
Hecate!

543
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:29,789
I hereby license thee to depart.

544
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:38,748
Buffy?

545
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:48,566
- Oh, my God!
- Stay behind me.

546
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:50,552
Xander!

547
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:55,023
I need you. Come here, please!

548
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:57,599
Erm, Diana!

549
00:39:57,634 --> 00:40:00,023
Goddess of love, be gone!

550
00:40:00,058 --> 00:40:02,465
Hear no more thy siren's song.

551
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,963
Get off!

552
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:31,332
Get off me!

553
00:40:35,826 --> 00:40:38,373
What's going on? Where am I?

554
00:40:39,592 --> 00:40:42,014
What's going on?

555
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:55,090
- Hi, Oz!
- Hi.

556
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,404
I seem to be having
a slight case of nudity here.

557
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:01,691
But you're not a rat!

558
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,709
So call it an upside.

559
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,621
You think, maybe
you could get me some clothing?

560
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:09,390
Yes, I can. Just, uh,
don't go anywhere.

561
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,620
Really not an issue.

562
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:17,791
What... What did we...?

563
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:21,151
Boy, that was the best scavenger hunt ever!

564
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:28,109
- "Scavenger hunt".
- Your mom seemed to buy it.

565
00:41:28,144 --> 00:41:30,142
So she says.

566
00:41:30,143 --> 00:41:33,471
I think she's just so wigged at hitting on
one of my friends that she's repressing.

567
00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:37,214
She's getting pretty good at that.
I should probably start worrying.

568
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:40,079
Well, I'm back to
being incredibly unpopular.

569
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:42,996
It's better than everyone
trying to axe-murder you, right?

570
00:41:42,997 --> 00:41:47,978
Mostly, but, uh...
Willow won't even talk to me.

571
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,999
- Any particular reason she should?
- How much groveling are we talking here?

572
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:54,149
Oh, a month, at least.

573
00:41:54,283 --> 00:41:57,757
Xander, come on.
I mean, this is worse for her than anyone.

574
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:02,186
She loved you before you invoked
the great roofie spirit. The rest of us...

575
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:05,042
- You remember, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

576
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:10,657
I remember coming on to you.
I remember begging you to undress me.

577
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:13,212
And then a sudden need for cheese.

578
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:15,552
I also remember that you didn't.

579
00:42:15,624 --> 00:42:18,743
- Need cheese?
- Undress me.

580
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:22,267
It meant a lot to me, what you said.

581
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:25,038
Come on, Buffy, I couldn't
take advantage of you like that.

582
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:26,865
OK, for a minute it was
touch and go there.

583
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:28,909
You came through.

584
00:42:29,432 --> 00:42:33,250
- There might just be hope for you yet.
- Well, tell that to Cordelia.

585
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:36,394
You're on your own there.

586
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:40,594
Cody Weinberg called me
at home last night.

587
00:42:40,629 --> 00:42:44,765
- Cody Weinberg? The one with the 35OSL?
- The very one. 

588
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,513
Said he's thinking of asking me
to the pledge dance on Thursday.

589
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:49,274
- That's so huge!
- Yeah!

590
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,406
There's just two other girls
he's gonna ask first,

591
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:54,333
and if they refuse, then... Watch it!

592
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:56,430
Sorry.

593
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:58,214
God! You know, I'm glad

594
00:42:58,215 --> 00:43:01,679
your mom stopped working at the
drive-through long enough to dress you.

595
00:43:01,714 --> 00:43:05,875
Oh, that reminds me.
Did you see Jennifer's backpack?

596
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:08,975
- It is so trying to...
- Harmony, shut up!

597
00:43:10,353 --> 00:43:12,931
Do you know what you are, Harmony?
You're a sheep.

598
00:43:12,932 --> 00:43:15,067
- I'm not a sheep.
- You're a sheep!

599
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:19,553
All you ever do is what everyone else does,
just so you can say you did it first!

600
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:21,791
And here I am
scrambling for your approval

601
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:24,569
when I'm way cooler than you are
'cause I'm not a sheep!

602
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:27,337
I do what I wanna do
and I wear what I wanna wear.

603
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:31,541
And you know what?
I'll date whoever the hell I wanna date.

604
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:34,644
No matter how lame he is.

605
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:46,619
Oh, God! Oh, God!

606
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:51,181
- It's gonna be OK. Just keep walkin'.
- Oh, God, what have I done?

607
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:54,067
- They're never gonna speak to me again.
- I'm sure they are.

608
00:43:54,402 --> 00:43:57,079
If it helps, whenever we're around them,
you and I can fight a lot.

609
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,774
- You promise?
- You can pretty much count on it.
