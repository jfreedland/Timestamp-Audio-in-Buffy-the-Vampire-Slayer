1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,681
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:09,127
Whenever a slayer turns 18.
It's a time-honoured rite of passage.

3
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:11,363
It's an archaic exercise in cruelty.

4
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:14,763
- We're finished.
- Not quite. She passed. You didn't.

5
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:19,324
I have recommended to the Council that
you be relieved of your duties as Watcher.

6
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:20,448
You're fired.

7
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:24,845
- The Council's orders are to concentrate...
- I don't think I'm taking any more orders.

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:30,246
Tell your Council, until the next slayer comes
along, I'm not working for them any more.

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,643
- What about the Key? They all over it?
- They're interested.

10
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:37,612
But they didn't guess about Dawn?
They don't know that it's her?

11
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:38,489
No.

12
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:44,207
Here, I'll get that. Sorry.

13
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:48,129
Mom's still not 100 per cent
and I haven't been taking up the slack.

14
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:52,411
- No, the place looks fine, Buffy.
- Yeah, it's just us.

15
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,686
That must have belonged to...

16
00:00:57,773 --> 00:01:00,526
Aren't we supposed to have a meeting?

17
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:04,851
Yes, we're here for a reason.

18
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:08,323
I've had some rather...
Well, I've had some news.

19
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:10,722
It seems that the Council of Watchers

20
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:14,203
has found some information
that may help us out.

21
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:16,523
- About Glory?
- Presumably.

22
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:19,605
We'll find out when they arrive.
Could be very important.

23
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:24,244
Arrive? They're coming here? Now?
Why do they have to come here?

24
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:28,372
Don't they have phones? "'AIIo, Buffy!
Here's some stuff we know, pip pip."

25
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:30,728
Yeah! Phones. I'd like them on phones.

26
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:33,532
What's so bad about them?
Aren't they good guys?

27
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:36,366
I mean, watchers,
that's like other Gileses, right?

28
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:39,604
Yeah, they're scary and horrible.

29
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,122
They can appear a bit... well, hard-nosed.

30
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:47,923
But their agenda is the same as ours.
They want to save the world and kill demons.

31
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:51,369
Kill the current demons, right?
Current demons.

32
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:55,526
Giles, I don't want them to come here.
I don't trust them. Make them not come here.

33
00:01:55,613 --> 00:02:01,290
They're already on their way. Our old friend
Quentin Travers is heading up a delegation.

34
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:03,523
Their test almost killed me.

35
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:06,252
And when I was Faith,
they almost killed me again.

36
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,642
I can't handle almost being killed right now.

37
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:13,488
I don't like the sound of this.
They don't sound very ex-demon-compatible.

38
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:19,125
Are you sure they're English? I thought
they were gentler than normal people.

39
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:24,082
Maybe it won't be so bad this time. I mean,
Buffy, they did think you were Faith last time.

40
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:27,483
Now they know you're you,
maybe they won't care enough to kill you.

41
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:30,690
It's notjust that.
They're gonna screw everything up.

42
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:34,527
It's a delicate time right now.
I have to take care of Dawn, and...

43
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,844
But that's not new.
You've always taken care of her.

44
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:41,642
Right. Right, I know that.
It's just, you know, there's Glory.

45
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:45,885
I don't need them looking over my shoulder
when I don't know what we're dealing with.

46
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:49,682
That's precisely why we need to talk to them.

47
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:53,812
Dawn, honey, what are you doing
up at this hour? Go back to bed.

48
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:57,727
- I was just getting a snack.
- Dawn, are you listening?

49
00:02:57,813 --> 00:03:00,373
I can get a snack if I want to.

50
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:04,569
- She was listening.
- Does it matter?

51
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:07,850
I mean, is she really gonna
set the junior high school buzzing

52
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:10,811
with "There's a delegation a-coming"?

53
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:13,771
No, I guess not. You know, it's just...

54
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,726
sometimes we say stuff, and... it's all good.

55
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:21,532
Giles, you were saying something?

56
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:25,288
Just that if the Council
knows something about Glory,

57
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:28,729
her agenda or her origins,

58
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:32,806
then maybe it will help us
get a grip on what we're dealing with.

59
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,122
Right now I think we're a bit lost.

60
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,845
Mistress!

61
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:50,367
Oh, God! Please don't hurt me, I beg of you!

62
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:53,013
If you just let me go,
I swear I won't tell anyone!

63
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:56,563
- Help her!
- We're here for you, Great One.

64
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,606
- Drink.
- What is this?

65
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,807
What the hell are you things doing to me?

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

67
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:26,242
Very good. Delicious.

68
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,131
No, I'm good. It's OK.

69
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:38,641
I know you're all always
looking at me. I can tell.

70
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,531
Always tell. I can see.

71
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:44,366
My hat. Where's... my hat?

72
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,167
Where's... my hat?

73
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:53,128
Try not cutting things
so close next time, understood?

74
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:56,046
- Yes. We live to serve.
- As always.

75
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:59,930
Cool. Take this mess out
with the rest of the trash.

76
00:05:01,453 --> 00:05:05,731
And you have something to tell me?

77
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:08,611
- Indeed, Glorificus.
- And I'm waiting.

78
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:14,563
We have found that the signs of the
alignment are moving faster than expected.

79
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:15,529
Meaning?

80
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:19,652
If you are to use the Key,
you must act quickly.

81
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:23,085
Fine.

82
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:27,849
I have been cooling my heels
in this crappy little town long enough.

83
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:32,848
Sunnydale's got too many demons
and not enough retail outlets.

84
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,924
All you need is the Key.

85
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:38,847
Yes, and I bet Mousy the Vampire Slayer
has an idea where it is.

86
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:43,643
If I may remind Your Eminence,
you don't have much time.

87
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:48,011
Baby, if that girl's the only thing
between me and my Key,

88
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:50,129
I don't need much time.

89
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:48,531
If you're serious about this, madam,
you need to be very careful.

90
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:51,366
Measure precisely,
and please don't step ahead.

91
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,286
He's quite right.

92
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,092
Wouldn't want to do anything dangerous.

93
00:06:57,173 --> 00:07:00,085
Turn the wrong person into a badger.

94
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:03,885
Quentin. I didn't realise you were here.

95
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:06,924
Evidently.

96
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:13,052
It's been a while. I see you've brought
some of our colleagues with you.

97
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:16,129
Would you care to introduce us?

98
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:18,773
First I thought we might catch up.

99
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:21,892
Well, certainly.

100
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:28,003
This is the shop, obviously. It's been a very
interesting transition into the world of retail.

101
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:31,130
It's going rather well.
I'll give you a grand tour if you like.

102
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:35,445
That's all right. I think
I can see what you've been up to.

103
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:39,367
Yes, well, I do limit my time here, obviously.

104
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:43,731
Buffy and I have been training a great deal
these days. There's a back room that we...

105
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:47,442
Yes. I thought you were keeping
that space for the really dangerous items

106
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,331
that should be kept out of the public's hands.

107
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:55,126
- Or maybe you don't worry about that.
- I'm very careful.

108
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:59,445
Most of this stuff couldn't harm anyone.
Incense, dime-store trinkets...

109
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:02,206
- But there are some things...
- I'm sorry, who are you?

110
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:07,003
There are some very potent elements here.
Focusing crystals, runic artefacts,

111
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:09,084
an amulet of Cauldis.

112
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:13,564
Also this statue. Its removal
from Burma is a criminal offence,

113
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:17,532
and when triggered,
it has the power to melt human eyeballs.

114
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,852
In that case I severely underpriced it.

115
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:25,245
Giles, sorry, but this is just
for the duration of our stay.

116
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,244
I think you can see why.

117
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,325
What? What is just for the duration?

118
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:33,962
Magic Box shoppers,
we're going to have to ask you to leave.

119
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:36,931
The store is closing early today.

120
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,766
Terribly sorry for the inconvenience.

121
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,686
Hey! Giles, what are they doing?

122
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,845
Customers, please bring your money back.

123
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:50,807
You knew you'd do this
before you even saw the place.

124
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:54,966
I'm sorry. It's just for the duration
of the Council's review.

125
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:57,647
Council? You're the Council?

126
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:01,569
Welcome to our store.
We're closed now. I'll be in the back.

127
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:05,812
What review? Let's just
stop and talk about this.

128
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:08,282
Miss? Excuse me, you work here?

129
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,123
Yes, I do.

130
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:15,923
Ever since I moved here from Indiana, where
I was raised by both a mother and a father.

131
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,085
Anya, just go. You don't have to talk to him.

132
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,403
She works for me.

133
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:24,963
Now, tell me about this review.
No one said anything to me about this.

134
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:28,045
Let's sit down and talk about it over here.

135
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,485
You all stand around and look sombre.

136
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,452
Good job.

137
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:47,242
You used to respect us, Giles.
You used to be one of us.

138
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:51,804
You used to pay me. If you recall,
firing me was not my idea.

139
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:53,485
Touché.

140
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:59,364
But you were on the inside once. You know
what sort of resources we command.

141
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:03,446
We've discovered information
about this creature, your Glory.

142
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:06,286
Some of it is clearly vital,

143
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:12,130
the rest merely extremely disturbing,
and it won't be handed over

144
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:16,729
until we're convinced that you and your
slayer are prepared for it. Thus the review.

145
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:20,010
I'm not having you put her through
another of your insane tests.

146
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:23,244
It's not a test. It's a check of her methods.

147
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:27,211
We need to know that this information is safe.

148
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,682
You can trust her.

149
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:35,249
Buffy's come very far recently.
She's acquired a remarkable focus.

150
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:40,727
Now, Rasputin was associated
with a certain obscure religious sect.

151
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:45,204
They held the tenet that in order
to be forgiven, one first had to sin.

152
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:50,686
Rasputin embraced this, and proceeded
to sin impressively and repeatedly.

153
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:54,209
The notion that he was in fact evil
gained strength years later,

154
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:59,492
when the conspirators who set out to kill him
found it nearly impossible to do so.

155
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:03,532
- "Nearly impossible"?
- I'm sorry, there was a question?

156
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:07,281
Miss Summers, of course.

157
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:16,370
I... about, you know, killing him...

158
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:22,926
You know, they poisoned him and they beat
him and they shot him, and he didn't die.

159
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:26,323
Until they rolled his body in a carpet
and drowned him in a canal.

160
00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:29,689
But there are reported sightings of him
as late as the 1930s.

161
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:34,210
There is near consensus in the academic
community regarding Rasputin's death.

162
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,682
There was near consensus about Columbus,

163
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:39,765
until someone asked the Vikings
what they were up to,

164
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:44,369
and they're, like, discovering
this America-shaped continent.

165
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:48,241
I just... I'm only saying,
you know, it might be interesting

166
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:53,327
if we came at it from, you know,
a different perspective, that's all.

167
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:57,531
Well, I'm sorry if you find these facts
so boring, Miss Summers.

168
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:01,492
Maybe you'd prefer I step aside,
so that you can teach your own course.

169
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:04,041
Speculation 101 perhaps?

170
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:07,571
Intro to Flights of Fancy?

171
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:10,486
- I only meant...
- What was it you were on about last week?

172
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:15,283
Mysterious sleeping patterns
of the Prussian generals?

173
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:17,762
Now, some of us are here to learn.

174
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:21,289
Believe it or not, we're interested
in what actually happened.

175
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,967
It's called studying history.

176
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,969
You can sit down now.

177
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:30,568
Unless you have
something else to add, Professor?

178
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,641
"Miss Summers"!
"Some of us are here to learn, Professor"!

179
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:49,292
- "Maybe you'd like to teach your own class"!
- Who are you talking to?

180
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:04,453
Spike, why did you do that?

181
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:09,004
Not for money, if that's what you're thinking.
Your heartfelt gratitude's plenty.

182
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:13,484
- Expect I'll be getting that any moment.
- Gratitude? For getting in my way?

183
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,962
Getting in your way? I saved you.

184
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:18,651
I was regrouping.

185
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:22,089
You'd have been regrouped
into separate piles. You needed help.

186
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:24,971
I didn't need you. I never need you, Spike.

187
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:30,685
I get it. You just don't like
who did the rescuing, that's all.

188
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:33,333
Wishing I was your boyfriend.
Wait, he's run off.

189
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,325
I don't need a boyfriend,
to rescue me or for anything.

190
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:39,530
Don't need or can't keep?
You make notches in the headboard,

191
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:43,492
but eventually they get up
out of the bed and run off, don't they?

192
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,565
- You're disgusting.
- Rough talk.

193
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,246
Maybe that's your problem.
Maybe you push 'em away.

194
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:55,282
Or is it the other? Maybe you cling too much.
Or maybe your beauty's fading.

195
00:13:55,373 --> 00:14:00,128
The stress of slaying ageing you prematurely.
Things not as high, not as firm.

196
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:04,764
You know what, Spike? The more I get
to know you, the more I wish I didn't.

197
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:08,243
Or maybe you just don't hold their interest.

198
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:22,092
Begging permission to speak with you, sir.

199
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:24,926
Don't touch me. You're crusty.
What do you want?

200
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:27,652
Not me. The magnificent Glory.

201
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:33,925
She wants more information on the Slayer.
She knows you know her.

202
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:37,892
The Slayer? I don't know any slayer.
Get away from me. You shouldn't be here.

203
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:41,443
I believe you do, sir.
She's short, symmetrical, hair on top?

204
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:44,684
- Buffy something.
- Buffy Summers is the Slayer?

205
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:47,446
That's the one! Very clever of you, sir.

206
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:52,482
- The Slayer. How does Glory know this?
- I do not know. I was not there.

207
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:57,966
But the beauteous Glory said for you
to tell us, please, where her dwelling is.

208
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,606
- Who her friends are.
- Why?

209
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:05,527
So Glory can find her, do something to her?
Why would I do that?

210
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:10,767
I don't know, sir. She just said
to tell you to do it. For her.

211
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,562
That was her message.

212
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,725
Well, I've got a message for Glory, too.

213
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:20,123
We've been developing
a sort of hybrid fighting style.

214
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:26,209
Let me outline her progress and I think you'll
see that your review isn't strictly needed.

215
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:30,289
Bad day. Bad, bad...

216
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:32,364
Miss Summers.

217
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,008
Good to see you again.

218
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:42,812
- Mr Travers.
- Giles is telling us of your training regimen.

219
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:46,408
Perhaps you'll favour us
with a demonstration while we're here.

220
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:49,530
- Right now?
- No need to rush you.

221
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:52,286
They're staying a little longer
than I'd anticipated.

222
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:56,491
We've already laid out our project
for Mr Giles. Nigel?

223
00:15:56,573 --> 00:16:00,009
An exhaustive examination
of your procedures and abilities.

224
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:03,449
- Observe your training, talk to your friends...
- My friends?

225
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:07,446
Yes, we understand you're still
taking civilians out on your patrols.

226
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:11,606
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Buffy, I can sense your resistance.

227
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:13,684
I don't blame you.

228
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:19,131
But your watcher hasn't reminded you lately
of the status of the players in our little game.

229
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:23,001
The Council fights evil. The Slayer
is the instrument by which we fight.

230
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:27,450
The Council remains, the slayers change.
It's been that way from the beginning.

231
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,650
That's a very comforting,
bloodless way of looking at it.

232
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:35,011
Giles, let me talk to Buffy,
because I think she's understanding me.

233
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:40,489
Glory is stronger than you.
She's a more powerful instrument, if you will.

234
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:45,366
We can help you.
We have information that will help.

235
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:48,923
Pass the review and we give it to you
without reservation.

236
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:54,087
Fail the review, either through incompetence,
or by resisting our recommendations...

237
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:56,050
Resisting your recommendations?

238
00:16:56,133 --> 00:17:00,843
She fails if we don't do as you say! How
much under your thumb do you think we are?

239
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:04,926
- How much do you want our help?
- She's not your bloody instrument!

240
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:06,526
Giles!

241
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:12,923
I understand you think this is unfair.

242
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:17,325
There are factors which should
motivate you to go along with the review.

243
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:22,806
I don't want to do this, but obviously
we could shut this place down permanently.

244
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:25,361
You can't. You don't have that kind of power.

245
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:27,523
Of course we do, and a great deal more.

246
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:32,812
If you insist on fighting us, we'll arrange
to have Mr Giles deported within the day.

247
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:35,805
Never set foot in this country again.

248
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:40,489
Now, perhaps you're used to idle threats
and sloppy discipline, Miss Summers.

249
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:43,133
But you're dealing with grown-ups now.

250
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:46,643
Am I making myself clear?

251
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:00,567
Jinx!

252
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,167
Hey, what's the deal with your face?

253
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:06,006
It's a message from Ben.

254
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,121
He isn't going to help.

255
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:12,408
Isn't going...?

256
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,322
- Isn't going to help?
- No.

257
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:20,567
All he has to do is turn over that squirming
slayer girl. I have business to do with her.

258
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:23,850
If she knows where I can
start looking for my Key...

259
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:33,810
Why won't he help? He knows her.

260
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:37,283
He could go to her, he could talk to her...

261
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:39,841
He could seduce her
and bang the Key out of her!

262
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:44,165
- He is quite attractive.
- Well, of course he's attractive!

263
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:47,051
But he drives me insane.

264
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,124
You know what I mean?

265
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,488
- He drives you insane?
- Yeah!

266
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:54,007
That's it exactly!

267
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:01,727
Sweet, lumpy minion.

268
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,885
You're the only one that understands.

269
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:10,325
Probably cos I haven't
sucked your brain out yet.

270
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:14,765
He makes me so mad!

271
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:19,492
If I could just get my hands on him!

272
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:23,764
You know? I'll just find her myself.

273
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:28,723
It's a power play, that's what it is.
It's about who has the power.

274
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:32,965
I'm guessing they do?
Big power outage in Buffy County?

275
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:36,764
I should have set you on them,
that's what I should have done.

276
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:40,323
Giles, that Travers guy is, like, 60.
I can't hit him.

277
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,652
- Can I?
- I suppose not.

278
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:48,644
Well, I could. I think I will.

279
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:55,729
Can they really do what they threatened?
Kick you out of the country?

280
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:58,373
In a heartbeat.

281
00:19:58,453 --> 00:20:02,685
The rough stuff, they're all right at.
They're ham-handed, but they get it done.

282
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:08,962
But this stuff, the bureaucracy, the pulling of
political strings, they're the best in the world.

283
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:13,251
They can kill you
with the stroke of a pen. Poncy sods.

284
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,452
Am I gonna be able
to get through this review?

285
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:24,043
Well, I suppose they'll make it
as difficult as they want to.

286
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:28,767
The physical stuff
could be a bit of a challenge.

287
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,572
That's not what I'm worried about.

288
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:33,848
It's the other stuff.

289
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:38,927
Examining decisions I've made. I mean, twice
I've been within slaying distance of Glory,

290
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:42,892
and twice she's kicked my ass
without even tensing a muscle.

291
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:46,522
And I haven't been able to figure out
what she is or anything about her,

292
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:50,811
except she wants the Key, which I have, and I
don't even know if it's OK to tell anyone that.

293
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:52,929
No one could have done better than you.

294
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:56,926
But no one else is gonna be asked
the questions that I can't answer.

295
00:20:57,013 --> 00:21:01,291
They're gonna expect me to be
like a slayer, and know stuff,

296
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:03,568
but I'm just me and I don't know anything.

297
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:07,931
They'll go away and not tell me how to fight
Glory and I won't be able to protect Dawn!

298
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,004
Buffy, calm down.

299
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:15,370
The scandal here is not anything you've
done wrong. It's the way they're behaving.

300
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:20,686
Holding what they know hostage with a gun
pointed at my bleeding green card, no less.

301
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,124
It's humiliating.

302
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:27,248
Also smart.

303
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,642
They picked the perfect thing.

304
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:32,372
I can't lose you.

305
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:34,444
Thank you.

306
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:38,973
I guess I should be getting ready.

307
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:42,489
What do you think it'll be like?
How do you think they'll start?

308
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:47,409
Anya Christina Emanuella Jenkins.
20 years old. Born on the fourth of July.

309
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:52,123
And don't think there weren'tjokes about
that. "Who's our little patriot?" they'd say,

310
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:55,762
when I was younger, and therefore
smaller and shorter than I am now.

311
00:21:55,853 --> 00:22:00,881
So, you spell it A-N-Y-A, then?

312
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:06,292
- Yes.
- Fine. Now we can get to the questions.

313
00:22:06,373 --> 00:22:09,809
- Questions, great.
- We can answer questions.

314
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:13,090
Well, I need to know
a little bit more about the Slayer,

315
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:17,883
and about the both of you,
your relationship, whatever you can tell me.

316
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:19,804
Our relationship?

317
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:22,202
- We're friends.
- Good friends.

318
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:27,204
- Girlfriends, actually.
- Yes, we're girlfriends.

319
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:30,729
We're in love. We're lovers.

320
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:33,930
We're lesbian, gay-type lovers.

321
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:37,210
I meant your relationship with the Slayer.

322
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:41,404
Just good friends.

323
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:46,449
Best friends. Willow and me and Buffy. The
three of us were together from the beginning.

324
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:50,367
We've always gone on patrols, and done
demon research with her and everything.

325
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,684
Have you mastered
any fighting disciplines over the years?

326
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:54,603
No.

327
00:22:54,693 --> 00:23:01,690
So, you have no special skills or powers
or knowledge that you bring to the mix.

328
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:05,049
- Neither of you.
- Just enthusiasm for killing the demons.

329
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,328
Go deadness for the demons.

330
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:11,167
- I don't have any powers, but I do help.
- How? Be specific.

331
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:14,643
Last year, Willow, Giles and me
combined our essence with Buffy.

332
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:16,849
Which isn't as weird as it sounds.

333
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:21,290
We merged, and I was
the heart part of a super-Buffy.

334
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:25,969
- Again, let me stress the not-as-weird thing.
- I'm told it was all very professional.

335
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:30,171
Are you saying that the Slayer
needs that level of help from you often?

336
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:33,484
- No, no, she doesn't need help.
- She'd be fine without us.

337
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:36,133
She goes off and does stuff
without even telling us.

338
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:39,330
Not that she's, like, a weird Ioner or anything.

339
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:42,530
- I'm not sure we're saying this right.
- See, here's the thing.

340
00:23:42,613 --> 00:23:47,562
We can help because we do magics.
I'm working on this ball-of-sunshine thing.

341
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:49,609
- I have this theory.
- It's very cool.

342
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:53,971
And if it works, easier slaying for Buffy.
Not that it's hard for her now.

343
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:56,726
Interesting. What level are you at?

344
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:59,043
"Level"?

345
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,522
Magical proficiency level?

346
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:04,445
A high level.

347
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:08,367
Very high. One of those top levels.

348
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:10,648
Five!

349
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:17,693
And you're registered as practising witches
under the names as you gave them to me?

350
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:19,331
"Registered"?

351
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:22,325
- Yes! Yes, of course, we're...
- Registered.

352
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:24,973
Do either of you
know anything about the Key?

353
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:29,683
Nope. Sounds demony to me.
I don't hold with that demon nonsense.

354
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:32,571
Muffin? I cooked them myself.

355
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:39,643
So, Buffy sometimes protects you
from the dangerous elements of her work.

356
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:43,851
Yes. She's saved my life lots of times.
The vampires in this town hate her.

357
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:46,733
But we understand that you help the Slayer.

358
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:49,850
- I pitch in when she pays me.
- She pays you?

359
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:51,764
She gives you money?

360
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:54,811
Money, a nip of blood
out of some stray victim, whatever.

361
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,090
- Blood?
- Well, if they're gonna die anyway.

362
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:04,368
Come to think of it, that's a bit scandalous,
isn't it? I'm shocked. The girl's slipping.

363
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:07,092
- You've noticed a decline in her work?
- Yeah.

364
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:11,132
See, the poor little twig can't keep a man.
Gets her all down.

365
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:15,641
Few more disappointments, she'll be
crying on my shoulder, mark my words.

366
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,928
Is that what you want?

367
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:22,006
I'd think you'd want to kill her.
You've killed slayers before.

368
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:26,046
Heard of me, have you?

369
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:29,883
I wrote my thesis on you.

370
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,207
Well, well. Ain't that neat?

371
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:38,645
Tell me, pet, now we're such good friends,
how's the Slayer doing?

372
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:43,128
She OK? High marks in all categories?

373
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,886
Agility, clarity, stamina and strength.

374
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:50,046
These are the qualities that the Slayer
must possess to do herjob.

375
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:53,603
- What came after agility?
- If you want her to attack the dummy...

376
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:58,448
Phillip will attack the dummy.
The Slayer's job is to protect it.

377
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:01,286
- Do you understand?
- Protect the dummy?

378
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:04,206
As if it were precious.

379
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:07,444
Now, getting the best of Phillip
will require agility.

380
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:12,607
Listening to my instructions at the same
time, that will demonstrate clarity.

381
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:15,253
And stamina and strength
will win the long fight.

382
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,893
- Good luck.
- "Instructions"?

383
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:21,283
I'll be telling you what to do,
how to counter Phillip's thrusts.

384
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:26,322
We assume you're familiar with the Japanese
names for aikido and jiujitsu moves.

385
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:27,812
- Japanese?
- And... go!

386
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:33,411
Hold on a second. In America,
we usually work our way up to "go".

387
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:38,602
He wants you to bow. Take a bow.

388
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:59,049
- Punch him.
- Thanks, Giles.

389
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:01,169
Sorry.

390
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:05,849
Back kick, elbow...

391
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:08,493
Elbow... strike.

392
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:11,133
- How've you been training her?
- I trained her to win.

393
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,489
Know what? I'm gonna
have to do it my way, guys.

394
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:36,607
- I think she just broke my rib.
- Yes, well...

395
00:27:36,693 --> 00:27:40,163
I didn't mean to. You know, I can do better.

396
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:45,373
I think I might be getting this, like, inner-ear
thing. Maybe if I got a note, I could try again?

397
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:49,969
No, that's all right. I don't think we need
to see any more physical tests for a while.

398
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:52,487
We can move on to the real review.

399
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:56,009
Look into your strategies. Plans.

400
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,812
Figure out what's going on in that head.

401
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:01,683
Good. Head stuff.

402
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:05,163
We start at seven tonight. Give you time to...

403
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:09,690
Well, however you prepare.

404
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,924
Mom?

405
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:38,723
Long day, sweetie?

406
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:51,643
So... this is where
the Slayer eats, sleeps and...

407
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,530
combs her hair?

408
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:57,727
So cute.

409
00:28:57,813 --> 00:29:00,407
I can't even stand it.

410
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:05,442
Personally, I need more space,
but this is good for you.

411
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:08,366
It's so quaint, and...

412
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:14,801
Buffy, if I wanted to fight,
you could tell by the being dead already.

413
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:22,489
- So play nice, little girl.
- What do you want?

414
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:25,804
The Key. Why else
do you think I'd come here?

415
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:28,691
See, I think you know where it is.

416
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:32,127
- And that's a good thing.
- I'm glad you think so.

417
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:34,852
It's the only thing
keeping you alive right now.

418
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:40,610
You may be tiny queen in vampire world,
but to me, you're a bug.

419
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:43,526
You should get down
on your knees and worship me!

420
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:49,085
But no. You still think it's neat
having slayer strength. Big deal!

421
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:52,688
Stronger than humans! Who isn't?

422
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:58,006
I could crush the life from you as easy
as you'd break a nail. But I need the Key.

423
00:29:58,093 --> 00:29:59,685
Kid!

424
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:03,089
- Come here a sec.
- Leave her out of this.

425
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:06,210
- Not asking twice.
- This is between you and me.

426
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:08,761
No. This is between me and my Key.

427
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:12,211
You just happen to be the thing in the way.

428
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:20,172
And you are just the darlingest thing
I ever did see in my life.

429
00:30:21,893 --> 00:30:24,282
- What's your name, honey?
- Dawn.

430
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:28,844
Dawn? Did you know your sister took
my Key, Dawnie? And she won't give it back.

431
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:33,882
- I bet you know where she put it, don't you?
- She doesn't know anything.

432
00:30:34,573 --> 00:30:35,767
I know some stuff.

433
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:40,529
I bet she takes your stuff all the time without
asking, doesn't she? Where's my Key, Dawn?

434
00:30:40,613 --> 00:30:43,127
Go upstairs, Dawn.

435
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,922
You're always talking about
stuff I'm not supposed to hear.

436
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,891
I'm gonna figure it out, you know.

437
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:53,123
I like her. She's sassy!

438
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:57,851
And I'll kill her.

439
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:01,164
I'll kill your mom, I'll kill your friends...

440
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:05,565
and I'll make you watch when I do.

441
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:11,244
Just give me the Key. You either have it
or you know where to find it.

442
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:17,367
Obviously, this is a one-time-only deal.

443
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:21,731
Next time we meet,
something you love dies bloody.

444
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:25,203
You know you can't take me.
You know you can't stop me.

445
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:38,367
Buffy, who was that?

446
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:40,972
Pack a bag.

447
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:48,762
It's the Slayer.
For a second there I was worried.

448
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:57,207
So, what's with the family outing?

449
00:31:57,693 --> 00:32:00,571
- I need your help.
- Great. I need your cash.

450
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,644
I'm serious.

451
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:06,047
You have to look after them.

452
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:10,763
That's a boatload of manly responsibility
to come out of nowhere. What's the matter?

453
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:13,367
- You're not feeling 100 per cent?
- No.

454
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:15,489
- They didn't put a chip in your head?
- No!

455
00:32:15,573 --> 00:32:18,610
- Be funny if they did.
- Spike, I need an answer. Now.

456
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:20,684
In or out?

457
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:26,161
You're the only one
strong enough to protect them.

458
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:31,323
All right, then.

459
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:33,802
Ladies, come on in.

460
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:37,047
There's plenty of blood in the fridge.

461
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:40,045
Do you mean, like, real blood?

462
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:44,172
- What do you think?
- Mostly I think "Ew".

463
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,643
Keep Dawn here as long as you can.
I'll be back soon.

464
00:32:50,813 --> 00:32:53,008
- I don't need to remind you...
- Yeah, yeah.

465
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:57,211
"Anything happens to 'em, I stake you good
and proper." Sing me a new one sometime.

466
00:32:57,293 --> 00:32:59,443
That bit's gone stale.

467
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:15,647
I love what you've neglected
to do with the place.

468
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,842
Just don't break anything.

469
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:25,086
And don't make a lot of noise.
Passions is coming on.

470
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:28,688
Passions?
Do you think Timmy's really dead?

471
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,732
No, no, she can just sew him back together.
He's a doll, for God's sake.

472
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:37,728
What about the wedding? I mean, there's
no way they're gonna go through with that.

473
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:44,732
Look at them. Big tough
Council members picking on the books.

474
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:48,203
- Fascists.
- Why doesn't Mr Giles put them out of here?

475
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:51,444
If they deport him,
they're notjust destroying his career,

476
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:57,290
they're condemning the man to a lifetime diet
of blood sausage, bangers and mash.

477
00:33:58,613 --> 00:34:02,731
Well, your slayer's 20 minutes late
and counting, Rupert.

478
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:04,929
Buffy will be here, I assure you.

479
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:07,527
Yes, but when?

480
00:34:09,653 --> 00:34:11,644
Crap!

481
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:33,243
Guys? Any way we could not do this?

482
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:33,050
OK. Let's see what you are.

483
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:40,009
- Or who you are.
- One soldier in a vast army.

484
00:35:40,093 --> 00:35:42,448
What army?

485
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:46,526
The Knights of Byzantium, an ancient order.
And now your enemy.

486
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:52,131
- You work for Glory?
- You think we ally ourselves with the Beast?

487
00:35:52,213 --> 00:35:55,410
- You must be mad.
- You're the ones who tried killing me.

488
00:35:55,493 --> 00:36:00,328
We were fools, three alone. But if it takes
a hundred men, we send a hundred men.

489
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:05,328
- If it takes a thousand, we send a thousand.
- A thousand?

490
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,849
So long as you protect the Key,
the brotherhood will never stop

491
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,925
until we destroy it and you.

492
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:16,843
You are the Slayer,
and we know what we must do.

493
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:19,891
Now, be done with it.

494
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:22,965
Kill us, and let legions follow.

495
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:46,404
Go.

496
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:12,601
- You're late.
- Yeah.

497
00:37:14,653 --> 00:37:17,804
- Was there an attack?
- Yeah.

498
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:20,361
We can begin the review at last.

499
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:23,650
We'll skip the more obvious questions.

500
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:29,732
- There isn't gonna be a review.
- Sorry?

501
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:35,683
No review. No interrogation.
No questions you know I can't answer.

502
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:38,970
No hoops, no jumps. And no interruptions.

503
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:48,204
See, I've had a lot of people
talking at me in the last few days.

504
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:52,571
Everyone just lining up
to tell me how unimportant I am.

505
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:56,687
And I finally figured out why.

506
00:37:58,013 --> 00:37:59,765
Power.

507
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:01,889
I have it.

508
00:38:01,973 --> 00:38:03,964
They don't.

509
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:07,287
This bothers them.

510
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:11,733
Glory came to my home today.

511
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:14,930
- Buffy, are you...?
- Just to talk.

512
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:19,564
She told me I'm a bug, I'm a flea,
she could squash me in a second.

513
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:23,044
Only she didn't.

514
00:38:23,973 --> 00:38:26,533
She came into my home, and we talked.

515
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:32,772
We had what in her warped brain probably
passes for a civilised conversation. Why?

516
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:36,851
Because she needs something from me.

517
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:39,401
Because I have power over her.

518
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:49,562
You didn't come all this way to determine
whether I was good enough to be let back in.

519
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:54,044
You came to beg me to let you back in.

520
00:38:56,733 --> 00:39:00,806
To give yourjobs, your lives,
some semblance of meaning.

521
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:03,930
This is beyond insolence...

522
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:11,004
I'm fairly certain I said "no interruptions".

523
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:14,081
That was excellent.

524
00:39:14,173 --> 00:39:16,607
You're watchers.

525
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:21,050
Without a slayer, you're pretty much
just watching Masterpiece Theatre.

526
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:26,726
You can't stop Glory. You can't
do anything with the information you have,

527
00:39:26,813 --> 00:39:31,933
except maybe publish it in the Everyone
Thinks We're Insanos Home Journal.

528
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,203
So here's how it's gonna work.

529
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:41,127
You're gonna tell me everything you know.
Then you're gonna go away.

530
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:45,252
You'll contact me if and when you have
any further information about Glory.

531
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:51,010
The shop will remain open. Mr Giles will stay
here as my watcher, reinstated at full salary.

532
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:53,129
Retroactive.

533
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:56,330
To be paid retroactively
from the month he was fired.

534
00:39:57,893 --> 00:40:00,453
I will continue my work
with the help of my friends.

535
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:04,731
I don't want a sword
thrown at me, but civilians?

536
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:07,930
We're talking about children.

537
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:12,404
We're talking about two very powerful
witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon.

538
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,768
Willow's a demon?

539
00:40:14,853 --> 00:40:18,004
The boy? No power there.

540
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:23,369
"The boy" has clocked more field time than
all of you combined. He's part of the unit.

541
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:26,843
- That's Riley-speak.
- I've clocked field time.

542
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:29,401
Now...

543
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,690
you all may be very good at yourjobs.

544
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:36,402
The only way we're gonna find out
is if you work with me.

545
00:40:36,493 --> 00:40:40,168
You can all take your time
thinking about that.

546
00:40:40,253 --> 00:40:43,404
But I want an answer right now from Quentin,

547
00:40:43,493 --> 00:40:46,405
cos I think he's understanding me.

548
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:55,809
Your terms are acceptable.

549
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,608
See? No begging.

550
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:13,847
- Rupert?
- Quentin?

551
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:19,291
When we inventoried your shop,
we found a bottle of single-malt scotch

552
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:21,887
behind the incense holders...

553
00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:26,444
- It's not, you know, during working hours...
- I think I could use a glass.

554
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:31,162
- Well, I suppose we could...
- Just a minute.

555
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:33,767
Glory. I wanna know.

556
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:37,244
Well, there's a lot to go through.

557
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:40,450
Just tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.

558
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:44,446
Well, that's the thing, you see.
Glory isn't a demon.

559
00:41:45,413 --> 00:41:47,244
What is she?

560
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:49,531
She's a god.

561
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,891
