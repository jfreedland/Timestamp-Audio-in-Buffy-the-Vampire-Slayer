00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,169
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:08,405
- So it's her. Under our noses all this time.
- Glorificus will find the witch.

3
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:09,812
- Witch?
- Tara.

4
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:11,724
- You're not the Key, you're nothing.
- No.

5
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:14,722
Tara.

6
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:18,169
- I'm so sorry.
- They kill mice.

7
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:20,608
- Not if I get the Key first.
- Could you do it?

8
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:22,968
Take a human life with your own hands?

9
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:25,811
I told you this wasn't over.

10
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,645
Such pure green energy.

11
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:28,961
The Key.

12
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:31,886
Just pack the supplies we need
and that's it - we're gone.

13
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:33,682
- Giles.
- I see them.

14
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,922
- Buffy.
- How is he? Will?

15
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:43,129
He's stabilised, but there's
a lot of damage. We need to get him out.

16
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:45,167
We got company.

17
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:46,926
The Key.

18
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:53,531
Once the Key is activated, the walls
separating realities will crumble.

19
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:55,888
Dimensions will bleed into each other.

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,487
I won't let anything happen to you.

21
00:00:58,573 --> 00:00:59,926
- Let me out.
- Will, open a door.

22
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:01,605
No.

23
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,607
- Buffy.
- Dawn.

24
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:07,691
Buffy, you have to get up. Buffy, please.

25
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:09,962
Buffy.

26
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:18,605
Quickly. Already we're behind schedule.

27
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:21,765
Someone's bound for a beheading.
Let's make sure it's not me.

28
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:26,324
Why do we remain when our moment
of triumph lies so close-at-hand?

29
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:31,203
The Glorious One, having acquired much
in this world, doesn't exactly travel lightly.

30
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:34,931
Minions, I can hear you.

31
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:38,562
Godlike ears don't miss much,
you know what I'm sayin'? Come here.

32
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:42,202
- He blasphemed, Magnificence.
- Spurred by treacherous urging.

33
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:45,126
Guys. I'm not gonna kill you.

34
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:50,402
Not in the mood.
What do you think that's about?

35
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:54,170
- In mercy does your power lie?
- No, brainless.

36
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:57,245
In torture, death
and chaos does my power lie.

37
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:03,006
So tell me, why am I not popping
your head like a zit right now?

38
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:07,010
- Maybe I'm just hungry.
- Yes, we shall fetch a lovely...

39
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,129
No, I'm not hungry.

40
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,006
I'm just a little tight in this skin, is all.

41
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:16,768
I've been waiting an eternity...
well, 25 human years.

42
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,969
And it all comes down to tonight.

43
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:22,523
- The portal shall open...
- And the great Glorificus shall return...

44
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:25,366
..to the Hell I came from,
where I'm gonna rain down

45
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:28,365
more supersized portions of slaughter,
mayhem and bloodshed

46
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:31,650
than any of you scabs can even dream about.

47
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:37,526
So, how come I ain't happy?

48
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:39,803
Got everything I ever wanted.

49
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,650
Still, something's off.

50
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:47,803
I don't know. What do you think?

51
00:02:55,653 --> 00:03:00,204
Better part of a century spent in delinquency
just paid off. Hot-wired Ben's auto.

52
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:03,410
- Who's for gettin' the hell out?
- All in favour. Let's do it.

53
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:06,053
- You good to go?
- Don't worry about me.

54
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,124
- How's Buffy?
- The same.

55
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:12,209
- Still.
- It's been almost a half an hour.

56
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,490
Slayer's gonna be all right, won't she?

57
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:19,001
You should try again, Will.

58
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:24,531
All right, but I'm not even sure she's,
you know, really in there.

59
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,524
Try.

60
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:36,488
Can you hear me? Buffy.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,074

62
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:39,204
Buffy.

63
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,722
She can'tjust be braindead.

64
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:48,131
I mean, she's still Buffy,
somewhere in there, right?

65
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:51,566
Spike, we won't get
Dawn back by sittin' here.

66
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:55,123
You won't any way you slice it.
That's for Buffy to decide.

67
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:57,283
Good, panic. That oughta help.

68
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:02,170
We should move her.
Unless we shouldn't. Should we?

69
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:06,283
Couldn't that make it worse?
I think I've read that somewhere.

70
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:08,804
I am so large with not knowing.

71
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,726
It's impossible to know for sure.

72
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,646
Losing Dawn, after all
that Buffy's been through...

73
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,122
It's pushed her too far,
into a sort of catatonia.

74
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:20,371
You don't need a diploma
to see that. Snap her out of it.

75
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,167
Buffy.

76
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:26,208
- Rise and shine, love.
- Spike.

77
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:30,809
Come on, people. Girl's endowed with slayer
strength. Hardly time to get dainty. Buffy.

78
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,451
We tried that.

79
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:35,732
We didn't try that.

80
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:38,806
Are you insane?
This could be neurological damage.

81
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:42,170
- You wanna kill her?
- We have to do something.

82
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:45,245
I can'tjust sit watching.
You waste time with kid gloves.

83
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,643
I'll wager, when all's said and done,
Buffy likes it rough.

84
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:51,602
Separate.

85
00:05:56,653 --> 00:06:02,410
Buffy's out. Glory has Dawn.
Some time real soon, she's gonna use Dawn

86
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:05,565
to tear down the barrier
between every dimension there is.

87
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:09,726
So, if you two wanna fight,
you do it after the world ends, OK?

88
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,048
All right. First we head back to Sunnydale.

89
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:18,649
Xander'll take Giles to a hospital.
Anya's looking after Tara.

90
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:23,887
And Spike, you find Glory.
Check her apartment, see if she's still there.

91
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:28,728
Try anything stupid, like payback,
and I will get very cranky.

92
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:33,644
Everyone clear?

93
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:36,810
Anya.

94
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:38,965
What will you do?

95
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:42,963
- I'll help Buffy.
- OK, then.

96
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,613
The world is spinning.

97
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:49,572
Straight to a new day. Big day.

98
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:54,811
Will?

99
00:06:55,093 --> 00:07:00,611
Now don't turn me into a horned toad for
asking, but what if we come across Ben?

100
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:05,290
I don't think a doctor's
what Buffy needs right now.

101
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:08,490
Well, yeah, especially not one
who also happens to be Glory.

102
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:11,804
- What do you mean?
- You know. Ben is Glory.

103
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:14,327
You mean, Ben's with Glory?

104
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,329
- "With" in what sense?
- They're working together?

105
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:22,891
No. Ben is Glory. Glory's Ben.
They're one and the same.

106
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:29,005
- Well, when did all this happen?
- Not one hour ago.

107
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:31,129
Right here, before your very eyes.

108
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:36,489
Ben came, turned into Glory, snatched
the kid and vanished, remember?

109
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,725
You do remember?

110
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,690
Is everyone here very stoned?

111
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:49,252
Ben. Glory. He's a doctor, she's the Beast.

112
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,131
Two entirely separate entities
sharing one body.

113
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:54,932
It's like a bloody sitcom.
Surely you remember.

114
00:07:55,013 --> 00:08:00,246
- So you're saying Ben and Glory...
- Have a connection.

115
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,369
Yes, obviously, but what kind?

116
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:09,169
I get it. That's very crafty.
Glory's worked the kind of mojo

117
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:12,768
where anyone who sees her little
presto-change-o instantly forgets.

118
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:17,210
And yours truly, being somewhat
other than human, stands immune.

119
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:21,730
So, Ben and Glory are the same person?

120
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:28,492
Glory can turn into Ben,
and Ben turns back into Glory.

121
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:31,690
And anyone who sees it instantly forgets.

122
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:35,247
And a kewpie doll for the lady.

123
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,809
Excellent.

124
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:44,082
Now. Do we suspect that there may be some
kind of connection between Ben and Glory?

125
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:59,808
The Key.

126
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:23,087
Unbelievable how annoying
the groupies can be.

127
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:26,722
They merely sense that tonight
the dimensional portal shall open...

128
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:29,452
Ushering in the long
and bloody reign of the great...

129
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,728
What's he doing?

130
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:34,490
I must anoint the Key.

131
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:37,124
Really, don't. Go.

132
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:39,443
- But...
- Get out.

133
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:48,885
You know, you recapture your
godhood and unleash Armageddon,

134
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:53,125
all of a sudden everybody wants
to be a part of the inner circle.

135
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,124
You OK?

136
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,330
I wanna go home.

137
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:05,164
Sweetie...

138
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,924
You're about to.

139
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:16,768
Not that fake suburban nightmare
the monks cooked up. Your real home.

140
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,611
As the Key.

141
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:22,208
You fit in a lock. Well, it's like a lock.

142
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:26,163
You want a pizza?

143
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:27,732
No.

144
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:32,532
Pillow? I don't know if
this thing gets cable. Doubtful.

145
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:35,366
Please. Stop.

146
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,244
- You nervous?
- Yes.

147
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:43,608
I know how you feel.

148
00:10:44,173 --> 00:10:46,767
It is your last night.

149
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,287
As, you know, a human.

150
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:53,366
This body? It's just a rental, Dawnie.

151
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:56,805
Being human? It's like a costume
for girls like you and me.

152
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:00,931
Being something else, that's what we are.

153
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:02,682
Don't.

154
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:07,683
- What?
- Don't call me Dawnie.

155
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,367
Wow.

156
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,762
You know, that actually hurt my feelings.

157
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:21,732
- I'm sorry.
- Not the point.

158
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:27,126
I'm just thinking,
I'm trying to make you feel better,

159
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:30,728
when comforting others... not part of my life.

160
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:35,091
And I'm doing it so I can stop feeling so...

161
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,921
- Help me out.
- Guilty?

162
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:45,041
Guilty. That's it.

163
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,687
But I'm not supposed to feel guilty.

164
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:55,408
I'm not supposed to feel anything. I'm a god.

165
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,801
I'm above it. I'm...

166
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,846
You.

167
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,043
You did this to me, didn't you?

168
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:10,126
Some sort of spell. You've been
hanging with the Wicca, you could've...

169
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:14,001
But no. Not magic. It's something else.

170
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,491
Still, it is you doing this.

171
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:21,846
I'm not doing anything. I swear.

172
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,924
We'll see.

173
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,563
Anoint this thing now.

174
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:31,490
You know what they're all chanting
for out there, Dawnie? Blood.

175
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,690
Cos we found out your blood
is the key to the Key.

176
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:40,044
All I gotta do is bleed you dry,
the portal opens up, and I can go home.

177
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:45,251
So knock yourself out, girlfriend.
Make me feel bad as you can.

178
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:52,003
Cos tomorrow you bleed, little girl.

179
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,730
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- I think so.

180
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:00,963
I don't know.

181
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:05,763
It's not exactly
well-explored territory, but I gotta try.

182
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:11,046
A spell like this could be really
dangerous for Buffy. And you.

183
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:13,693
Time. Time is coming.

184
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,528
It's OK. I'm here.

185
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,972
- You'll look after her while I'm...
- Sure. What do I do?

186
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:29,889
Mostly just be here for her.

187
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:36,612
There's some pills in my knapsack. Half of
one every two hours keeps her pretty mellow.

188
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:39,969
You think you'll be gone
more than two hours?

189
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,442
- Wish me luck?
- OK.

190
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,724
Good luck.

191
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,365
Thanks.

192
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:53,613
OK. Be good now, sweetie.

193
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,330
I'll be back as soon as I can, OK?

194
00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:00,484
We're good?

195
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,564
Good luck.

196
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:17,884
Hi, Willow.

197
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,924
Hello, Buffy.

198
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:46,281
What are you doing here?

199
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,645
Actually, I'm looking for you.

200
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:53,524
Do you like dolls?

201
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:58,209
- Buffy, what are you doing here?
- I like it here.

202
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:04,286
But you know we need you.
You have to come out.

203
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:08,165
- Why?
- To be with your friends.

204
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:10,365
It's a big day for me.

205
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,448
- Hello.
- Mommy, Daddy.

206
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,493
- You're back.
- Hello, Buffy.

207
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:20,041
How's my girl?

208
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,806
Are you ready to meet your new baby sister?

209
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:26,571
Come on now, Buffy.
She's nothing to be afraid of.

210
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:29,451
- Who's afraid?
- Don't you want to be the big sister?

211
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:33,204
- No. I want to be the baby.
- Buffy.

212
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:37,407
You're gonna pay more attention
to her and forget all about me.

213
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:45,602
Doesn't she look funny?
Like a wrinkly old grandpa.

214
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:50,250
Like this. OK, support the head.

215
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,212
There you go. We're calling her Dawn.

216
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:55,926
Dawn.

217
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:02,813
I could be the one to look after her
sometimes, if you need a helper.

218
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,122
Mom, can I take care of her?

219
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,846
Yes, Buffy, you can take care of her.

220
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:25,765
OK.

221
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:33,492
Can you...

222
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:37,250
There. How you doin'?

223
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:41,372
It only hurts while I answer
pointless questions. Where's Buffy?

224
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,129
Willow's on it. Or in it. She's workin' some
spell, trying to reach Buffy psychically.

225
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:48,283
She's gone into Buffy's mind?

226
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:52,002
- Pretty trippy stuff.
- It's extraordinarily advanced.

227
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:55,722
I was thinking we should check
on Glory's victims while we're here.

228
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:59,089
The mental ward? I already been.
The vegetable section's closed.

229
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:01,971
It's like they all just got up and walked away.

230
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:05,841
I checked out Glory's flat.
Looks like the great one has scampered.

231
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:10,485
Gone to perform her ritual with
Dawn and leaving us entirely clueless.

232
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:13,402
Not entirely.

233
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,883
I know this bloke. Well,
not so much a bloke so much as demon.

234
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:24,001
But still, bookish. All tuned in to
the nastier corners of this, our magic world.

235
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:27,688
It's a bit of a last resort really, but still,

236
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:31,163
we might persuade him
to suss out Glory's game plan.

237
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:36,243
Sound worthy?

238
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:40,366
Off we go, then. Meet back at the shop?

239
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:45,164
I found Ben's room at Glory's.
Didn't learn much.

240
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:51,601
Wait. Ben? At Glory's? You're saying
all this time he's been subletting from her?

241
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:53,923
This is gonna be worth it.

242
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:59,603
Last time. From the top.

243
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:06,689
- I'm hating this, Murk.
- This would be what exactly, Your Holiness?

244
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,527
Memories. I'm starting to
remember the things Ben did.

245
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:12,922
People he spoke with, stuff he wore...

246
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,605
Kid.

247
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:20,009
I came... He came to see you, didn't he?

248
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:23,403
- Ben?
- Yeah, Ben.

249
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:30,486
You called him to the desert
when you were hiding from me. And he came.

250
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:34,486
- And then he was me, you remember?
- Yes.

251
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:38,690
See? She's not supposed to
remember that. Nobody should.

252
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:41,162
The cloak between Ben and me is fading.

253
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:44,882
I almost helped her. He... I wanted to.

254
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:48,689
I can't do this.

255
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,762
- Get him out of me.
- What?

256
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:57,481
Ben. The human meat sack
who's infecting me.

257
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:03,167
Do your mojo, make an incision,
or removal, or whatever you gotta do.

258
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:10,250
Help me. I'm thinking Ben's thoughts,
and I'm feeling his feelings.

259
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,291
And I...

260
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,364
Can't kill the girl.

261
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:19,004
Damn it.

262
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,891
- Help me.
- This I cannot do.

263
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:29,725
You risk terrible magics
in opening the portal.

264
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:33,442
Nothing comes without a price.
This is yours.

265
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:37,844
Gods don't pay.

266
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:43,569
We do this now.

267
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:53,401
I know you. You're the first original Slayer
who tried killing us all in our dreams.

268
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:58,325
- How've you been?
- Death is your gift.

269
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:02,571
- Death is my gift?
- Wait. Death is her what?

270
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:04,530
Death is your gift.

271
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,364
Where are you going?

272
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,564
Glorificus, wait.
Kill the Key now and all will be lost.

273
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:28,645
We'll be stuck on this
mortal plane for ever.

274
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:32,653
All right, you're right. It's cool.

275
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:38,323
I'm just a little emotional right now
which, if you're into irony, funny.

276
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:42,046
Leave. We need a little girl time.

277
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:43,725
Goodbye.

278
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,083
How do they do it?

279
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:53,522
- Do what?
- People.

280
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:57,492
How do they function in the world
with all this bile running through them?

281
00:22:57,573 --> 00:23:01,248
Every day it's "Whoo-hoo!" You have
no control. They're not even animals.

282
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:06,805
They're just meatbaggy slaves to hormones
and pheromones and their feelings.

283
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:09,612
Hate 'em. I mean, really.

284
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:12,287
Is this what the poets go on about? This?

285
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:17,892
Call me crazy, but as hard-core drugs go,
human emotion is just useless.

286
00:23:17,973 --> 00:23:22,251
People are puppets. Everyone getting
jerked around by what they're feeling.

287
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,928
Am I wrong? Really, I wanna know.

288
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,482
Gonna bleed you either way.

289
00:23:32,773 --> 00:23:36,322
- Depends on the person.
- So you're saying some people like this.

290
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,849
- Some.
- Funny.

291
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,925
Cos I look at this world
you're so eager to be a part of,

292
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:47,133
and all I see is six billion lunatics
looking for the fastest ride out.

293
00:23:47,213 --> 00:23:50,444
Who's not crazy? Look around.

294
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:54,970
Everyone's drinking, smoking,
shooting up, shooting each other,

295
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:59,524
orjust plain screwing their brains out
cos they don't want 'em any more.

296
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:06,330
I'm crazy? Honey, I'm the original one-eyed
chicklet in the kingdom of the blind.

297
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:11,084
Cos at least I admit the world makes me nuts.

298
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:15,963
Name one person who can take it here.
That's all I'm asking. Name one.

299
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,965
Buffy.

300
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:29,451
I can't keep following you around
like this, Buffy. We have to go.

301
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,601
You have to talk to me.

302
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,444
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:44,213 --> 00:24:46,329
Don't be.

304
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:48,973
Death is my gift.

305
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:53,843
Yeah. I keep hearing that, but
I'm not exactly sure what it means.

306
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:56,322
It's really not that complicated.

307
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,404
Not for you, maybe.

308
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:06,249
It's what I do. I mean, come on.
You've known me for how long?

309
00:25:06,813 --> 00:25:09,964
It's what I'm here for. It's all I am.

310
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,973
Buffy, stop. No.

311
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,088
God, no.

312
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:27,646
What? I keep telling you, Will.
I figured it out. Death is my gift.

313
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:38,253
Ben, this is really not a good time.

314
00:25:39,253 --> 00:25:41,244
Dawn. Has Glory hurt you?

315
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:44,807
No. Not yet.

316
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:49,083
But I have to get out of here.

317
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,645
Ben?

318
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,769
Are you OK?

319
00:25:57,573 --> 00:25:59,609
Where is it?

320
00:26:01,613 --> 00:26:04,332
- Where's what?
- All the blood.

321
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:09,128
I can feel it, still warm and wet.

322
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:13,002
Glory. Oh, God.

323
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:18,611
She slaughtered hundreds of men.
But I can feel them breaking.

324
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:23,366
Ben, something is happening
to both you and Glory.

325
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:29,005
I'm rememberin' her, aren't I? The things
she's done. Things she's going to do.

326
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,688
I know. She told me.

327
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:37,166
I think, whatever the magic is that keeps
you guys apart is starting to break down.

328
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,528
Ben, Glory could come back any minute.

329
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:43,489
- How could she do this?
- I don't know.

330
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:48,806
- We have to get out of here and find Buffy...
- No! I mean, I have ajob. I have a life!

331
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:52,203
And Glory? She never once
thinks about me in all this.

332
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:58,488
- Help me.
- How?

333
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:00,765
Highness.

334
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,487
- Please.
- Is everything all right?

335
00:27:06,813 --> 00:27:08,883
You're not...

336
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:17,331
I'll take you as far as I can,
ditch you before she's back.

337
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,722
OK, now, this is weird.

338
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:23,008
Hi, Willow. What are you doing here?

339
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:27,644
Actually, I'm looking for you. Here. Again.

340
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:35,204
- Do you like dolls?
- No.

341
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:37,932
And I think we already déjà'd this vu.

342
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,927
- You talk funny.
- Yes.

343
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:45,642
As you'll tell me again
when we're older and in chem class.

344
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:50,284
- Buffy, what are we doing here?
- Don't you like it here?

345
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:52,970
We don't have time.

346
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,003
- Mommy, Daddy.
- We're home.

347
00:27:56,733 --> 00:28:00,169
- You're back.
- Hi, Buffy.

348
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:06,332
We're calling her Dawn.

349
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:14,928
I could be the one
to look after her sometimes.

350
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:26,124
It's always open.

351
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:29,205
What can I do for you boys?
Want some cocoa?

352
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:35,369
- No. We need information. We need...
- Ben's Glory.

353
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:39,326
- Who's what?
- Look at this. Special Ed remembers.

354
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:45,010
Yeah. I do. Ben's Glory and Glory's Ben.
It's like this fog's lifted.

355
00:28:45,093 --> 00:28:49,291
Wonderful. But not why we're here.
Hell-god type. Name of Glory...

356
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:52,331
- AKA Ben.
- ..has gone missing.

357
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:57,931
She's brewing up some major-league bad,
and she's nicked the Slayer's kid sister.

358
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:01,164
That girl you brought here. Sweet little thing.

359
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:05,971
How'd things work out with her mom?
Changed her mind, didn't she?

360
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:09,648
Yeah. You got any idea
where Glory would take her?

361
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:12,964
Glory.

362
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:18,002
You don't mean Glorificus?

363
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:20,527
Gosh. What do you wanna
get mixed up with her for?

364
00:29:20,613 --> 00:29:24,811
That's a sure way to get yourselves
killed. I hear she's awfully unpleasant.

365
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:30,206
When it comes to Hell gods, my best advice
is get out of the way, and stay there.

366
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:32,443
Love to. Can't.

367
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,202
Well, other than that...

368
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:41,329
I'd like to help, but I'm a small-town guy.

369
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:46,403
This Glorificus, if it is her, she's big city.

370
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:49,243
- She's got Dawn.
- Right.

371
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:56,651
Well, I may know a fella, you know,
who knows a fella in China. He might...

372
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:59,167
How the hell are we
to get to China? Teleport?

373
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:04,282
I guess. You know, if you're
in that much of a hurry. Wish you luck.

374
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:06,843
You're lying.

375
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:12,168
And what's more, I believe you're standing
right in front of the very thing we need.

376
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:18,282
Idiot.

377
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:20,965
Get him.

378
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:31,806
You think only underworld
bottom feeders worship the Beast?

379
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,851
Her day is coming, boys.

380
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:45,721
And when she returns,
then you're gonna see somethin'.

381
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:08,884
- What have we got?
- Something worth dying for.

382
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:23,849
Buffy, will you just stop
a second and listen to me?

383
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:28,211
- Buffy. You have to stop doing this.
- Doing what?

384
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,769
- Killing Dawn.
- Why?

385
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:34,289
Because this never happened.
You never killed your sister.

386
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:38,488
- Will, I did this.
- In your imagination.

387
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:42,407
None of this is real.
You're stuck in some kinda loop.

388
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:46,643
I don't know what you're
talking about. Excuse me.

389
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:49,167
Buffy, why are you doing this?

390
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:52,924
I think they see us.

391
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:56,201
Stay close to me. Don't look back.

392
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:01,844
Stay very still.

393
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:12,724
I'm sorry.

394
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:15,005
Sorry?

395
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,925
That actually hurt, you prepubescent puke.

396
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:30,562
OK, first thought, just totally spontaneous,
unfiltered, off the top of my head...

397
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:36,606
You hit Ben in his soft human head,
and I remember the pain.

398
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:42,607
You probably think I won't waste
any precious blood of yours till tonight.

399
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:47,528
You're right. But I know a thousand ways
to hurt you that won't spill a drop.

400
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:50,923
You know those pesky feelings
I've been having? Guilt, empathy?

401
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:54,847
I'm gonna take 'em and mash 'em
back down where they belong, OK?

402
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:59,324
Now. Let's have big-girl fun. Just you and...

403
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,250
Leave her alone.

404
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:06,407
I said, leave her alone.

405
00:33:06,493 --> 00:33:09,644
No. Little late in the game
to grow a backbone, Benjamin.

406
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,963
Now be good and stay quiet.

407
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:14,886
No, you don't. Get over yourself, Ben.

408
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:17,965
This is the way things are.
I'm strong, you're weak.

409
00:33:18,053 --> 00:33:21,363
This is reality. Stop trying
to infect me with your...

410
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:25,083
Do you ever stop talking?
I don't know which is worse,

411
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:30,566
waking up in a dress not knowin' where I've
been, or hearing your self-involved ranting.

412
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:32,962
- Animal.
- Wrong, Glory. I'm no animal.

413
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:36,683
This is humanity you're feeling.
Welcome to the world.

414
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:37,888
No, no, no.

415
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,771
- Stick around, chica.
- I won't let you hurt her, Glory.

416
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:48,970
Shut your hole,
you sanctimonious little meat worm.

417
00:33:49,213 --> 00:33:51,852
I'm going home no matter what you do.

418
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:59,967
- You really think I'll just let that happen?
- Benjamin, what are you doing?

419
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:04,207
You need her blood? When I'm through
there won't be enough to fill a bottle cap.

420
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,842
- Then you, Hell bitch, have nowhere left...
- To go.

421
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:17,369
You can't hurt her and you know it, Ben.

422
00:34:17,453 --> 00:34:20,729
I know it because
I feel what you're feeling. Scared.

423
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:27,045
It's OK. You don't wanna die.
Who would? I don't.

424
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,567
You can't, you're immortal.

425
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:32,121
Nobody has to die here, Ben.

426
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:35,842
Just let me bleed the girl and go home.
Everything'll work out fine.

427
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:38,812
Do you believe, with all I know,
that you can trick me?

428
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,691
Stop and think, baby.

429
00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:44,571
We bleed the kid,
return me to my seat of power,

430
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:47,929
- I become a god again...
- And I disappear.

431
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:51,493
Unless somebody up there likes you.

432
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:55,248
Give up the girl, I could like you a lot.

433
00:34:56,453 --> 00:35:00,571
- I won't make a deal with you, Glory.
- When exactly did you get stupid?

434
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:03,167
I'm offering immortality here.

435
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:10,569
I believe you. That's not the problem.
You make me immortal, then what?

436
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:15,522
I'd have to kill her. I can't live with that,
not even for a day. Forget about eternity.

437
00:35:15,773 --> 00:35:20,403
Baby, baby Ben. Why do you worry so much?

438
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:25,283
When you're immortal, all this crap
you've been carryin' around inside,

439
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,922
the guilt, the anger, the crazy-makin' pain,

440
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:33,130
it all just melts away like ice cream.

441
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:38,446
Trust me. When all this is over
I can set you up real nice.

442
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:42,924
I'm making it easy. It's you or the girl.

443
00:35:44,053 --> 00:35:46,044
I can't accept that.

444
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:51,282
Accept it. I'm a god, stupid.

445
00:36:00,013 --> 00:36:01,492
I'm sorry.

446
00:36:07,773 --> 00:36:13,166
Don't make this harder than it already is.
I'm sorry, I got no choice. It's you or me.

447
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:24,603
No. Buffy, leave Dawn alone. What is this?

448
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:26,763
My gift. This is what I do.

449
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:32,689
I'm not talking about this.
I'm talking about this.

450
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:45,967
Right here, it happened. I know it's
something small, but it's something.

451
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:49,487
- What?
- Don't go there, Will.

452
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:53,691
I'm not. You're the one who
keeps dragging me back here.

453
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:58,927
And you wouldn't be doing that if you
weren't trying to show me something.

454
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:00,969
Do I?

455
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:04,045
Buffy, come on. It's your brain. Just tell me.

456
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:10,047
What happened here?

457
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:13,926
This was when I quit, Will.

458
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:17,289
- You did?
- Just for a second.

459
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:20,292
I remember.

460
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:23,369
I was in the magic shop.

461
00:37:23,453 --> 00:37:25,842
I put a book back for Giles.

462
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:31,049
Nothing special about it.
And then it hit me.

463
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:36,409
- What hit you?
- I can't beat Glory.

464
00:37:36,773 --> 00:37:38,923
Glory's going to win.

465
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:41,083
You can't know that.

466
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,690
I didn'tjust know it.

467
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:47,209
I felt it. Glory will beat me.

468
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:51,652
- And in that second of knowing it, Will...
- I wanted it to happen.

469
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:54,681
- Why?
- I wanted it over.

470
00:37:56,533 --> 00:38:02,244
This is... All of this...
It's too much for me.

471
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:08,091
- I just wanted it over.
- If Glory wins, then Dawn dies.

472
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,282
And I would grieve.
People would feel sorry for me.

473
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:16,123
But it would be over.

474
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,602
And I imagined what a relief it would be.

475
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:28,287
I killed Dawn.

476
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:32,569
Is that what you think?

477
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:34,964
My thinking it made it happen.

478
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:38,688
Some part of me wanted it.

479
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:43,007
And in the moment Glory took Dawn...

480
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:46,688
I know I could have done something better.

481
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:48,764
But I didn't.

482
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:52,007
I was off by some fraction of a second.

483
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:55,285
- And this is why...
- I killed my sister.

484
00:38:56,413 --> 00:39:01,203
I think Spike was right back at
the gas station. Snap out of it.

485
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:03,042
- What?
- What?

486
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:07,725
All this, it has a name. It's called guilt.

487
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:13,285
It's a feeling, and it's important.
But it's not more than that, Buffy. Buffies.

488
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,363
You've carried the weight of the world
on your shoulders since high school.

489
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:22,402
And I know you didn't ask
for this, but you do it every day.

490
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:27,328
And so you wanted out
for one second. So what?

491
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:33,128
- I got Dawn killed.
- Hello. Your sister, not dead yet.

492
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:37,126
But she will be if you stay locked
inside here and never come back to us.

493
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,005
And what if I can't?

494
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:45,086
Then I guess you're right.
And you did kill your sister.

495
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:48,842
Wait.

496
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,810
Where are you going?

497
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:58,082
Where you're needed. Are you coming?

498
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,442
Buffy? She's back.

499
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:33,093
- You're OK?
- Yeah. I'm OK.

500
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:36,483
- Hear you found the ritual text.
- Something like that, yes.

501
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:41,408
- Did you know that Ben is Glory?
- So I'm told. What do we know?

502
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:46,769
Well, according to these scrolls,
it is possible for Glory to be stopped.

503
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,643
I'm afraid it's...

504
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:55,807
Buffy, I've read these things very carefully,
and there's not much margin for error.

505
00:40:55,893 --> 00:41:00,171
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Might help if you actually said it.

506
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:12,569
Glory plans to open a dimensional
portal by way of a ritual blood-letting.

507
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,882
- Dawn's blood.
- Yes.

508
00:41:18,213 --> 00:41:21,649
Once the blood is shed
at a certain time and place,

509
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:25,328
the fabric which separates
all realities will be ripped apart.

510
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:31,604
Dimensions will pour into one another,
with no barriers to stop them.

511
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:36,045
Reality as we know it will be destroyed and...

512
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:40,129
- chaos will reign on earth.
- So how do we stop it?

513
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:43,683
The portal will only close
once the blood is stopped.

514
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:47,211
And the only way for that to happen is...

515
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:53,723
Buffy, the only way is to kill Dawn.

516
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,168
