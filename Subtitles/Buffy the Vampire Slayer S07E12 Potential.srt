2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:06,851
- Dawn, what happened here?
- l saw Mom.

3
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:10,562
lt's the Big Bad, Dawn.
The one we knew was coming.

4
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:12,564
l believe in you, Spike.

5
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:15,811
They were after Spike all along.

6
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:17,963
l know what we're up against. The First.

7
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:21,284
Now, Spike, you wanna see
what a real vampire looks like?

8
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:24,649
<i>(Giles)</i> As Neanderthals are to human beings,
the Turok-Han are to vampires.

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,691
Ferociously powerful killing machines,
single-minded as animals.

10
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:29,923
They are the vampires that vampires fear.

11
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:32,085
Nice place. Bit of a mess.

12
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:34,641
- They're all slayers?
- Potential slayers.

13
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:39,443
Waiting for one to be called. There were
many more like them all over the world.

14
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:42,650
Now there's just a handful,
and they're all coming to Sunnydale.

15
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,486
- How many girls arriving today?
- Just one.

16
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:49,407
But since Giles has the coven
searching for other slayers-in-waiting,

17
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:52,053
we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.

18
00:00:52,573 --> 00:00:54,928
- Rona, right?
- You're her!

19
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,971
Another potential arrived in town
the day before yesterday.

20
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:01,328
She's cold. Been dead for days.

21
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:04,052
She made it all the way to Sunnydale
just to get killed.

22
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:07,205
- Eve.
- Eve, who's in our house?

23
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:09,523
- Get away from them.
- Buffy, what did Eve do?

24
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:11,410
- That's not Eve.
- One more down.

25
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:15,486
Oh, well, can't save 'em all,
can ya, Buffy? Bye.

26
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:25,762
l don't know what's coming next,
but l do know it's gonna be just like this.

27
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,242
Hard. Painful.

28
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:32,330
Believe it. We'll be the ones left standing.

29
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,048
You.

<i>(twig snaps)</i>

32
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:13,249
Agh!

33
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:20,092
OK... These two are dead. Why?

34
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:23,128
Cos the black chick always gets it first?

35
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:27,172
- What was that, Rona?
- l'm dead because he's a vampire.

36
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:30,802
l don't have slayer strength,
slayer speed. lt wasn't a fair fight.

37
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:34,249
Vi, do you think l care if it's a fair fight?

38
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,085
No... No, sir.

39
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:42,685
You don't play by the rules, and l have
learned a valuable lesson of some sort. Ow!

40
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,048
OK, Spike.

41
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:51,770
You're right. You don't have slayer strength,
but that doesn't mean that you're not strong.

42
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:54,811
You have inherent abilities
that others do not have.

43
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:57,123
- Not like you do.
- No.

44
00:02:57,213 --> 00:03:02,082
Not yet, but it's there.
You have the potential.

45
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:07,481
You have strength, speed, instinct.
You just have to learn to trust yourself.

46
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:11,563
Rona, what did your instincts
tell you to do just then?

47
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:16,807
Block his attack, keep him off balance,
gain the advantage...

48
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:20,044
- No, they didn't.
- They told me to run.

49
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:23,121
- Vi?
- They told me to run.

50
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:27,005
They're still... sort of telling me to run.

51
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:30,768
Don't fight on his terms.
Your gut's telling you to run, run.

52
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:33,970
Regain the higher ground.
Make the fight your own.

53
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:37,125
Spike, what did your instincts
tell you to do just then?

54
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:40,046
Hunt. Kill.

55
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:43,526
Come at me, full speed.

56
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,688
He needs to kill to live.
That tells you everything you need to know.

57
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:56,401
lnstinct. Understand his, but trust yours.

58
00:03:57,133 --> 00:04:00,443
- You were chosen for a reason.
- <i>(Spike groans)</i>

59
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,763
- Are you OK?
- Fine.

60
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:05,208
Couple of ribs ain't quite set right.

61
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:08,524
- l'm fine.
- Let me see... Spike.

62
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:13,528
l'm gonna be OK.

63
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:15,850
That's hot.

64
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:19,528
So, we're supposed to, like,
make out with them or something?

65
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:25,245
Careful, Buffy. Just when you think
it's part of the lesson, he'll... hurt your arm.

66
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:34,251
Molly, Kennedy, let's go. You're up.

67
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,324
Next lesson.

68
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,286
<i>(Rona)</i> No way.
One-armed push-ups are bull.

69
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:43,571
- <i>(Kennedy)</i> l can do 'em.
- <i>(Rona)</i> l'm more of a chin-up kinda girl.

70
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:48,488
- l can do chin-ups till the cows come home.
- l can do the kind where you clap between...

71
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,848
You're all gonna die.

72
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:57,324
But you knew that already.
That's the cool reward for being human.

73
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:59,529
Big dessert at the end of the meal.

74
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:05,922
Don't kid yourselves, you guys.
This whole thing is all about death.

75
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:09,528
You think you're different
cos you might be the next slayer?

76
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:13,447
Death is what a slayer breathes,
what she dreams about when she sleeps.

77
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,922
Death is what a slayer lives.

78
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:20,684
My death could make you the next slayer.

79
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:25,324
Oh, goody. Rapt attention.
l love that so much.

80
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:29,884
Now, where was l?

81
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,964
Ah.

82
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:36,649
lf we go with Anya's resources,
then the First is in remission for a while,

83
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,122
which we think means "advantage us".

84
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:42,762
What does that mean... about the First?

85
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:46,766
Best we can tell,
he - or more precisely it -

86
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:51,131
was putting a lot of stock
in that Übervamp thing, the... Chaka Khan.

87
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:52,931
Turok-Han?

88
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:57,564
When l kicked its ass, the whole Firsty circus
decided to back off for a while.

89
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:59,086
Good news?

90
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:04,201
Means we probably don't have to worry
about it pulling Spike's strings for a while.

91
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,284
Here's the half-empty.

92
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:10,204
Time away means time to regroup.

93
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:14,047
And part of that regrouping
is coming back stronger than ever.

94
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:18,126
The odds are against us.
Time is against us.

95
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:22,569
And some of us will die in this battle.

96
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:26,123
Decide now that it's not going to be you.

97
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:33,363
l know you're all tired,
far away from home, anxious.

98
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:37,248
But you're all special.

99
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:43,721
Most people in this world have no idea
why they're here or what they wanna do.

100
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,203
You do.

101
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:51,286
You have a mission, a reason for being here.

102
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,727
You're not here by chance.

103
00:07:57,813 --> 00:08:01,203
You're here because you are the chosen ones.

104
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:09,243
Dawn, you better hurry up and eat something
so you're not late for school.

105
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,370
<i>(bell rings)</i>

106
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,488
Xander, l know. l'm sorry.

107
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:18,770
lf you're gonna take a shower
at my house, lock the door.

108
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:21,526
Of course they're curious.

109
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:27,726
Hey, l gotta go.

110
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:29,963
Has Giles checked in yet?

111
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:33,841
l thought he was picking up that
Chao-Ahn girl in Shanghai yesterday.

112
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:37,562
OK, well... Let me know if he does. Bye.

113
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:41,491
Amanda, right? l'm all yours.

114
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:44,451
Do people ever think you're weird?

115
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:51,562
l guess... Sure.
ln a charming, endearing, lovable...

116
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:52,847
Yeah.

117
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:56,687
l feel like people think l'm weird,
and so they pick on me.

118
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:58,889
But l might be... weird.

119
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:02,648
Amanda, why do you think that you're weird?

120
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:06,885
One of the boys who picks on me,
l kind of...

121
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:11,892
See, if a guy picks on you,
is it weird to think he's cute?

122
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,886
Oh.

123
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:19,888
lt's just the last few times l've seen him
l've wanted to, you know...

124
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:22,885
pick on him... extra. More.

125
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,561
Uh-huh.

126
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:27,042
The thing is... l can't tell.

127
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:31,324
My mom says when a guy teases you,
it means he likes you.

128
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:34,644
- Sometimes that's true.
- ls it weird?

129
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:38,123
We're mean to each other,
and we like each other.

130
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:41,603
Well, it depends.

131
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:47,211
Sometimes that's how people relate,
being mean to each other.

132
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:50,683
Even... mortal enemies.

133
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:52,491
Then with the...

134
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:57,852
And that leads to no good -
absolutely no good - and much confusion.

135
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:01,164
And then it's over.
Absolutely, seriously, definitely over.

136
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:06,122
And that's confusing too, the over part.
Which it is. Over!

137
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:10,368
So... maybe.

138
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:17,048
<i>(girls and Xander shouting)</i>

139
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:23,964
<i>(Xander)</i> There might be a more appropriate
place to do that, like maybe outside.

140
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:26,613
Why do we always have to yell?

141
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,088
l was only gone a couple of hours.

142
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:32,772
Buffy?

143
00:10:32,853 --> 00:10:36,368
Hey, everybody, it's Willow.
Perhaps with a blunt weapon.

144
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:38,444
Buffy, we just got news.

145
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:44,249
- And she's sure?
- Positive.

146
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,246
Althenea said the seers located
another potential slayer in Sunnydale.

147
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,484
- Someone that already lives here.
- Oh, God.

148
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:54,645
All these girls flocking to town,
and this one's already here?

149
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:59,648
Wait, the seers couldn't find out
her name or her address or anything?

150
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,724
Am l getting the word "seer" wrong?

151
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:06,125
l was gonna take the girls out for some
show and tell, but maybe l shouldn't.

152
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:10,491
They were so excited.
You're gonna break their little hearts.

153
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:14,771
This town is lousy with Bringers.
l don't want them to find this new girl first.

154
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:18,243
No, you should go.
l can do a spell to find her tonight.

155
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,563
l have to get together a few ingredients.

156
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:23,725
You shouldn't skip your training.
lt's too important.

157
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:26,281
- You think you can handle it?
- No problemo.

158
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:29,171
Yeah. You guys have
more important things to do.

159
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:31,562
OK, l'll take 'em.

160
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:33,962
Yes!

161
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:36,613
Andrew, you're not going.

162
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:42,292
Ooh, crossbow! Gotta love it.
Feels like l'm stormin' a castle.

163
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:47,652
- You do a lot of that, do you?
- l might if l had a beauty like this. Halt!

164
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:52,052
- We don't point weapons in the kitchen.
- lt's not loaded.

165
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:56,411
That's always under the headline: "Household
Crossbow Accident Claims Teen".

166
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:59,485
- Oh, a mace!
- Yeah, that's better.

167
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:02,041
Gotta go with the stake. lt's classic.

168
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:05,250
- l like the feel of wood in my hand.
- Lost me there.

169
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,801
Hey, are we gearing up already?

170
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,442
Right. You guys are going
on your little group patrol.

171
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:14,206
More than that, it's an outing.

172
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:18,332
- Tonight we might actually get to kill things.
- l've killed things.

173
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:21,689
- l'm not begging.
- You're like a dog dancing for Snausages.

174
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:24,128
You don't want me to come
cos you think l'm evil.

175
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:27,523
- He doesn't seem evil, exactly.
- He's not evil.

176
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,083
But when he gets close to it,
he picks up its flavour like a mushroom.

177
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:34,245
But l'm reformed.
l'm like Vegeta on <i>Dragonball Z.</i>

178
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:38,372
l used to be a pure Saiyan,
and now l fight on the side of Goku.

179
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:41,047
- Still not coming.
- lt's not fair.

180
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:47,572
- Spike just killed people, and he gets to go.
- Spike didn't have free will. You did.

181
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:49,769
l hate my free will.

182
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,289
This where you're all hiding?
You ready to go, or what?

183
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,365
Let's go, girls. Grab your weapons.

184
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:58,772
All right, let's do it.

185
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:02,812
<i>(Rona)</i> l don't know about you guys,
but l'm ready to kick some serious...

186
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:05,487
You wanna play <i>Dragonball Z?</i>

187
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:10,003
l got my tumbleweed, my eggs.

188
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:14,052
Got my chrysalises... chrysali?

189
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:18,011
My butterfly transformer pods.

190
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:20,163
Hey, where's my snakeskin?

191
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:24,451
At your ssservice, Miss Rosenberg, sssir.

192
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:33,725
Can you imagine if once in a while
people just wriggled out of their skin

193
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:38,284
and left it behind them, like, on the sidewalk?
Talk about embarrassing.

194
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:42,924
Hey, do you think this girl -
this potential - goes to Sunnydale?

195
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:47,564
Hmm. Well, l guess probably.
l mean, she's gotta be about that age.

196
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:49,611
Could be anybody.

197
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:53,242
Could be that glamazon in gym class.
What's her name?

198
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,245
Oh, my lab partner, Margo the freak.

199
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,326
l hope not. She fainted right in the middle
of our foetal pig dissection.

200
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:03,086
l just don't think
she's cut out for the slayage biz.

201
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:06,768
Killing pigs is just so wrong. And also hard.

202
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:09,651
We'll know soon enough
who the next potential is.

203
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,883
Somebody's life is about to change.

204
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:15,522
How long will it take?
Will we find out who it is right away?

205
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:19,049
Pretty much. The spell will
conjure up this brilliant light.

206
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:23,843
The light will find the potential
and it'll illuminate her with a glowing aura.

207
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:24,968
Cool.

208
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:29,046
l've enchanted this map,
so that we can track her basic location.

209
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,603
We'll have to hotfoot it,
but l'm betting we find her tonight.

210
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:35,890
lf it is Margo, she's so gonna faint.

211
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:41,203
To light the aura of the new,
skin of snake and chrysalis too.

212
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:46,492
To indicate the fresh reborn,
tumbleweed and rosebush thorn.

213
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:50,528
An egg that means the life to come.

214
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:54,128
Take this, O spirits, and my spell is done.

215
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:57,762
Good God! What is that smell?

216
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:00,811
l'm sure that's a hard-boiled egg
being thrown into a fire.

217
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:03,532
- Uh-huh.
- The smell will lead us to the potential.

218
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:05,922
Or someone who ate too many chimichangas.

219
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:09,005
She'll also be lit with a brilliant aura.

220
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:11,812
ls it supposed to be
shimmying all over like that?

221
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:15,249
l don't know. l don't think so.

222
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:20,691
So you messed up the spell again.
At least it smells... otherworldly.

223
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:23,045
Oh, look! Pretty!

224
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:27,649
l suck. l'm sorry, you guys...

225
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:31,803
Maybe we could figure something out
on the computer?

226
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:35,329
Good call. l'm gonna open the door
and let this place air out.

227
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:38,007
Don't worry, Will. lt's really no big.

228
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:41,563
l just... l was sure that it was gonna work.

229
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:45,164
Dawn!

230
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,042
l think it worked.

231
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,322
- Dawn!
- Dawn, are you OK?

232
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:13,804
Maybe you did it wrong?
Was it ambiguous in any way?

233
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,723
Did you maybe say "potential sailors"?
l do like the water.

234
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:20,202
- l did it right.
- Wow, she...

235
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,249
You're a potential.
You could be the next slayer.

236
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,288
Oh!

237
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:27,807
Wow, it's like...

238
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:32,603
One second you're a klutzy teenager with
fake memories and a history of kleptomania,

239
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:35,969
then suddenly you're a hero
with a much abbreviated life span.

240
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:38,567
This is huge. We have to think about this.

241
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:42,089
l can't think about this.
lt doesn't fit in my head.

242
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:44,562
A slayer. Makes sense, l guess.

243
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:47,963
Remember that thing about
"they share the same blood"?

244
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:50,044
Yeah, l never got that.

245
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,408
She has to die.

246
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:57,652
l mean, if l was ever the Slayer,
it would mean she died.

247
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:01,371
lt's a lot like being the Pope in that way,

248
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,889
except you don't have to be
some old Catholic.

249
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:08,886
- We've gotta call Buffy.
- No, we can't. She didn't bring her cellphone.

250
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:11,692
Well, sure.
All the important people are with her.

251
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:15,368
- You're important now.
- What happens now?

252
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:19,364
Well, you could start
by maybe sitting still for a sec.

253
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:21,762
l can't. l need to know
what happens to my life.

254
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:24,731
- Well, l guess Buffy trains you.
- Right.

255
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:29,523
l train with the potentials... other potentials.
Learn to do the stuff they're learning.

256
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:34,528
We also have to protect you from the eyeless
guys with the sharp, sharp knives.

257
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:35,602
Bringers.

258
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:38,765
- lt's OK, we'll protect you.
- What if they saw the spell?

259
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:43,051
Saw the spell?
Dawn, they can't see flash cards. Big ones.

260
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,249
We did a big orange powerful spell.

261
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,972
What if they sensed it?
What if they're on their way?

262
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:54,162
Are we gonna replace the microwave?
l was thinking some Orville Redenbacher...

263
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:56,642
What's going on?

264
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,850
- Dawn's gonna be a slayer.
- Holy crap!

265
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:01,886
Excuse me.

266
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,726
Plucked from an ordinary life,
handed a destiny...

267
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:07,043
Say Skywalker, and l smack ya.

268
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:10,364
- Does Buffy know?
- She didn't take her phone.

269
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:11,488
lncommunicado.

270
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:14,326
- We'll tell her as soon as she gets back.
- Let's not.

271
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:16,608
Dawn, she has to know.

272
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:19,161
l know, just not right away.

273
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:23,324
Guys, when Mom appeared to me, she said...

274
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:25,369
- Dawnie...
- No, please.

275
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:31,964
She said something about Buffy,
and l'm thinking...

276
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,487
l'm just not so sure
Buffy will be happy for me.

277
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,245
- Of course she will.
- Will she?

278
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,962
l'm not even sure l'm happy for me.
Everything's different now.

279
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:44,046
That's because you're a part of
something larger. Like being swallowed.

280
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,886
- By something larger.
- This...

281
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:49,448
This is too much for my head again.

282
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:52,252
l can't. l need to be...

283
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:56,529
Nice job with "getting swallowed".

284
00:18:56,613 --> 00:19:01,243
Well, it is a mixed bag. lf she gets to be
the Slayer, then her life is short and brutal,

285
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,211
and if she doesn't,
it smells of unfulfilled potential.

286
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:06,807
My "swallowed" analogy
looks pretty sweet now.

287
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:12,809
lt's not like that.
lt's like she's part of this huge power.

288
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:15,851
l know what that feels like. lt feels wonderful.

289
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,925
Yes, Willow so captured it. lt's like...

290
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:22,210
lt's almost like this metaphor
for womanhood, isn't it?

291
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,523
The sort of flowering that happens

292
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:29,733
when a girl realises that she's... part of
a fertile heritage stretching back to Eve...

293
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:33,249
- l'll pay you to talk about <i>Star Wars.</i>
- This isn't about womanly power.

294
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,450
Dawn just might have
bought herself an early death.

295
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:40,731
- We don't know that.
- All we know is that everything just changed.

296
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,771
<i>(Willow)</i> Someone should go find Buffy.
She needs to know.

297
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:47,607
- <i>(Xander)</i> Will, what if she doesn't like it?
- Are you worried about the ghost?

298
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:50,127
We don't even know
if that really was Joyce.

299
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:53,205
- We don't know what she meant about Buffy.
- l don't mean that.

300
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,602
What's Buffy gonna do with this information?

301
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:59,163
Jump up and down, teach Dawn
the handshake? She knows what this means.

302
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:03,007
Short, brutal life. Sharp, sharp knives.
l covered this.

303
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:05,891
Right. You think Buffy
really wants that for Dawn?

304
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,851
<i>(Xander)</i> Besides, Dawn doesn't
want us telling her yet.

305
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:12,482
<i>(Willow)</i> Dawn's freaking out.
Her input - not worth that much now.

306
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:14,803
<i>(Anya)</i> She's a child. She can't handle this.

307
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:19,808
<i>(Xander)</i> Something out there said she can
handle this and more. Something chose her.

308
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:21,884
l'm chosen.

309
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:24,089
<i>(Willow)</i> ls that why she's hiding?

310
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:27,882
<i>(Xander)</i> She's just getting used to it.
She doesn't have to rush.

311
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:30,965
He's right. We shouldn't rush her.

312
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:34,125
Rushing's only gonna get her killed.

313
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:50,084
<i>(Rona)</i> This is a bar.

314
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:53,210
- Best damn field trip l ever took.
- Look, they're all...

315
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,206
They're demons! lt's a demon bar.

316
00:20:57,293 --> 00:21:00,205
lt's like a gay bar, only with demons.

317
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,806
Spike!

318
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:07,209
Long time. Nice of you to bring snacks.

319
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:10,569
Touch them, and lose your privates.

320
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:15,570
- l didn't like him.
- Nice job of blending in, girls.

321
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:20,090
We're 15-year-olds in a demon bar. How much
blending did you think we were gonna do?

322
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:23,563
lt's OK. Usually you come to
a place like this, you wanna be seen.

323
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:26,213
You wanna scare someone or make contact...

324
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:29,012
- Or have a strong drink?
- Not usually that.

325
00:21:29,093 --> 00:21:31,209
- You don't drink?
- Sure l do.

326
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,761
l mean, no. That would be wrong.

327
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:37,528
- Do they card?
- Nope, go ahead.

328
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:41,686
Down all the yak urine shots
or pigs' blood spritzers you like.

329
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:44,968
- Gross.
- Got that right.

330
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:49,604
Prices they charge, you should get
human blood straight from the body.

331
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:51,565
Vampire.

332
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:57,091
lf l come here, it's to wring information
out of something large, scary, drunk,

333
00:21:57,173 --> 00:22:00,848
with a room full of friends who don't
care for the Slayer. Remember that.

334
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:03,447
Not a being here
wouldn't gladly rip your throat out.

335
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,966
Buffy?

336
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:09,649
- Girl, how you been?
- Clem! You look great. So toned.

337
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:13,764
- He's ripping out her throat.
- My God! lt is so good to see you!

338
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:18,688
l saw this great show the other night that
l knew you'd love, but my TiVo went flooey.

339
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:21,333
Can l talk to you for a second over here?

340
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:23,881
You think she dated him too?

341
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,932
OK, everyone. These are the girls.

342
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:30,765
Howdy.

343
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:34,732
So, you girls are gonna
deal with demons, huh?

344
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,088
Just let me tell you this:

345
00:22:40,853 --> 00:22:43,606
l could use a shot of that
yak urine right about now.

346
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:56,605
Hey.

347
00:22:57,053 --> 00:22:59,567
Hey, Dawn. What you doing?

348
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:03,368
Just walking. You?

349
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:05,887
Yeah, just walking too.

350
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:10,285
Well, have a good walk.

351
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:13,843
- l guess l'll see you Monday morning?
- Yeah.

352
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:18,168
You all right?

353
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:21,325
Sure. Just walking. You know?

354
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:28,282
Are you all right? You've got a thing.

355
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:38,002
l guess l... l had a bit of a...

356
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:40,527
lt's been a bizarre night.

357
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:43,491
What happened? Who did that to you?

358
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:49,967
Nobody... exactly.
l don't think you'd exactly believe me.

359
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,771
Try me.

360
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:55,323
l was at school late
because of, you know, swing choir,

361
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:58,644
and l tore my sweater -
you know, the striped ones we wear.

362
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:01,645
So l went to Home Sciences to sew it up.

363
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:06,170
And by the time l was finished,
the place was empty,

364
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:09,325
so it was all echoey and lonely and...

365
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:14,609
Then there was this guy - or thing -
and it was...

366
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:18,606
lt scratched me, and l kinda dodged it,
and it kinda hit its head.

367
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:21,969
- What kind of thing?
- l don't know.

368
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:27,005
lt was messed up, in the face.
Around hereabouts.

369
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:33,771
And when it scratched at you, did it...
was it scratching with its teeth?

370
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:39,364
ls it real?
Was it really a vampire?

371
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:46,450
- l bet you think l'm crazy.
- l... believe you.

372
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:50,683
Well, cool.

373
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:54,802
The thing is, after it hit its head,
l kinda freaked out.

374
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,568
l trapped it in a room, and it's still there.
Now l don't know what to do.

375
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:04,444
- lt's OK. This is totally dealable. Don't worry.
- l was thinking of getting your sister.

376
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:08,765
- You know something about my sister?
- Well, l've heard people talking.

377
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:12,243
A lot of 'em think she's some kind
of high-functioning schizophrenic.

378
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:18,966
But... l also heard that maybe...
she could help with this kinda thing.

379
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:23,171
- Do you think we should go get her?
- She's out.

380
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:25,005
l'll take this one.

381
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:28,650
Phew!

382
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:33,443
l think l strained something.
Maybe something l'll need later in life.

383
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,684
Come on. The vampire's upstairs.

384
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:43,207
- Are you spooked out?
- No. l'm all right. l can do this.

385
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:46,891
lt's mostly instinct... l think.

386
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:49,124
<i>(Dawn yelps)</i>

387
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:56,212
So, if he scratched me with a tooth, am l...

388
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,767
l'm not gonna turn into one, am l?

389
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:03,846
Only if he slashed open one of his veins
and led you to drink deep of his blood.

390
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:05,924
Nope.

391
00:26:06,893 --> 00:26:09,851
Good. You're lucky
he didn't hurt you way more than that.

392
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:12,128
Right. He can do that.

393
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:18,013
So, l was thinking...
we don't have to kill the vampire, do we?

394
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:19,848
What?

395
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:25,166
Suppose he got out and was led toward the
gym while the marching band was playing.

396
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:30,043
The way they look down on the swing choir,
it might be, you know... funny.

397
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:34,004
l'm just saying.

398
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:47,682
Well... he didn't break down the door, anyway.

399
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,445
Yeah.

400
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,524
Can they do that?

401
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:54,329
They're very strong.

402
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:58,008
Although they feel pain,
they don't hold back because of it.

403
00:26:58,093 --> 00:27:01,005
Guess you're some kind
of monster expert too.

404
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:05,292
Let's just say it runs in the family.

405
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:23,572
- l thought you said it was locked.
- lt was.

406
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:27,368
lt was here.

407
00:27:27,453 --> 00:27:29,444
Amanda...

408
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,169
lt got out.

409
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:51,964
Where'd it go?

410
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:56,009
l don't know. But we have to get out of here.

411
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:00,047
Argh!

412
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:18,688
What are you doing?

413
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:23,051
l can't remember! Does it have to be
right side up or upside down to work?

414
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:41,124
A vampire is an animal. Sometimes
they run in packs, sometimes alone.

415
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:45,483
- Who can tell us where we are?
- lt's a nest.

416
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:48,485
- How can you tell?
- Only a vamp could live like this.

417
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:51,690
Some, yeah. As a group,
we're not known for our decor,

418
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:56,528
but, in all fairness to race,
this place is seriously lacking in style.

419
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,086
- Thank you, Spike.
- l'm merely saying.

420
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:05,167
He has a point. Vampires can
live anywhere. Any way they want.

421
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:09,007
Tastes, fashions, living conditions -
they can vary.

422
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:12,051
The animal inside, always the same.

423
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:16,289
- Where'd you live?
- What, you mean before?

424
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:20,203
A crypt actually, but nicer. A bit more...

425
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:24,925
l don't know if posh is the right word,
but it was more...

426
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,685
- Comfy.
- Excuse me?

427
00:29:26,773 --> 00:29:29,845
When did you find it comfy?

428
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,089
Moving on.

429
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:36,563
You wanna stay alive, you have to
spot and identify a nest on sight.

430
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:38,530
Look around, all of you.

431
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:44,643
Look for signs that last night maybe a dozen
vampires were right where we're standing.

432
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,324
Go ahead.

433
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:58,252
Work, work, work. This excursion
was just in danger of being interesting.

434
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,801
You know something, Spike...

435
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:05,608
lnteresting is not a problem.

436
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:08,002
Buffy, l think we found something.

437
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:11,444
lt's a body.

438
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:20,690
lt's not a body. lt's leftovers.

439
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,969
ln here!

440
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:37,009
Help! We need to barricade this!

441
00:30:39,293 --> 00:30:41,284
Too small.

442
00:30:44,253 --> 00:30:46,244
Too big!

443
00:30:53,013 --> 00:30:55,004
Stay down.

444
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,008
Think we're safe?

445
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:03,446
No one's safe. Not here, not ever.

446
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,767
- See this guy?
- He was dead a minute ago.

447
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:09,367
That was a minute ago. Now...

448
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:13,044
- Hey!
- ..he's the enemy.

449
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:15,292
- Amanda?
- Yes?

450
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,931
- Listen.
- l'm listening.

451
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:20,847
We're gonna get out of this.
Both of us. Alive.

452
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:23,242
Alive. Do you believe me?

453
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:27,690
- l believe you.
- Good. Cos l got a plan.

454
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:31,048
<i>(Buffy)</i> You can't think too much.

455
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:32,486
Reacting's better.

456
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:36,725
Could be the difference between
staying alive and that other thing.

457
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:45,090
This plan of mine...
l'm not guaranteeing it'll work.

458
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:47,641
Better than mine about the marching band.

459
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:50,850
Besides, your plan'll work.

460
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:53,483
l don't know what l'm doing here.

461
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:55,529
You're getting it done.

462
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:08,606
The question is never "What do you think?"
lt's always "What do you know?"

463
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:13,244
You gotta know.
lf you don't, if you make one mistake...

464
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:17,212
<i>lt takes just one vampire to kill you.</i>
<i>So you've gotta know you can take him.</i>

465
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:21,764
<i>Know your environment. Know what's</i>
<i>around you, and know how to use it.</i>

466
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:32,563
<i>ln the hands of a slayer, everything is</i>
<i>a potential weapon, if you know how to see it.</i>

467
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:37,044
<i>When you're fighting, you have to</i>
<i>know yourseIf, your brain, your body.</i>

468
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:40,569
<i>Know how to stay calm, centred.</i>
<i>Every move is important.</i>

469
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:45,681
<i>Every blow has gotta be part of your plan,</i>
<i>cos you make that one mistake, and it's over.</i>

470
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:49,004
<i>You're not the Slayer. You're not a potential.</i>

471
00:32:50,653 --> 00:32:52,883
You're dead. So what do you know?

472
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,445
Now, the only thing you know for sure...

473
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:59,129
you got me.

474
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:15,250
- Come on, sweetie. Open up.
- Want me to kick down the door?

475
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,722
- Anya.
- What? lt'd be funny.

476
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:22,008
Besides, she's been sulking in there forev...

477
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:23,811
Oh.

478
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:28,766
Crap.

479
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:33,012
- Double crap.
- Gone.

480
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:36,449
We gotta find her... before the Bringers do.

481
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,445
l can do a locator spell,
but we gotta hurry. And find Buffy.

482
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:42,331
- Help! Amanda, help me!
- l can't!

483
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:44,005
Amanda!

484
00:33:50,693 --> 00:33:52,684
No! You don't want her!

485
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:58,326
You want me.

486
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:13,045
Amanda!

487
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:25,969
- What were those?
- Amanda, listen to me.

488
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:28,726
You remember when you said l was special?

489
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:32,442
Well, l'm not. But the thing is, you are.

490
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:35,570
- This is your battle, Amanda.
- No, l can't.

491
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,609
You can! You've got to.

492
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:41,606
Look, l've got your back,
but this is something you have to do.

493
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:44,082
lt's something you were born to do.

494
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:48,521
Here, this belongs to you.

495
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,803
<i>(Xander)</i> Buffy, up here.

496
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:08,606
Here!

497
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,885
OK.

498
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:25,761
One minute l'm in swing choir,
and the next...

499
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:30,846
What the hell's going on?
You tell me to come to you with problems.

500
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:34,130
Turns out a vampire attacked me. Problem.

501
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:37,762
So l go to your house,
only then this orange cloud hits me.

502
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:39,889
She was at the doorway.

503
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:43,522
l don't know if you're into the drugs,
but that's not my deal.

504
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:48,050
That cloud hit me, and l got
a little dizzy and discombobulated.

505
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:52,645
lt was Willow's spell.
She's the potential slayer.

506
00:35:57,293 --> 00:36:00,968
l'm sure the vampire thought
we were, like, four helpless girls.

507
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:05,604
- Then Vi yells "We're just four helpless girls."
- That was part of my plan.

508
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:09,845
When it all started going down, it was
like we knew what we were doing, for real.

509
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:12,970
Like when you dodged that attack,
and cracked him across the jaw.

510
00:36:13,053 --> 00:36:15,726
l couldn't have done that
if you hadn't took his legs out.

511
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:19,567
l hurt his arm. Yep!
And an arm can be as lethal as a mouth.

512
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:22,121
When you staked him, the rush was like...

513
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:27,526
- So, you took one out solo?
- Yeah, what was that like?

514
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,849
l don't know.

515
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:35,848
l mean, when l saw the vampire... vamp...

516
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:38,003
Vampire's good too.

517
00:36:38,093 --> 00:36:45,932
Cool. Yeah, when that vampire attacked me,
l felt this kind of charge. You know?

518
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:51,361
<i>(Kennedy)</i> Like you realise in one instant
that your whole life is different.

519
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:56,129
<i>(Amanda)</i> Exactly.
lt's that rush you're talking about.

520
00:36:58,373 --> 00:37:00,364
Hi.

521
00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:02,842
- You OK?
- Yeah.

522
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:07,249
l was thinking of hitting the books.
Do some research on the First.

523
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:10,962
lt's in retreat mode,
but you still need to know how to fight it.

524
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:13,044
Great. Sounds good.

525
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:17,649
Hey, you guys. Wanna head downstairs?
Get our newest arrival up to speed?

526
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,801
What's up?

527
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:42,487
l'm just thinking about the girls.

528
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:45,133
lt's a harsh gig, being a potential.

529
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:47,568
Just being picked out of a crowd.

530
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:51,692
Danger, destiny. Plus if you act now, death.

531
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:54,681
- They can handle it.
- Yeah.

532
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:57,928
They're special, no doubt.

533
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:03,887
And the amazing thing is,
not one of 'em will ever know. Not even Buffy.

534
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:07,647
Know what?

535
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,531
How much harder it is for the rest of us.

536
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:14,242
- No way. They've got...
- Seven years, Dawn.

537
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:19,123
Working with the Slayer. Seeing
my friends get more and more powerful.

538
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,727
A witch. A demon.

539
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:24,043
Hell, l could fit Oz in my shaving kit,

540
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:29,082
but, come a full moon,
he had a wolfy mojo not to be messed with.

541
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:32,168
Powerful. All of them.

542
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:36,445
And l'm the guy who fixes the windows.

543
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:44,811
You had that sexy army training for a while,
and the windows really did need fixing.

544
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:47,608
l saw what you did last night.

545
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:49,411
Yeah, l...

546
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,371
l kinda lost my head
when l thought l was the Slayer.

547
00:38:52,453 --> 00:38:56,651
You thought you were all special.
Miss Sunnydale 2003.

548
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:59,763
And the minute you found out you weren't,

549
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:03,812
you handed the crown to Amanda
without a moment's pause.

550
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:06,088
You gave her your power.

551
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:09,487
The power wasn't mine.

552
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:13,882
They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie,

553
00:39:13,973 --> 00:39:16,533
to be the one who isn't chosen.

554
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:20,083
To live so near to the spotlight
and never step in it.

555
00:39:20,173 --> 00:39:22,289
But l know.

556
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:27,652
l see more than anybody realises
because nobody's watching me.

557
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:33,448
l saw you last night.
l see you working here today.

558
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:36,924
You're not special.

559
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:40,402
You're extraordinary.

560
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:52,250
Maybe that's your power.

561
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,403
What?

562
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:56,848
Seeing. Knowing.

563
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:02,287
Maybe it is. Maybe l should get a cape.

564
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,772
Cape is good.

565
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:07,127
Yeah.
