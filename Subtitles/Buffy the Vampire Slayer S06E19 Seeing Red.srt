1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,710
- Previously:
- Why won't you sleep with me again?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,750
- Because I don't love you.
- Like hell.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,190
- Thought you were gonna go see Tara.
- She was seeing someone else.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,270
We should have some coffee sometime.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm free tomorrow.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,110
- Whoa.
- Shut it all down!

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,310
- Is that the cam in the Magic Box?
- Oh, my God.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,590
- Oh, God. What is she...?
- That's enough.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,830
You left me, Xander. At the altar.
I don't owe you anything!

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,670
So you go out and bang
the first body you can find?

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,230
- It's good enough for Buffy.
- Shut up and leave her out of...

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,110
Tara?

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,390
You can't just... have coffee and expect...

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,430
- I know.
- There's just so much to work through.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,950
Trust has to be built again, on both sides.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,870
Can we just skip it?

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,230
Can you just be kissing me now?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,074

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,430
When did morning happen?

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,710
After the moon went down.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,820
I forgot how good this could feel.

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,790
Us, together.

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,670
- Without the magic.
- There was plenty of magic.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,150
It's getting late.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,270
- Wanna get up?
- No.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,430
Oh, God, no.

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,510
I was just thinking about Buffy.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,270
Oh.

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,550
- She still isn't back?
- I didn't hear her.

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,710
She wouldn't talk about what happened at the
magic shop when she got home last night.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,990
She just asked how close I was
to tracing the camera signal

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,950
back to the empire of the nerds.

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,910
Then she left again.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,190
I'm sure she'll be OK.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,630
Yeah, I'm not really worried about her
going up against Warren and the others.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,110
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but...
I think something might be going on.

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,190
With Spike and Buffy.

38
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,830
I mean, she looked so hurt when
she saw him with Anya. I think maybe...

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,030
They've been sleeping together.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,550
No. I wouldn't go that far.

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,420
No, I mean she told me
they've been sleeping together.

42
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,420
Sleeping together? You mean,
like, the naked kind of together?

43
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,510
I'm sorry I didn't say anything
but I promised her I wouldn't.

44
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,270
Does everybody know? Am I the only one...

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,950
God, no. She didn't even
mean to tell me. It just came out.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,550
How could she hide
something like this from me?

47
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,510
I think she was afraid
of the look you'd get on your face.

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,470
- Kind of like the one you're wearing now.
- Oh, no, I'm not...

49
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,630
I'm just... trying to understand.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,710
So is she.

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,870
Wow, she probably
really needs someone to talk to.

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,790
Probably.

53
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,870
We've been kind of busy.
Maybe we didn't hear her come home.

54
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,550
Buffy?

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,230
Is she back yet?

56
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,310
Not yet. I'm sure she'll be home soon.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,630
- Everything's fine. Just go back to bed.
- It's ten o'clock.

58
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,430
Oh. Uh...

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,870
You don't think
she's gonna hurt Spike, do you?

60
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,190
- She told you about Spike?
- It was kinda obvious after last night.

61
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,870
Yeah, I totally knew.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,070
It must have hurt so much.

63
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,670
To see him and Anya like that.

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,950
And poor Xander.
Everything is so screwed up.

65
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,830
It's gonna be all right.

66
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,510
It's just complicated. When people have such
strong feelings for each other, sometimes...

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,830
Is she back yet?

68
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,750
Oh. Hey.

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,590
You and...?

70
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,030
- That's my cue to go put some clothes on.
- No! I'm totally not here.

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,500
You guys, you do whatever you want.

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,950
I'll go watch TV, downstairs, really loud,
in the basement where I can't hear anything.

73
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,670
Oh, my God!

74
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,740
I love you guys!

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,830
All right! Let's make this quick.

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,540
Fine. But I'm not leaving
till we have a little chat.

77
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,670
Very little, considering
the pummelling that needs to occur.

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,350
I mean, guys, hello?

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,430
Slayer here. Did you honestly
think I wouldn't find you?

80
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,390
Well, that can't be good.

81
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,740
OK. That's gonna cost you.

82
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,950
OK, we're here, ready for action.

83
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,030
Bad-guy-fighting action.

84
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,870
Guys, you didn't have to...
You know, if you still wanna be alone.

85
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,580
- No. No, we're good.
- We're better than good.

86
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,070
- Great.
- Super.

87
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,630
Mm-hm.

88
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,190
- OK. All right, we'll stop.
- Oh, you better not.

89
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,510
So, nerds - how are them... they?

90
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,630
I found their lair but they knew
we were tracing their signal.

91
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,470
They left in a hurry. Van was gone,
but everything else was still there.

92
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,510
We should go back.
Tara and I can sherlock around.

93
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,870
Nothing left now. Giant buzz saw.
There was a thing.

94
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,190
This is all that I could save.
We need to go through it,

95
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,750
see if we can find anything that might tell us
what they're doing, where they're going.

96
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,630
This might take a while.

97
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,790
Anything we can do to fast-forward? We need
to find Warren before anyone else gets hurt.

98
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,390
Should we call Xander?

99
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,590
I don't think he's really in the Scooby space.
We need to give him some time.

100
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,190
Maybe they've heard something
in the demon bars about those guys.

101
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,510
- Spike...
- Spike...

102
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,750
Spike's not part of the team.

103
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,980
So he's not going to be around any more?

104
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,630
I don't know, Dawn. Not for a while.

105
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,830
What about Anya? She might be
able to help with the demon texts.

106
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,750
I'm guessing she's not feeling
real researchy right now.

107
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,190

108
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,470
I know how you feel. Maybe I can help.

109
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,910
How could Carl do that to me? That bastard!

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,110
He's a man. Look no further.

111
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,190
But with my sister? She's not even pretty.

112
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,150
Well, it isn't always about looks.

113
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,230
Or a beating heart.

114
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,470
Sometimes intimate sweaty relations with the
wrong person seems a good idea at the time.

115
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,500
She's fat. He cheated on me
with my fat, ugly sister.

116
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,030
Likes'em fleshy, huh?

117
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,630
Bet you wish he'd bloat up a few thousand
pounds and pop like a big old meat zeppelin.

118
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,630
He said he loved me.

119
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,270
Then he must've meant it, cos guys never say
anything they don't really mean, do they?

120
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,110
They say "l love you" and you think it's true.

121
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,110
They say "Oh, Anya, I wanna be with you
for the rest of my life," and you believe them.

122
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,430
You believe they feel the same about you
because that's the way love's supposed to be.

123
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,430
Who's Anya?

124
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,430
You get all excited, with the tingly
anticipation, but wait. Not so fast.

125
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,220
There's the apocalypse, the back
from the grave, the blah, blah, blah!

126
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,510
By the time you're standing there
in that expensive white dress

127
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,830
you've dreamed of since you became human,
he gets all heebie-jeebie and decides

128
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,750
"I'd rather just go steady."

129
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,070
Men suck. I wish Carl's flesh would...

130
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,870
He said it isn't me, but how can I believe him?
I mean, he knew he didn't wanna get married.

131
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,230
Deep down, he knew.
But he lied to me every day for months.

132
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,990
- I wish...
- He lied and lied and lied some more.

133
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,750
Who's gonna notice with all the other lies
flying around like monkeys?

134
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,150
Then he thinks he can sweep
the carnage under the rug by saying...

135
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,670
I'm sorry. Sorry.

136
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,790
I'm sorry. Sorry. Please! I'll never
try to desecrate your chamber again.

137
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,830
Don't hurt me. Please!

138
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,670
Hit him again. Hit him again!

139
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,470
Wow. They're tougher than I thought. One jolt
from this should have dropped an elephant.

140
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,150
You want a piece of this, huh?
Not so tough, are you, now, Pufnstuf?

141
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,510
Hey, hey, hey! We need him fresh,
all right? Not smokehouse.

142
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,750
I'm done being the bait. Next time
one of you can wiggle on the hook.

143
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,030
If this works, the next time
we'll be the thing that everyone's afraid of.

144
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,630
OK. So... what now?

145
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,580
Well, now it's your turn, Sparky.

146
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,950
Does it help?

147
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,750
Doesn't hurt.

148
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,510
Not planning a campout, are we?

149
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,550
No. I'm sleeping over at Janice's.

150
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,310
Figured Willow and Tara
might want some time to, uh...

151
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,580
So the birds are flying again, eh?

152
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,870
Ain't love grand?

153
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,870
I wanted to stop by
on my way and... you know.

154
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,790
Everybody's pretty mad at you.

155
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,070
Yeah. Kind of picked up on that.

156
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,620
You're not gonna be
coming around any more, are you?

157
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,300
It's complicated, Niblet.

158
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,180
Everybody's been saying that.

159
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,670
It must be true, then.

160
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,980
Was it worth it? What you did with Anya?

161
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,750
Buffy told you?

162
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,630
Kind of caught the show.

163
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,550
There was a camera
somewhere in the Magic Box.

164
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,630
Warren and Jonathan and that other guy
had been watching Buffy.

165
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,990
Wankers.

166
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,230
Do you love her?

167
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,390
Oh, no. No.

168
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,470
It was just a...

169
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,600
It was a bad day. For both of us.
We just had a few drinks, and things just...

170
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,790
No. Not Anya.

171
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,110
Buffy.

172
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,230
Do you really love her?

173
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,910
Then how could you do that to her?

174
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,550
Oh, right, cos big sis was treating me
so well up until that point.

175
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,950
Must still be a bit of the evil
left in me after all.

176
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,070
I don't know what happened
between you two.

177
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,590
But what you did last night...

178
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,590
If you wanted to hurt Buffy, congratulations.

179
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,670
It worked.

180
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,950
This is it. We found it.

181
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,110
- You sure it's in there?
- Be careful.

182
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,590
Only Nezzla demons
can pass through the barrier.

183
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,150
- Everything else gets curly-fried.
- This sucks.

184
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,020
- Just make sure all your skin's covered.
- Why can't I just use a glamour?

185
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,510
You can't Siegfried-and-Roy the barrier.
It's gotta be the real deal.

186
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,470
- It's still wet.
- Good. Then it should still be fresh enough.

187
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,630
"Should be"? Wait a minute, what do you
mean? What do you mean, "should be"?

188
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,550
Wasn't sure that would work.

189
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,990
Jackass.

190
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,030
- You think he knows?
- Well, if he did, why would he be here?

191
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,660
Why is he? Our mojo's tight, bro.
We could've pulled this ourselves.

192
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,390
Well, somebody had to guinea-pig
the meat suit. Were you gonna volunteer?

193
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,780
- I don't trust that leprechaun.
- Stay frosty.

194
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,190
This works the way we planned it, by the end
of the evening Jonathan won't be a problem.

195
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,230
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

196
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,700
- That's it?
- Better be.

197
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,630
No way I'm going back through there.
That thing stings like a mother.

198
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,430
- Dude, unholy hair gel.
- Get off.

199
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,590
- Make me, skin job.
- Shut up.

200
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,590
Gentlemen, the Orbs of Nezzla'khan.

201
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,830
Strength. Invulnerability. The deluxe package.

202
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,270
They're everything I've ever dreamed of.

203
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,110
Those things have been there for a zillion
years. How do we know they'll still work?

204
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,150
Oh, they work.

205
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,070
You don't look any different. I thought they
were supposed to make us all huge and veiny.

206
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,860
- Are you sure they're working right?
- Let's find out.

207
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,950
- Mahatma!
- Welcome to the show, boys.

208
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,630
- That was so hot.
- Let me try'em!

209
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,150
- Watch the paws, little man.
- Ow!

210
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,830
- We're supposed to share.
- Oh, relax.

211
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,510
You'll each get a whirl.
Soon as I'm done playing with'em.

212
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,390
Hey.

213
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,870
Hey.

214
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,430
I think there's a cold one in the fridge.

215
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,140
Thanks, but I think
it's still a little early for me.

216
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,390
She loves you. You know that.

217
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,470
Anya was just...

218
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,510
She was hurting.

219
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,270
She was hurting and she did
this really stupid thing.

220
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,110
With your boyfriend.

221
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,310
He's not my boyfriend.

222
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,630
I know why Anya...

223
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,710
I understand, I do.

224
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,630
But you...

225
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,630
All those times I told Spike to get lost.

226
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,750
That he didn't have a chance
with a girl like you.

227
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,820
- You don't know how hard it's been.
- What, lying to me?

228
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,270
Being here.

229
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,230
After I was brought back...

230
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,510
You have no idea
how hard it is just being here.

231
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,980
- You could have told me.
- You didn't wanna know.

232
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,110
So you went to him instead?

233
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,870
Xander, what I do with my personal life
is none of your business.

234
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,150
It used to be.

235
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,110
It just happened, OK?

236
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,310
Oh, like, "Say, you're evil."

237
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,780
"Get on me."

238
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,470
You fought side by side
with him when I was gone.

239
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,310
- You let him take care of Dawn.
- But I never forgot what he really is.

240
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,630
God, what were you thinking?

241
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,660
You're asking me that? Cos your decision-
making skills have really sparkled lately.

242
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,470
I'm not saying I didn't make any mistakes. But
slaughtering half of Europe wasn't one of'em.

243
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,350
He doesn't have a soul, Buffy.
Just some leash they jammed in his head.

244
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,310
You think he'd still be all snuggles
if that chip ever stopped working?

245
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,350
Would you still trust him with Dawn then?

246
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,430
It doesn't matter.

247
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,950
I'm not seeing him any more. It's over.

248
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,030
Yeah. There's a lot of that going around.

249
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,590

250
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,710
It's all a mess.

251
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,310
These things take time. We'll figure it out.

252
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,270
Sure. We'll decipher codes,
foil evil schemes...

253
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,870
- Finally get out of bed.
- I was with you up until there.

254
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,870
Whoa.

255
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,630
What is it?

256
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,740
One of their data CDs. It's filled with
encrypted blueprints, schematics.

257
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,750
- To what?
- I'm not sure.

258
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,190
Their designations have been stripped.

259
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,670
Maybe we can cross-reference them
with the county clerk's office.

260
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,870
Would that involve getting up?

261
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,630
- Eventually.
- Then I'm coming out firmly against it.

262
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,870
What about the trio's evil scheme?

263
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,310
Well, I'm kinda busy working on my own.

264
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,070
You're all wet.

265
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,990
- It's a good thing I'm part fish.
- Which part?

266
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,070
The part with the hook in it.

267
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,510
Careful. Someone might reel you in.

268
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,150
Yeah, but then there'd be
the flopping and the... gasping.

269
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,780
Maybe it'd work out, but chances are
I'd leave you in your white dress,

270
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,670
find you spawning with another fish

271
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,070
who's spawning my good friend
night and day behind my back.

272
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,070
Then comes the fighting, and again
with the flopping and the gasping.

273
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,860
Chicken of the Sea here's not doing
too good with the women these days.

274
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,870
Huh?

275
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,510
Sorry, I'm just looking to curl up
with the quiet alone tonight.

276
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,990
We don't have time for this.

277
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,070
Ease up, twitchy.

278
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,870
All right.

279
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,990
Let's make some noise.

280
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,550
Not bad. How hard you gonna hit
when you're blowing in the wind?

281
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,270
That was rhetorical.

282
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,830
Ow.

283
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,150
Are you hurt? You're not moving so well.

284
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,500
- Get out.
- We have to talk.

285
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,910
- I really don't.
- Well, this isn't just about you.

286
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,670
As much you'd like it to be.

287
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,220
You spoke. I listened. Now leave.

288
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,350
I'm sorry.

289
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,150
Not that it matters any more,
but I needed you to know that.

290
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,800
- Why?
- Because I care about you.

291
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,590
Then you might wanna try
not sleeping with my friends.

292
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,470
I didn't go to Anya for that.
I was looking for a spell.

293
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,860
You were gonna use a spell on me?

294
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,950
It wasn't for you.

295
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,030
I wanted something.

296
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,830
Anything to make these feelings stop.
I just wanted it to stop.

297
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,100
You should have let him kill me.

298
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,710
- I couldn't do that.
- Why?

299
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,260
- You know why.
- Because you love me.

300
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,110
- No, I don't.
- Why do you keep lying to yourself?

301
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,630
How many times do...

302
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,550
I have feelings for you. I do.

303
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,750
But it's not love. I could never
trust you enough for it to be love.

304
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,430
Trust is for old marrieds, Buffy.

305
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,190
Great love is wild,
and passionate and dangerous.

306
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,840
It burns and consumes.

307
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,630
Until there's nothing left.

308
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,990
Love like that doesn't last.

309
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,990
I know you feel like I do.
You don't have to hide it any more.

310
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,670
- Spike, please stop this.
- Let yourself feel it.

311
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,950
- No.
- You love me.

312
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,030
- No, stop it.
- You love me.

313
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,550
Spike, stop! Ow! What are you doing?

314
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,670
Ow!

315
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,300
Let it go. Let yourself love me.

316
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,510
- Buffy... Buffy...
- Spike, no. Ow! I'm hurt!

317
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,270
Stop! Ow! Stop it, please!

318
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,590
I know you felt it... when I was inside you.

319
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,230
No! No! No! No! No!

320
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,270
Ow! Ow!

321
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,710
Please! Please!

322
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,710
- Spike...
- You'll feel it again.

323
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,910
- Please don't do this!
- I'm gonna make you feel it!

324
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,710
Stop!

325
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,310
Ask me again why I could never love you.

326
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,790
- Buffy, my God, I didn't...
- Because I stopped you!

327
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,670
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

328
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,790
What are we doing here?
Somebody might recognise us.

329
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,630
This is great. We're risking everything
so that Charles Atlas can get a date.

330
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,470
He's gonna end up getting us
thrown into jail. Or worse.

331
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,070
- Maybe you and I should think about...
- Warren's the boss.

332
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,710
He's Picard, you're Deanna Troi.
Get used to the feeling, betazoid.

333
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,070
The clothes, and the cars, and the money,
it's all just window-dressing.

334
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,310
Baby, this is what's really important.

335
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,910
- Two souls, coming together...
- Hey!

336
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,790
She only comes together with me.
So get lost, shrimp.

337
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,110
Frankie? Oh, my God, is that you?
How long has it been?

338
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,950
It's Warren. Remember? Warren.
Gym class, fifth period?

339
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,600
You and your jock buddies
gave me such a hard time.

340
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,670
That thing with the underwear?
God, I thought I'd never stop crying.

341
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,030
- That was you?
- That was me. But, hey, no hard feelings.

342
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,680
I know you were just fooling around.

343
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,750
Like I'm gonna be with your girl
in about five minutes.

344
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,590
- What'd you say?
- You heard me, meathead. Go walk.

345
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,950
You're dead, you little...

346
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,390
This ain't high school.

347
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,470
Frankie!

348
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,150
Let's party.

349
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,510
Oh, don't worry about the tab,
now, ladies. It's on Daddy tonight.

350
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,980
Don't worry. Daddy gonna give you some too.

351
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,910
I think it's the "Daddy" thing
that's throwing her.

352
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,870
- Cos incest's not that sexy.
- Oh, crap.

353
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,030
Let's leave the ladies to their impending
nausea and move the freak show outside.

354
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,350
OK. But let me ask you something first.

355
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,110
You think you could
put in a word for me with Anya?

356
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,790
If she's taking it from a vamp,
I think I might have a chance.

357
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,230
No wonder she's screwing a dead guy.
You hit like a girl.

358
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,670
Well, at least I know how to get one.

359
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,910
- Let's see how popular you are with no face.
- We have to go.

360
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,990
We go when I'm ready.

361
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,910
Hey, it's your call, but...

362
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,710
we're gonna miss that thing you wanted
to do tonight if we don't leave right now.

363
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,830
It's your lucky night, Shemp.

364
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,510
We just leave him?
What if he sics the Slayer on us?

365
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,670
Bring her on.

366
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,220
Buffy? I found Warren.

367
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,550
Actually, my face kinda found him...

368
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,830
This what you call
not seeing Spike any more?

369
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,550
What did he do? Did he hurt you?

370
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,710
He tried. He didn't...

371
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,750
- Son of a bitch.
- Don't.

372
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,380
Please, just... don't.

373
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,430

374
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,900
Hey, I think we finally have something.

375
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,830
- What happened?
- Nothing.

376
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,510
What'd you find out?

377
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,510
We deciphered pretty much
everything except these.

378
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,870
It isn't written in any ancient language
we could identify.

379
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,550
It's Klingon. They're love poems.

380
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,550
Nothing to do with the insidious scheme
you're about to describe.

381
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,390
What have you got for me
that doesn't rhyme?

382
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,350
This.

383
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,670
It was filled with blueprints and schematics.

384
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,790
To what?

385
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,870
Banks, armoured car routes,
corporate vaults. This is big.

386
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,630
They're looking to score some serious dinero.
We don't think they're planning just one job.

387
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,430
Spree, anyone?

388
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,470
- I can't cover all these at once.
- You don't have to.

389
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,590
- We think there's one they may hit tonight.
- It's time-sensitive.

390
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,230
Be careful. Warren's gone all Mighty Mouse.
Emphasis on the "might".

391
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,310
Good. Then I won't have to hold back.

392
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,270
Please, stop it! Please stop!
Please don't do this! Please!

393
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,710
- Please!
- Buffy...

394
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,230
- I'm gonna make you feel it.
- Stop!

395
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,940
Knock, knock.

396
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,310
I was just in the neighbourhood
so I thought, you know...

397
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,750
There's a Knight Rider marathon
on the TV, so... I got hot wings!

398
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,390
What have I done?

399
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,230
Why didn't I do it?

400
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,430
What has she done to me?

401
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,550
She done... who?

402
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,430
Oh.

403
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,980
Slayer, huh? Gosh.

404
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,510
She break up with you again?

405
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,950
We were never together.

406
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,030
Not really.

407
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,470
She'd never lower herself that far.

408
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,270
She's a sweet girl, Spike, but hey.

409
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,350
Issues.

410
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,150
And no wonder, with the whole
coming back from the grave and whatnot.

411
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,990
I had this cousin who got resurrected
by some kooky shaman.

412
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,510
Whoo, boy! Was that a mess.

413
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,550
- Why do I feel this way?
- Love's a funny thing.

414
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,630
Is that what this is?

415
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,070
I can feel it.

416
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,230
Squirming in my head.

417
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,430
- Love?
- The chip.

418
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,950
Gnawing bits and chunks.

419
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,830
Maybe a wet cloth...?

420
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,070
You know, everything
always used to be so clear.

421
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,190
Slayer. Vampire. Vampire kills slayer,

422
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,790
sucks her dry, picks his teeth with her bones.

423
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,030
It's always been that way.

424
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,580
I've tasted the life of two slayers.

425
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,270
But with Buffy...

426
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,710
It isn't supposed to be this way.

427
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,420
It's the chip!

428
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,590
Steel and wires and silicon.

429
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,940
It won't let me be a monster.

430
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,030
And I can't be a man.

431
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,750
- I'm nothing.
- Hey.

432
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,430
Come on, now, Mr Negative. You never know
what's just around the corner. Things change.

433
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,270
Yeah, they do.

434
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,710
If you make them.

435
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,830
All right, that's the last one.

436
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,750
- Quite a haul, huh?
- Always the biggest gate of the year.

437
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,830
- Don't lose any.
- Yeah.

438
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,590
Wanna grab a bite after?
I think Rupert's is still open.

439
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,670
What the hell?

440
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,910
- There's something back there!
- I can't wait to get my hands on his orbs.

441
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,430
Yeah, I'm sure he'll be
giving'em up any second now.

442
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,710
Hey. Is this your bank?

443
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,360
Cos if not, there's gonna be a fee for that.

444
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,310
I was wondering when
Superbitch would show up.

445
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,270
- You got a problem with strong women?
- Nothing I can't handle.

446
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,830
You seem a little off. Is this a bad day?

447
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,150
It's gettin' better.

448
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,070
That all you got?

449
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,670
No!

450
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,950
There's two ways this can end. And right
now I'm thinking they're both gonna hurt.

451
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,150
I think you're right.

452
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,990
What's the matter, baby?
You never fight a real man before?

453
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,070
Wow. That almost hurt, kitten.

454
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,110
Kill her. Kill her!

455
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,310
- You know who I am? Huh, Slayer?
- You're a murderer.

456
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,960
Well, that too, but more to the point...

457
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,150
I'm the guy that beat you.

458
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,070
And it's not the muscles, baby. It's the brains.

459
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,860
I'll remember that
when I knock'em clean out of your...

460
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,260
Whoa! Sparky, I didn't think you had it in you.

461
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,950
Orbs! Smash his orbs!

462
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,590
Say good night, bitch.

463
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,630
Good night, bitch.

464
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,180
You're nothing but a sad little boy, Warren.

465
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,030
But it's time you grow up,
and pay for what you've done.

466
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,190
Get away from me. I swear to God
I'm gonna take you down, you piece of...

467
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,910
Oh, come on.

468
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,310
Well played, Slayer.

469
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,470
Why didn't I get one of those?

470
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,510
This round to you.
But the game is far from over.

471
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,540
Jet packs. You jerks
were setting me up to take the fall.

472
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,630
He left me. He flew away and left me.

473
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,420
Oh, God.

474
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,670
The big house.

475
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,870
How could he do this to me?

476
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,950
He promised we'd be together,
but... he was just using me.

477
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,910
He never really loved... hanging out with us.

478
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,390
You think he'll come back for us?
I mean... he wouldn't just take off, would he?

479
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,390
Get nice and comfy, Slayer. I'll be back.

480
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,270
And when I do, things are gonna change.

481
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,870
Hey. Clothes.

482
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,150
- Better not get used to'em.
- Yes, ma'am.

483
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,630
- Xander.
- OK, not quite the response I was fishing for.

484
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,100
No, he's here.

485
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,680
Think they're making up?

486
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,910
I hope so. That's the best part.

487
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,390
Time for the spring poking already?

488
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,070
Just making sure there are
no more evil-trio cameras.

489
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,720
Or evil uno.

490
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,360
The sinister yet addictive card game?

491
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,150
Warren. Jonathan and Andrew got clinked,
but... Warren pulled a Rocket Man.

492
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,110
You'll find him. He won't be
much good without his friends.

493
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,430
No, he won't.

494
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,660
How did we get here?

495
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,740
Scenic route. Long drive.

496
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,190
- The past few weeks...
- I know.

497
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,270
I thought I hit bottom, but... it hurt.

498
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,430
That you didn't trust me enough
to tell me about Spike.

499
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,710
It hurt.

500
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,750
I'm sorry.

501
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,780
I should have told you.

502
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,630
You would have, if I hadn't given you so
many reasons to think I'd be an ass about it.

503
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,150
Guess we've all done
a lot of things lately we're not proud of.

504
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,700
I think I've got you beat.

505
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,590
- Wanna compare?
- Not so much.

506
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,230
I don't know what I'd do...

507
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,310
without you and Will.

508
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,620
Let's not find out.

509
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,110
I love you. You know that, right?

510
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,270
Buffy!

511
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,790
You think you can just do that to me?
You think I'd let you get away with that?

512
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,590
Think again.

513
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,870
Your shirt...

514
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,830
Tara?

515
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,750
Sweet fancy Moses! Where the hell did he...

516
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,590
Oh, God.

517
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,390
Tara? Baby?

518
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,430
Baby, come on! Get up!

519
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,870
Oh, God. Buffy? Buffy?

520
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,380
Buffy?

521
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,190
No! No!

522
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,020

523
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,590

524
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,310

525
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:37,306
