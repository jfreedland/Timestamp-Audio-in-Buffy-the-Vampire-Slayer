<i>Previously on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'':</i>

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,889
<i>- Tell me what kind of demon l'm fighting.
- Glory isn't a demon. She's a god.</i>

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,735
We had to hide the Key.
Made it human and sent it to you.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,378
- Dawn.
- l'm not real.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,974
You're the Key? Go. Before she finds you.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,175
She's here.

7
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:21,970
l won't help her find the Key.
l would never do that to an innocent...

8
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:24,621
- An innocent?
- lt's not a person.

9
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:29,175
- What about the Key?
- He indicated that it was a person.

10
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:33,539
- l'll tell you who the sodding Key is.
- The vampire is lying to me.

11
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:37,409
The Slayer is going to kick your lopsided ass.

00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:52,173
- Professor Lillian?
- Buffy.

14
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:56,778
l'm sorry that l missed the lecture today.
Was it good?

15
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,378
Of course it was.

16
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:03,902
- Do you want me to try?
- Yes. Thanks.

17
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:06,860
The slide is stuck in the thing.

18
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,898
OK.

19
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:12,941
l just came by to tell you
that l have to drop this class.

20
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,341
All my classes, actually.

21
00:01:16,422 --> 00:01:18,697
l'm not finishing the semester.

22
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:21,501
l wish...

23
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,336
l just... l can't be in school right now.

24
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:26,459
l have to take care of my sister.

25
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:29,011
Yes. l thought you might.

26
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:33,614
l was very sorry to hear about your loss.

27
00:01:36,623 --> 00:01:40,218
l have these forms from
the registrar's office that l need you to sign.

28
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:42,294
Oh. Yes.

29
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:50,060
Thanks.

30
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:58,735
ls there something else?

31
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:00,655
No.

32
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:02,735
Yes. Yeah.

33
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:07,619
l wanted to tell you
how much l enjoyed this class.

34
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:12,502
l mean, l know that l wasn't
the best student, but l really learned a lot.

35
00:02:13,544 --> 00:02:15,933
And l really like poetry.

36
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,538
l really do.

37
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:24,020
- Sorry.
- l'm glad you like poetry, Buffy.

38
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:28,701
l wish l had time for it.
But l just don't right now.

39
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:31,424
Well, maybe short poems.

40
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:36,784
Yeah. Like those Japanese ones
that... sound like a sneeze?

41
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,856
- Haiku?
- Right.

42
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:43,143
Maybe those.
And hopefully l'll be back next semester.

43
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:46,584
<i>When l'm more myself again.</i>

44
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:51,500
Benjamin. This is a pleasant surprise.

45
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,304
- l'm sorry l'm late.
- You're not late.

46
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:58,014
- But, sir...
- You can't be late to ajob you don't have.

47
00:02:58,105 --> 00:03:02,702
lnterestingly enough, l've decided to give
yourjob to someone who'll actually do it.

48
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:06,855
Honest to God, l've been calling you
for two weeks. Where have you been?

49
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:11,656
l didn't wanna... l'm sorry to fire you,
but l need somebody l can count on.

50
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:13,782
l haven't been here...

51
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:17,939
l haven't been here in two weeks.
There's an explanation for this.

52
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:20,665
Which l can't exactly give you.

53
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:24,018
l... Can l just tell you it's not my fault?

54
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,579
Sure. You can also tell me
that the dog ate your homework,

55
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,261
or maybe eating Twinkies made you do it,

56
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:36,625
or maybe, yeah, that there's really
a wicked, demonic creature living inside you

57
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:40,905
that takes control of your body
and forces you to do its bidding.

58
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:44,505
Take responsibility for your actions, Ben.

59
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:47,260
All right. This...

60
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:49,941
Oh, forget it. Just forget it.

61
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:52,587
This is so unfair.
You're taking everything away.

62
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,181
Everything l worked for,
l earned, l care about.

63
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:59,738
These are my choices.
This is my life, and you're ruining it!

64
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:02,467
No. No.

65
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:04,937
Not here. Not now, please.

66
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:08,182
l'm Ben. l'm Ben. l'm Ben.

67
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:11,817
l'm Ben. l'm Ben. l'm Ben. l'm Ben! l'm Ben!

68
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:18,226
l'm hungry.

69
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,578
We got this part right, that's for sure.

70
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,186
Lot of sucky things in this dimension.
Bubble baths? Not one of 'em.

71
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,267
- Know what l mean?
- l am in thunderous agreement,

72
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,545
O glittering, glistening Glorificus.

73
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,144
l wasn't talking to you.

74
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,228
Begging your pardon, and begging
in general, but were you talking to me?

75
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,187
Yeah, right. Like any of you
have ever bathed anyway.

76
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,024
Oh, but we do, Your Scrumptiousness.

77
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:43,909
We bathe in your
splendiferous radiance, your...

78
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:47,779
How about you shut up and listen to me,
you disgusting little fools?

79
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:49,990
OK.

80
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:54,701
Now, l asked for the Key,
and you brought me a vampire.

81
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,181
A pulseless, impure, follicly fried vampire.

82
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,227
Loofah.

83
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,548
So, what l think we have here

84
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,099
is a failure for you to do your frickin' jobs.

85
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:08,261
Pardon my French.

86
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,308
Mimosa.

87
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:18,708
Vitamins.

88
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,784
So rack your minion brains
and tell me everything you saw

89
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:25,182
when you were spying
on Buffy and her wacky pals.

90
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:27,069
Everything.

91
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:30,781
- Then l'll figure out who the Key is.
- You lied to me?

92
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:35,543
Didn't... lie... exactly.

93
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:39,705
Really? What about all the times l asked you
how school was and you said ''fine''?

94
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,589
Well, it was.

95
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,949
You didn't ask if l was in it when it was fine.

96
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:51,427
l don't know what to say. l'm sure you're
aware that the past few months, you know,

97
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:55,267
have been kind of hard for Dawn.
Not that l'm saying that's an excuse.

98
00:06:55,353 --> 00:07:00,143
l understand. Your mother was a lovely
woman, and we'll all miss her very much.

99
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:05,747
- l know how difficult it must be.
- lt is. Especially for Dawn.

100
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,983
She's just a kid.

101
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:09,347
Well,

102
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:14,144
l think we both know that Dawn
is a lot more than ''just a kid''.

103
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:21,673
She's a talented young girl
with a sharp mind,

104
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:24,143
when she puts the effort in.

105
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:28,988
l realise there's been some ball-dropping,
but l'm sure this will all...

106
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,066
Dawn, why don't you
wait outside for a few minutes?

107
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,149
Honey. Old saying:
''A watched customer never buys.''

108
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,193
They would if they were patriotic.

109
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:12,629
OK, l'm goin' in.

110
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:14,865
- Patriotic?
- Yes.

111
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:18,744
l've recently come to realise
there's more to me than just being human.

112
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:21,225
l'm also an American.

113
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:26,151
l suppose you are, in a manner of speaking.
You were born here. Your mortal self.

114
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:29,271
Well, that's right, foreigner.

115
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:31,711
So l've read a lot about
the good old ''us of A'',

116
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:35,630
embracing the precious ideology
that's helped to shape and define it.

117
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,468
- Democracy?
- Capitalism.

118
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:40,673
A free market dependent on
the exchange of goods for currency.

119
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:44,510
A system of symbiotic beauty,
apparently lost on these old people.

120
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:47,190
Look at 'em. Perusing the shelves.

121
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:51,509
Undressing the merchandise
with their eyeballs. All ogle, no cash.

122
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,586
lt's notjust annoying, it's un-American.

123
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:59,190
Appalling. Almost as if they no longer
think money can buy happiness.

124
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:04,265
Totally un-American.
Oh, and you know what else is un-American?

125
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,473
- French people.
- You don't say.

126
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:11,870
From what l hear, they don't tip. French old
people? That's really the bottom of the barrel.

127
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:16,826
An, how's about we try being a bit
less prejudiced and a bit more inclusive?

128
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:19,226
Not us, just you.

129
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:22,788
Fine. l'm gonna make
those fogeys buy things.

130
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:34,506
Hey, what's up?
lt's Dawn Giovanni and the Buffster.

131
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:37,396
- Hi.
- Hey, everybody.

132
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:42,188
- Everything went well at the university?
- Yep. l'm all dropped out.

133
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:44,712
Good on you. Welcome to the real world.

134
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:48,234
Lot of fun to be had on the outside.
You'll see.

135
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:51,867
lt's just for now. l think that
l'll probably go back next semester.

136
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,749
That's cool, too. Whatever you choose,
you've got my support. Just think of me as...

137
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,387
as your...

138
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:06,269
l'm searching for supportive things, and l'm
comin' up all bras, so something more manly.

139
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,873
Think of me as that.

140
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,632
Seriously. Whatever you need.

141
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:15,948
Thank you. Actually, l need
to talk to Giles alone for a minute.

142
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,357
Cool.

143
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,556
Dawn, why don't you
get started on your homework?

144
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:25,073
lf you need help... Will, could you?

145
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,277
OK.

146
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,348
l just don't know what l'm gonna do.

147
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,149
She's messing up.
l'm messing up. lt's a mess.

148
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,315
- You'll just have to put your foot down.
- l try.

149
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,517
lt's just... my foot's
not used to being put down.

150
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,070
l want you to do it.
You can be the foot-putting-downer.

151
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,630
- No, Buffy. l don't think l can.
- Please?

152
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,395
Pretty please? l mean,
your foot is way bigger than mine.

153
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,632
And you're so much more
a grown-up than me.

154
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:04,556
Dawn needs an authority figure,
a strong guiding hand. She'll listen to you.

155
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,632
<i>Like you always have.</i>

156
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:08,991
l listen.

157
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,876
l do.

158
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:17,313
Then perk up your ears.

159
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:20,438
l may be a grown-up, but you're her family.

160
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:25,714
Her only real family now.
She needs you to do this.

161
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:30,155
Right.

162
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:33,715
She needs me.

163
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:36,077
Me, the grown-up.

164
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:41,316
The authority figure. The strong
guiding hand and stompy foot that is me.

165
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,040
That's the spirit.

166
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,472
OK.

167
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:49,201
- l can do this.
- l know you can.

168
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:53,113
- Please?
- No.

169
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:56,953
OK.

170
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,033
Here we go.

171
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:05,557
Early to bed, early to rise, balanced breakfast,
hospital corners. lt's a new beginning.

172
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,713
Discipline. Authority.

173
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:10,874
Order.

174
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:15,511
What is this? l thought
l told you to do your homework.

175
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:18,515
- l was.
- Please don't lie to me.

176
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:22,634
- l'm not.
- We were acting out a geometry problem.

177
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:25,601
Cos l read this really neat article that said

178
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:29,915
kids learn math better if you stimulate
their visual learning pattern.

179
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:34,043
You know, using the right side
of the brain instead ofjust the left?

180
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,842
Stuff like that.

181
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:40,076
So we made a triangle with our bodies.
And that's when l called Xander obtuse.

182
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:43,952
And he got really grumpy. And then
Dawn said we were ''a cute'' triangle.

183
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:46,877
And, well, hilarity ensued.

184
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:49,874
Right. Well, you know what l think?

185
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:52,876
l think maybe Dawn should
do her homework at home.

186
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:58,601
But it was working. l was really learning.

187
00:12:58,684 --> 00:13:01,482
Please get your stuff.

188
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:05,282
Fine. Don't listen to me.

189
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:08,243
Please don't be grouchy with her.

190
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:12,603
Who among us can resist
the allure of really funny math puns?

191
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:16,075
lt's really important that
Dawn finishes her schoolwork.

192
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:19,396
Yeah, l know. But we were having
good, clean, educational fun,

193
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:24,320
and then all of a sudden it was all gloom and
doom and the outlawing of human triangles.

194
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:28,833
lt's really important that Dawn
finishes her schoolwork right now.

195
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:31,837
l know it is, and l'm a big fan of school.

196
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:35,042
You know me. l'm like,
''Go to school. lt's your birthday.''

197
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,320
Or something to that effect.

198
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:42,036
l know that you mean well. But you just don't
understand, and there's no way you could.

199
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,720
l do so understand, and...

200
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:49,197
- You're stressed out.
- l'm more than stressed out. l'm freaked out.

201
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:54,035
Yeah, well, maybe
you need a break, to de-freak.

202
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:58,119
You could go to the World Culture Fair
if you want to, with me and Tara.

203
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:01,915
- l don't think so.
- Come on. You can bring Dawn.

204
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:05,237
lt'll be fun. Good, educational-type fun,

205
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:07,601
in a discipline-y sort of way.

206
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:09,803
l can't do it, Will.

207
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:12,799
Don't worry. lt's not like l don't have a life.

208
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,276
l do. l have Dawn's life.

209
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,404
Ready?

210
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:26,078
So it's her. Under our noses all this time.

211
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:29,521
l like the detailed work those monks did.

212
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:32,121
Quirks, foibles, passions.

213
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:35,199
lt's all so cute, so... human.

214
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:38,999
You know? Pretty convincing, really.

215
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,037
But not convincing enough.

216
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:50,406
You all know your assignments.

217
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:53,562
l think it's time to collect the Key.

218
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:06,048
lt wasn't anything, really. Buffy was just
a little crabby at Dawn about her schoolwork.

219
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:08,767
- Well, it's understandable.
- Yeah, sure it is.

220
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:12,443
l'd totally be blowing off classes
if l were in Dawnie's shoes.

221
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:15,885
Sweetie, you wouldn't blow off
a class if your head was on fire.

222
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:19,484
- And l meant Buffy.
- Buffy what?

223
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:24,404
Understandable, about the crabby.
She has to look after Dawn now.

224
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:29,279
Yeah, but not in a Miss Minchin's
Select Seminary for Girls way.

225
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:32,918
She's just gonna make
Dawnie more rebellious.

226
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,081
l had to deal with
my brother's problems after...

227
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,808
l mean, you can't really
know what it's like to...

228
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:40,880
Yeah, l know that.

229
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,407
- l didn't mean to...
- No. l just...

230
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,084
l know l can't know what you went through.

231
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,565
But l just... lt's no big.

232
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,483
- l made you mad.
- No. No.

233
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,086
- All l meant was...
- lt's OK. This Buffy thing, let's just forget it.

234
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,083
No, please. l mean,
tell me if l said something wrong.

235
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,163
Otherwise l know l'll say it again.
Probably often and in public.

236
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,445
No. l was Snippy Gal.

237
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,283
lt's just... l know l can't...

238
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,362
On some level...

239
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:23,881
lt's like my opinion isn't worth anything
because l haven't been through...

240
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:29,800
l didn't lose my mom, so l don't know.

241
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:33,042
Well, l'm not the expert.

242
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:35,691
l mean, l've only lost the one.

243
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:44,930
Do l act like the Big Knowledge Woman?

244
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,289
No.

245
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:51,569
ls that ''no'' spelled y-e-s?

246
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:53,643
S-o-r-t of.

247
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:58,203
l mean, l just feel like the junior partner.

248
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:02,131
You've been doing everything
longer than me.

249
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:06,364
You've been out longer. You've been
practising witchcraft way longer.

250
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:09,842
But you're way beyond me there.
ln just a few...

251
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:13,925
l mean, it frightens me
how powerful you're getting.

252
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,327
That's a weird word.

253
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:20,450
''Getting''?

254
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:22,922
lt frightens you?

255
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:26,164
- l frighten you?
- That is so not what l meant.

256
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,051
l meant impresses. lmpressive.

257
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:33,649
Well, l took Psych 101. l mean,
l took it from an evil government scientist

258
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:37,089
who was skewered by
her Frankenstein-like creation,

259
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:39,482
but l know what a Freudian slip is.

260
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,691
Don't you trust me?

261
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,367
- With my life.
- That's not what l mean.

262
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:52,883
- Can't we just go to the fair?
- l don't feel real multicultural right now.

263
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,611
What is it about me that you don't trust?

264
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:02,403
lt's not that. l worry, sometimes.

265
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:06,762
You're changing so much, so fast.

266
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:09,812
- l don't know where you're heading.
- Where l'm heading?

267
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:13,523
- l'm saying everything wrong.
- No. l think you're being pretty clear.

268
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:17,004
This isn't about the witch thing.
lt's about my other changes.

269
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:19,085
l trust you. l just...

270
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,092
l don't know where l'm gonna fit in,
in your life, when...

271
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:27,167
When l change back?

272
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:31,248
Yeah, this is a college thing,
just a little experimentation

273
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:35,726
before l get over the thrill
and head back to Boys Town.

274
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:41,090
- You think that?
- Should l?

275
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:46,090
l'm really sorry that l didn't
establish my lesbo street cred

276
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,769
before l got into this relationship.

277
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:54,330
You're the only woman
l've ever fallen in love with, so...

278
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:57,533
how on earth could you
ever take me seriously?

279
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:00,968
- Willow, please.
- Have fun at the fair.

280
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:15,086
OK. So l think the next step
is to make a chart, a schedule.

281
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:18,646
l'll write down the things
you're supposed to do and when to do them.

282
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:23,764
Then l'll leave a box next to it, which you can
mark with an X when you've done the task.

283
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,134
What?

284
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:29,367
You want gold stars?
OK. You can have gold stars.

285
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:32,494
l don't want gold stars.

286
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:35,296
l don't want any of this.

287
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:39,091
l'm just trying to give you a normal life.

288
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:42,168
Good luck.

289
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:50,536
What? What am l doing wrong now?

290
00:19:51,177 --> 00:19:53,168
This is for real, Dawn.

291
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:55,407
No, it's not.

292
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:59,410
l'm not real, so why would
my exciting graph of chores be real?

293
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:02,490
Who cares if a Key
gets an education anyway?

294
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:08,290
lt's a chart, not a graph. And you are real.

295
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:12,447
Yeah? Those monks put
grades K through eight in my head.

296
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:15,496
Can't we just wait and see
if they drop nine in there too?

297
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:18,650
Damn it, Dawn. This is serious.

298
00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:21,377
Why? Why should l care about any of this?

299
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,256
Because they'll take you away!

300
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,888
Take me away?

301
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:36,857
What do you mean?

302
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:39,976
They'll take you away from me.

303
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:45,531
That's what your principal told me
when you weren't in the room.

304
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,258
lf l can't make you go to school,

305
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:51,331
then l won't be found fit
to be your legal guardian.

306
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:02,449
Where would l go?

307
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:04,575
l don't know.

308
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:08,539
Dad, maybe. Or foster care.

309
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,009
l didn't really wanna ask.

310
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,529
You could've told me that.

311
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,491
l just did.

312
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:22,019
ls this seat taken?

313
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:25,532
l hope this isn't a return.

314
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:29,820
Everyone wants petrified hamsters,
and they're never happy with them.

315
00:22:33,422 --> 00:22:35,299
You all right?

316
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:36,781
Yeah.

317
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:40,298
Ah, yes, because your good mood
is both obvious and contagious.

318
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:43,780
l had a fight with Tara. lt was awful.

319
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:47,061
- Oh, l'm sorry.
- Me, too.

320
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:53,137
- You two don't quarrel much, do you?
- Never. Until today.

321
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:56,612
- Well, it's over.
- Over?

322
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:59,137
How can it be over? l just found her.

323
00:23:00,423 --> 00:23:02,414
The quarrel is over.

324
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:06,173
Yeah.

325
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:11,815
You'll feel better when you've apologised and
know you can fight without the world ending.

326
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:15,738
l know it all seems bleak now
but, as they say, ''This too...

327
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:19,374
shall pass.''

328
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:25,702
- Wow!
- What do we have here?

329
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:30,255
- He's one of those things that work for Glory.
- Yes. How helpful.

330
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:35,418
l do indeed work for the god. Let me go
if you do not wish to incur her anger.

331
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:39,941
Well, she's not here. What a marvellous
opportunity for you and me to talk.

332
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:45,178
l will not betray Glorificus. l will never talk,
no matter what heinous torture...

333
00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:48,894
Actually, you're talking quite a lot,
just not about the right things.

334
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:50,816
Tell us why you're here.

335
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:54,534
No words shall pass my lips
that would bring peril to Glorificus.

336
00:23:56,625 --> 00:24:00,174
Girls, get the twine that's on the counter.
Let's tie him up.

337
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:04,143
Don't! l'll tell you anything. Please.

338
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:08,619
Whatever you want. Just... Anything.

339
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:11,697
- What happened?
- He changed his mind.

340
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:15,494
l'm... l'm supposed to watch.

341
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:20,137
We're watching the Slayer's people
while Glory fetches the Key.

342
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,786
- Glory knows who the Key is?
- Oh, God.

343
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:25,334
- We've gotta call Buffy.
- Too late. Too late.

344
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:28,498
Glorificus will find the witch
and you can't stop her.

345
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:31,259
- Witch? What do you mean?
- Tara.

346
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:35,737
She's new among you. lt wasn't hard to figure
out. The Glorious One will have found her.

347
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:39,341
- Willow, wait. l'll...
- No. Call Buffy and go look in Tara's room.

348
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:41,815
l'm gonna check the fair.

349
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:45,742
This is nice.

350
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:48,579
Just hangin' out, just us girls.

351
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,056
You like this sort of thing, don't you?

352
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:56,460
Don't make a sound.

353
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:03,218
Nah. They won't help you.
l'd kill them. You know that.

354
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:09,543
There's no one here that can stop me.

355
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,895
l'll kill her and...

356
00:25:12,987 --> 00:25:14,978
and them.

357
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:19,985
l'll kill him and her and her.
And it'll all be your fault.

358
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:26,140
Kinda funny, isn't it?
All these people here and...

359
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:30,460
no one who can do a thing,
not a person who can help you.

360
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:36,016
But that's people for ya.
They're pretty worthless.

361
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:40,946
But Keys, on the other hand,

362
00:25:41,028 --> 00:25:43,906
Keys are worth a very lot.

363
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:54,539
You lying little tramp.
You're not the Key. You're nothing.

364
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:59,100
Just another worthless human being!
l hate being lied to.

365
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,777
lt makes me feel so betrayed.

366
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:09,818
You wanna make it all better?

367
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:14,619
lf you tell me who the Key really is,
l'll let you go.

368
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:19,499
Think about it. You think your hand hurts?

369
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:24,822
lmagine what you'd feel
with my fingers wiggling in your brain.

370
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,706
lt doesn't kill you.

371
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,746
What it does...

372
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,300
is make you feel like
you're in a noisy little dark room,

373
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,263
naked and ashamed.

374
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,901
And there are things in the dark
that need to hurt you because you're bad.

375
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,266
Little pinching things that go in your ears

376
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,740
and crawl on the inside of your skull.

377
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,982
And you know, if the noise
and the crawling would stop,

378
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,062
that you could remember how to get out.

379
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:03,700
But you never, ever will.

380
00:27:08,391 --> 00:27:11,622
Who is the Key?

381
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:20,309
Fine.

382
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:22,347
Let's get crazy.

383
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,268
Tara!

384
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,822
Tara! By the force of heart
and mindful power,

385
00:27:34,592 --> 00:27:37,152
by waning time at the waxing hour,

386
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:39,746
l... when l decree...

387
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:41,870
What is it? What is it?

388
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,749
No! No!

389
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:47,662
..that she l love must now be free!

390
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:52,629
Tara!

391
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:55,071
No!

392
00:27:55,152 --> 00:27:58,861
Tara? Tara, are you OK?

393
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:01,421
lt's dirty. lt's all dirty.

394
00:28:02,793 --> 00:28:06,308
And all over me. Dirty. Dirty.

395
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,987
l'm bad. Bad.

396
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:12,346
Tara!

397
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:15,903
Tara, l'm so sorry! l'm so sorry.

398
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:31,549
Can't she go home now?

399
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:35,388
Unfortunately, no. Hospital policy
dictates we keep her for the night.

400
00:28:35,474 --> 00:28:38,193
But does she have to?
l can take care of her at home.

401
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:43,109
lt's poisoned. Why did l tell you that?
lt has to be checked, though.

402
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:48,387
- She your sister?
- lt has to be verified.

403
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:52,183
Anyone can tell you that.
Of course. Of course, of course.

404
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,265
She's my everything.

405
00:28:55,314 --> 00:28:59,990
You can get her released in the morning. But
she must spend one night in the psych ward.

406
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:04,067
Just for observation. We'll keep an eye
on her, do a couple of basic tests,

407
00:29:04,154 --> 00:29:07,545
then you take her home.
Does that sound fair?

408
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:12,072
Well, sit tight, then, and l'll send
a nurse by in few minutes to pick up Tara.

409
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:23,994
Man, words cannot express
how much l hate this place.

410
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:27,306
- lt's dreadful.
- lt's like communism.

411
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:32,104
Will, l'm so sorry.

412
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:41,467
They kill mice.

413
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:45,875
Tara.

414
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:59,550
l'm sorry it took me so long. But Dawn's safe
with Spike, so l can stay as long as you need.

415
00:30:01,396 --> 00:30:05,628
- l'm so scared.
- Nothin' to be worried about, kid.

416
00:30:05,956 --> 00:30:08,106
No one's gonna hurt you.

417
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:12,190
Oh, yeah? The same ''no one''
who did that to you?

418
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:16,748
What, these? lt's just a few bruises.
Nothin' to write home about.

419
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:20,627
Hey, chin up, platelet.

420
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:25,154
And don't get scared. Maybe Glory doesn't
wanna kill you. Maybe it's something...

421
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:27,034
Worse?

422
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:58,510
- Hey.
- You wanna know what l'm scared of, Spike?

423
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,955
Me.

424
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:08,271
Right now, Glory thinks Tara's the Key.

425
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:12,149
But l'm the Key, Spike.

426
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,350
l am.

427
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:18,997
And anything that happens to Tara...

428
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,070
is cos of me.

429
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,912
Your bruises, your limp...

430
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:29,113
that's all me, too.

431
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,150
l'm like a lightning rod for pain and hurt.

432
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,628
And everyone around me suffers and dies.

433
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,392
l must be something so horrible...

434
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,553
to cause so much pain and evil.

435
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,755
Rot.

436
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,038
<i>What do you know?</i>

437
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,350
l'm a vampire.

438
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,273
l know somethin' about evil.

439
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,669
You're not evil.

440
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,158
Maybe l'm not evil.

441
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,439
But l don't think l can be good.

442
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:23,079
Well, l'm not good, and l'm OK.

443
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:27,120
Don't! Please don't with that treachery!

444
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:32,480
l told the cats. And now
l beg my mother sitting all alone.

445
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:36,156
Bye, Tara. l'll see you tomorrow. l love you.

446
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:40,637
Willow. No. lt's just for one night.

447
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:44,031
Yeah, l know, but... it's a whole night.

448
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:47,119
l don't think l can sleep without her.

449
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:50,195
<i>You can sleep with me.</i>

450
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:57,631
Well, now, that came out a lot more
lesbian than it sounded in my head.

451
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:02,360
Will, you just have to rest.
OK? Right now there's nothing you can do.

452
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:06,073
Yes, there is.

453
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:09,996
No. No way. You cannot
even think about taking on Glory.

454
00:33:10,082 --> 00:33:12,642
You saw what she did.
l can't let her get away with it.

455
00:33:12,722 --> 00:33:17,034
No. You have to let her get away with it.
Even l'm no match for her. You know that.

456
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:20,194
- But maybe l am.
- You're not. And l won't let you go.

457
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:23,036
This is not your choice. lt's mine.

458
00:33:23,123 --> 00:33:25,034
This is not the time.

459
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:28,035
<i>When, Buffy? When is? When you feel like it?</i>

460
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:31,714
<i>When it's someone you love
as much as l love Tara?</i>

461
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:34,271
When it's Dawn? ls that it?

462
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:39,562
When we have a chance.
We'll fight her when we have a chance.

463
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:44,635
You wouldn't last five minutes
with her, Willow. She's a god.

464
00:33:47,683 --> 00:33:50,072
Fine. l'll wait.

465
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:53,114
lt's the only way.

466
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:55,001
Yeah.

467
00:33:56,764 --> 00:34:00,552
- Can l do anything?
- Just let me be alone.

468
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:52,715
You know, l think l'm a little buzzed
from eating that witch!

469
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:56,559
What a mind she had! Mmm, nummy treat!

470
00:34:56,645 --> 00:35:01,720
- But is Your Grace not concerned about...
- What, about the Slayer? Don't be stupid.

471
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:05,795
l know l'm closing in.
The Key's as good as mine.

472
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:10,516
A girl like Buffy's gotjust so many friends.
All l gotta do is rip through 'em one by one,

473
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:12,756
until l finally...

474
00:35:22,806 --> 00:35:26,162
Did anybody order an apocalypse?

475
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:31,167
Kali, Hera, Cronus, Tonic.

476
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:35,085
Air like nectar, thick as onyx.

477
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:39,479
- Cassiel, by your second star...
- Ah. lt's the lover.

478
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:42,764
- That's so cute.
- ..hold mine victim as in tar.

479
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:47,922
l owe you pain!

480
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,236
- lt's all my fault.
- No.

481
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:59,125
Sweetheart, it is not your fault.

482
00:36:02,648 --> 00:36:04,878
How's Willow?

483
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:09,598
She was looking to go
all payback-y on Glory for a minute.

484
00:36:09,688 --> 00:36:11,758
But l cooled her down, a little.

485
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:14,679
Actually, a lot.

486
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:17,919
So she's not gonna do anything rash, then?

487
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:21,523
No. l explained there was no point.

488
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:26,764
What?

489
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:34,923
So you're saying that
a powerful and mightily pissed-off witch

490
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:40,129
was plannin' on going and spillin' herself
a few pints of god blood until you... what?

491
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:42,006
''Explained''?

492
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:45,808
You think she'd...? No.

493
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:48,687
l told Willow it would be like suicide.

494
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:50,760
<i>l'd do it.</i>

495
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:55,886
Right person.

496
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:58,005
Person l loved.

497
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,441
<i>l'd do it.</i>

498
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:04,404
Think, Buffy,

499
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,958
<i>if Glory had done that to me.</i>

500
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,808
Shatter.

501
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,278
ls that it? ls that the best you can do?
You think l care about all this?

502
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,009
The apartment, the clothes?

503
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,485
Now, sucking on your girlfriend's mind?

504
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,478
That was something to treasure.

505
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,370
What's this? Bag of tricks?

506
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:40,646
Bag of knives.

507
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:46,167
Spirit of serpents, now appear.

508
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:51,650
Hissing, writhing, striking near.

509
00:37:57,891 --> 00:38:00,359
Now this is getting weak.

510
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:04,571
And so are you, honey. Aren't ya?

511
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,882
No!

512
00:38:13,732 --> 00:38:17,361
You know what they used to do
to witches, lover? Crucify 'em.

513
00:38:19,452 --> 00:38:21,886
They used to bow down to gods.

514
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:27,324
Things change.

515
00:38:39,172 --> 00:38:41,971
That witch really slowed me down.

516
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:52,850
- Thicken.
- This isn't over, you hear me?

517
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:55,401
lt isn't over!

518
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:09,611
- Chicken salad?
- Right here.

519
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:13,243
Eggplant, that's me. Salami with...

520
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:15,806
peanut butter?

521
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:17,088
Dawn.

522
00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:21,486
Yeah, like eggplant is normal.
lt's what, half egg, half plant?

523
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,883
Cos that's just a natural.

524
00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:25,805
What's Tara got?

525
00:39:26,694 --> 00:39:29,003
l got her tuna. Does she like...

526
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:35,003
Tara?

527
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:45,529
Plastic and their six sisters.

528
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:48,083
Six sick sisters.

529
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:50,450
- Willow?
- lt's OK.

530
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:53,129
Let's just start slow today.

531
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:55,251
Buffy, could l have that?

532
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:01,566
Here you go.

533
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:08,091
That's my girl.

534
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:13,606
Can l help?

535
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:26,371
What are you gonna need?

536
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:30,608
l don't know. They gave me
a lot of stuff to keep her calm.

537
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:38,294
They said l might
have to restrain her at night.

538
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:41,766
But... sometimes she's fine.

539
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:46,124
She looks at me and... she's fine.

540
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:53,808
- l'm sorry l couldn't...
- lt's OK.

541
00:40:53,897 --> 00:40:55,569
l can do this.

542
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:59,286
l'm gonna take care of her.
Even if she never...

543
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,368
She's my girl.

544
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:12,565
l understand.

545
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:17,610
l know you do.

546
00:41:21,498 --> 00:41:23,966
Hear that, baby?

547
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:26,209
You're my always.

548
00:41:34,938 --> 00:41:38,135
- l told you this wasn't over.
- No. The place is cracking!

549
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:40,937
lt's cracking! Cracking! No, no!

550
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:42,610
No, Tara, it's OK.

551
00:41:42,898 --> 00:41:44,695
Look at that. Look at that.

552
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:48,214
Oh, the light! Oh, it's so pure.

553
00:41:48,898 --> 00:41:51,776
Such pure green energy.

554
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:55,171
Oh, it's so beautiful.
