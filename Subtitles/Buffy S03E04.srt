1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,840
One night, after supper,

2
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,468
the lead dog turned up a snowshoe rabbit,

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,265
the dog lay down low to the race,
his body flashing forward, leap by leap,

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,852
He was sounding the deeps of his nature,

5
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:23,523
and the parts of his nature that were deeper
than he, going back into the wombs of time.

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,276
The rabbit could not...

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,612
OK, maybe we should try
a less stimulating passage.

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,826
- Private Harris reporting for Oz watch.
- Xander. Oh, good.

9
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:41,374
Oh! Call of the Wild, Aren't we reading
the Cliffs Notes to this for English?

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,462
Some of us are. Anyway,
it'll help you stay awake.

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,256
It's good and very wolfy.

12
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,342
It seems to soothe the savage beast.

13
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,720
Except for the parts about rabbits.

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:01,144
- Rabbits?
- It seems to make him a little overexcited.

15
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,397
OK, now he's had his two o'clock feeding,

16
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,525
and, after sunrise,
if he forgets where his clothes are,

17
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,195
they're on the file cabinet in his cage.

18
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,155
I put those towels up for privacy.

19
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,408
No worries.
I can handle the Oz full monty.

20
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,245
I mean, not "handle" handle,
like, hands to flesh "handle".

21
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:24,793
OK, it's not for you. It's for me, because
I'm still getting used to half a monty.

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,712
Oh, good. Half? You and Oz?

23
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,716
- Which half?
- Wouldn't you like to know!

24
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,803
He's more manageable tonight
and on the third night.

25
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,431
Tomorrow night, the full moon,
that's when he's a real woofer.

26
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,143
But in case there's trouble -
there won't be, but if...

27
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,896
Sleepy time. Gotcha.

28
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,150
Thanks again for this.
I wouldn't have asked, but I have this test.

29
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,529
No big. You can count on me.
I got my coffee, magazines.

30
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,866
Figured I'd read, maybe run the stairs
over there a little bit. I'm good.

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,790
Bye.

32

33
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,226
Nice place. D'you ever catch kids
doin' the dirty out here?

34
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,148
No. There's a smooch spot up by the woods.
That's usually where kids go.

35
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,609
Yeah? Bet you and Scott have been
up there kicking the gearshift.

36
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,613
- Hardly. We've only been on a few dates.
- But you like him.

37
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,577
And when you think about him,
you get that good down-low tickle, right?

38
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,996
Yeah, I guess.

39
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,665
- How low?
- You tell me.

40
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,751
How about not?

41
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,339
But he is nice and... he's funny.

42
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,966
And quite a muffin.

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,969
Blueberry, that crunchy-munchy stuff on top.

44
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:03,141
But my most favourite thing so far is that
he doesn't seem to be any kind of hell beast.

45
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,311
All men are beasts, Buffy.

46
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,773
OK. I was hoping to not get
that cynical till I was at least 40.

47
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,359
It's not cynical, it's realistic.

48
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:18,531
Every guy from Manimal down to "Mr I Loved
the English Patient" has beast in him.

49
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:23,745
And I don't care how sensitive they act.
They're all still just in it for the chase.

50
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,195
I don't think that's true,
that every guy is in it only for the chase.

51
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,616
- I know. It is an awful generalisation.
- Hey, Buffy!

52
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,539
That's what I stopped you for, basically. Hey.

53
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,374
OK. Hey.

54
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,754
- Howdy, Debbie.
- Hi, Oz. You're not doing jazz band this year?

55
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,383
Can't take the pressure. It's not the music
that's hard, it's the marching.

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,596
- We have a marching jazz band?
- Since the best jazz is improvisational,

57
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,892
we'd be going off in all directions,
banging into floats. It's scary.

58
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,645
- He's just being Oz.
- Pretty much full time.

59
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,940
- Those are pretty flowers.
- Pete brought them for me.

60
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,236
Yeah. I'm sure Scott does
that kind of stuff for you too, Buffy.

61
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,156
Well, we're not up to flowers.

62
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,658
Are we up to flowers? Did I miss flowers?

63
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,245
No, we're pre-posy.
Definitely. What time is it?

64
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,833
- Oh, I have to go see Mr Platt today.
- Platt, the school counsellor?

65
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,087
To convince him
I'm Little Miss Stable so I can stay.

66
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,588
Platt creeps me out.

67
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:44,219
I'd quit going, but I'm flunking senior bio
and my teacher says I have "success issues".

68
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,472
Senior bio? I kinda aced that final.

69
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,393
And how did you do that?
Oh, right, you showed up.

70
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,771
- If you want my notes, they're yours.
- That'd be great.

71
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,232
We'd better go.

72
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,567
- I'll see you?
- Yeah.

73
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,659
We have to recheck
every possible exit avenue.

74
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,078
It's a waste of time. I was here all night.

75
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,082
Right. It's good to see you. No need to panic.

76
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,212
- Just a thought: poker, not your game.
- What's the deal, Giles?

77
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,549
Now, bear in mind
most likely there is no deal.

78
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:29,055
But, if there was a deal, then it
would concern murder last night.

79
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,684
- A male student was found in the woods.
- Which student?

80
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,439
- Jeff Walken.
- Jeff? He was...

81
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,569
- I knew him.
- I'm afraid he was terribly mauled.

82
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,574
Now, much as I hate to think it,
it could be the handiwork of... of...

83
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,201
- Me.
- "Wolf' you, not "you" you.

84
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,705
But it's not. Not "wolf' you, not "you" you.

85
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,376
The room was secured, the gate was locked
and the window unbreakable and...

86
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,588
open.

87
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,423
Oh, God.

88
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,468
Not to freak. I rested my eyes
now and then. That's all.

89
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:11,348
How long, exactly, did you rest your eyes for?

90
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,559
A little now, a little then.

91
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,938
But I never heard Oz leave and he was
here in the morning when I... when I...

92
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,860
- Woke up!
- You could put it that way, Mr Technical.

93
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,909
Oh, God.

94
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,675
Two o'clock. Miss Summers.

95
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,762
Buffy Summers, reporting for sanity.

96
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,394
Look, I know that I have to do this, and
I'll cooperate and I'll look at your ink blots,

97
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,067
but I don't want to talk about my life
or my childhood, or anything for that matter.

98
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,362
And I don't want to be friends here.

99
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,990
We're not gonna be friends.

100
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,828
You have friends already. I hope.

101
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,747
I mean, friends are a good thing.

102
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,626
They like you, agree with you,
tell you what you want to hear.

103
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:29,843
It's not what you need. What you need
is a trained, not too crazy professional,

104
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,096
who will always give you
his honest opinion.

105
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,811
Which I offer you.

106
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,688
Have a seat.

107
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,277
"Not too crazy."

108
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,154
Those are your credentials?

109
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:55,869
Look, Buffy, any person...
grown-up, shrink, Pope...

110
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:02,042
any person who claims to be totally sane
is either lying or not very bright.

111
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,794
I mean, everyone has problems.

112
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,672
Everybody has demons, right?

113
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,092
I gotta say I'm with you on that.

114
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,552
Excellent.

115
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,556
So the hope I bring you is:
demons can be fought,

116
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,894
people can change, you can change.

117
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,189
Now, your turn.

118
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,359
Let's start with why you ran away.

119
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,527
That's a long story.

120
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,490
- Bore me.
- You know, I'm really over it.

121
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:37,077
I'm moving on, I feel good,
I'm even dating someone new.

122
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:43,249
All good things. But still, you're...
you're bringing me in at the end of the movie.

123
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,338
I was dating someone.

124
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,716
It ended badly.

125
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,968
My mom and I were fighting and I...

126
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,554
kinda freaked.

127
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,392
Tell me more about this guy,
the "bad ending" guy.

128
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,982
He was my first...

129
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,821
I loved him.

130
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,490
- And then he...
- Changed?

131
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,869
- Yeah.
- He got mean?

132
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,374
- Yes.
- And you didn't stop loving him.

133
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:32,090
Look, lots of people lose themselves in love.
It's no shame. They write songs about it.

134
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,344
The hitch is, you can't stay lost.

135
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,598
And sooner or later
you have to get back to yourself.

136
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,270
And if you can't?

137
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,273
If you can't,

138
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,403
well, love becomes your master,
and you're just its dog.

139
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,168
- I'm afraid to ask.
- Oz ate someone last night.

140
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,920
- He did not.
- Oz does not eat people.

141
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:16,051
It's more werewolf play. I bat you around
a bit, like a cat toy. I have harmless wolf fun.

142
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:21,681
Is it Oz's fault that people get cut to ribbons?
And maybe then he'll take a little nibble and...

143
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,851
- I'm not helping, am I?
- No.

144
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,647
- Oz may have got out of his cage last night.
- Maybe there's another werewolf.

145
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,068
Perhaps. But perhaps
it's something else entirely.

146
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,196
It's OK. We'll work together
and we'll figure this out.

147
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,866
Yes, Buffy, you... you patrol the woods.

148
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,619
The others, check out the morgue.

149
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,122
Right. We can see if it's a werewolf kill or not.

150
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,167
But what about Oz?

151
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,046
Well, I have some research materials
at home I need to look at.

152
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,799
We could ask Faith to watch over him.

153
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,011
You're having a slayer watch me?
Well, good, we're not over reacting.

154
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:10,814
OK. You know that things where you bail
in the middle of an upsetting conversation?

155
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,861
I have to do that. It's kinda dramatic, I know,
but sometimes it's a necessary guy thing.

156
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,074
And I want you to... do the guy thing, but...

157
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,516
Oz?

158
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,186
Get away from the cage.

159
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,565
What?

160
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,068
It's gonna happen soon.

161
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,949
Get away from me.

162
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,756
Oh, God.

163
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,591
Here, hold this.

164
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,060
We're doin' crime.
Don't sneak up during crime.

165
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,480
God, have a... OK. Scarred for life.

166
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,858
Oh, God.

167
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,028
Willow, how can you stand it?

168
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,114
Yeah, this guy is pretty barf-worthy.
Can't we be elsewhere?

169
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,658
Like, is Oz cleared or what, huh?

170
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:14,580
I'm not sure. There are a lot of incised
wounds, but they could be from anything.

171
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,916
Anything with big sharp teeth and vicious...

172
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,919
D'you want to go back to the car and wait?

173
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,422
No. God, I'm just saying...

174
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,509
Almost done. Let me just get a few stray
hairs. They could be from the attacker.

175
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,513
- Great. So we got everything we need?
- Yep, that's it.

176
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,269
OK, a little too much excitement
for the Willster here.

177
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,858
- It doesn't look good for Oz, does it?
- It really doesn't.

178
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,737
This guy was ripped apart
by a big wild animal.

179
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,679
Oh, Buffy. Are you OK?
What are you doing here?

180
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,974
Bleeding internally, but I'll live.

181
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,768
God, I'm sorry. I guess I didn't hear ya.

182
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,688
Figured as much. Ow, again.

183
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,526
Actually, I came to give you
the rest of the night off.

184
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,320
Get out of jail free, huh? How come?

185
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,657
I couldn't sleep.
Figured I'd cram for my French test.

186
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:18,245
That's cool. I was going crazy here, but
I can get in a few stakings before sunrise.

187
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,582
Knock yourself out. Not literally, though.

188
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,293
Yeah. Later.

189
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,382
Hey.

190
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,009
Hello.

191
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,556
Boy, Faith and her nutty books.

192
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,769
Exploring Demon Dimensions
and Mystery of Acathla,

193
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,023
Yeah, and she still listens
to heavy metal. Ricky-ticky.

194
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,150
Buffy?

195
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,367
What if... I told you that...

196
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,203
I had a dream about Angel,

197
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,040
and it brought up some questions?

198
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,253
I'd say it was to be expected.

199
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:53,966
It must have been some dream. I didn't think
you knew what a card index was for.

200
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,304
I dreamt that he came back.

201
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,684
Of course.

202
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,854
After Jenny was killed,

203
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:12,109
I had dreams that she was
still alive, that I saved her.

204
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,780
This was vivid. Really vivid.

205
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,743
Three dimensional,
Sensurround, the hills are alive.

206
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,123
- Do you believe it was a prophecy?
- No. I don't know. I...

207
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,502
I guess it just... it made me wonder.

208
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,842
Is there a chance, even, it could happen?

209
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,138
There's no record of anyone
returning from the demon dimension

210
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:46,518
once the gate was closed.
I can't imagine how it could happen or why.

211
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,857
Let's just pretend for a second that...

212
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,653
Angel somehow found his way
back to Sunnydale.

213
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,865
What would he be like?

214
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,785
I really can't say.

215
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:08,457
From what is known about the dimension,
it would suggest a world of brutal torment,

216
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,420
and time moves quite differently there, so...

217
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,756
I remember.

218
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,386
So he would have been down there
for hundreds of years.

219
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,638
Yes.

220
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,015
Of torture.

221
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:30,312
It would take someone of extraordinary
will and character to survive that,

222
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,190
and retain any semblance of self.

223
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,068
Most likely he'd be a monster.

224
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,822
A lost cause.

225
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,075
Maybe. Maybe not.

226
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,538
From my experience,
there are two types of monster.

227
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,501
The first can be redeemed, or,
more importantly, wants to be redeemed.

228
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,962
And the second type?

229
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,424
The second is void of humanity.

230
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,136
He cannot respond to reason

231
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,221
or love.

232
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,978
- I thought Faith was on duty.
- Oh, hey. Change of plans.

233
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,481
Glazed or cake?
It's fun to watch them make them.

234
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,818
They use this spritzy thing
and drop the batter...

235
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,611
Couldn't sleep, huh?

236
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,824
I've been to Mister Donut
since the TV did that snowy thing.

237
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,118
How come you're the wakey girl?

238
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,414
This time it's not your boyfriend
who's the cold-blooded...

239
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,459
Jelly donut?

240
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,712
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, uh...

241
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,883
- What happened with the body?
- Anyone? They're yummy delicious.

242
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,219
Well, come on. Was it werewolf?

243
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,848
- Was it a vampire?
- It wasn't conclusive.

244
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,351
How can it not be conclusive?
Was he bit?

245
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,562
- Let her finish, Buffy.
- No, it's just...

246
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,819
I'm sorry.

247
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,911
Buffy, over here.

248
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,790
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, I can't...

249
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,752
I can't back you on that lunch.
Nutritional demerits.

250
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,882
My stomach doesn't want hard food today.
But there's fruit in it.

251
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,259
Those are marshmallows.

252
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,095
Oh.

253
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,015
I'm really out of it today.
I didn't sleep well last night.

254
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,561
Don't tell Mr Platt you have insomnia.
He'll make you start a dream journal.

255
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:39,358
Like a Barbie thing? "How come Ken hasn't
come around since he got that earring?"

256
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,653
I never did it. He's a quack.

257
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,655
I kinda liked him.

258
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,450
Really? I guess he's kinda funny and stuff.

259
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,829
It's just, sometimes I just
don't like the things he says.

260
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,582
Oh, he definitely marched to the beat
of his own drummer.

261
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,335
Actually, he makes his own drums.

262
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,921
My mom says that therapy can be helpful.

263
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,716
But your mom has the wattage
of a Zippo lighter.

264
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,969
I hope you realise I don't know these people.

265
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:11,098
I thought you would like me better
if I had friends, so I hired them.

266
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,101
So...

267
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,312
I, uh... I wanted to tell you
that you look great today.

268
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:22,860
But now I want to raise that to amazing
because you didn't sleep well.

269
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,155
That's really sweet.

270
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:31,535
Uh, and I wish I didn't have to,
but I just remembered that I do, so, uh...

271
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,997
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

272
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:40,002
Check out Scotty liking
the manic-depressive chick.

273
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,338
Angel?

274
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,719
Do you understand me?

275
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,470
Debbie, come on. Just for a minute.

276
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:18,017
- I can't. I have to meet a friend.
- So you'll be late, but happy.

277
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,700
- No, no. Let's stay here.
- Relax. What's wrong with you today?

278
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,666
What is that?

279
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:47,046
- Nothing. Kiss me.
- No. Debbie, you did not drink that, did you?

280
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,631
Drink it? You know I didn't.

281
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,509
Debbie, what's going on?

282
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:02,186
Two o'clock, Buffy Summers, right? Wait.
Don't turn around. And don't say anything.

283
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,524
Just listen. And that's...
that's your thing, right?

284
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,862
There's something going on.

285
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:16,033
This story's probably gonna convince you
that I'm loony-bin material,

286
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,454
but... there's nobody else that I can talk to.

287
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,626
Not Willow and... not Giles. Nobody.

288
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,924
They... if they found out, they'd freak on me,
or they'd do something and...

289
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,930
I need help.

290
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,975
I just... I need to talk to someone.

291
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,107
I'm so scared.

292
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,902
It's this guy. He...

293
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,538
He's come back.

294
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:18,220
So, the bottle just jumped out of
the cabinet and spilled on its own?

295
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,266
Of course not. I was tying to get rid of it.

296
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:27,229
- You were trying to get rid of it?
- To help you. You know how you get.

297
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,276
You think this has anything
to do with how I get?

298
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:36,613
- Well, when you drink it...
- When I drink it, nothing, Debbie... nothing.

299
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:41,326
I don't need this any more, OK?
I am way, way past that now.

300
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,329
You see?

301
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,081
You see?

302
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,042
No more.

303
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,880
You could pour out everything I made
and it wouldn't help.

304
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,799
And you wanna know why?

305
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,218
You wanna know why?

306
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:04,433
Because all it takes now is you, Debbie.
You and your stupid, grating voice.

307
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:21,408
You're the reason I started the formulas
in the first place. To be the man you wanted.

308
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,369
And you pay me back how?

309
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,957
- By whoring around with other guys?
- No, I don't! I don't even look!

310
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:36,799
Is that something your shrink taught you,
Debbie, huh? Huh? To share?

311
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,760
To communicate? To piss me off?

312
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,601
Guess what? Even he's not going to listen
to your pathetic ramblings any more.

313
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,106
I am all you've got now, Debbie.

314
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,817
Do you hear me?

315
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,653
I am all you've got!

316
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,832
Oh, my God.

317
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,965
Debbie.

318
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,719
Listen.

319
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,304
You know you shouldn't make me mad.

320
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,307
Huh? You know what happens.

321
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,729
Debbie, please. Are you all right?

322
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,615
It's OK.

323
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,620
It's OK.

324
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,041
This creature is especially brutal.

325
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:56,211
The phrase coined by the coroner
when describing Platt was "puréed".

326
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,507
But he confirmed Platt was killed
shortly before Buffy found him.

327
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:04,470
- Which means he was killed during the day.
- Yes!

328
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:10,267
Sorry. I got... I've just been...
It's horrible. Horrible.

329
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,355
It's OK, Will. We're all glad Oz is off the hook.

330
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,817
Indeed. Shouldn't he be here by now?
Sunset's at 5:30.

331
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,536
Sorry I'm late.

332
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,747
Did you bring the notes?

333
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,333
Yeah. Um..

334
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,335
- You OK?
- What?

335
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,713
Oh, yeah. I'm such a klutz.

336
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,591
I...

337
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,678
Fell down? Hit your... eye?

338
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,556
Doorknob. I... thanks.

339
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,355
If you wanna talk...

340
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,195
- Thanks again for the notes.
- Yeah.

341
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,082
Our task now is to determine
what sort of killer.

342
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:19,003
Clearly we're looking for
a depraved, sadistic animal.

343
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,838
Present.

344
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,091
I may be a cold-blooded donut,
but my timing is impeccable.

345
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:29,596
But you aren't. It-it's a killer-in-the-day
monster. A hundred percent for sure.

346
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,476
- OK.
- I wish we had time to celebrate properly.

347
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:37,187
However, we have two victims.

348
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,940
Jeff Walken and now Platt.

349
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,609
Maybe there's something
they had in common.

350
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,237
Missing internal organs.

351
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:49,199
- Besides that.
- Debbie. Well, victim number one, Jeff?

352
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:54,329
- He was in jazz band. They horsed around.
- They were screwing?

353
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:59,126
I don't think so, but he hid
her music comp book once.

354
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:03,881
Debbie knew Platt. She was seeing him, and
way vocal about not having love for the guy.

355
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:08,344
Add this and stir. I just saw Debbie
sporting a nasty black eye.

356
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:13,932
OK, so pretend Debbie wanted Platt dead.
Maybe he fought back.

357
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,561
No. Platt was dead in an instant.

358
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:21,440
He didn't even drop his cigarette.

359
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,402
Now, what if Pete's the one
doling out the punishment?

360
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,324
- We should find them immediately.
- Debbie was in the quad.

361
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,161
We'll split up. Faith, you and I team.
Willow, stick with Buffy.

362
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,623
And I'll... go lock myself in the cage.

363
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,559
It's tricky covering a fresh shiner like that.

364
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,729
- You know what works?
- What?

365
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,981
Don't get hit.

366
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,030
What's going on? I'll bet the farm you know.

367
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:15,160
- You're wrong. I don't know anything.
- You wanna play "I have a secret"? Fine.

368
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,414
But people are dying here.

369
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,795
It... it's not his fault.

370
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:29,174
- He's not himself when he gets like this.
- You mean Pete?

371
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:35,055
It's me. I make him crazy. He just does what
he does because he loves me too much.

372
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:38,684
Weren't Mr Platt and Jeff
murdered by an animal?

373
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,603
Pete's not like other guys, is he, Debbie?

374
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,066
- I have got to go.
- You have to talk to us.

375
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:50,487
- We can't help you until you do.
- I didn't ask for your help.

376
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:55,075
When are you going to?
If Pete kills you, it'll pretty much be too late.

377
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:57,703
Debbie, we're running out of time.

378
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:15,054
- Where can we find him?
- I don't know.

379
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:18,724
- You're lying.
- What if I am? What are you going to do?

380
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,560
Wrong question.

381
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:27,316
Look at yourself.
Why are you protecting him?

382
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:32,029
Anybody who really loved you
couldn't do this to you.

383
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:38,118
Won't they take him someplace?

384
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,789
Probably.

385
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,957
I could never do that to him.

386
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,585
I miss everything.

387
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:51,840
Great. So, while you two live out your
Grimm fairy-tale, two people are dead.

388
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:56,220
Who's gonna be next?

389
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,938
Since when do you touch my girl?

390
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,526
Pete, this is kind of a bad time.

391
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:17,533
Well, I guess you didn't think about that
when you put the moves on Debbie.

392
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,577
We talked, yeah. But it was move-free.

393
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:26,500
About this cage? When that sun sets...

394
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,670
You won't be alive to see it.

395
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:39,722
I'm serious. Something's gonna happen
that you probably won't believe.

396
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,313
Or you might.

397
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:03,203
He does love me. He does love me.

398
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,665
This is useless. We have to go.
I have to find Pete.

399
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,127
He does love me. He does love me.

400
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:14,173
- I think we broke her.
- He does love me. He does love me.

401
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:17,343
I think she was broken before this.

402
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:30,439
Did you kiss that whore?
Huh? Did she like it?

403
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,870
Time's up. Rules change.

404
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,521
What was that?

405
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,275
Get the dart gun!

406
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,278
Hey, watch out!

407
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,782
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, right. Bloody priceless.

408
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:31,667
- You get the wolf.
- Got it.

409
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,467
Pete! You're all right!

410
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,179
God! You're all right. She almost shot you.

411
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,848
Did you see? I stopped her.

412
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:35,314
You have to leave.
Get out of Sunnydale. She knows.

413
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:40,069
How did she know, Debbie?
Did you run your big mouth?

414
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,155
No. She just knew.
It seemed like she just knew.

415
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:47,493
- So you filled in the blank.
- No! No!

416
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,038
But what did I expect
from a screw-up like you?

417
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,415
I didn't. Pete?

418
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,959
- You're nothing but a waste of space.
- No!

419
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:27,574
Oh, God.

420
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,087
Where's the gun?

421
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,215
Where's the gun?! Get off her!

422
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,136
Get the gun! Get the gun! Hurry!

423
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,564
All the same! You're all the same!

424
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,678
Buffy?

425
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,693
Buffy.

426
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:48,841
It's all over school,
what happened with Debbie and Pete.

427
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,301
Except for the "Pete was a monster" part.

428
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:55,639
A freshman told me that Pete had
eight café mochas and just lost it.

429
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:59,435
It's better than the oestrogen theory -
taking his mother's birth-control pills.

430
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:02,938
He didn't? Pete was a monster?
Where have I been?

431
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,066
In your special place,
which is why I adore you.

432
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,777
So what's the true story? What happened?

433
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:14,491
We got hold of Pete's lab books and stuff,
and Mr Science was doing a Jekyll-Hyde deal.

434
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:20,748
He was afraid Debbie would leave him, so
he mixed this potion to become más macho.

435
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:26,462
After a while, he didn't need the potion to
turn into a bad guy. He did it fine on his own.

436
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:30,382
So he wasn't under
the influence of anything?

437
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:32,843
Just himself.

438
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,474
I'll see you guys later.

439
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:42,811
Great. Now I'm gonna be stuck
with serious thoughts all day.

440
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:58,702
I don't know what to say that's not
gonna sound stupid or obvious.

441
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:05,959
I've been friends with them both
since before we started school.

442
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,129
Is there anything I can do?

443
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:14,134
Thanks. I'm gonna be OK.

444
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:19,473
It's just that you never really know
what's going on inside somebody.

445
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:23,811
I mean, you think...
if you care about them.

446
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:28,774
But you never really do.

447
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:39,451
Night came on, and a full moon
rose high over the trees,

448
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:44,039
lighting the land
till it lay bathed in ghostly day,

449
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:48,627
And the strain of the primitive
remained alive and active,

450
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:53,966
Faithfulness and devotion,
things born of fire and roof, were his;

451
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:58,762
yet he retained his wildness and wiliness,

452
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:04,226
And from the depths of the forest,
a call still sounded,

453
00:44:05,305 --> 00:44:11,768
