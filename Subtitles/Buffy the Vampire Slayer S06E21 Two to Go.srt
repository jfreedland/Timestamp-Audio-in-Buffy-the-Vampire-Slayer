1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,596
This is what happened this year:

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,188
Tomorrow night, we're bringing Buffy back.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,470
We're talking about raising the dead.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,388
I think I was in Heaven.
I was torn out of there by my friends.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,029
I'm headed back to England.
And I plan to stay.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,994
So you three have, what,
banded together to be pains in my ass?

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,997
We're your arch-nemesis... es.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,878
Willow, you are using too much magic.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,399
I don't think this is gonna work.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,192
Are you saying you're gonna leave me?

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,548
Willow has a problem.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,590
I need help.

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,914
We kissed, Buffy.

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,395
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,475
Are you afraid I'm gonna...

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,316
Things have changed.

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,159
The only thing that's different
is that I'm disgusted with myself.

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,918
It's over. I'm using you.

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,632
- We're getting married.
- Congratulations.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,716
Xander's missing? What do you mean?

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,991
I wish we could just go back
to the way things were before.

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,395
And I wish you were never born.

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,315
You left me, Xander, at the altar.

24
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,829
So you go out and bang
the first body you can find?

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,270
- It's good enough for Buffy.
- Shut up and leave her out of...

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,113
We can't ignore this behaviour.

27
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,549
Something needs to be done
before it spins out of control.

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,830
Can you just be kissing me now?

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,711
- Please...
- I'm gonna make you feel it.

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,590
Stop!

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,115
Ask me again why I could never love you.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,834
Get nice and comfy, Slayer. I'll be back.

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,872
You think you can just do that to me?

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,113
Tara? Tara?

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,355
Bring her back.

36
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,630
- It is done.
- No!

37
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,234
Something terrible has happened.
But you don't have to...

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,078
I need power.

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,918
What are you doing? She's gonna die.

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,519
No, she isn't.

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,835
We need to find Willow.

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,593
And you want to return to your former self?

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,233
Bitch is gonna see a change.

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,078
Let me go. Somebody!

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,633
Please! God!

46
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,716
Bored now.

47
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,919
Willow, what did you do?

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,792
One down.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

50
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,874
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Again?

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,636
Xander, we don't have time.

52
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,471
I know. It's just...
what happened back there.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,670
The sounds of it.

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,109
- The smell.
- I know.

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,715
- Willow did that.
- That's why we have to keep moving.

56
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,956
You heard what she said: "One down. "

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,959
She was talking about two to go, right?
Jonathan and... the other guy.

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,674
Andrew. They're in jail
with no clue she's coming.

59
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,519
You don't think she's gonna
kill them too? She wouldn't.

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,474
She has an addictive personality. She just
tasted blood. She may be there already.

61
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,388
No, she couldn't. A witch at her level?
She can only go airborne.

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,752
It's a thing. More flashy, impresses
the locals, but it does take longer.

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,758
- Longer than what?
- Teleporting.

64
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,955
Right. Vengeance demon.
Well, at least she'll get there first.

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,150
I'm counting the ways that can go wrong.

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,955
- Anya can handle herself.
- Against Willow tonight? Don't be too sure.

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,992
Well, she should come down
at some point, shouldn't she?

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,715
I mean, back there she was out of her head.
Running on grief and magics.

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,274
It doesn't matter.
Willow just killed someone.

70
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,198
Killing people changes you.
Believe me, I know.

71
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,709
Warren was a cold-blooded killer
just warming up.

72
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,513
- If you ask me, the bastard had it coming.
- Maybe.

73
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,790
Andrew and Jonathan don't.

74
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,415
This is still Willow we're dealing with,
right?

75
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,050
I hope so.

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,389
Whatever she's going through,
we must stop her.

77
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,080
Maybe we can actually do that
if we can get to your...

78
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,558
- car.
- Willow.

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,275
I guess she wants to finish the job
without us tagging along.

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,358
- Meet me at the jail.
- Sure. How are you gonna...

81
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,394
OK, then. I'll just catch up.

82
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,995
She's only my best friend, you know.
No big deal, just...

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,316
glad I can help.

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,800
Dude, move, like, a foot to your left.

85
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,556
What for?

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,319
- I'm trying to hear something.
- Like what?

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,752
Signals.

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,110
For crying out loud. Signals?

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,913
Who from, your probe-happy alien friends?

90
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,555
Say, maybe we can trade
a pack of cigarettes in for tin foil.

91
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,355
- Make you a nice little antenna hat.
- Laugh it up, fuzzball.

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,356
I figured it out. Warren never abandoned us.

93
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,916
Well, not me, anyway.

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,953
This is like his test. If we can figure out
how he's communicating with us,

95
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,435
then we'll be... you know, worthy.

96
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,790
You're checking for implants?

97
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,993
Lex Luthor had a false-epidermis escape kit
in Superman vs the Amazing Spider-Man.

98
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,148
First of all, those were sonic disrupters.
Second of all, you are sadness personified.

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,118
Waiting for Warren?

100
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,949
Yeah, maybe he'll come bust us
outta here in Santa's magic sleigh.

101
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,834
- I'm telling him you said that.
- Why wait? Tell him right now.

102
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,669
- Warren, your girlfriend's pathetic. Over.
- Shut up, Jerkathan.

103
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,109
You see this? This is why we get jet packs

104
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,196
and all you get is left behind.

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,309
- So you admit it?
- Why not?

106
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,790
You were out of the trail a long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away.

107
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,195
And you wanna know why, little fella?

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,070
No respect for the chain of command.

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,185
See how far it's gotten you?

110
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:37,793
Checking every hole in your sad
little body for transmitters.

111
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,310
I'll find it if I have to check
every hole in my body and yours.

112
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,035
- Get off!
- Make me!

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,949
- There you two are.
- You do that?

114
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,075
Listen. We have to get you out of here
or you'll both be killed. Guard!

115
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,758
- What's goin' on?
- Guard!

116
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,634
Stop that. I don't trust her.
Do you trust her? This is major uncool.

117
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,070
Anya, you're gonna have to
break this down for us a little.

118
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,149
Warren shot Buffy. Warren shot Tara.
Buffy's alive. Tara's dead.

119
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,238
Willow found out and,
as the most powerful Wicca in the West,

120
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,193
decided to get the payback, with interest.

121
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,114
What about Warren?

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,869
She killed him. Ripped him apart
and bloodied up the forest doing it.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,389
Now she's coming here
and the two of you are next.

124
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,479
- Oh, my God. Warren.
- Oh, my God. Me.

125
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,555
- Guard!
- We didn't do anything.

126
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,636
Guard!

127
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,591
All right, all right. What do you...

128
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,430
- Who the hell are you?
- Something's coming. Something bad.

129
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,473
You have to let these men out of here
or I guarantee there will be hell to pay.

130
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,433
OK. What exactly is coming?

131
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,438
One of the many things in this world
you are not prepared for.

132
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,949
- Is that a fact?
- Yes. We're running out of time.

133
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,500
So believe me when I tell you
these things are real,

134
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:57,154
they're dangerous, and they're coming.

135
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,036
What the hell was that?

136
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,036
- I don't know what you're doing, but...
- Take a nap.

137
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,116
So please stop looking at me like it's your
first trip to the circus and let them out.

138
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,919
- You three stay here.
- Like we have a choice.

139
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,190
Don't move. You'll be safe here.

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,912
Are you listening?
This is the one place they won't be safe.

141
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,596
Back off.

142
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,276
Hold it.

143
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,673
Stop it. Just stop. Why is she doing this?
Tell her we didn't do anything.

144
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,793
Yes, we did. We teamed up. We wanted
to see where our plans would take us.

145
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,151
- Well, take a look. This is it.
- Maybe for you.

146
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,956
Anya, teleport us out of here, please.
Take us with you.

147
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,116
I can't. It doesn't work that way.

148
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,714
Oh, God. Help!

149
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,796
Move!

150
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,594
Buffy.

151
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,110
Willow, just stop for
a second and listen to...

152
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,676
What's that sound? God, it kills.

153
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,276
- We have to make a run for it.
- She's like Dark Phoenix up there.

154
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,358
- You expect us to just outrun her?
- Pretty much.

155
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,396
Get in.

156
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,716
Go, go!

157
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,391
- Is she coming?
- I don't see anything.

158
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,671
Are you guys all right? Are you injured?

159
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,277
- I don't think so.
- Where are you taking us?

160
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,398
We'll keep you someplace safe
until we can stop Willow.

161
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,876
- Run and hide? That's your brilliant plan?
- I don't believe this.

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,602
Boys, knock it off, or I will
pull over and you can just...

163
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,028
walk to your painful deaths from here.

164
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,643
I don't get it. Willow's a witch.
Why doesn't she just...

165
00:11:43,678 --> 00:11:45,678
wave her arms and make us dead?

166
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,439
She doesn't want you dead.
She wants to kill you.

167
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,630
But we didn't do anything.

168
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,953
I hate to admit it, Buff,
but Jonathan may have a point.

169
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,150
Why isn't she right here right now?

170
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,797
Maybe she's just getting
her mojo up and running.

171
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,549
Or maybe she hasn't figured out
exactly how much power she really has yet.

172
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,638
- Neither have we.
- Guess we keep running, then.

173
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,110
I still can't believe that was Willow.

174
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,834
I mean, I've known her
almost as long as you guys.

175
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,155
Willow was... you know.

176
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,195
She packed her own lunches and wore floods
and was always... just Willow.

177
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,870
- Jesus.
- What was that?

178
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,836
Just Willow.

179
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,914
- OK, any ideas?
- Drive faster.

180
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,876
This is faster.

181
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,794
She knows you're in this car too, right?

182
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,956
Right?

183
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,629
- She's draining.
- She's what-ing?

184
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,476
Just keep going.

185
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,756
Cool.

186
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,669
Not that I'm knockin' the nacho cheese ones.

187
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,270
I like the taste.
It's just the texture I can't deal with.

188
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,110
So gritty.

189
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,037
Kinda hurts my tongue.

190
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,153
So, I give 'em a seven. Maybe a seven-five.

191
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,555
And you think this is dumb, don't you?

192
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,394
No.

193
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,433
No. As taste tests go, this is definitely
one of the better ones I've been to.

194
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,710
I get it. No biggie.

195
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,231
You wanna play cards? I can be a real
boredom-buster if you just give me a chance.

196
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,830
- It's not you.
- Still, I feel responsible.

197
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,350
It's not fair. A girl your age
cooped up in a crypt.

198
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,117
Tell you what. Let me get my hat and coat.
I'll take you to a movie. We'll go nuts!

199
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,037
PG-13.

200
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,280
Clem, look at me. Do I look
weak to you, or incapable?

201
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,551
- Heck, no.
- So why am I stuck here?

202
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,230
No good reason I can see.

203
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,278
I'm still real sorry about what happened.

204
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,756
If there's anything I can do to help,
just name it.

205
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,590
Anything?

206
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,838
Oh. You're not gonna go and get yourself
in trouble now, are you? Or me?

207
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,891
Cos your sister's the Slayer. I'm a demon.

208
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,556
That's a real good incentive
to get along with her.

209
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,035
I need a demon to help me.

210
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,199
- Spike would have.
- Spike's gone.

211
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,433
You understand, then?

212
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,351
Yeah. It's not like you haven't been
clear about it, O great mysterious one.

213
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,827
This is a test. I don't get what I want
unless I pass it.

214
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:51,918
That about the size and shape?

215
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,268
Yes.

216
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,873
Since your pad is decked
out gladiator-style,

217
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:58,679
and no No. 2 pencils have been provided,

218
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,837
I guess we're not starting with the written.

219
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,795
Oh, here we go, then!

220
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,309
Just me and the walking action figure.

221
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,512
I'm venturing this is
a "kill or be killed" situation?

222
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,710
To the death.

223
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,875
Right.

224
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,193
Here we are now. Entertain us.

225
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,352
Son of a...

226
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,994
Rack's place was around here last time.

227
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,475
I don't feel anything.
Oh, not here. Let's go.

228
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,273
You don't feel anything
because his place moves.

229
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,949
Know why Rack moves all the time?
Because he's shady.

230
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,992
- A bad element comes down here.
- I get that.

231
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,192
But Willow's part of it now.
She is the element.

232
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,039
If she isn't around,
Rack may know where she is,

233
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,596
- which is why we need to talk to him.
- We? In a face-to-face way?

234
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,599
- Or me. I'll go in there without you.
- No, it's fine. I'm good. It's just...

235
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,679
Rack's not partial to the floppy-eared.
He has a thing.

236
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,189
But, hey. I'm in, absolutely.

237
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,230
Either way. Just get me there.

238
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,480
Say Rack does know,
he won't tell you for nothing.

239
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,160
- He's gonna want something.
- I have money.

240
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,352
That's not the something he'll want.
He likes little girls.

241
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,076
I am not a little girl.

242
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:22,234
I don't know if you've thought this through.

243
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,272
I'm supposed to keep you safe,
and this whole thing is...

244
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,599
I mean, even if you find Willow,
you really think you can stop her?

245
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,710
Thanks for getting here so fast. Big help.

246
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,150
Once again, Xander in need of big help.

247
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,272
Whatever. So, can you still sense Willow?

248
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,029
Knowing her location would be
a real big comfort right about now.

249
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,994
No, I can't. Which means she's gone
way beyond simple vengeance.

250
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,473
Did I mention the comfort?

251
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,149
Whatever we got, grab it fast.
This is the first place she'll look for us.

252
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,377
Then why are we here? I could summon
a demon that would kill her.

253
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,431
I could smack your eyes
out of their sockets.

254
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,798
No one is getting killed. Sit down.

255
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,270
We need to find some magics to stop Willow,
or at least slow her down.

256
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,595
She drained the place. Took everything.

257
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,075
- Not everything.
- What is it?

258
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,392
A book of protection spells.
Anti-magic. Our last resort.

259
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,756
You think you can work this stuff?

260
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,409
OK. Well, good news is, the text is intact.

261
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,455
Bad news is, I can't read a word of it.

262
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:33,270
It's, like, in ancient Sumerian
or something.

263
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,470
- Could I take a look at it?
- Shut up.

264
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,876
Right.

265
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,118
I just thought,
as long as you're protecting us...

266
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,676
I'm not protecting you, Jonathan.
None of us are.

267
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,793
We're doing this for Willow. The only reason
it happens to be your lucky day

268
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,277
is because, if Willow kills you,
she crosses a line, I lose a friend.

269
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,353
- And I hate losing.
- I get that.

270
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,837
It's just... You know she's
running out of power, right? I can tell.

271
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,799
I can practically feel it.
I've dabbled in magics.

272
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,312
I think Willow's in a league
of her own now, dabble boy.

273
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,238
But still, running that hot for that long,

274
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,069
at some time you gotta recharge,
no matter how juiced up you are.

275
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,953
Thank you. Now, remember
that thing we talked about?

276
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,957
About me shutting up?

277
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,036
Right.

278
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,516
Buffy.

279
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,319
Buffy, let's say this works and we stop
Willow working the hoodoo for a minute.

280
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,829
- What then?
- I talk to her.

281
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,153
Great. And say what?

282
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,789
Look, whatever she's gonna do,
she starts with those two.

283
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,596
They're the line she cannot cross.

284
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,510
And if she is running low on magics,

285
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,757
she's probably somewhere right now
trying to get it all back.

286
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,436
Hey, babe.

287
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,310
I've been waitin' for you.

288
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,556
Guess the rehab didn't take, huh?
That's the way it goes sometimes.

289
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,595
But I gotta say,

290
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,429
I could feel you comin' a mile away,
the power you got.

291
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,394
And you know something, sweetness?

292
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,476
I liked it.

293
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,952
When you first came to me,
you were just a little slip of a girl.

294
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,236
Look at you now. So... growed-up.

295
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,990
Just full of dark juice.

296
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,909
And you still taste like strawberries.

297
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,470
Only now...

298
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,430
you're ripe.

299
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,318
You came because
you want something, don't you?

300
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,714
I thought so.

301
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,633
So tell me, strawberry.

302
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,960
What on this earth do you want?

303
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,755
Just to take a little tour.

304
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,800
Yay, Clem. Makin' with the demon senses.

305
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,876
I knew you could find this place.

306
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,791
- It's not very clean.
- Don't wig out on me again.

307
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,390
It's just... I'm still not so sure
you should be here.

308
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,912
- I'm not so sure I should be here.
- It'll only take a minute. Come on.

309
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,070
- You wanna wait here?
- If that works for you.

310
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,156
Be right back.

311
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,236
Willow?

312
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,916
Hey, cutie.

313
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,885
Dawnie, what are you doing here?

314
00:23:02,886 --> 00:23:06,030
Cos if you're lookin' for
me, now's not a great time.

315
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,993
- You look terrible.
- Do I?

316
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,957
- You're back on the magics.
- No, honey. I am the magics.

317
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,755
Did you kill that guy?

318
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,795
It's an improvement, believe me.

319
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,876
I have to go.

320
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,990
Why? So you can run and tell Buffy?

321
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,312
Willow, please just listen to me.

322
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,797
You don't have to talk.
Just think real loud. I can hear you.

323
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,115
- You're freaking me out.
- Don't be like that.

324
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,435
I'm just a little wired.

325
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,235
And I have some things to do.
I thought if anybody'd understand...

326
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,749
I miss Tara, too.

327
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,513
But this? What you're doing here?

328
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,713
This is not the way to go.
You're only going to make things worse.

329
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,756
But I promise, it's not too late...

330
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,952
- You miss her?
- Yes.

331
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,875
Did you cry?

332
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,880
Of course you did. I get that.

333
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,237
I understand the crying.
You cry because you're human.

334
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,715
But you weren't always.

335
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,990
Yes, I was.

336
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,275
No, please. You're telling me
you don't remember?

337
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,756
You used to be some mystic ball of energy.

338
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,237
Maybe that's why you're
crying all the time, Dawnie.

339
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,635
Cos you don't belong here.

340
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,672
Wanna go back? End the pain?

341
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,434
You'll be happier. I'll be happier.

342
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,236
We'll all be a lot happier
without listening to the constant whining.

343
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,594
Willow, stop.

344
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,109
"Mom! Buffy! Tara!"

345
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,315
It's time you go back
to being a little energy ball.

346
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,150
No more tears, Dawnie.

347
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,151
I think you need to get away from her.

348
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,036
- You're too close.
- How am I supposed to read?

349
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,472
I don't know. I'm staring right at
this stuff and I can't read it.

350
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,876
Well, how's the translation coming?
What have we got so far?

351
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,074
So far we've got "the".

352
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,715
Well, either "the" or "towards",
I'm not really sure.

353
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,391
I can't do this. I'm in retail.
Stupid ancient Sumerian.

354
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,718
I'm pretty sure it's Babylonian. The text
is similar, but the dialect is different.

355
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,752
Great. Babylonian. Thanks a bushel.

356
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,555
But, unless you can read Babylonian,
why don't you sit back down?

357
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,794
- Why are you helping them?
- Because they're saving our lives, moron.

358
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,034
And what then? Even if they kill that Wicca
bitch, you think they're gonna let us walk?

359
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,628
- They own us.
- So what do you want me to do?

360
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,031
Look around. You know magic.
We're in a magic shop.

361
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,891
We can take them.

362
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,697
The books are sucked dry, but so what?

363
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:17,633
There's still tons of supplies
all around us.

364
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,479
This is our best chance we're gonna get
to make it out of here.

365
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,512
- And do what?
- Start over.

366
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,870
We can be a duo. You and me.

367
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,713
You can even be the leader.
I swear I'll take orders.

368
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,310
I like taking orders.
Just tell me what to do.

369
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,476
You want an order?

370
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,800
Grow up.

371
00:26:42,858 --> 00:26:45,395
Play nice or you'll break our concentration.

372
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,317
Which means no protection spell.

373
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,716
And Willow will make
you two boneless chickens skinless too.

374
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,195
And then what?

375
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,278
You think your little witch buddy's
gonna stop with us?

376
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,836
You saw her.
She's a truck-driving magic momma.

377
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,635
We've got seconds before Darth Rosenberg
grinds us into Jawa burgers,

378
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,309
and not one of you bunch
has the midichlorians to stop her.

379
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,633
You've never had
any tiny bit of sex, have you?

380
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,436
The annoying virgin has a point.

381
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,472
What if Willow filets their souls
and comes after us?

382
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,194
- She won't.
- You don't know that.

383
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,199
We're her friends, Anya. Her family.
She would never hurt us.

384
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,232
She tried to use you
for a hood ornament, Xander.

385
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,669
She doesn't care if you live or die.

386
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,430
I guess you two finally
have something in common.

387
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,992
I care if you live or die, Xander.
I'm just not sure which one I want.

388
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,755
Again with the comfort.

389
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,634
Look, we both know things
might get ugly at Wiccapalooza.

390
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,435
- And if it gets really bad...
- Let me guess. You'll propose?

391
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,395
I need to know if you're gonna turn on me.

392
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,956
Use this little shindig as an excuse
for some sweet revenge.

393
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,629
There is nothing in this world
that would give me greater satisfaction

394
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,638
than to wreak bloody vengeance
upon you, Xander Harris.

395
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,150
But I can't. Not officially. Not magically.

396
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,798
So smile. It's your lucky day.
You got away with it. I can't hurt you.

397
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,629
You varnishing the table with Spike,
how could that possibly have hurt?

398
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,355
- It may have chafed.
- That wasn't vengeance.

399
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,436
It was solace.

400
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,911
Look,

401
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,636
I really can't hurt you, so I'm just gonna
have to settle for hating you.

402
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,877
- If that's what you need to do.
- Don't play the martyr.

403
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,232
- I'm not.
- This wouldn't be happening but for you.

404
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,669
You think I don't know that?

405
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,268
You think I'm the hero of this piece?

406
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,595
I saw the gun.

407
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,829
Before Warren raised it,
I saw it and I couldn't move.

408
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,876
He shot two of my friends...
before I could even...

409
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,798
You want me to know how useless I am?
That it's my fault?

410
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,877
Thanks. I already got the memo.

411
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,630
I was talking about us.

412
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,195
You need to back down a minute
and think, Will.

413
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,993
I wasn't gonna hurt her, buzzkill.

414
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,111
She tried to turn me back.

415
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,879
You're attacking the people
who love you now?

416
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,639
Only the ones in my way.

417
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,832
That's not... You need help.

418
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,315
I'm doing fine on my own, thanks.

419
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,432
Dawn, get out of here. Go.

420
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,554
Don't. We're all friends.

421
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,030
Willow, I know what you wanna do,
but you have to listen to me.

422
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,152
The forces inside you
are incredibly powerful.

423
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,475
They're strong, but you're stronger.

424
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,829
You have to remember you're still Willow.

425
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,348
Let me tell you somethin' about Willow.

426
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,233
She's a loser, and she always has been.

427
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,954
People picked on Willow
in junior high school,

428
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,152
high school, up until college,

429
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,714
with her stupid, mousy ways.

430
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,518
And now... Willow's a junkie.

431
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,039
- I can help.
- The only thing Willow was ever good for...

432
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,435
The only thing I had going for me...

433
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,430
were the moments...

434
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,190
just moments when Tara would
look at me and I was wonderful.

435
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,672
And that will never happen again.

436
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,790
I know this hurts... bad.

437
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,513
But, Willow, if you let loose
with the magics, it'll never end.

438
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,995
- Promise?
- You don't want that.

439
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,237
- Why not?
- Because you'll lose everything.

440
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,669
Your friends. Yourself.

441
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,270
Willow, if you let this control you, then
the world goes away, and all of us with it.

442
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,356
There's so much to live for.

443
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,992
Will, there's too much...

444
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,998
Please! This is your pitch?

445
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,592
Buffy, you hate it here as much as I do.
I'm just more honest about it.

446
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,429
- That's not true.
- You're trying to sell me on the world?

447
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,030
The one where you lie to your friends
when not trying to kill them,

448
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,391
you screw a vampire just to feel,

449
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,398
and insane asylums
are the comfy alternative?

450
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,835
This world? Buffy, it's me.

451
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,554
I know you were happier
when you were in the ground.

452
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,878
The only time you were ever at peace
in your whole life was when you were dead.

453
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,232
Until Willow brought you back,
you know... with magic.

454
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,716
Sorry, the trip can be kinda rough
if you're, you know... not me.

455
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,870
Dawn.

456
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,109
Jonathan. Andrew.

457
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,270
You boys like magic, don't you?

458
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,956
Abracadabra.

459
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,354
OK. Didn't see that coming.

460
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,153
- What was that?
- We're alive.

461
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,635
You guys wanna take it slow?

462
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,513
I can do that too. Ask Warren.

463
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,273
Don't.

464
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,476
Let's get outta here.

465
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,508
No, no. Stay.

466
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,915
I mean, we're just getting started.

467
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,711
I've got big party plans.

468
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,552
- Will.
- No, don't.

469
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,196
Guys, come on. I'm just getting
the wood for the violence here.

470
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,233
And you know what they say:
If at first you don't succeed...

471
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,515
Had enough?

472
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,631
Bad move, bad move, bad move.

473
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,068
Looks like local boy loses.

474
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,515
So it would appear.

475
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,676
Good on me, then.

476
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,633
I get what I came for. I passed, right?

477
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,039
Indeed. You have passed
the first stage of the test.

478
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,116
Right. I get it.

479
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,753
Wait. First stage?

480
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,028
Bugger.

481
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,317
Damn, that is one effective counterspell.

482
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,390
- Won't keep you alive, though.
- Will, stop. You need to give this up now.

483
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,718
I get it. You boys put a spell
on yourselves, didn't you?

484
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,391
Protecting you from harm,
from magics. That's cute.

485
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,433
Will, back off before somebody gets hurt.

486
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,676
How about I back off right after?

487
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,872
So, which one of you boys worked the mojo?

488
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,557
Doesn't matter really.
I just... I'm curious.

489
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,590
Just because I can't do magics to you
doesn't mean I can't do them on myself.

490
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,958
Now I'm pretty sure I'm strong enough
to beat you to death.

491
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,356
I don't wanna hurt you.

492
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,549
Not a problem.

493
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,397
I said I didn't want to.

494
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,036
Didn't say I wouldn't.

495
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,673
- Let's go.
- What about Willow?

496
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,916
- Buffy can handle her.
- Are you sure?

497
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,713
No. That's why we're leaving. An.

498
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,354
I can't. I have to keep
the spell going on Willow.

499
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,755
- No, but...
- Go. Do something right.

500
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,676
No.

501
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,394
So, here we are.

502
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,590
Are we really gonna do this?

503
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,871
Come on. This is a huge deal for me.

504
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,232
Six years as a sideman,
now I get to be the Slayer.

505
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,959
A killer isn't a slayer. Being a slayer
means something you can't conceive of.

506
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,111
Oh, Buffy.

507
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,479
You really need to have
every square inch of your ass kicked.

508
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,398
Then show me what you got,
and I'll show you what a slayer really is.

509
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,714
- Where are you taking us?
- Someplace safe.

510
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,990
- Like where?
- Xander?

511
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,873
I don't know.

512
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,551
Get off, superbitch.

513
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,157
I can help you stop.

514
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,157
You were gonna show me what a slayer was.

515
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,595
I can't run any more.

516
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,676
Need to... breathe.

517
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,040
If you wanna keep breathing,
you gotta keep moving.

518
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,879
This is bogus.
We've gotta get out of this town.

519
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,594
Mexico. We should go to Mexico.

520
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,790
Hey, you're not goin' anywhere.

521
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,232
We've gotta hide you until
we get the all clear from Buffy.

522
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,275
What if the Slayer's dead already? We just
wait for Sabrina to come and disembowel us?

523
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,233
- You do what I say to do.
- I don't think so.

524
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,955
Well, hey. Isn't that interesting?
Anya's still here.

525
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,037
Looks like I've been beatin' on
the wrong gal.

526
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,438
OK, Andy. Let's just put the sword down.

527
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,348
No way. I'm not gonna die
because of something I didn't even do.

528
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,236
You're not gonna die.

529
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,957
Leave him alone.

530
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,436
Let him go, Andrew.

531
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,112
You heard me.

532
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,757
- You let me go first.
- Him.

533
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,876
- It's your move.
- No. Yours.

534
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,871
I'm not moving.

535
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,513
I'm not gonna budge till...

536
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,710
right now.

537
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,669
Xander's right. We're not leaving Sunnydale.

538
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,634
When this is over, you and I
are going back to jail to do our time.

539
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,276
Help me!

540
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,384
Help me!

541
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:47,316
You can't block my spells
if you can't chant.

542
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,199
And you can't chant if you're sleeping.

543
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,670
Buffy, I gotta tell ya, I get it now.

544
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,316
The Slayer thing
really isn't about the violence.

545
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,830
It's about the power.

546
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,154
And there's no one in the world
who has the power to stop me now.

547
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,470
I'd like to test that theory.

548
