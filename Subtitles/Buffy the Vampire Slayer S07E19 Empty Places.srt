00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:04,853
<i>- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>
- Get me out of here!

2
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:06,890
- Call me Caleb.
- l'm Shannon.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:11,525
l want you to deliver a message for me.
lt's for the one and only, the original Slayer.

4
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:18,410
Hey. Got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?

5
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:22,885
- Hello, Faith.
- l guess "wanted" wasn't really accurate.

6
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:26,853
l have a mission to save the world.
l don't have time for vendettas.

7
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:28,845
The mission is what matters.

8
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:32,483
l think you've taught me
everything l need to know.

9
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,213
- l heard you have something of mine.
- l do now.

10
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:42,127
No!

11
00:00:42,214 --> 00:00:43,408
Get them outta here.

12
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:45,212
l work in mysterious ways.

13
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:49,931
- Argh!
- <i>(Buffy)</i> Xander!

14
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:55,089
<i>(child)</i> l don't wanna leave.

15
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:57,165

17
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,609
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

18
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:18,924
Can you believe this mishegaas?

19
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:22,404
You'd think these people had
never seen an apocalypse before.

20
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:27,090
What about you? Just going
for a quick spin to 7-Eleven...

21
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:29,051
in Nebraska?

22
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:32,414
lt's gettin' bad here. Really bad.

23
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:36,612
Hellmouth acting up again.
People feeling it, getting crazier.

24
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:40,733
You can't swing a cat without
hittin' some kind of demonic activity.

25
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:43,806
Not that l swing cats... or eat... Nope.

26
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:46,692
Cuttin' way back.

27
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,730
Cholesterol... Morals.

28
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:51,369
- l mean morals.
- Right.

29
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:55,609
We've seen some bad stuff
in this town before, but, you know...

30
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:59,369
this time it's like itjust seems
different, more powerful.

31
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:02,651
l don't think anyone's
gonna be able to stop it.

32
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:08,013
l mean, l'm sure you'll do fine.
Complete confidence in you.

33
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,803
lf anyone can do it, you can,
because you... rock!

34
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:14,692
lf you save the world, we'll have drinks.

35
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:19,529
When... When, l mean.
When you save the world.

36
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:23,289
lt's gonna be great with all the... rocking.

37
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:28,332
Maybe... you should
just get outta town this time.

38
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:33,406
Yeah. l probably should.

39
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:38,042
You take care of yourself, OK?

40
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,051
Bye.

41
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:49,129
- Thank you, Officer. We appreciate your help.
- Oh, no. Thank you, lnspector.

42
00:03:49,214 --> 00:03:54,652
We don't get a lot of contact with lnterpol, so
we're happy to help. ls there anything else?

43
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,043
No. Thank you, we're fine.

44
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:59,967
Right. Because...

45
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:03,524
- Wait. Who are you?
- l'm with the inspector.

46
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:09,524
You're with the inspector. Right. We don't
get a lot of contact with lnterpol, so...

47
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,605
A single step!

48
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:15,130
A single step, and it is upon us.

49
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,693
lt is nigh!

50
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:20,210
- From beneath you it...
- Nutcase.

51
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,808
- <i>(punching)</i>
- Ow.

52
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,885
People are actin' up, gettin' nuts.

53
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:29,809
Let us know if you need help with your guy,
cos we are itchin' to hand out some justice.

54
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,772
He doesn't seem like much of a threat.

55
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:33,843
And you are...?

56
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:40,169
l think it's time we were
catching our flight to... lnterpol.

57
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:43,166
Right. OK.

58
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:47,167
Good idea. My control was fading.
What's up with those cops?

59
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:52,248
Oh, same as everyone.
The Hellmouth is active again.

60
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,087
Come on. l wanna get back to Xander.

61
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:59,963
- Who was that?
- Um... l don't know.

62
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:02,614
- Did you get one of these yet?
- No. What is that?

63
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:05,686
Fugitive. Ran to ground
right here in our own backyard.

64
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:10,564
Yeah? Sounds like a situation
that needs some justice.

65
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,931
You should expect some bruising
when you remove the bandages.

66
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,847
Bruising around the... area.

67
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:21,610
The bone structure and musculature
was hit pretty hard.

68
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:24,132
OK.

69
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:28,446
Also they said that the meds
may cause you some stomach discomfort,

70
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:31,890
so we're gonna have to be
careful with your diet.

71
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:34,534
l can't taste anything right now anyway.

72
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:38,766
l keep waiting for my other senses
to improve 50 per cent.

73
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,845
That should kick in any day now.

74
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:45,331
We're looking at a possible release
as early as tonight.

75
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:49,407
We're waiting for your labs, and Dr Calid
said that should be a couple of hours.

76
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:52,046
That's great.

77
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:56,362
OK. l think we're all caught up.

78
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:58,968
Thank you for this.
This was really great work.

79
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:01,727
Oh. l thought we were gonna...

80
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:06,045
There were gonna be card games.

81
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:13,686
l know. l just... l should really get back.
l wanna get everyone started on this.

82
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,572
l think we're really close to something.

83
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:20,891
lt's OK. lt's gotta be done.

84
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:24,170
And l might see you tonight.

85
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:27,929
Without depth perception, of course,
but still...

86
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,732
So l guess you're stuck with me then.

87
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:39,683
Let's order some
cherry-flavoured off-brand gelatin,

88
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,607
and then l think we'll be up
for a rousing game of...

89
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,208
- l might need a parrot.
- Huh?

90
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:48,047
To go with the eye patch.
To really complete the look.

91
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:51,012
l think l still have
that costume from Halloween.

92
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:54,769
Yeah, and don't underestimate
the impact of a peg leg.

93
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:57,368
Maybe the hospital
can hook you up with a nice one.

94
00:06:57,454 --> 00:07:00,730
Maybe they have a "two body parts
for the price of one" deal.

95
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:02,770
You know the best part?

96
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:05,687
No one will ever
make me watch <i>Jaws 3-D</i> again.

97
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:08,846
Yeah, and... you'll never have to...

98
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:19,285
Oh, Willow...

99
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,565
Please don't.

100
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:37,087
So we know that a battle is coming.
Ubervamps galore.

101
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:40,325
We also know that the Ubervamps
are hard to kill.

102
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:42,882
Hard... to... kill.

103
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:49,163
But l have been talking to my old contacts
and they've provided some surprising news.

104
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:51,245
Yay for them!

105
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:53,647
Um... OK.

106
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:59,411
For example, Ubervamps can be staked...
right through the heart.

107
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:02,486
Zing! Poof! Just like regular vamps.

108
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:05,088
We didn't know this.

109
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:08,484
Of course, these guys
have incredibly strong sternums,

110
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:12,203
so it's a lot like driving
a wooden stake through solid steel.

111
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:14,933
But you guys are all superstrong, right?

112
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:17,050
Um... no.

113
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:19,485
Right. OK.

114
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:23,283
But still... heart information -
still good to know,

115
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:28,084
since holy water seems to run off these guys
like they've been Scotchgarded.

116
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:33,043
And sunlight would work, but guess what?
They're not coming out during the daytime.

117
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:39,687
Also, beware of their teeth
and the claws they use to shred flesh.

118
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:45,053
You know what? l used to be
really afraid of these Ubervamp guys.

119
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:49,366
But then the scary preacher blew into town,
and now l'm mostly terrified of him.

120
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:54,653
Right, well... We're working on
getting info on that guy.

121
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,773
Why bother? Nothing works. Nothing will.

122
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:06,484
l know you're all upset,

123
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:10,852
and l myself would much rather be sitting
at the bedside of my one-eyed ex-fiancé

124
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:16,804
than killing time here in this overcrowded
and increasingly ripe-smelling basement.

125
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:21,490
And l would be too, if not for a certain
awkward discussion he and l recently had

126
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:26,011
right on that cot immediately following
some exciting and unexpected break-up sex.

127
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:29,973
But l need to give him some space.

128
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:33,330
So l'm doing what l can do,
contributing any way l can.

129
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:37,885
And so will all of you.
You still need to know this information.

130
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:41,205
We can't stop just because
something else is trying to kill you.

131
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,925
You got enough to share?

132
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:54,087
l'll trade ya for a carton of cigarettes
and some soap.

133
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,925
Sorry. Habit.

134
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:01,412
Shouldn't you be down at Hogwarts?

135
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:04,171
Probably.

136
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:08,645
All right. Playing hooky.
Score one for the boarding-school brat.

137
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,453
Anya's technique's
probably not what you're used to.

138
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:14,924
Do you think there will be questions
about her sex life on the test?

139
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,448
l really hope l don't have to study all that.

140
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,571
Whenever she talks about
getting sweaty with Xander,

141
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,964
l just remind her l had him first.
Shuts her right the hell up.

142
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:25,646
Thing is, what's the point?

143
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:29,488
Studying demon hot zones and
pressure points doesn't do much good

144
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:32,611
when preacher man's out there,
ready to finish the job.

145
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,685
No one's got any info on Caleb yet?

146
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:38,847
No. Nothing is working.
Not research, not Anya's contacts.

147
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:41,209
We're lousy with dead ends around here.

148
00:10:41,294 --> 00:10:45,810
Everyone's feeling pretty pointless.
We don't even have a place to start.

149
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,566
<i>(Buffy)</i> Hey. Who's here?

150
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:51,522
Hey, Buffy. How's Xander?

151
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:57,246
He's doing really well.
He's ready to come home, l think.

152
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:00,173
What you got?

153
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:03,052
lnfo that Giles and Willow
pulled off the police database.

154
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:06,524
We figured with Caleb's
overt religiosity thing,

155
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:10,163
if we wanna learn more about him,
let's find out where he's been.

156
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:15,408
"lncidents of violence connected to California
religious institutions in the last ten years."

157
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:18,804
Looks like this gives us a place to start.

158
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,930
l figure we start with California.

159
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,812
lf we don't find anything,
we'll expand the search.

160
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:25,885
But Caleb didn'tjust get in the game.

161
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:29,853
He's been playing for a while, and
l wanna know where. Whatever it takes.

162
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,492
You good to help?

163
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:35,726
l was gonna do lots of homework,
but, darn the luck, they cancelled school,

164
00:11:35,814 --> 00:11:38,851
so looks like l got the time.

165
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,925
Good.

166
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:48,282
Buffy, how was Xander's mood,
you know, exactly?

167
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:53,931
Did you get a chance to talk to the doctor
about the meds? lt seemed like...

168
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:59,532
Pipsqueak, why don't you go get some
of the stuff you've already gotten from Giles?

169
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:02,287
Or we can talk about this later, maybe.

170
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:04,412
OK.

171
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:07,809
Yeah. l'll be right back.

172
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:13,010
Try to find anything that looks like Caleb.
His church, his ring...

173
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:16,973
His ability to render a slayer useless
in just one punch.

174
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:22,973
l didn't... That was stupid.
l don't know why l said that.

175
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:26,403
lt's OK.

176
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:30,692
l have to go to the school,
pick up the rest of my stuff.

177
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:34,449
- l really didn't mean...
- lt's fine. Really, it's fine.

178
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,852
Don't worry about it.

179
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:42,926
Hey, isn't Anya doing
that thing for you guys today?

180
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,005
Yeah. We were.

181
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:50,486
- We probably should head down there.
- OK. l'll be back soon.

182
00:12:57,854 --> 00:13:01,688
- See that everyone else gets started on this.
- Yeah.

183
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,449
<i>(Caleb)</i> Oh, now, look.

184
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:07,483
Things don't go exactly your way,
so here come the waterworks.

185
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,251
Ain't thatjust like a woman?

186
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:21,848
- Get out of here.
- Now, now, little girl. Manners.

187
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:27,406
l do imagine that firebrand tongue of yours
has inflamed many a man, weak as they are.

188
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:30,452
This here is a public school, ain't it?

189
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,367
Kinda deserted. Only just, l suppose.

190
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:39,766
Folks work so hard at keepin' the Lord out.
Look what happens in return.

191
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:44,685
He abandons you. Not that he could
do you much good now, anyway.

192
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:46,173
Uh, uh, uh.

193
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:50,292
Wouldn't do that were l you, sweet pea.

194
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:54,686
Fightin' back didn't do you
much good last time, did it?

195
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:57,334
And how is poor, sweet Xander?

196
00:14:57,414 --> 00:15:02,044
Let him know he's in my prayers,
and any time he's willin', l'm ready to...

197
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,328
finish the job.

198
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:06,724
Go near Xander again and l will end you.

199
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,445
Mind your manners.

200
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:18,051
l do believe l did warn you once.

201
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:21,251
You're angry, frustrated, scared.

202
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:24,442
l like that in a girl.

203
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:27,810
You really should relax a little.

204
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,885
Look at where you are.

205
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:33,808
History's gonna look back at you,
at me, at this place,

206
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:36,328
and they're gonna see the glory.

207
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:39,326
Great things are happenin' now, right here.

208
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:41,484
This school, the seal.

209
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:46,694
lt's all a part of the great sweepin' tide
of change, and you're gonna be a part of it.

210
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:48,890
Why would you wanna miss that?

211
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:52,525
More importantly,
why would you want to get in its way?

212
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:55,805
l guess l'm just ornery.

213
00:15:58,494 --> 00:15:59,722
<i>(chuckles)</i>

214
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:02,089
l knew you'd be a wild one.

215
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:15,883
l'm gonna take
such sweet pleasure in taming you.

216
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:29,888
l'll see you soon, little lady.

217
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:40,763
Here's the one that stood out.
lt's a mission up north in Gilroy.

218
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:48,566
Faith stole the last meatball-and-mozzarella
Hot Pocket even though l had dibs on it.

219
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:51,726
- l don't see anything.
- Exactly. No vandalism at all.

220
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:56,365
- Then why is it in the file?
- The place was abandoned.

221
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:59,491
Locals noticed after a few days
that no one was going in or out.

222
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:03,931
Six members of the order lived there,
but when the cops showed up, all gone.

223
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:10,772
The Post-it's still here: "Andrew's. Please
do not eat." But the box is empty now.

224
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:14,849
- Oh.
- Oh? Oh, good?

225
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,484
l'm not sure. Here.

226
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:26,331
lt's not the Hot Pocket itself -

227
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:29,486
even though it did have that
new-and-improved tomato sauce.

228
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:33,931
- lt's just the fundamental lack of respect.
- Shut up. Pay attention.

229
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:37,169
Dawn, what do you see?

230
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:41,850
- What am l looking for?
- On the back wall, a knothole.

231
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:45,007
That's not a knothole.

232
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:48,769
Amanda, would you go down
to the basement and get Spike?

233
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:55,928
Maybe this'll help,
if this does bring us closer to Caleb.

234
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:58,524
Sounded like there was news.

235
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:02,603
What's up, Rupert?

236
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:07,010
- Spike, l have a mission for you.
- Oh, really?

237
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:12,248
Sometimes our missions end up with you
trying to kill me. Not fond of those.

238
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:16,407
This is bona fide, with real ramifications.

239
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:18,485
Take a look at this.

240
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:25,730
Looks like our boy's been here.
You want me to go check it out?

241
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:30,729
l need someone who can take care of himself
in case Caleb has left some souvenirs.

242
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,082
Are we gonna get
to the food-stealing issue soon?

243
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:38,005
- Take Andrew.
- <i>(both)</i> What?

244
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:40,449
You say you wanna
get outta the house more.

245
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:43,731
- Yeah, but...
- There may be demons lurking about.

246
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:46,408
- He's a demon expert. He can help.
- Oh, please.

247
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:49,691
He could bring his pan-flute thing along.

248
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,004
Excellent. Off you go.

249
00:18:54,294 --> 00:18:59,368
See? That's something, right?
We'll have some news soon.

250
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:02,685
Sure. Maybe that'll get us somewhere.

251
00:19:03,694 --> 00:19:04,968
"Maybe."

252
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:09,491
ln the meantime, the troops gotta
sit and stew, feeling crappier by the minute.

253
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,883
We should keep them occupied.

254
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:16,010
Yeah. l know how to keep 'em occupied.

255
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:19,166
<i>(# "Rock City News" by Nerf Herder)</i>

256
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,732
What kinda band
plays during an apocalypse?

257
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:37,487
l think this band might be one of the signs.

258
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:45,643
Hey. Guys, how's it...

259
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:52,927
- going?
- Buffy.

260
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,083
Are you hurt?

261
00:19:58,374 --> 00:20:01,605
- Caleb came back looking for seconds.
- My God, is he...?

262
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:06,973
Still able to make me see cartoon birdies
all around my head? You betcha.

263
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:10,967
The short lack of consciousness was nice.
l feel rested.

264
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:17,843
So, how did those police files work out?
Were they helpful?

265
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:20,368
Yes. Very much so, l think.

266
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:25,968
There's evidence that Caleb
may have established a foothold up north.

267
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:29,012
- That's great. That's...
- l...

268
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:32,211
l sent Spike to look into it.

269
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:35,525
Spike?

270
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:39,004
ls this a mission from which
you intend Spike to return alive?

271
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:43,087
Yes. l sent Andrew with him.

272
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:45,449
Again l ask the question.

273
00:20:46,774 --> 00:20:49,493
Buffy, you weren't here.

274
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:52,372
Decisions have to be made in your absence.

275
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:56,323
- Those are the ones that scare me.
- l did what l thought was right.

276
00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:59,292
You sent away the one person
that watches my back. Again.

277
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:01,649
We're all watching your back.

278
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,804
Funny. That's not really what it feels like.

279
00:21:05,894 --> 00:21:06,883
Buffy...

280
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,204
- Where did everybody go?
- What?

281
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:12,047
Faith. The girls. Where are they?

282
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:19,203
Faith thought that the girls could do with
some time off their studies. l thought...

283
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:23,322
She took them to the Bronze.

284
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:35,164
You know what l figured out tonight?

285
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:41,523
Every high school in this country, from
one end to the other, smells exactly alike.

286
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:44,128
Why do you suppose that is?

287
00:21:44,214 --> 00:21:46,205
And how was our best girl?

288
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:49,092
They always think they should put up a fight.

289
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,369
- Did you lay the proper groundwork?
- l did.

290
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:54,173
She got the message,
even if she doesn't know it yet.

291
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:57,644
So now the big, strong Slayer
goes back to those girls.

292
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,646
She's just so ready to walk them right into it.

293
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:05,125
All we have to do is give her
that one final gentle nudge.

294
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:06,932
Excellent.

295
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:13,006
This is so cool.
Buffy would never let us do this.

296
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:15,210
You are so cool.

297
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:17,683
This woman is so cool.

298
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:22,214
- Hey, how old are you?
- 17.

299
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:26,211
We're gonna get you a real nice 7UP, OK?

300
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:41,572
l wondered what was taking
you boys so long. Where you been?

301
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:44,771
We're asking you to come with us, miss.
Outstanding warrants.

302
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:47,004
Yeah, or we could try this one on instead.

303
00:22:47,094 --> 00:22:52,009
How about you guys buy me another drink,
and we'll see where the evening takes us?

304
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:53,129
Hey!

305
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:55,523
- What's goin' on?
- <i>(Faith)</i> lt's cool. l got it.

306
00:22:55,614 --> 00:22:58,174
lt's nothing. Get off me.

307
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,285
- Get off me.
- Shut up.

308
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:12,765
l tell you right now, l'm not going back to jail.

309
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:18,853
- Who said anything aboutjail?
- <i>(guns cocked)</i>

310
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:38,049
Stay back. This doesn't concern you.

311
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:41,444
- You can't keep us in here.
- lt'll be over before you know it.

312
00:23:51,774 --> 00:23:54,413
Trust me. The best thing
you can do is wait here.

313
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:56,962
Don't listen to him. He won't hurt us.

314
00:23:57,054 --> 00:24:00,205
You know what?
l'm just gonna go borrow the phone.

315
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:08,805
Best thing you can do is wait... here.

316
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:19,088
- You'll have to shoot us all to stop us.
- lt doesn't really bother me.

317
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:22,371
<i>(Rona)</i> These cops are
really getting Hellmouthed.

318
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:24,206
- Back up!
- No!

319
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:25,283
What?

320
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:53,330
Faith!

321
00:24:53,414 --> 00:24:55,086
What are you doing?

322
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:57,688
Just blowing off steam.
Well, it started that way.

323
00:24:57,774 --> 00:25:00,368
Turned when the cops went evil on us.

324
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,444
Girls, go home.

325
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:09,290
l need to talk to Faith for a minute.

326
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:13,492
- Buffy, we weren't...
- Dawn, you too. Go.

327
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:24,529
- What is this?
- They needed a break, all right?

328
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:27,367
They've been running themselves
into the ground.

329
00:25:27,454 --> 00:25:30,446
Taking a break is one thing.
l get blowing off steam.

330
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:33,412
But they were fighting.
And those girls were drunk!

331
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:36,611
- What were you thinking?
- Seemed like a good idea at the time.

332
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:39,731
- What if someone had gotten hurt?
- They didn't.

333
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:43,124
Faith, l need to know that these girls
are safe when l'm not around.

334
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:45,523
No one got hurt, B.
You don't know these girls.

335
00:25:45,614 --> 00:25:50,051
Maybe you should have more confidence
in 'em. Let 'em mess up, get down and dirty.

336
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:53,763
- How else are they to learn?
- Learning from your mistakes is one thing.

337
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:56,971
- But you don't throw children...
- They're not children.

338
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,329
That really isn't the point.

339
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:03,404
What about the vineyard?

340
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:06,123
What?

341
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:08,682
How safe were they
when you took them to meet Caleb?

342
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:11,163
How safe was Rona, Amanda or Molly?

343
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:29,127
You sure you don't wanna stop and pick up
some burgers or something? Road-trip food?

344
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,490
lt's not a road trip. lt's a covert operation.

345
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,565
Right, right. Gotcha.

346
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:41,484
l bet even covert operatives
eat curly fries. They're really good.

347
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:44,849
Not as good as those onion-blossom things.

348
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:47,528
- Ooh, l love those.
- Yeah, me too.

349
00:26:48,494 --> 00:26:53,363
lt's an onion, and it's a flower. l don't
understand how such a thing is possible.

350
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:57,925
The genius of it is, you soak it in ice water
for an hour so it holds its shape.

351
00:26:58,014 --> 00:27:02,053
Then you deep-fry it root-side up
for about five minutes.

352
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:04,523
- Masterful.
- Yeah.

353
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:10,210
Tell anyone we had this conversation,
l'll bite you.

354
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:12,125
Right.

355
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:24,132
- The meeting hasn't started yet, has it?
- God, l hope so.

356
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,650
Faith?

357
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:30,613
You must be Principal Wood.
Heard a lot about you.

358
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:36,526
lt hasn't really started yet, has it?
l hate being late.

359
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:40,289
Troops are still gathering. l think you're safe.

360
00:27:42,054 --> 00:27:45,091
Looks like someone
banged you up pretty well.

361
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,529
Yeah. Cops.

362
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:49,969
- Mostly.
- Mostly?

363
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:52,773
This one's from someone
who just thinks she's a cop.

364
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:56,005
lt's my favourite of all my current bruises.

365
00:27:56,094 --> 00:27:59,166
Someone who thinks she's a cop, huh?

366
00:27:59,254 --> 00:28:02,564
You gonna have to, like,
ice her now or something like that?

367
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:05,964
l'm not gonna kill her. Wanted to, but didn't.

368
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:09,091
By the way, bully for me
since no one else said it.

369
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:14,248
- For what? For not killing Buffy?
- lt's this new thing l'm trying.

370
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:18,088
- She told me about you.
- Believe every word.

371
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:20,165
So what changed?

372
00:28:20,254 --> 00:28:23,052
l mean, why didn't you fight back?

373
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:27,049
Other things matter more.

374
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,449
l think you're worried about her.

375
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:34,607
l think you need to brush up
on your Buffy and Faith history.

376
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:38,528
All right, if you say so,
but l read people pretty well.

377
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:41,085
lt's a thing l do.

378
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:43,768
You live around here, right?

379
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:48,569
No, not exact...
Well, it's the centre of town, really.

380
00:28:48,654 --> 00:28:53,569
This town, walkin' anywhere
after dark is, like, an extreme sport.

381
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:58,648
Someone who didn't know you very well
might think you were out looking for a fight.

382
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:02,727
Maybe you got bigger issues
than what's wrong with B.

383
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:06,011
- l read people too.
- <i>(car approaches)</i>

384
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:09,525
Xander's home.

385
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:27,484
No one's here.

386
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:30,691
These kind of places
make me feel funny inside.

387
00:29:30,774 --> 00:29:34,972
How about that? You and me
got something else in common after all.

388
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,247
Spike!

389
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,889
<i>(door opens)</i>

390
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:04,293
<i>(Xander)</i> Oh, God.

391
00:30:04,374 --> 00:30:09,084
We didn't have time to do more.
You have to pretend there's a big party here.

392
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:21,571
That's fine. Parties in this house, l usually
end up having to rebuild something.

393
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:29,686
Welcome home, Xander.
l wanted you to be here for this.

394
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:32,288
l think you'll be interested
in what l found out.

395
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:34,365
What did you find out?

396
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:40,768
lt's about the cellar.
l know that night wasn't fun for any of us.

397
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:46,531
But l figured out some things about that
place, and l realise now what we have to do.

398
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:49,003
We're going back in.

399
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:01,445
Tell me about the mark.

400
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:04,728
Hey! Are you part of Caleb's faction?

401
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:06,247
No. No.

402
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:08,848
- Then tell me what happened.
- l can't.

403
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:12,087
"Can't" is a four-letter word.

404
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:16,804
l'm Andrew. l'll be your bad cop this evening.
You don't start singing, my associate...

405
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:20,284
We're trying to fight him. Caleb.
We need your help.

406
00:31:20,374 --> 00:31:23,650
You can't fight him. You can't stop him.

407
00:31:24,294 --> 00:31:28,173
- You can only run.
- "Run" is a four-letter wor...

408
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:30,449
A three-letter word.

409
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:33,685
Talk.

410
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:38,642
l'll do better. l'll show you.

411
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:50,052
One night, some time ago,
a man arrived at our doors.

412
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:53,963
And you said "Come in. Do some damage."?

413
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:58,286
We are a benevolent order,
and, yes, we welcomed him.

414
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:02,526
We offered to feed him,
but he had come for something else.

415
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:07,844
Behind this, he revealed something
even we didn't know was here.

416
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:09,572
A secret room.

417
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:14,523
He was excited, talking the whole time.
Destiny, that sort of thing.

418
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:17,811
Yeah. We hear he's a real smooth talker.

419
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,408
He went on about this ancient inscription.

420
00:32:20,494 --> 00:32:22,530
Neat.

421
00:32:22,614 --> 00:32:25,492
He read it, and he didn't like what it said.

422
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,446
His temper...

423
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:33,005
He was the purest evil l've ever seen.
He burned his mark upon me.

424
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:36,404
And then l ran and l hid...

425
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:40,127
and l listened to the others die.

426
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:45,853
Running away saved your life.

427
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:50,765
What does it say?

428
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:54,165
"lt is not for thee."

429
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,647
"lt is for her alone to wield."

430
00:33:00,054 --> 00:33:03,524
l know what you're thinking,
but l had a visit at the school from Caleb.

431
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:06,003
- Buffy, why didn't you...?
- l'm fine.

432
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:10,246
lt wasn't fun, but l'm fine.
l'm better than fine.

433
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:14,043
l figured something out. He kept
making all this noise about the school.

434
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:16,853
- ls it that seal again?
- Do we need to shut it again?

435
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:23,043
No, that's just it. We've spent all this time
worrying about the seal and the Hellmouth.

436
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,409
Why isn't Caleb guarding them?

437
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:29,328
Why doesn't he have someone protecting it?
Why is he out at the vineyard?

438
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:31,723
The bad guys always go where the power is.

439
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:35,329
lf the seal was so important to Caleb
and the First, they would be there now.

440
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:38,884
They're protecting the vineyard
or something at the vineyard.

441
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:43,092
l say it's their power, and l say it's time
we go in and take it away from them.

442
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:49,683
Or, in the alternative, how about we don't?

443
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:54,493
lt's a neat theory, B, but l'm not goin'
back in that place, not without proof.

444
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,565
Neither should you,
neither should they.

445
00:33:56,654 --> 00:34:00,249
- l'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
- l think Faith had the floor.

446
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:04,369
Maybe it ends OK the way you wanna play it,
but maybe it doesn't.

447
00:34:04,454 --> 00:34:08,606
- l don't think l want you playing the odds.
- Did you come here to fight?

448
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:13,165
We're all fighters, but you gotta give me
something to fight, something real, not...

449
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:15,927
Windmills.

450
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:19,006
- There is something there.
- Maybe.

451
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:21,813
We can't be sure of that.

452
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:25,170
- This is a hell of a lot to ask.
- Too much.

453
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,894
l don't understand this.

454
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:34,286
For seven years, l've kept us safe
by doing this - exactly this.

455
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:36,968
Making the hard decisions.

456
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:39,727
And now you're all acting
like you can't trust me?

457
00:34:39,814 --> 00:34:42,328
Didn't you say to me today
you can't trust us?

458
00:34:43,134 --> 00:34:46,809
Maybe there's something there
that should be addressed.

459
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:49,533
ls that why you sent Spike away?
To ambush me?

460
00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:53,402
- Come on.
- l am sick of your deal with this Spike guy.

461
00:34:53,494 --> 00:34:56,008
This isn't about him. This is about you.

462
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,767
- You're being reckless.
- What?

463
00:34:58,854 --> 00:35:01,288
You are! l don't even know you, and l can tell.

464
00:35:01,374 --> 00:35:05,287
You are so obsessed with Caleb,
you will jump into any plan without thinking.

465
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:09,526
- This is not what l'm doing.
- Well, that's how it feels to us.

466
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:11,764
- People are dying.
- <i>(Willow)</i> Kennedy...

467
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:14,448
Why are you always standing up for her?

468
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:17,253
- l'm not.
- What do you mean, you're not?

469
00:35:17,894 --> 00:35:20,772
With everything that's happened, l...

470
00:35:21,574 --> 00:35:24,372
l'm worried about yourjudgment.

471
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,566
l wish this could be a democracy. l really do.

472
00:35:32,654 --> 00:35:35,122
Democracies don't win battles.

473
00:35:35,214 --> 00:35:38,650
lt's a hard truth,
but there has to be a single voice.

474
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:42,090
You need someone to issue orders
and be reckless sometimes

475
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,130
and not take your feelings into account.

476
00:35:44,214 --> 00:35:46,648
You need someone to lead you.

477
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:50,170
And it's automatically you.

478
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:52,563
- You really think you're better than us.
- No...

479
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:56,932
But we don't know.
We don't know if you're actually better.

480
00:35:57,014 --> 00:36:01,963
You came into the world with
certain advantages, sure. That's the legacy.

481
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:05,888
- l...
- But you didn't earn it. You didn't work for it.

482
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:12,129
Nobody's said you deserve these things more
than anyone else. They were handed to you.

483
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:17,732
So that doesn't make you better than us.
lt makes you luckier than us.

484
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:21,290
l've gotten us this far.

485
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:24,047
But not without a price.

486
00:36:24,134 --> 00:36:27,570
- Xander...
- l'm trying to see your point here, Buff,

487
00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:32,409
but l guess it must be a little bit to my left,
cos l just don't.

488
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,644
l'm willing to talk strategy.

489
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,885
l'll hear suggestions on how to do it,
but this is the plan.

490
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:40,807
We have to be together on this
or we will fail again.

491
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,533
We are clearly not together on this.

492
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:46,526
Which is why you have to fall in line.

493
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:50,563
- l'm still in charge here.
- Why is that exactly?

494
00:36:50,654 --> 00:36:54,203
- Because l'm the Slayer.
- lsn't Faith a slayer too?

495
00:36:54,534 --> 00:36:59,130
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. So not
what l meant. l'm not "in charge chick".

496
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:03,730
l think B here just needs to chill out
for a little bit, take a siesta or somethin'.

497
00:37:03,814 --> 00:37:07,124
- But l'm not the one you want.
- Maybe we need a vote.

498
00:37:07,214 --> 00:37:09,967
To see who wants Faith
to have a turn in charge.

499
00:37:10,054 --> 00:37:13,012
- No.
- No, what?

500
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:18,612
No. You don't get to vote until l've had my
chance to pal around, get everybody drunk.

501
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,288
l didn't get that this was a popularity contest.

502
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:24,525
l should have equal time
to bake them cookies, braid their hair...

503
00:37:24,614 --> 00:37:26,605
Learn their names?

504
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:30,533
- You're loving this.
- You have no idea what l feel.

505
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:34,926
Come in here, take everything that l have.
You did it before. Did you tell them that?

506
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:38,131
Did you tell them you used to
kill people for fun? ls that nifty?

507
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,363
Buffy, that's enough!

508
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:44,050
l didn't come here to take anything away
from you, but l'm not gonna be your lapdog.

509
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:47,649
l came here to beat the other guy,
to do right, however it works.

510
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:52,364
l don't know if l can lead.
But the real question is, can you follow?

511
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:56,325
So we vote.

512
00:37:59,174 --> 00:38:01,563
Wait. Guys...

513
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:12,212
l can't watch you just
throw away everything that...

514
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:17,533
l know l'm right about this.
l just need a little...

515
00:38:19,774 --> 00:38:24,245
l can't stay here and watch her
lead you into some disaster.

516
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:32,449
Then you can't stay here.

517
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,687
Buffy, l love you.

518
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:42,727
But you were right.
We have to be together on this.

519
00:38:44,894 --> 00:38:47,408
You can't be a part of it.

520
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,489
So l need you to leave.

521
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:58,492
l'm sorry, but this is my house too.

522
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:14,290
Ding dong, the witch is dead.

523
00:39:14,374 --> 00:39:16,205
Shut your mouth.

524
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:22,647
Hey.

525
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:25,646
- l swear l didn't want it to go this way...
- Don't.

526
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:26,723
l mean it...

527
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:29,408
Don't be afraid to lead them.

528
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:35,732
Whether you wanted it or not,
their lives are yours.

529
00:39:37,454 --> 00:39:40,332
lt's only gonna get harder.

530
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:42,609
Protect them.

531
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:47,129
Lead them.

532
00:40:45,014 --> 00:40:47,164
