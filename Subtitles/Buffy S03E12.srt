2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,607
- Gotcha.
- Right in the heart.

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,193
Satisfied?

4
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,196
I'm not sure that's the word.

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,533
OK.

6
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:37,203
- I didn't mean satisfied like...
- No, I wasn't trying to...

7
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:41,875
Cos we're not having satisfaction
in the personal sense.

8
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,918
Of course.

9
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:48,048
- I should go. Giles is...
- Is waiting for you. Yeah, I know.

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,468
Thanks. For the work-out.

11
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,512
Am I going to see you this weekend?

12
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,681
You... you... you probably have plans.

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,894
Right. Birthday. Actually, I do have a thing.

14
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,606
A thing. Date?

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,192
Nice attempt at casual.

16
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,195
Actually, I do have a date.

17
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,364
Older man. Very handsome.

18
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,200
Likes it when I call him "Daddy".

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,078
Your father. It is your father, right?

20
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,874
He's taking me to the ice show.
It should be big fun.

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,419
I could use a little fun.

22
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,838
This one?

23
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,509
- Amethyst.
- Used for?

24
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,302
Breath mints?

25
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,556
Charm bags, money spells,
and for cleansing one's aura.

26
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,101
OK. How do you know
if one's aura is dirty?

27
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,062
Does somebody come by
and write "wash me" on it?

28
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,899
Buffy, I'm aware of your distaste
at studying vibratory stones,

29
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:52,445
but since it is part of your training,
I would appreciate your glib-free attention.

30
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,616
Sorry. It's just, with Faith on one
of her unannounced walkabouts,

31
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,952
somebody should be patrolling.

32
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,955
Faith is not interested in proper
training. So I must rely on you.

33
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:07,502
- I hate being the good one.
- As for patrolling, you'll be there soon.

34
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,879
Why so anxious?

35
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:14,801
I guess that I just have some energy to burn.

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,846
Well, in due time. But, for the present,

37
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:23,810
if it's not entirely beyond your capabilities,
try to concentrate.

38
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,906
- That looked funny. Do it again.
- I'll kill you for that.

39
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,452
For that? What were you
trying to kill me for before?

40
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,665
OK, so here's the deal...

41
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,811
Let me know if I'm not doing this right.

42
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,611
A bit early in the day.

43
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,780
Giles, something's wrong.

44
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,116
Wrong?

45
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,372
Perhaps you shouldn't

46
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,373
do that any more.

47
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,210
On top of that, I got a bad case of
the dizzies and almost let a vamp stake me.

48
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,505
With my own stake.

49
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,301
I'm way off my game.

50
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,722
My game's left the county. It's in
Cuernavaca. Giles, what's going on here?

51
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,143
Perhaps you've got
a bad flu bug or something.

52
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,355
No. No, not sick. I can't get sick.

53
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,774
My dad's coming to take me to the ice show.

54
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,735
We do it every year for my birthday.

55
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,321
If I cancel, it's gonna break his heart.

56
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,865
Well, just take it easy for 48 hours.

57
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,119
Forgo patrolling until you feel yourself again.

58
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,290
No. No, I just need to spend
a little more time training.

59
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,587
- I'm gone.
- Thank you.

60
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,674
An ice show? A show performed on ice.

61
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,636
- How old are we again?
- I went to Snoopy on Ice when I was little.

62
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,932
My dad took me backstage and I got
so scared I threw up on Woodstock.

63
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,852
I know you think it's a big,
dumb, girly thing, but it's not.

64
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,397
A lot of the skaters
are Olympic medal winners.

65
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,526
Dad buys me cotton candy and
one of those souvenir programmes and...

66
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,113
OK, it's a big, dumb, girly thing, but I love it.

67
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,784
It's not so girly. Ice is cool.
It's water, but it's not.

68
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,746
It's sweet you and your dad have a tradition.

69
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,457
Especially now that
he's not around so much.

70
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,794
Ixnay on the caramel corn though
if you go backstage.

71
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:23,133
But we're still talking party? Some of us still
love to relish celebrating the birth of the Buff.

72
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,012
I don't know. It might be time to put
a moratorium on parties in my honour.

73
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,098
They tend to go badly.
Monsters crash, people die...

74
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:35,895
But 18's a big one, Buffy. I mean,
you can vote now. You can be drafted.

75
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,524
You can vote not to be drafted.

76
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,110
I think I'll celebrate this one
with quiet reflection.

77
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,656
Where's it written that quiet reflection
can't be combined with cake and funny hats?

78
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,001
Buffy?

79
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,920
Present. Present.

80
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,090
They're not. They're from your father.

81
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,595
His quarterly projections are unravelling
and he can't afford to take off.

82
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:14,059
He promises to make it up to you.
It's all right there in the letter.

83
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,522
If you want, I could ask somebody
to cover for me at the gallery.

84
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,900
I mean, if you want me to take you.

85
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,778
No. No, that's not necessary.

86
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,574
I was just thinking it might be
nice to have a quiet birthday.

87
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,899
- How much longer, Hobson?
- Five, maybe six hours, sir.

88
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,362
Once you've finished,
you and Blair can get some rest.

89
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,823
But sleep in shifts.

90
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,083
We're getting very close.

91
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,961
The Slayer's preparation is nearly complete.

92
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:30,719
You know, it's not just cartoon characters.
They do pieces from operas and ballets.

93
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,181
Brian Boitano doing Carmen is a life changer.

94
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:41,104
He doesn't actually play Carmen.
But a lot of sophisticated people go.

95
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,692
Yes, I think we should start
with the grounding crystal again.

96
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,155
It's usually something
that families do together.

97
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,533
Look very carefully for
the tiny flaw at its core.

98
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:58,705
If someone were free, they'd take
their daughters, or their student,

99
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,498
or their slayer.

100
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,377
Yes, but, Buffy, I think
we should concentrate now.

101
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,922
Now, look for the flaw at its centre.

102
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,108
Buffy?

103
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm sorry. Did I zone out on you?

104
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,877
I'm just... I'm nursing that flu bug.

105
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,463
Best take care of that.

106
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,550
- Perhaps we should...
- Call it a night.

107
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,927
Yeah, that's a good idea.

108
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,430
Thanks.

109
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,311
Good night.

110
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,986
How's it going with Amy the rat?

111
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,531
Good. She loves her exercise wheel.
She runs around, her nose wiggles...

112
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,452
I meant, how's it going changing
her back into a human being?

113
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,080
Still working on it.
But I just got her the cutest little bell...

114
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,709
You don't do that to me.
I waited for you at the Bronze all night.

115
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,961
And the big deal is...?

116
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,506
You made me look like some
kind of dork in front of my posse.

117
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,593
First of all, "posse"? Passé.

118
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:21,222
Second, anyone with a teaspoon of brains
knows not to take my flirting seriously.

119
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,434
Especially with my
extenuating circumstances.

120
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,021
- What circumstances?
- Rebound. Look it up.

121
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,858
- Hey, I'm not through here.
- I beg to differ.

122
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,532
- What is wrong with you?
- The chick started it.

123
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,453
Are you OK?

124
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,255
OK, I just got swatted down by some
no neck and rescued by Cordelia.

125
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,841
- What is happening?
- It will sort itself out.

126
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,804
Look, you're not getting the big picture
here. I have no strength.

127
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,391
I have no coordination.

128
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,435
- I throw knives like...
- A girl?

129
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,899
Like I'm not the Slayer.

130
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,402
Look, Buffy, I... I assure you,

131
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,865
given time, we'll get to the bottom
of whatever's causing this anomaly.

132
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,828
- Promise me?
- Yes.

133
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,580
I give you my word.

134
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,667
You're having doubts,

135
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,212
Cruciamentum is not easy.
For Slayer or Watcher.

136
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,924
But it's been done this way
for a dozen centuries.

137
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,095
Whenever a slayer turns 18.
It's a time-honoured rite of passage.

138
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,348
It's an archaic exercise in cruelty.

139
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:51,062
To lock her in this tomb,
weakened, defenceless,

140
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,317
and to unleash that on her.

141
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,409
If any one of the Council still had contact
with a slayer they would see,

142
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,953
but I'm the one in the thick of it.

143
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,622
You can't make this decision -
you're too close.

144
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,126
- That's not true.
- A slayer is not just physical prowess.

145
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,379
She must have cunning, imagination.

146
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,133
A confidence derived from self-reliance.

147
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,637
And believe me, once this is all over,
your Buffy will be stronger for it.

148
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,807
Or she'll be dead for it.

149
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,822
Rupert, if this girl is everything you say,
then you've nothing to worry about.

150
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,540
Sir, if you can spare me for a short spell,
I'll need to make a run to the hardware store.

151
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,713
Take care of it.

152
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,277
Come along, come along.

153
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,373
Kralik. Your pills.

154
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,126
Open your mouth.

155
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,606
That's enough. Close it up.

156
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,491
"A curse on slayers."

157
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,412
Oh, no, wait. It's "lawyers".

158
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,750
Maybe we're on the wrong track with
the whole spell, curse and whammy thing.

159
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:20,920
Maybe what we should be looking for
is something like slayer kryptonite.

160
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,132
Faulty metaphor. Kryptonite kills.

161
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,677
You assume I meant green kryptonite.
I was referring to red kryptonite,

162
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,888
which drains Superman of his powers.

163
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,099
Wrong, gold kryptonite's the power-sucker.

164
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,685
The red kryptonite mutates Superman into...

165
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,854
Guys? Reality?

166
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:46,029
Buffy, I know you are definitely, without
a doubt, gonna get your powers back.

167
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,948
Thanks, Will.

168
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,159
But what if you don't?

169
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,286
OK.

170
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,416
If I don't get my powers back, then I don't.

171
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,419
I'll deal.

172
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:07,258
- And there's a whole lot of good sides to it.
- Actually, this could open up so many...

173
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,096
- Did you find anything?
- No. Not yet.

174
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,409
It's your shift.

175
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,630
- Pills.
- Yes.

176
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,189
It's coming.

177
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,284
Pills.

178
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,545
- Take them.
- Pills.

179
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,381
- They're right in front of you.
- Where?

180
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,303
- Here.
- I can't see... can't... can't reach it.

181
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,978
Open your eyes.

182
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,820
Everything's OK now.

183
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,427
Thank you. It's beautiful.

184
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,305
- You really like it?
- Of course I do.

185
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,727
It's sweet and thoughtful and

186
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:28,650
full of neat words to learn and say,
like "wilt" and "henceforth".

187
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:34,155
Then why did you seem more excited last
year when you got a severed arm in a box?

188
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,243
I'm sorry.

189
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:43,081
It's just suddenly there's this chance
that my calling's a wrong number, and

190
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:47,335
- it's freaking me out a little.
- That's understandable.

191
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,463
Angel, what if I have lost my power?

192
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,383
You've lived a long time without it.
You can do it again.

193
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,760
I guess.

194
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,555
But what if I can't?

195
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,392
I've seen too much. I know
what goes bump in the night.

196
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,061
Not being able to fight it...

197
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,149
What if I just hide under my bed,
all scared and helpless?

198
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,401
Or what if I become pathetic,

199
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:14,863
hanging out at the old slayers' home,
talking about my glory days,

200
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,991
showing them the stake I had bronzed?

201
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:22,412
Buffy, you could never be helpless
or boring, not even if you tried.

202
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,083
Don't be so sure.

203
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:35,842
Before I was the Slayer, I was...
well, I don't want to say shallow, but

204
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,598
let's say a certain person, who will
remain nameless - we'll call her Spordelia -

205
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,185
looked like a classical
philosopher next to me.

206
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:51,858
Angel, if I'm not the Slayer,
what do I do? What do I have to offer?

207
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,029
Why would you like me?

208
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,533
I saw you before you became the Slayer.

209
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:06,373
- What?
- I watched you, and I saw you called.

210
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,170
It was a bright afternoon,
out in front of your school.

211
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,006
You walked down the steps,

212
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,135
and... and I loved you.

213
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,014
Why?

214
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,308
Because I could see your heart.

215
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,691
You held it before you for everyone to see,

216
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,695
and I worried that it
would be bruised or torn.

217
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:42,826
And more than anything in my life I wanted
to keep it safe, to warm it with my own.

218
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,877
That's beautiful.

219
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,341
Or, taken literally, incredibly gross.

220
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,678
I was just thinking that too.

221
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:25,535
You're up. I was afraid I'd drained
you too much. I do that sometimes.

222
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:35,045
Ever have a tune you can't get out of your
head, that keeps playing over and over?

223
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:39,007
It drives me nuts.

224
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,182
Thank you.

225
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,895
That is much better.

226
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,992
It's a game, you know.

227
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:11,122
We're not going to play by their rules,
but that doesn't mean we're not gonna play.

228
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:17,128
Why don't you call your friend in here?
We'll discuss it over dinner.

229
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,475
Quentin?

230
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,126
Hello?

231
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,839
Quentin? Hob...?

232
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,080
- She's cute.
- Yeah.

233
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,499
Let's find out.

234
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,046
Hey, sweet girl. How much for
a lap dance for me and my buddy?

235
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,852
"Walk me home, Angel? No, I'm fine.
I can take care of myself."

236
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,400
Hummers. Big turn-off.

237
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,570
I like guys that can remember the lyrics.

238
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:52,117
You know, I wish I could,
but my mind just isn't what it used to be.

239
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,161
- Let me go.
- You didn't say "please".

240
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,747
Help me, somebody. Please.

241
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,794
Help me, please. Help me, please.

242
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,381
Somebody, please help me.

243
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,148
No.

244
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,197
Stop. Please. I need help.

245
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:33,867
Please stop.

246
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,292
Hurry.

247
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,978
When I hit him, it felt like my arm
was broken, it hurt so much.

248
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,443
I can't be just a person.
I can't be helpless like that.

249
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:13,031
Giles, please. We have to
figure out what's happening to me.

250
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:26,002
It's an organic compound
of muscle relaxants and adrenal suppressors.

251
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,592
The effect is temporary.

252
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,304
You'll be yourself again in a few days.

253
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,935
You?

254
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,772
It's a test, Buffy.

255
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:52,487
It's given to the Slayer once she...
if she reaches her 18th birthday.

256
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:57,784
The Slayer is disabled,

257
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:03,915
and then entrapped with a vampire whom
she must defeat in order to pass the test.

258
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:11,256
The vampire you were to face has escaped.

259
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,844
His name is Zackary Kralik.

260
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:21,391
As a mortal, he murdered and tortured
more than a dozen women

261
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:25,395
before he was committed to
an asylum for the criminally insane.

262
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,314
When a vamp...

263
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,567
You bastard.

264
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,278
All this time you saw
what it was doing to me.

265
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,947
All this time and you didn't say a word.

266
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,658
- I wanted to.
- Liar.

267
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:42,287
In matters of tradition and protocol,
I must answer to the Council.

268
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,541
My role in this was very specific.

269
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:51,004
I was to administer the injections and to
direct you to the old boarding house

270
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,174
- on Prescott Lane.
- I can't... I can't hear this.

271
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,344
Buffy, please.

272
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,432
Who are you?

273
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,434
How could you do this to me?

274
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:06,770
I am deeply sorry,
and you have to understand...

275
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,939
If you touch me, I'll kill you.

276
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:16,988
You have to listen to me. Because
I've told you this, the test is invalidated.

277
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,700
You will be safe now, I promise.

278
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,953
Whatever I have to do to deal with Kralik

279
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:27,332
- and to win back your trust...
- You stuck a needle in me.

280
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,501
You poisoned me.

281
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,547
What's going on?

282
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,593
Oh, God. Is the world ending?
I have to research a paper on Bosnia,

283
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,639
but if the world's ending,
I'm not gonna bother.

284
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:48,228
You can't walk home alone,
Buffy. It isn't safe.

285
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,817
I don't know you.

286
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,446
Did something take her memory? He's Giles.

287
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,032
Gi-les.

288
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,411
He hangs out here a lot.

289
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:08,289
Cordelia, could you please drive me home?

290
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,959
Of course.

291
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:15,213
But if the world doesn't end,
I'm gonna need a note.

292
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,779
Buffy?

293
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,204
Mother.

294
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,921
Mother.

295
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,717
May I call you Mother?

296
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:47,555
My own mother was a person
with no self-respect of her own,

297
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,767
so she tried to take mine.

298
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:58,692
Ten years old, she had the scissors - you
wouldn't believe what she did with those.

299
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,529
But she's dead to me now.

300
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:06,074
Mostly because I killed and ate her,

301
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:11,329
but also because I know
I won't be alone much longer.

302
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,874
I'll have your daughter.

303
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,378
I won't kill her, I'll just make her like me.

304
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,588
Different.

305
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,382
She'll go to sleep,

306
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:27,470
and when she wakes up,
your face will be the first thing she eats.

307
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:34,894
I have a problem with mothers.
I'm aware of that.

308
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,247
I was just trying to reach you.

309
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:21,584
- I was on watch, by the boarding house.
- Then you'll know what's happened.

310
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,253
Yes.

311
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,797
He's killed Hobson
and made Blair one of his own.

312
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,259
Your perfectly controlled test

313
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:34,180
seems to have spun rather impressively
out of control, don't you think?

314
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,686
- It changes nothing.
- Well, then allow me.

315
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,605
I've told Buffy everything.

316
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,152
That is in opposition to the Council's orders.

317
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:50,530
Yes. Interestingly, I don't give
a rat's arse about the Council's orders.

318
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,699
There will be no test.

319
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,954
The test has already begun. Your slayer
entered the field of play ten minutes ago.

320
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:02,500
- Why?
- I don't know. I returned there as she entered.

321
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,963
- Giles, we've no business interfering.
- This is not business.

322
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,287
Hide and seek.

323
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,377
Hide and seek.

324
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:45,270
Why did you come
to the dark of the woods?

325
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:50,066
To bring all these sweets
to Grandmother's house?

326
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:05,373
Oh, no, no. Just a little lower. Right... Oh, yes.

327
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,168
Yes...

328
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,797
Thank you very much.

329
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:57,277
If you stray from the path,
you will lose your way.

330
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,197
I won't take it all. I won't take it all...

331
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:21,593
No. No. No.

332
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:33,813
Buffy?

333
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,442
Buffy, we have to get out.

334
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:42,322
Where are they?

335
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,449
Where are they?

336
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:12,227
You... you don't seem to
understand your place in all of this.

337
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:15,271
Do you have any idea...?

338
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,024
Oh, my.

339
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,860
What have you...? My pills?

340
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,913
No. No.

341
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,709
If I was at full Slayer power,
I'd be punning right about now.

342
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,503
No. No.

343
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,556
Buffy, thank God you're OK.

344
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,391
Oh, that man...

345
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:56,938
- I can't get these. They're too tight.
- Can't you just...?

346
00:39:57,689 --> 00:40:01,234
Not right now. Maybe there's
some clippers around.

347
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,672
Congratulations, You passed,

348
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:27,135
You exhibited extraordinary courage
and clear-headedness in battle.

349
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:30,180
The Council is very pleased.

350
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,682
Do I get a gold star?

351
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:36,811
- I understand that you're upset...
- You understand nothing.

352
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,190
You set that monster loose
and he came after my mother.

353
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:42,525
You think the test was unfair?

354
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:47,197
I think you better leave town
before I get my strength back.

355
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:51,284
We're not in the business of "fair".
We're fighting a war.

356
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,953
You're waging a war. She's fighting it.

357
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:56,206
Mr Giles, if you don't mind...

358
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:58,708
- The test is done. We're finished.
- Not quite.

359
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,378
She passed. You didn't.

360
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:06,675
The Slayer is not the only one
who must perform in this situation.

361
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,135
I have recommended to the Council

362
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:14,224
that you be relieved of your duties
as watcher immediately. You're fired.

363
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:18,186
On what grounds?

364
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:22,565
Your affection for your charge has
rendered you incapable of clear judgement.

365
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:29,739
You have a father's love for the child,
and that is useless to the cause.

366
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:34,994
It would be best if you had
no further contact with the Slayer.

367
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:39,624
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I didn't expect you would adhere to that.

368
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:45,672
However, if you interfere with the new
watcher in any way, you will be dealt with.

369
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,301
- Are we clear?
- We're very clear.

370
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:55,181
Congratulations again.

371
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,227
Bite me.

372
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:01,646
Yes, well...

373
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,733
Colourful girl.

374
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:58,244
I can't believe Giles was fired.
How could Giles get fired?

375
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,663
So, how did you manage to kill Kralik?

376
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:03,166
She was very clever.

377
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:09,381
- You go ahead and tell it. You tell it better.
- When you say fired, do you mean fired?

378
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:12,550
You're not cruising past
that concept anytime soon, are ya?

379
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:18,765
Well, it's just... I mean, he's been fired.
He's... he's unemployed. He's between jobs.

380
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:23,186
Giles isn't going anywhere, Will.
He's still librarian.

381
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:26,981
- OK, but I'm writing an angry letter.
- Nothing's really gonna change.

382
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:31,986
The important thing is that I kept up my
birthday tradition of misery and horror.

383
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:35,448
Bright side to everything?

384
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:39,160
I'll just feel better when
I get my strength back.

385
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:41,663
Give you a hand with that, little lady?

386
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,583
You're loving this far too much.

387
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:49,379
Admit it. Sometimes you
just need a big, strong man.

388
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:58,763
Will? Give me a hand with that?

389
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:05,824
