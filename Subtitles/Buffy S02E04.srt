1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,864
In every generation there is a Chosen One,

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:09,523
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness,

3
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:10,618
She is the Slayer,

4
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:16,086
- This is so unfair.
- I don't think it's that bad.

5
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:19,117
It's the übersuck.
Mom could've at least warned me.

6
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,941
Well, a lot of parents
are doing it this year.

7
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:23,109
It's part of this whole
cultural-exchange megillah.

8
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:26,525
- The exhibit. The dance.
- I have the best costume for the dance.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,206
A complete stranger
in my house for two weeks.

10
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:33,257
I'm gonna be insane. A danger to myself
and others within three days, I swear!

11
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:35,584
I think the exchange-student
program's cool.

12
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:39,014
I do! It's a beautiful melding
of two cultures.

13
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:41,354
Have you ever done
an exchange program?

14
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:45,495
My dad tried to sell me to some
Armenians once. Does that count?

15
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,586
Ooh! There's mine.

16
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:01,441
Sven. Isn't he lunchable?
Mine's definitely the best.

17
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:04,700
- What are you looking at?
- Pictures of our exchange students. Look.

18
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:07,775
100% Swedish. 100% gorgeous.

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,299
100% staying at my house!

20
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:13,001
So how's yours? Visually, I mean.

21
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:15,508
I don't know. Guy-like?

22
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:19,657
By guy-like, we are talking
big, beefy guy-like girls, right?

23
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:22,316
I was just told "guy".

24
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:25,370
You didn't look at him first?
He could be dogly.

25
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,474
You live on the edge!

26
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,295
Hold on a sec.

27
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:32,257
So this person who's living with you
for two weeks is a man?

28
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:36,082
With man parts?
This is a terrible idea.

29
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:39,223
What about the beautiful melding
of two cultures?

30
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:43,098
There's no melding, OK?
He better keep his parts to himself.

31
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:45,657
What's he doing?

32
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:50,957
That's Rodney Munson.
He's God's gift to the bell curve.

33
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:56,204
What he lacks in smarts,
he makes up in lack-of-smarts.

34
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,427
You just don't like him 'cause of that time
he beat you up every day for five years.

35
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:03,081
Yeah. I'm irrational that way.

36
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:05,078
I better stop him
before he gets in trouble.

37
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,850
I got it. The non-violent approach
is probably better here.

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,834
I wasn't gonna use violence.
I don't always use violence.

39
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:18,550
Do I?

40
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:21,502
The important thing is...
you believe that.

41
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:25,621
What are you... Oh, Willow, hi.

42
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:28,376
That's probably not something
you're supposed to be doing.

43
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:30,618
- You could get in trouble.
- Oh, no.

44
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:33,026
And they might kick me out of school?

45
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:35,702
Are we still on for
our chem tutorial tomorrow?

46
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:39,355
Yeah. I think I got almost
all 14 natural elements memorized.

47
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,524
There are 103.

48
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:47,899
Welcome, students. We shall now
proceed into the Incan burial chamber.

49
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:52,353
The human sacrifice is about to begin.

50
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:56,647
Typical museum trick.
Promise human sacrifice.

51
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:58,992
Deliver old pots and pans.

52
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:03,874
500 years ago, the Incan people
chose a beautiful teenage girl...

53
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:06,304
to become their princess.

54
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:10,324
I hope this story ends with
"And she lived happily ever after."

55
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:15,458
No, I think it ends with "And she became
a scary, discolored, shriveled mummy."

56
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:19,949
The Incan people sacrificed their
princess to the mountain god, Sabancaya,

57
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:25,080
an offering buried alive
for eternity in this dark tomb.

58
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:29,680
They could've at least wrapped her in those
nice, white bandages - like in the movies.

59
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:34,119
The princess remained there,
protected only by a cursed seal...

60
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:38,491
placed there as a warning
to any who would wake her.

61
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,879
So, Buffy, when's exchange-o boy
making his appearance?

62
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:46,443
His name's Ampata.
He'll be at the bus station tomorrow night.

63
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:49,718
Oooh! The Sunnydale bus depot. Classy!

64
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:53,243
What a better way to introduce someone to
our country than with the stench of urine.

65
00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:57,003
Now, if you'll follow me this way, please.

66
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:33,302
Cool!

67
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,351
Damn!

68
00:05:45,324 --> 00:05:50,791
<b>"Inca Mummy Girl"</b>

69
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:56,461
- So can I go?
- I think not.

70
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:06,024
- How come?
- Because you are the Chosen One.

71
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:08,498
Just this once, I'd like
to be the Overlooked One.

72
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,352
Well, I'm afraid that is not...

73
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:15,491
You have responsibilities
that other girls do not.

74
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,503
Oh! I know this one!
"Slaying entails certain sacrifices,

75
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,283
blah, blah, bitty blah.
I'm so stuffy, give me a scone."

76
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:24,649
It's as if you know me.

77
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,181
Your secret identity is gonna be
difficult enough to maintain

78
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:29,859
while this exchange student
is living with you.

79
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:31,589
Not...

80
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,032
with her.
In the same house as her.

81
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:38,583
Am I the only one who's objective enough
to make that distinction?

82
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,392
So! I think going to the dance
like a normal person

83
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:46,312
would be the best way
to keep that secret.

84
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:50,153
Giles, come on! Budge.
No one likes an un-budger.

85
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,023
Fine!

86
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,371
- Go.
- Yay! I win.

87
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:03,053
I'll just go and introduce
my shoulder to a... an ice pack.

88
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:05,057
So I guess we're dance-bound. Cool.

89
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,151
I think I can get my mom's car,
so I'm Wheel Man.

90
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:11,193
- I thought you were taking Willow?
- Well, yeah, I'm gonna take Willow,

91
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:14,516
but I'm not gonna "take" Willow,
in the sense of "take me".

92
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,542
See, with you we're three and
everybody's safe. Without you, we're two.

93
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:20,519
Ah. And we enter dateville.
Romance, flowers.

94
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:22,250
Lips.

95
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:24,855
Oh, come on. In all the years

96
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,368
you've known Willow,
you've never thought about her lips?

97
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:31,430
Buffy, I love Willow
and she's my best friend...

98
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:35,243
which makes her not the kind of girl
who I think about her lips that much.

99
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:39,066
She's the kind of girl that...
I'm best friends with.

100
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:41,446
Hey, guys.

101
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:44,843
Willow! Hi! We were just
talking about happy things.

102
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:47,744
Like the three of us
going to the dance together, see?

103
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:51,772
Happy. Not happy.

104
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,421
No. Uh, oh, y-yes.

105
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:56,540
No. Rodney's missing.

106
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,890
Trouble with Mr. Munson again?

107
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:01,476
His parents say
he never came home last night.

108
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,697
You know, I don't think I remember seeing
Rodney on the bus back from the field trip.

109
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:09,017
I didn't either. I hope
he didn't get in trouble at the museum.

110
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,370
Hey, maybe he awakened the mummy.

111
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,724
Right, and it rose from its tomb.

112
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,341
And attacked him.

113
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,045
On the other hand, maybe Rodney
just stepped out for a smoke.

114
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,824
- For 21 hours?
- It's addictive, you know.

115
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:31,835
We'll deal with that
when we've ruled out evil curses.

116
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,222
One day I'm gonna live
in a town where evil curses

117
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,730
are just generally ruled out
without even saying.

118
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:38,645
There was the seal?

119
00:08:38,646 --> 00:08:41,022
It was right here.

120
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:42,794
And it's broken.

121
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:47,126
- Does that mean the mummy's loose?
- No. Comfy as ever.

122
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:50,253
Look at this series of pictograms.

123
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,036
Look out!

124
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:04,475
- OK. I just saved us, right?
- Something did.

125
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,794
Well we'll fret about the details later.
Let's just get out of here

126
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:09,648
before he comes back.

127
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:11,413
Giles,

128
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:14,224
were the Incas... very advanced?

129
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,187
Yes. Yes, very.

130
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,289
Did they have orthodontists?

131
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:24,699
Rodney looked like he had been dead
for 500 years. How could that be?

132
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:27,721
Maybe we should ask that crazy man
with the big old knife.

133
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,998
I don't think he seemed overly chatty.

134
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:34,639
The way he bolted when he saw Rodney?
I'd say he was as freaked as we were.

135
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,190
My resources on the subject
are extremely limited.

136
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,240
I gather that this particular mummy
was from the Sabancaya region

137
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:43,476
of eastern Peru. It's very remote.
Now, if there's an answer,

138
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:46,260
- then it's-it's locked in...
- In the seal.

139
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:50,647
It could take me weeks to...
translate these pictograms.

140
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:53,245
- Well, we'll start tonight with...
- Ampata!

141
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,670
- I was gonna suggest hunting.
- No, I'm late. I told mom I'd pick him up.

142
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:58,653
Buffy, where are your priorities?

143
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:01,728
Tracking down a mummifying killer
or making time for some Latin lover

144
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:04,178
whose stock in trade
is the breakage of hearts?

145
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:07,607
Ampata's there alone.
I don't know how good his English is.

146
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:10,436
He's from South... South America.

147
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:12,496
Hey, you know, maybe
he could translate the seal.

148
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:14,505
Oh, yeah. Fall for the old

149
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:17,518
"let me translate
that ancient seal for you" come-on.

150
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:20,351
Do you know
how many times I've used that?

151
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:28,481
Ampata!

152
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,421
Ampata!

153
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:48,521
Hello?

154
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:02,900
- 40 minutes late. Welcome to America.
- What if he left already?

155
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:06,566
Ampata! Ampata Gutierrez?

156
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:10,926
So, do we have to speak Spanish
when we see him?

157
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,618
'Cause I don't know anything much
besides "Doritos" and "Chihuahua".

158
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:17,925
- Ampata!
- Here.

159
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:21,680
Hello.

160
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,691
I am Ampata.

161
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:37,843
Ay caramba! I can also say that.

162
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,662
Dining room. And this...

163
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,249
- is kitchen.
- It's very good.

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,212
Yeah, you got your stove, your fridge.
It's fully functional. We're very into it.

165
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,052
Would you like a drink?

166
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:59,888
Uh, let's see, we've got milk,
and, uh, oh, older milk...

167
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:02,390
- Juice?
- Please.

168
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:04,167
So, Ampata,

169
00:12:04,202 --> 00:12:06,477
you're a girl.

170
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,733
Yes. For many years now.

171
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:15,131
And not a boy. 'Cause we thought a boy was
coming, and here you are in a... girl way.

172
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,145
It's just one of those crazy mix-ups, Will.

173
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,441
So, have you ever been
to America before?

174
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:22,715
Uh, I, I have toured.

175
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:25,623
Where did... you go?

176
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:30,045
I was taken to Atlanta, Boston, New York.

177
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:34,227
New York! That's exciting.
What was that like?

178
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,135
I did not see so much.

179
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:41,100
- Your English is very bueno,
- I listened much.

180
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,240
Well, that works out well
because I talk much.

181
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,658
Hey.

182
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,183
- Sorry about the teeniness of the room.
- My old one was much smaller.

183
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,510
What's it like back home?

184
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:08,542
Cramped and very dead.

185
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:11,266
Well, you'll feel right
at home in Sunnydale.

186
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,721
Oh, no!

187
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:17,905
But... But you have so much here.

188
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:22,352
How about friends?

189
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,938
They're...

190
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:29,345
It is just me.

191
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,688
I've been there. But, hey,
you'll meet lots of people tomorrow.

192
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:36,367
Thank you.

193
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:40,544
You must teach me
everything about your life.

194
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:47,528
I want to fit in, Buffy.
Just like you. A normal life.

195
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,641
One normal life... coming up.

196
00:13:56,014 --> 00:13:58,410
Devon, I told you
I'd be at the dance tonight

197
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:01,871
but I am not one of your little groupies.
I won't be all doe-eyed,

198
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:04,873
looking up at you,
standing at the edge of the stage.

199
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:07,931
- Got it.
- So, I'll see you afterwards?

200
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:09,917
Sure. Where do you wanna meet?

201
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,990
I'll be standing at the edge of the stage.

202
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,131
With that guy?

203
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:17,834
Sven. Momento, Needa.

204
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:21,008
This whole student exchange thing
has been a horrible nightmare.

205
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,939
They don't even speak American.

206
00:14:23,974 --> 00:14:27,100
So I'll see you later? Bye.

207
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:31,756
Sven! Come!

208
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:38,709
- Oz, man. What do you think?
- Of what?

209
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,926
Cordelia, man!

210
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:43,312
She's a wonderland tour.

211
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:47,419
- You gotta admit, the girl is hot.
- Yeah, she's a hot girl.

212
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:51,791
Let me guess. Not your type?
What does a girl have to do to impress you?

213
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:55,286
Well, it involves a feathered boa
and the theme of A Summer Place,

214
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:58,738
- I can't discuss it here.
- You're too picky, man.

215
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:03,462
Do you know how many girls you could have?
You're lead guitar, Oz. It's currency.

216
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:08,297
I'm not picky. You're just impressed
by any pretty girl that can walk and talk.

217
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:11,263
She doesn't have to talk.

218
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:16,100
I worked really hard on my costume.
It's pretty cool.

219
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:19,685
OK, but what about me? I gotta think.

220
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:23,508
Well, it's a celebration of cultures.
There are lots of dress-up alternatives.

221
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:27,110
And a corresponding equal number
of mocking alternatives, all aimed at me.

222
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:30,661
- Bavarians are cool.
- OK. No shirts with ruffles,

223
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,002
no hats with feathers
and definitely no lederhosen.

224
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:36,330
They... make my calves look fat.

225
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:39,513
Why are you suddenly so worried
about looking like an idiot?

226
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:42,005
That came out wrong.

227
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,100
Your first day at school. Nervous?

228
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,893
It is just more people
than I have seen in a long time.

229
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,650
Don't worry.
You'll have no problems making friends.

230
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:55,043
As a matter of fact,
I know someone who's dying to meet you.

231
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:57,952
How do you do?

232
00:15:58,021 --> 00:16:01,774
I was, I was wondering
if you could, um, translate... this?

233
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:03,652
That was in no way awkward.

234
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,575
- Is something wrong?
- No. It is...

235
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:15,290
- Why are you asking me?
- Well, uh, uh...

236
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:18,738
It's, well, it's an artifact...
from, from, uh, your... region.

237
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:23,005
It's from the tomb
of an Incan mummy, actually.

238
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:27,628
We're trying to translate it...
as a project for our, um...

239
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:29,940
Our archaeology club.

240
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:33,905
- Very good.
- It is broken. Where are the other pieces?

241
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,120
That's all we found.

242
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:39,900
It's very old. Valuable.

243
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:45,757
- You should hide it.
- Is, is, uh, anything you recognize here?

244
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:50,737
This, this, um... this chap here
with the knife, for instance?

245
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:53,841
Well, I do not know exactly.

246
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:58,328
But... I think this represents...

247
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:02,306
I believe, the word is... bodyguard?

248
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:07,716
Bodyguard? Interesting.

249
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:12,846
Legend has it that he guards the mummy
against those who would disturb her.

250
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:19,389
Well. Yes, that's a very good
starting point for our, um... club.

251
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:26,039
Oh! And, uh, as club president,
I have, um, lots to do.

252
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:28,711
Lots of stuff. Dull stuff.

253
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,838
- Willow, maybe you could...
- Stay with Ampata for the day.

254
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,046
I'd love to.

255
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:38,069
Yes. That will be fun.

256
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:44,681
Right. I'll...
continue with the translation.

257
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:47,023
Buffy, you research this bodyguard thing.

258
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:50,046
And, Willow... Willow!

259
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:54,050
Boy, they really like each other.

260
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:59,972
And this...

261
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,856
- is called... a snack food.
- Snack food?

262
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:07,211
Yeah. It's a delicious,
spongy, golden cake

263
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:11,705
stuffed with a delightful,
creamy white substance of goodness.

264
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,042
And here's how you eat it.

265
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:20,195
Oh, but now I cannot try it.

266
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,977
That's why you bring two.

267
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:29,393
Here goes.

268
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:34,978
Good, huh?

269
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:38,779
The exciting part is that they have
no ingredients that a human can pronounce.

270
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,755
So it doesn't leave you with that heavy...
"food feeling" in your stomach.

271
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:47,395
- You are strange.
- Girls always tell me that...

272
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,457
right before they run away.

273
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:53,335
- I like it.
- I like you like it.

274
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,820
Please, don't learn from my English.

275
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:02,634
Ha! Or possible ha.

276
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:05,602
Do you think this matches?

277
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:10,039
- Hey!
- Oh.

278
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:14,175
Yes. I'm caring about mummies.

279
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:17,141
Ampata's only staying two weeks.

280
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:22,898
Yeah. And then Xander can find
someone else who's not me to obsess about.

281
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:26,641
At least with you
I knew he didn't have a shot.

282
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,363
Well, you know, I have a choice.

283
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:32,693
I can spend my life waiting for Xander

284
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:35,160
to go out with
every other girl in the world...

285
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:37,735
until he notices me, or...

286
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,911
I can just get on with my life.

287
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,014
Good for you.

288
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,238
Well, I didn't choose yet.

289
00:19:45,273 --> 00:19:47,773
Good Lord. Good work.

290
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:50,481
- My work?
- Yes.

291
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:53,122
This is most illuminating.

292
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:57,272
It seems Rodney's killer
might be the mummy.

293
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,813
- Where does it say that?
- Well, here.

294
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:04,254
It implies that the mummy is capable
of feeding on the life force of a person,

295
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:07,291
effectively freeze-drying them,
you might say.

296
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,864
- Extraordinary.
- So, then we just have to stop the mummy.

297
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:14,707
Which leads to the question, how do we
(a) find and (b) stop the mummy?

298
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:17,872
Well, the answer to that
is somewhere still in here.

299
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:20,136
Or in the rest of the seal.

300
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:26,123
You stole the seal! Where is it?

301
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:34,096
It is you!

302
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:46,125
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

303
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,810
Why is this guy so into us?
I mean, what's he want?

304
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,941
He said "Give me the seal."

305
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:54,045
Apparently this is more popular
than we realized.

306
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,476
I just don't know what we...
we should do with it.

307
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:58,989
Destroy it.

308
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,384
If you do not, someone could die.

309
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:04,503
I'm afraid someone already has.

310
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:06,543
You mean, the man with the knife
killed someone?

311
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:10,026
Uh, no. Well... not exactly.

312
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,671
You are not telling me everything.

313
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:19,969
You're right, Ampata. And it's time we do.

314
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:24,063
We're not an archaeology club. We're in...

315
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:29,513
We're in the crime club,
which is kinda like the chess club,

316
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:33,720
only with crime and, uh... no chess.

317
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:37,532
Please understand me.
That seal nearly got us killed.

318
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:40,381
It must be destroyed!

319
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:44,897
Ampata!

320
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:56,412
Ampata, listen to me.

321
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:58,704
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I won't let them.

322
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:03,560
Your investigation is dangerous.
I do not want that. Just normal life!

323
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:12,594
Is she OK?

324
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:15,927
Wigged. I'm trying to convince her
that our lives aren't just

325
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:18,602
danger and peril around here.

326
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:22,063
- You should take her to the dance.
- That's a good idea! We'll all go!

327
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,939
- No, I mean just you.
- But you were psyched.

328
00:22:25,974 --> 00:22:29,898
- And your costume.
- I'll see you there.

329
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:33,810
You know what, Willow?
You're my best friend.

330
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,273
I know.

331
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:42,203
I don't get it. Why would
the bodyguard have such a jones

332
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:45,206
for a broken piece of rock?

333
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,742
Well, um... Perhaps...

334
00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:51,238
he needs to put it together
with the other pieces.

335
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:53,974
If he has them.
I mean, we didn't find them.

336
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:57,198
If he didn't,
then they'd still be at the museum.

337
00:22:57,233 --> 00:23:01,262
So maybe we should go there and find them.
And odds are he'll show up too, right?

338
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,248
And hopefully, we'll be ready.

339
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:06,764
Hey! Look at us!
We came up with a plan. A good plan.

340
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:09,829
Right. We'll meet there tonight
after it closes.

341
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:15,035
No! Bad plan.
I have other plans. Dance plans.

342
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:19,967
Cancel plans.

343
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:23,046
OK. I have something to tell you.

344
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,937
And it's kind of a secret
and it's a little bit scary.

345
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,410
I like you... a lot.

346
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,432
And I want you to go...
with me to the dance.

347
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:37,436
Why was that so scary?

348
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:40,049
Well, 'cause you never know
if a girl's gonna say yes...

349
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:43,392
or if... she's gonna laugh in your face
and pull out your still beating heart

350
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:46,298
and... crush it into the ground
with her heel.

351
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:48,729
Then you are very courageous.

352
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:52,418
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

353
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:54,455
- I like you, too.
- Really?

354
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,957
- Really.
- That's great! Really?

355
00:23:56,992 --> 00:23:59,770
- Really.
- That's great!

356
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,586
You're not a praying mantis, are you?

357
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:05,253
Sorry. Someone else.

358
00:24:05,717 --> 00:24:08,887
- I will return to you.
- Where are you going?

359
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:12,140
Where you cannot follow.

360
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,810
I'll... wait outside.

361
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:31,753
I beg you...

362
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:39,167
- do not kill me.
- You are already dead.

363
00:24:39,503 --> 00:24:42,395
For 500 years.

364
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,525
But it was not fair. I was innocent.

365
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,634
The people you kill now...
so that you may live...

366
00:24:49,635 --> 00:24:51,916
They are innocent.

367
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:54,478
Please.

368
00:24:56,397 --> 00:25:00,079
- I am in love.
- You are the Chosen One.

369
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:05,455
You must die. You have no choice.

370
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:15,875
Yes, I do.

371
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,489
I have thought. The dance?

372
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,546
I will go with you.

373
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:36,132
Gladly.

374
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:45,643
Buffy, I do not have any lipstick.

375
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:48,811
Oh, you can borrow one of mine.
There should be some on the desk.

376
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:51,540
- What is that?
- The station sent the rest of your stuff.

377
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:54,767
Of course. I forgot all about it.

378
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:58,353
- I will unpack it later.
- No worries. I can do it.

379
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:03,191
But... you must get ready for the dance.

380
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:05,639
- I'm not going.
- Why not?

381
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:09,731
I have work to do. Crime club work.
It's nothing for you to worry about.

382
00:26:10,018 --> 00:26:13,537
Oh, I am not worried, thanks to Xander.

383
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:18,389
- He seems very happy around you.
- I am happy, too.

384
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,332
Mmm... This one?

385
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:25,856
Oh, no. That clashes. There should be
a gold one in there somewhere.

386
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:30,372
Thank you. You're always thinking
of others before yourself.

387
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:35,503
You remind me of someone from
very long ago. The Inca princess.

388
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:38,366
Cool. A princess.

389
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,959
They told her that she was the only one.

390
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:45,995
That only she could defend her people
from the nether world.

391
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:51,313
Out of all the girls in her generation,
she was the only one...

392
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:55,038
- Chosen.
- You know the story?

393
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:58,080
It's fairly familiar.

394
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:06,117
She was 16, like us. She was offered
as a sacrifice and went to her death.

395
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:11,334
Who knows what she had to give up
to fulfill her duty to others?

396
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,253
What chance at love?

397
00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:17,095
Who knows?

398
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:21,304
I'll just unpack
the rest of your stuff for you.

399
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:23,758
No, really. Let me.

400
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:27,311
That's Xander and Willow. I'll get it.

401
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:48,573
- I've come for the dance.
- And what culture are you?

402
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,100
I'm from the country of Leone.

403
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,464
It's in Italy, pretending to be Montana.

404
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:56,494
Where are you from?
The country of white trash?

405
00:27:56,495 --> 00:27:58,260
Mm. New line-up.

406
00:27:58,295 --> 00:28:02,284
You and Willow are taking Ampata.
Giles and I are hunting mummies.

407
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,435
- Where's you and Willow?
- She's not coming... with us.

408
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,552
Oh! On a date.

409
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,804
Romance. Lips.

410
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:17,180
- Hello, Xander.
- Ho he th-thee ai uh...

411
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:19,556
I can translate
American salivating boy-talk.

412
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:21,065
He says you're beautiful.

413
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,491
- Hav su...
- You're welcome.

414
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:28,674
Ampata, don't you look wonderful!

415
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,129
Oh, I wish you could talk my daughter
into going with you.

416
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:34,821
I tried, but she is very stubborn.

417
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,628
Well, I'm glad someone else sees that.

418
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,786
Well, good night, then.

419
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:50,075
- Be careful.
- I will.

420
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:52,027
Hey!

421
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,991
You look good.

422
00:29:00,203 --> 00:29:02,368
Look at that.

423
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:07,276
Two days in America and Ampata
already seems like she belongs here.

424
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:10,190
She's really fitting in.

425
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:12,931
Yeah.

426
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:15,957
How about that.

00:29:57,321 --> 00:30:00,776
He's like one of those dogs that
you leave at the Grand Canyon on vacation.

438
00:30:00,894 --> 00:30:03,772
It follows you back across four states.

439

See? My own, speechless, human boomerang.

440
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:11,664
He's kinda cute. Maybe it's nice
skipping all that small talk.

441
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:15,162
Small talk.
How about simple instructions?

442
00:30:15,284 --> 00:30:17,715
Get punchy.

443
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:22,378
You. Fruit drinky.

444
00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:25,253
He can follow me.

00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:15,916
Wow. You guys look great.

451
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,978
- I love your costume. It's very authentic.
- Thanks.

452
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:23,296
Yeah. You look, um... snug.

453
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:26,979

Yep. Not at the dance. Not with my friends.
Not with a life. What are you doing here?

458
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:45,215
I thought we were gonna meet
at the museum to find the bodyguard.

459
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,708
No. He's already been found...
in the school rest room, mummified.

460
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:52,723
OK, I don't get it. Why would the mummy
kill her own bodyguard?

461
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:56,958
Well, I've cross-referenced
and I've looked at the pictograms anew.

462
00:31:56,993 --> 00:31:59,408
He was a guard, all right.
But it was his job to ensure

463
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:01,483
that the mummy didn't
awaken and escape.

464
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:04,187
So Ampata translated it wrong?

465
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,062
Perhaps.

466
00:32:06,097 --> 00:32:10,868
Hold on a sec. She was wiggy
about the seal from minute one.

467
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:13,852
Yes, I suppose she was.

468
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:17,737
- Her trunks!
- I beg your pardon?

469
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,212
It's definitely all boys' clothes.

470
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:23,303
Why would a girl pack these?

471
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:31,592
How about this one?

472
00:32:31,593 --> 00:32:35,514

with a mummified corpse...

473
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:39,271
and doesn't even pack lipstick?

00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:32,475
I should have guessed.
Remember Ampata wanted us to hide the seal?

498
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,459
Then she wanted us to destroy it because...

499

Oh, wait!

Uh... waiting.

501
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,600
Well, we already know that the seal
was used to contain the mummy.

502
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:46,310
If breaking it freed her...

503
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:48,821
Reassembling it will trap her.

00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,856
I'll go to the museum.
I'll drop you off.

505
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,802
I'll try and piece together
the fragments there.

506
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:58,884
OK. I'll still get Xander... before
he gets smoochy with mummy dearest.

507
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,180
Have you seen Ampata?

508
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,373
- What was that?
- I shrugged.

509
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,932
Next time you should
probably say "shrug".

510
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:12,254
Sigh.

511
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,371
I thought this exchange student thing
would be a great deal.

512
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:19,947
But look what I got stuck with!
"Momento", "Punchy fruity drinky".

513
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,663
Is Cordelia even from this country?

514
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:41,453
Your hands feel kinda... rough.

515
00:36:44,164 --> 00:36:46,712
Aren't you with Xander?

516
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:52,292
Does it look like I'm with Xander?

517
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:57,887
Ampata!

518
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,057
That's my cue to leave.

519
00:37:09,191 --> 00:37:12,880
There you are. Why'd you run away?

520
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:19,797
Because... I do not deserve you.

521
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:25,511
What... You think that
you don't deserve me?

522
00:37:27,337 --> 00:37:29,666
Man, I love you!

523
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,714
Are those tears of joy?

524
00:37:36,749 --> 00:37:40,431
Pain? Revulsion?

525
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:46,156
I am very happy.

526
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:50,138
And very sad.

527
00:37:51,112 --> 00:37:54,854
Then talk to me. Let me know what's wrong.

528
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:58,348
I can't.

529
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:04,811
Hey, I know why you can't tell me.

530
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:09,420
It's a secret, right?
And if you told me, you'd have to kill me.

531
00:38:10,508 --> 00:38:13,637
Oh! That was a... bad joke.

532
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:16,927
And the delivery was off, too. I'm sorry.

533
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,273
I, uh...

534
00:38:24,272 --> 00:38:26,965
I'm sorry.

535
00:39:05,568 --> 00:39:08,561
No! I can't.

536
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:17,898
Xander, I'm so sorry.

537
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:24,214
"Inca cosmology unites
the bird head with its paler twin."

538
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:31,254
Oh, here. Its paler twin.

539
00:39:35,516 --> 00:39:37,353
The seal.

540
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:44,026
- Where's Xander?
- He's looking for Ampata.

541
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:47,236
We need to find him.
Ampata's the mummy.

542
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:50,450
Oh... Good... Xander!

543
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,529
- Where'd they go?
- Backstage, I think.

544
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:55,497
Hey, I...

545
00:39:57,415 --> 00:39:59,592
Who is that girl?

546
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,754
Are you OK?

547
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:04,298
I think so.

548
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:06,676
Boy, that was some kiss.

549
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:10,384
- Where's Ampata?
- She said something about the seal.

550
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:13,454
- The seal. Giles! Come on.
- What's going on?

551
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:16,467
- He doesn't know?
- We'll tell him on the way.

552
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:36,286
There. That's it.

553
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:38,043
Just one more piece.

554
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:50,390
I'll say one thing for you Incan mummies.
You don't kiss and tell.

555
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:59,387
Looks like you've been
keeping secrets from me,

556
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:06,154
- You're not a normal girl.
- And you are?

557
00:41:25,436 --> 00:41:27,722
This won't hurt.

558
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:29,846
Let her go!

559
00:41:31,893 --> 00:41:35,647
If you're gonna kiss anybody,
it should be me.

560
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:38,150
Xander, we can be together.

561
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:41,278
Just... Just let me have this one.

562
00:41:41,313 --> 00:41:44,912
- That's never gonna happen.
- I must do it.

563
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:48,078
I must do it now,
or it is the end for me and for us.

564
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:49,996
No!

565
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,318
You want life...
you're gonna have to take mine.

566
00:41:57,546 --> 00:41:59,889
Can you do that?

567
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:04,387
Yes.

568
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:05,536
I'm really the fun-talking guy today, huh?

569
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:10,361
- Sorry.
- That's OK. You don't have to talk.

570
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,823
I just, present company excluded,

571
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:17,839
I have the worst taste in women
of anyone in the world. Ever.

572
00:43:17,874 --> 00:43:19,801
Ampata wasn't evil.

573
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:22,618
At least not to begin with.

574
00:43:22,653 --> 00:43:24,767
And I do think she cared about you.

575
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,202
Yeah, but I think that whole
sucking the life out of people thing

576
00:43:27,203 --> 00:43:29,347
would have been
a strain on the relationship.

577
00:43:29,382 --> 00:43:31,733
She was gypped.

578
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:35,534
She was just a girl and she had
her life taken away from her.

579
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,707
I remember how I felt when I heard
the prophecy that I was gonna die.

580
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:44,423
I wasn't exactly obsessed
with doing the right thing.

581
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,796
Yeah, but you did.
You gave up your life.

582
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:52,038
I had you to bring me back.
