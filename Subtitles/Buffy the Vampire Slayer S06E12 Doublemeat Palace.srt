1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,071
- Previously:
- You never had it so good as me.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,079
If you tell anyone about last night,
I will kill you.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,113
So you three have, what,
banded together to be pains in my ass?

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,595
We're your arch nemesises... ses.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,437
You might've beaten us this time,
Slayer, but next time...

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,915
Maybe not.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,191
- Amy? How've you been?
- Rat. You?

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,799
Dead.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,595
It's nice having another
magically inclined friend around.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,280
It's too early to go home yet.
What d'you wanna do?

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,073
- I have a better idea.
- Is it dangerous?

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,997
Let's get outta here.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,037
Dawnie, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,594
- You could've killed her.
- I need help.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,311
No more spells. I'm finished.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,159
There's some money stuff
we have to talk to you about.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,872
You're telling me I'm broke?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,117
- How bad is it?
- Anya says pretty bad.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,870
Buffy, some discussion about
what you're gonna do now.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,278
I've been giving that a lot of thought,
actually, and I think I've figured it out.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,549
I get Warren being the super-villainy type,
but I thought Jonathan learned that lesson.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,636
I've never heard of this other guy.

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,958
You should have seen their headquarters.
It was like the nerd natural habitat.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,594
If we know where they are,
let's do something.

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,632
We tried. Buffy was gonna go in
and bust 'em on the spot.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,718
- I'm sensing a "not so completely".
- She went in and...

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,355
Speaking of Buffy, isn't she ready?
She'll be late for her first day.

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,313
Respect the narrative flow much?

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,954
Please continue the story of failure.

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,594
So Buffy went in, but they'd cleared out.

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,428
And then she brought back
the stuff that they left:

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,238
some spell books, some parchments,

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,558
a couple of rare things -
charmed objects and a conjurer's harp.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,712
And they had other stuff. Razor scooters,
pictures of the Vulcan woman on Enterprise.

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,794
I mean, nerds.

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,196
OK. See, this is why demons
are better than people.

37
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,117
Interesting turn.

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,550
When I was a vengeance demon
I caused pain and mayhem, certainly.

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,719
But I put in a full day's work doing it
and I got compensated appropriately.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,230
Welcome to today's episode of
Go, Money! Go!I hear it daily.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,794
Yep, for the rest of your life.

42
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,278
But supervillains want reward without labour
to make things come easy. It's wrong.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,871
Without labour there can be no payment,
and vice versa. The country cannot progress.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,878
The workers are the tools
that shape America.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,831
Good to know.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,919
I was kind of feeling like a tool.
And now I know why.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,074

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,034
You've seen us in your city or small town,

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,833
ordered delicious food
from our happy employees.

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,475
But now you're seeing it all in a new way
from behind the counter.

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,398
You've just become part of
the Double Meat experience.

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,272
I'm part of it.

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,551
- I'm part of it.
- I'm a part of it, too.

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,658
This cow and chicken don't know it yet,

55
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,996
but they're destined to
become part of it as well.

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,716
So what happens when a cow and a chicken
get together? That's a Double Meat Medley.

57
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,436
Let's take a look now at the process
of harvesting these two special meats.

58
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,836
Holy crap.

59
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,237
.. washing your hands
after each visit to the rest room.

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,511
Follow these rules and
you'll be a happy part...

61
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:24,434
of the Double Meat family for a long time.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,873
- Interesting, isn't it?
- Yes.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,073
Like how the cow and the chicken come
together even though they've never met.

64
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,159
It's like Sleepless in Seattle
if Meg and Tom were, like, minced.

65
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,230
I'm Manny the manager.
It's not a joke. It's just my name.

66
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,319
Right. You mentioned that a couple of times
when I filled out the application.

67
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,351
Why do you want to work here, Buffy?

68
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,631
You seem like a sharp woman
and there are a lot of other jobs.

69
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,272
I kinda need money pretty quickly,
like, today,

70
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:00,357
so I didn't want a lengthy
interview process.

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,268
And I figured this was
probably the fastest way to...

72
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,473
Because I wanted to be part
of the Double Meat experience?

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,116
Come on, let's take a tour.

74
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,190
Phillip, Timothy, this is Buffy.
She's gonna work the counter.

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,117
Hi.

76
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,629
What happened to the other one? Katherine?

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,796
- Emily?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,434
She's gone.

79
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,516
What happened?

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,153
Whatever always happens.

81
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,193
- You can use this one.
- There's someone's stuff in there.

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,636
They must have left it.
You can toss it or keep what you want.

83
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,992
- Sure they're not coming back?
- We have a lot of turnover here.

84
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,950
- Watch these two.
- Are they gonna do something?

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,231
They're solid. Follow their example
and you won't go wrong.

86
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,396
- They're lifers.
- Lifers?

87
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,355
In it for life, like me. You wanna get
something out of this, you'll do the same.

88
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,350
You put the work in, and 10 years from now
you'll be where I am, I promise you.

89
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,273
Congratulations. You're on the clock.

90
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,631
This is the kitchen -
the beating heart of the Double Meat Palace.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,560
- They're all so identical.
- Yeah.

92
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,069
They all start to look the same to me, too.

93
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,670
No, not the employees. The chicken slices.

94
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,989
Yeah. Medley Meal number two -
double-size it.

95
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,272
Drive-through's over there. High-pressure
job. You won't need to go in there.

96
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,172
Over there's the grill, the fryers,
the walk-in freezer.

97
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:00,058
You don't need to go in there either.

98
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,118
That's the dehydrated-pickle storage.

99
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,595
Those are locked.

100
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,472
Now I wanna show you this.

101
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,071
Look. The Double Meat Medley.

102
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,277
I know the Medley. It's just...

103
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:24,355
the video was kind of
graphic with the slaughter.

104
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,632
A classic double-decker with a twist -
a pure beefy patty above the mid-bun

105
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,797
and a slice of processed chicken product
below the mid-bun.

106
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,718
Plus pickles and the secret ingredient.

107
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,037
- Eat it.
- You know, I had a big breakfast.

108
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,469
I'll just wait for...

109
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,596
But it smells so good.

110
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,155
So what is the secret ingredient?

111
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,874
It's a meat process.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,152
Now I think it's time to start earning
your money, don't you, Buffy?

113
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,658
What's the deal with Manny the manager?

114
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,877
And can I write a children's book
called that?

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,753
- Fill this while I get the fries.
- Fill this?

116
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,190
I didn't know there was gonna be
drug testing on this job.

117
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,436
You're funny. You better stop that.

118
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,996
- Why?
- Productivity. One of Manny's watchwords.

119
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,112
"Levity is the time thief
that picks the pocket of a company. "

120
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,552
I prefer "Manny's a humourless dolt who
picks the pocket of he-should-bite-me. "

121
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,035
You really need to be quiet with that.

122
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,356
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

123
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,433
I'd like a small coffee and cherry pie.

124
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,509
That's $1.92, ma'am.

125
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,712
You hit so many buttons,
it was like button-palooza.

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,879
No, it's easy. Look. There are little
pictures of the food on the buttons.

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,754
I hit the coffee button, then I hit
the small button and then cherry pie.

128
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,952
There's a picture of a little fried pie.

129
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,890
Then I hit the total button,
I put the money in the drawer,

130
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:05,469
I close it and it resets the system.

131
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,669
A cocker spaniel could do it.

132
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,236
Why don't you take the next one,
the family? They're regulars.

133
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,909
- Hi. I'm new.
- I come here every day.

134
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,154
- That's nice.
- You really might make it, dear.

135
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,239
Not like some of them,
where suddenly you never see them again.

136
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,319
- I can see you here for a long time.
- That's great.

137
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,356
Thank you.

138
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,958
Hi. Welcome to the Double Meat Palace.
May I help you?

139
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,799
Two number four Medley Meals,
a Junior Medley,

140
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,195
a Fisherman's Medley and a Kid's Meal.

141
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,518
Plus three fries, a chocolaty shake
and extra pickles on one of the Medleys.

142
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,748
Excuse me. This button -
does it look chocolaty to you?

143
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,996
You don't need to be in there.

144
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,509
Sorry. I was just curious.

145
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,313
Curiosity killed the cat.

146
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,033
Theory number five: cat burgers.

147
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,839
Hey, Buffy.

148
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,793
We're supporting
your subsistence-level work. Bravo.

149
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,911
Thank you. This is cool of you guys.

150
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,349
So, Buff, how's it going?

151
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,359
I don't know. I've waitressed before,
but this is different.

152
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,476
- When have you waitressed?
- That summer in LA.

153
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,195
It was a diner and we had, you know,
lots of people who didn't tip,

154
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,440
and funny, funny health-code violations
but it wasn't like it is here.

155
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
I think there's something wrong here.

156
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,678
- Will, are you OK?
- Sorry. Yeah. Something's wrong?

157
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,473
There's this manager, right.

158
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,639
He's all scary and mysterious, you know.
And there's the secret ingredient.

159
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,514
And the people that work here,
they're kind of strange, you know.

160
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,950
They just stare into space,
plus they disappear.

161
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,789
- Disappear "poof"?
- No, not "poof". Well, I don't think so.

162
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,515
It's fast food.
I have swum these murky waters, my friend.

163
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,350
There's the assorted creepiness, staring,
the enthusiastic not-showing-up-at-all.

164
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,994
You're seeing demons
where there's just life.

165
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,558
I didn't say demons. It's just a vibe.
You guys still haven't seen this manager.

166
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,559
Well, isn't that him over there
getting the pickles wet?

167
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,148
- With the saddle shoes?
- And glasses?

168
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,919
I don't know. Maybe it's just the video
that creeped me out,

169
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,559
with the cow and chicken
all swirly together.

170
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,194
Make me hungry, why don't you?

171
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,756
How's about one of those
delicious Medley Meals?

172
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,960
OK, you got it. On me.

173
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,957
Thanks.

174
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,312
She'll be fine once she settles into
the routine. And by ordering, I'm helping.

175
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
- Getting a free meal?
- Well, yeah.

176
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,635
If you like the food here,
maybe we should get it for the reception.

177
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,992
- You're serving burgers? Cool.
- Well, time is running very short.

178
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,159
After Willow gave us the engagement party,
I figured she'd help,

179
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,953
but now that's all been blown to hell.

180
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,073
Standing right here.
Standing right exactly here.

181
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,272
Sorry. Didn't mean to tempt you.

182
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,391
Everyone's so delicate.

183
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,432
Anyway, I still have to select
the bridesmaids' dresses.

184
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,028
Then there are the guests
from the demon realm.

185
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,958
You wouldn't believe
how many have yet to let us know.

186
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,443
There you go, and I double-sized it for ya.

187
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:57,532
Thank you.

188
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,149
And cut way back on the cat.

189
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,555
- Cat?
- Just kidding.

190
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,958
Probably.

191
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,550
Slow night.

192
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,956
Gina.

193
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,836
Since it's slow, you think
they'll mind if I take another break?

194
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,350
We're not allowed. Downtime robs us all.

195
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,677
Thus quoth Manny. There's no one here.

196
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,394
Sure there is. Look.

197
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,269
This'll make my day complete.

198
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,071
- What?
- What's in the Double Meat nuggets?

199
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,872
I'm working. Go away.

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,312
Yeah, and you chose to be in the consumer
service profession, and I'm a consumer.

201
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,637
- Service me.
- Order something or go.

202
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,695
Give a bloke a chance
for his eyes to adjust.

203
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:05,751
Damn fluorescent lights make me look dead.

204
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,350
Some demons love 'em.
The way they vibrate makes the skin twitch.

205
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,516
That the kinda demon you are, love?

206
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,760
I'm not a demon. I don't know why
you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.

207
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,873
I see. That why you took this job?

208
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,073
Prove something to yourself?
A normal job for a normal girl?

209
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,395
Good way to drive yourself crazy, that is.

210
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,476
I'll be fine.

211
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,596
Buffy.

212
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,796
You're not happy here.

213
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,636
Please don't make this harder.

214
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,834
You don't belong here.

215
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,952
You're something... You're better than this.

216
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,996
- I need the money.
- I can get money.

217
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,791
Walk with me now, come on.

218
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,514
I need to go help Gary with the fries.

219
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,195
You gotta get outta here.
This place'll do stuff to you.

220
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,310
This place'll kill you.

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,956
Someone there?

222
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,548
Hi. What are you doing?

223
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,436
Feels like I just left, you know?

224
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,956
You came back.

225
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,796
I came back.

226
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,839
- Gary's gone.
- Gary?

227
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,953
- The guy that helped me out yesterday?
- He didn't show up this morning.

228
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,676
Well, shift's just starting.

229
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,759
He was supposed to unlock
early this morning. Didn't show.

230
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,871
Pull his card.

231
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,039
Well, I'm sure, you know, he's just late.
He didn't seem like he was leaving.

232
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,311
I'm moving Timothy to counter.
You're on grill.

233
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,668
- Me?
- I've been watching you.

234
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,191
But I don't know how to grill.

235
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,999
Just think, this is the last day
you'll ever be able to say that.

236
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,797
You put the beef on the grill,
hit the button, then it beeps.

237
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,071
You flip the beef, hit the other button,
then it beeps.

238
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,350
You put it on the bun.

239
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,994
There's not a button for that.

240
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,076
Repeat until insane.

241
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,709
It eliminates variation.

242
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,309
Every burger at every
Double Meat Palace is the same.

243
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,000
People don't like variation.

244
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,839
Got it. Variety is the spice of bad.

245
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,069
So, what's the secret ingredient?

246
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,591
It's a meat process.

247
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,516
- Well, what does that mean?
- It's a process. They do it to the meat.

248
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,553
- But what is it?
- It's just the name of the process.

249
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,196
Yeah.

250
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,755
So I guess we're gonna get kinda greasy.

251
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,913
Skin, hair,

252
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,355
eyelashes,

253
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,472
nostrils.

254
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,556
Inside your ears.

255
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,830
You wanna look inside my ears?

256
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,436
No. No, that's OK.

257
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,235
Once I noticed I couldn't hear
and went to the doctor.

258
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,875
He said it was grease that made a plug.

259
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,635
I got me a kit. A kit for cleaning my ears.

260
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,115
It's got this little bulb mechanism.

261
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,636
Imagine that.

262
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,113
Buffy?

263
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,189
It's Manny.

264
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,550
- You're working a double shift.
- What?

265
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,514
Another eight hours
right after these eight hours?

266
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,916
But that's so many hours.

267
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,589
You get paid for it.
Plus an extra free Double Meat Medley.

268
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,154
What happened? Why the double shiftiness?

269
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,477
Gary didn't show.
And now one of my grinder guys is late too.

270
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,832
But they could still show up, right?
I mean, they could be anywhere.

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,911
Your meat's here.

272
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,998
Yeah, OK. Bye.

273
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,476
An, that was Buffy.
She's working late, so I might have to go...

274
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,030
I have been called
and vengeance shall I wreak.

275
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,712
Cower, masculine one.
Tremble as you face my wrath.

276
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,877
I'm starting to think
we should do a potluck thing.

277
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,513
Honey.

278
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Hello. I am here to tear this man apart.
How many pieces do you wish?

279
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,113
- Halfrek.
- Anyanka?

280
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,470
My God.

281
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,512
How are you? How are you?

282
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,995
You two, you know each other?

283
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,078
I didn't summon you to kill Xander.
I called to invite you to our wedding.

284
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,510
What an embarrassing mistake.

285
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,870
Gorgeous.

286
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,552
You two clearly have some catching up to do,
so I'll not be in the apartment.

287
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,516
It's swell to see you again. I didn't mean
to have you materialise all the way here.

288
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,519
- Not until the ceremony, I mean.
- I guess I got the message garbled.

289
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,191
You know how it is. Half the time
I have no idea if I'm maiming the right guy.

290
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,189
So, you're marrying that man
with the large upper arms?

291
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,550
- Yes.
- Why?

292
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,953
Well, because I love him.

293
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,432
We're gonna be very happy together.

294
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,079
What?

295
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,277
It's boiling with nothing in it.
Sometimes it does that.

296
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,356
They say bugs fall in there.

297
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,559
I'm back. You can go on your break now.

298
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,437
Come in.

299
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,915
It's me. Dawn said I could come up.

300
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,992
So, is she pissed at you too or just at me?

301
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,075
What did you tell her about me?

302
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,310
D'you want something?

303
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,188
Yeah, actually. I mean,
I don't know if you wanted to keep it or...

304
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,669
You want it? Really?

305
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,634
Well, yeah, you know.
I mean, it's not much, but it's home.

306
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,035
Or it was.

307
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,994
- I don't know. I guess it's stupid.
- No, it's not stupid.

308
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,475
You can have it, of course.

309
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,757
So I hear you got this whole
cold turkey thing going on.

310
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,031
- How's that going?
- It's good. It's really good.

311
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,932
I mean, it was hard at first.

312
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:56,374
Frustrating doing everything the slow way.

313
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,513
It was like "Is everything
gonna take for ever, for ever?"

314
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,719
Yeah.

315
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,356
But it's better now.
I'm getting my focus back.

316
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,871
I can see that.

317
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,711
It's a pivotal page.

318
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,719
So this is it? This is gonna be
your life from now on?

319
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,990
What?

320
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,314
No.

321
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,951
Well, you're never gonna do it again. Ever.

322
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,198
You're never gonna
feel how it made you feel.

323
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,429
Don't think that's the way to look at it.

324
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,949
Will.

325
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,036
It's your birthday.

326
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,155
No, it isn't. But now that you mention it,
Buffy's is coming...

327
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,430
Potestas.

328
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,276
What?

329
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,874
Amy.

330
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,072
It's a gift. It's magic.

331
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,112
And it didn't come from you.
It came from me.

332
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,196
Completely legal.

333
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,236
Enjoy.

334
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,275
- Look what I found under the meat grinder.
- My God.

335
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,358
- Wanna tell me what's going on?
- I'm not sure.

336
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,277
Try again.

337
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,393
Well, there was an accident, maybe,
six weeks ago. A grinder incident.

338
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,239
Right, but this isn't six weeks old.
This is new.

339
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,070
It is? Well, maybe Gary did
come in this morning or late last night.

340
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,476
Maybe there was an accident
and he got himself to the hospital.

341
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,989
Right. Maybe he's in the hospital.

342
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,759
Or maybe he's in the grinder.

343
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,075
Meat process? Secret ingredient?

344
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,954
Maybe Gary's on the grill.
Or maybe he's under the pickle chips.

345
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,911
Buffy. Buffy.

346
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,277
Stop. Stop. Everybody, you have to stop.

347
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,994
Stop eating. No, you can't eat it.

348
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,352
It's not beef. It's people.
The Double Meat Medley is people.

349
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,233
The meat layer is definitely people.
It's people.

350
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,830
Probably not the chickeny part.
But who knows? Who knows?

351
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,159
What about the cherry pie?

352
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,552
What are you doing?
I thought you were part of the team.

353
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,678
You are fired.

354
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,555
Tell me more about Xander.

355
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,359
You keep asking about him.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?

356
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,835
- Do you?
- No.

357
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,274
Xander, he...

358
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,073
He's very kind and brave.

359
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,432
And he has the sweetest smile
and the nicest body, and he loves me.

360
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,755
Sometimes it isn't easy, but he does.

361
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,792
Who told you that it isn't easy to love you?

362
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,675
Well, I'll do something or say something

363
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,937
and then he has to say stuff like...

364
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,794
"It's incorrect for you to
appreciate money so much"

365
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,878
or "Observe: here is how
a real human would behave. "

366
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,230
So he corrects you?

367
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,156
Well, no, it's just...

368
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,944
Well, now I'm all confused.
You think there's something wrong with...

369
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:08,197
the way he treats me?

370
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,639
Do you?

371
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,194
OK, you have to stop doing that.
I love Xander.

372
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,276
Even though he thinks he knows better?

373
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,996
- But he doesn't. He doesn't think that.
- OK. I'm sorry. I was just curious.

374
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,193
You don't have to say another thing about it
if you're not comfortable.

375
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,116
But I am. I mean, it's not like
I'm hiding any deficiencies or anything.

376
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,468
I have absolutely no threes.

377
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,556
Go fish.

378
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,035
I call an emergency meeting, and this is it?
Where's Willow? Anya?

379
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,118
I couldn't find Willow.
I knocked and knocked on her door.

380
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,993
Anya's entertaining
a vengeance demon named Hallie.

381
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,113
Say, Buff, did you ever see Anya as a demon?
Cos if that's it, whoa.

382
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,153
There's something wrong
at the Double Meat Palace. Really wrong.

383
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,272
Have you been demon-fighting?
Is that why you smell funny?

384
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,356
No. I'm talking about...

385
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,154
That's great. That's just great.

386
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,883
I try to get an ordinary job
in a well-lit place...

387
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:12,638
and, look, I'm right back where I started.

388
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,194
Blood and death and funky smells.

389
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,630
Look. Look what I found near the grinder.

390
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,955
- Whose is that?
- I don't know.

391
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,153
It might be this guy named Gary,
the only one who didn't seem all braindead.

392
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,600
He didn't show up this morning. Except
now I think he was there the whole time...

393
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:33,479
as the secret ingredient.

394
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,639
We need to analyse that burger.
We need to find out if it used to be people.

395
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,079
What?

396
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,440
- People?
- Xander, you ate the burger?

397
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,113
First you say it's cat, then you come in,
hand me a burger, blah blah blah.

398
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,219
Five minutes later "And by
the way it happens to be...

399
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,199
hot, delicious human flesh. "

400
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,915
I needed that burger to analyse it.
Now I'm gonna have to get another one.

401
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,079
That's your problem with this scenario?
You getting seconds?

402
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,556
Late. Late. Sorry. I was reading for school.

403
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:05,912
Well, highlighting anyway. Anyway, late.

404
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,554
Yeah, you just missed the Gary burger.

405
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,674
What are we doing? Let's jump right in.
Did Xander say something about food?

406
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,592
You wouldn't want any. Apparently,
the Double Meat Medley is people.

407
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,149
Bad.

408
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,271
I bet it's not even just this one time.

409
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,949
Or even this one town. There are
Double Meat Palaces all over California.

410
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,594
- I've eaten there a lot.
- Everyone has.

411
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,554
They've got the perfect deal -
everyone expects high turnover of workers.

412
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,875
They get the meat for nothing and...

413
00:28:39,141 --> 00:28:41,800
and they have us disposing of the bodies.
How sick is that?

414
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,718
We need to bring down
the whole corporation.

415
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,958
Will, Xander ate the burger. Is there
any way for sure to figure out what it was?

416
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,915
Yeah, I can start analysing it with science.
Not... I can use science.

417
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,473
You ate it?

418
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,673
We have the wrapper. There's little
scribbles of meat on the wrapper.

419
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,588
You work on that. It's after closing,
so I'm gonna go see what I can find out.

420
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,553
Cool. You go. We'll be good.

421
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,309
Are you OK?

422
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,479
I'm just worried about Buffy.
She could be walking into anything.

423
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,518
Manny?

424
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,556
Manny?

425
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,995
Guess you really were a lifer.

426
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,510
Don't need magic.
Don't need it. Don't need it.

427
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,754
My friend Janice - her sister's a lawyer.

428
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,236
You think I should sue over the burger?
That's interesting.

429
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,916
No, I just mean...

430
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,111
Buffy's never gonna be
a lawyer or a doctor, anything big.

431
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,949
She's a Slayer. She saves the whole world.
That's way bigger.

432
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,790
But that means she's gonna have crap jobs
her whole life, right? Minimum-wage stuff.

433
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,718
I could still grow up to be anything.

434
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,673
But for her, this is it.

435
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,937
OK, but maybe you'll be a lawyer
or a doctor,

436
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:02,434
and you can support your deadbeat sister.

437
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,748
That's terrifically better. Thanks.

438
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,109
- Guys, I think I've got it.
- Good job, Will.

439
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,949
- Those aren't, like, potions, are they?
- No. No potions.

440
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,074
It's not magic. It's chemistry.
You can tell by how damn slow it is.

441
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,478
I made a solution that reacts
to the proteins in human blood.

442
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,558
So we're pretty close
to knowing for certain.

443
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,990
I'm here. I'm here.

444
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,636
- We're doing chemistry.
- So sorry I hurried.

445
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,320
Did your friend have a good time,
and then leave?

446
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,998
She's gone.

447
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,874
So, An, the way she looked, with the face...

448
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,434
That wasn't what
you used to look like, was it?

449
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,916
Something wrong with that?
Did you think she was unattractive?

450
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,396
Is there any answer to that question
that won't make you nuts?

451
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,080
Halfrek was always considered
to be a great beauty.

452
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,395
Well, hon, she was a little...

453
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,317
There was some veininess.

454
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,510
Hold this.

455
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,634
OK. If the solution reacts to the proteins,
then I'll be able to see it.

456
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,389
I mean, I'll be able to look through
the microscope and then see it.

457
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,312
You're not so perfect either,

458
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,355
what with your strangely large upper arms
and your tendency to criticise.

459
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,078
- What do you see?
- There's no reaction.

460
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,555
God, no. There's no reaction.

461
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,956
- Which means it's not human.
- It's not human.

462
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,429
- It's not human?
- Well, is it demon meat?

463
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,350
I mean, maybe someone's killing demons
and using them as a cheap source of meat.

464
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,072
We've all heard of that.

465
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,432
I'm opposed to using demon meat, no matter
how much money it saves. Surprise you?

466
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,471
Again, I say "Huh?"

467
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,912
No, I'm not sure what I'm seeing. Cellulose?

468
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,588
There's something weird here.

469
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,476
Scalp?

470
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,791
Wig.

471
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,717
Wig lady?

472
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,353
Oh, dear.

473
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,836
"Wig lady. " Is that what they call me?

474
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,080
I don't care for that.

475
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,953
I mean, I have to do something to hide this.

476
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,636
It's paralysing. Don't try to move, dear.
You really can't, much.

477
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,273
The paralysis spreads upward, by the way.

478
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,757
You may want to flail your arms a bit
while you still can.

479
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,796
Did I tell you? You're my favourite.

480
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,356
Double Meat workers.

481
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,217
You're so full of Double Meat burgers...

482
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:15,955
and you just slide down so smooth.

483
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,640
I just love the paralysis.

484
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,228
It means I can eat you slowly.

485
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,912
I know you're under there.

486
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,669
Buffy? Are you in there?
I can't see you inside.

487
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,075
Buffy, if you're in there,
the burger isn't people.

488
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,672
They aren't even meat. It's all
processed vegetables. Isn't that weird?

489
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,719
Buffy, there's more.
Something happened today.

490
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,595
It wasn't my fault. It was Amy's fault,
but I feel so bad about it.

491
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,648
It was Amy's power, but it felt like
I was doing everything myself.

492
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:22,750
And I couldn't stop.

493
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,159
And now it's gone and I feel kinda shaky
and like I need it, Buffy.

494
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,954
Buffy, something fell.

495
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,599
Buffy.

496
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,869
Visitors. How nice.

497
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,273
Missed me.

498
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,796
Buffy!

499
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,517
Buffy, are you all right?

500
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,279
Paralysed, but I think it's wearing off.

501
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,595
I did it. I killed her, Buffy. Look.

502
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,959
Amy.

503
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,635
Can I come in? My new place isn't set up
and I wanted to borrow detergent.

504
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,354
You really can't.

505
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,596
I can't borrow detergent?

506
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,110
When they call me Stinky Amy
I'm just gonna say "Not my fault. "

507
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,913
I can't spend time with you any more.

508
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,271
- What?
- You can't come in here again.

509
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,472
What's up? You didn't like
your birthday present?

510
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,999
That's right.

511
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,514
You're telling me that
you didn't have a genuine blast?

512
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,395
Come on, that was a sweet spell. It was
like a trip to Disneyland without the lines.

513
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,876
You don't get it.
What you did to me was wrong.

514
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,551
Do you have any idea how much harder
that makes just everything?

515
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,715
You know what I notice?
You're not denying that you had fun.

516
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,910
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

517
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,397
Sharp argument you got there.
Were you on the debate team? I forget.

518
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,069
I forgot a lot while you were
failing to make me be not a rat.

519
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,036
Amy, if you really are my friend,
you better stay away from me.

520
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,280
And if you really aren't,
you better stay away from me.

521
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,875
Yeah?

522
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,755
Hi. You must be the new manager.
I'm Buffy Summers.

523
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,555
I'm Lorraine Ross. They called me in
when Manny did his disappearing act.

524
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,240
You hear about that? Guy just disappeared.

525
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,672
Yeah. I think that used to
happen a lot around here.

526
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,109
Wait. Buffy Summers?

527
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,198
I heard about you. Caused a big scene.

528
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,352
Yeah.

529
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,190
Practical jokes not really right for
the workplace. I so get that now.

530
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,118
Anyway, I just wanted to return my uniform.

531
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,196
Most people don't even bother.

532
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,989
The Double Meat Medley is vegetables?

533
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,230
How do you know that?

534
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,316
So I guess it's true.

535
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,870
Close the door?

536
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,916
Have a seat.

537
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,158
It's a texturised, vegetable-based,
meat-like product, suitable for grinding.

538
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,670
It's blended with large amounts
of rendered beef fat for flavour.

539
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,156
The secret ingredient
in the beef is beef?

540
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,159
Buffy, you know something powerful here.
Do you understand that?

541
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,956
The Double Meat reputation
is built on a foundation of, well, meat.

542
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,674
You can't spread this around.

543
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,756
I get that.

544
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,318
- It's a valuable secret, isn't it?
- Is there something you want?

545
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,878
- I really need money.
- You want money?

546
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,233
No. Well, I mean, yes, but, no,
I want to work.

547
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,318
See, I have zero money coming in,
and there are expenses.

548
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,558
And by the time I interview for a new job
and go through a training process...

549
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,355
I'd really like to not be fired any more.

550
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,789
I don't want any more practical jokes.
I mean it.

551
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,070
I promise.

552
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,557
Well, I'm a little short-handed right now
and you're already trained.

553
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,874
I think you can not be fired.

554
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,278
Thank you. That's great.
I can do the job. I promise that, too.

555
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,277
I certainly hope so.

556
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,916
I don't like short-timers, Buffy.
I like people who want to be here.

557
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,956
Maybe you didn't take this job seriously
before, but from now on... See this?

558
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,470
I want you to be shooting for this
from here on out.

559
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,800
Right. Here on out.
