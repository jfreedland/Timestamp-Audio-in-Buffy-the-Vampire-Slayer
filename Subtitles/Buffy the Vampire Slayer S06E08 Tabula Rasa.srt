00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,718
Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,558
- We're getting married.
- Did you know?

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,877
He couldn't imagine his life without me.
Then he gave me this.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,752
Ante up.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,348
You play for kittens?

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,313
Have you spoken to Dawn
about that incident at Hallowe'en?

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,873
I thought you took care of that.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,230
- Right.
- What would I do without you?

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,952
You are using too much magic.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,548
What do you want me to do?
Keep my mouth shut?

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,829
That'd be a start.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,315
Let's just forget it ever happened.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,553
Forget.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,275
But I think I was in Heaven.
I was torn out of there.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,309
Pulled out by my friends.

16

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,553
Can we talk?

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,309
Vocal-cord-wise? Yes.
With each other? No.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,435
We have to talk.

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,516
About what?

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,356
We kissed, Buffy.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,038
So?

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,277
We... We kissed, you and me.

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,030
All Gone With The Wind, with the rising
music, and the rising... music.

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,435
- And what was that?
- A spell?

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,516
Don't get all prim and proper on me.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,234
I know what kind of girl you really are.

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,998
Don't I?

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,157
What we did is done.
But I will never kiss you, Spike,

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,238
never touch you, ever, ever again.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,475
Now, easy, boys.
No need to get physical, like.

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,555
Is there, Mr Spike?

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,513
- You know this guy?
- Yeah. What do you want?

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,074
Me?

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,476
There are a lot of things
I would like, Mr Spike.

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,395
A house in Bel Air
with a generously sized swimming pool.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,958
And, of course,
the 40 Siamese that you owe me.

38
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,153
- Take it easy. You'll get your kittens.
- Oh, I trust you, Mr Spike.

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,157
Oh, God! What is it with you guys?

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,432
Why kittens? Why can't you
just use money like everybody else?

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,553
- She's funny. I like "funny" in a girl.
- I just need a little more time.

42
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,595
Time, time! Time is
what turns kittens into cats.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,476
Look, I don't wanna see
anyone get hurt. Boys.

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,634
Then you better close your eyes.

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,271
I said she was the Slayer, boss.

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,153
Ah, good for you.

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,115
The Vampire Slayer! Have you ever
given any thought to freelance work?

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,710
A little debt collecting, perhaps?

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,991
- No, thank you.
- Boss, he's gone.

50
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,750
- Spike has split.
- Well, that's what I get for socialising.

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,634
All right, come on, boys.
We'll locate Mr Spike and...

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,909
talkto him a little more.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,630
It was a genuine pleasure.

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,277
If I were to stop saving his life,
it would simple things up so much.

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,239
Do you think she walked around
on clouds wearing like...

56
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:39,518
Birkenstocks and played a harp?

57
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,108
Cos those are just not flattering.

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,199
You know, the clonky sandals. Not a harp.

59
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,595
Who doesn't look good with a harp?

60
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,074
What? I'm just saying what
everyone's thinking. Right, baby?

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,437
You are attractive with many good qualities.

62
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,916
It's totally not stupid to wonder
what it was like for Buffy.

63
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,873
But it could have been one
of a zillion heavenly dimensions.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,436
All we know is that it was a good place
and she was happy there.

65
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,836
We took her away from that.
We wrecked it for her.

66
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,315
We didn't wreck. We didn't know.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,355
We didn't wanna know.

68
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,598
We were so selfish.
Iwas so selfish.

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,028
Maybe we were.

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,711
I just feel weird feeling bad that my
friend's not dead. It's too mind-boggling.

71
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,593
So I've decided to simplify the whole thing.

72
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,508
Me like Buffy. Buffy's alive. So me glad.

73
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,353
Not to be Miss Psycho Pep Squad, but
we must stop obsessing about what we did

74
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,199
and start trying to make
things better for Buffy.

75
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,117
I'm with Miss Psycho Pep Squad.

76
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,913
We need to spend more time with her.
Just hang out.

77
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,519
Maybe have weekly dinners
over here. Or a book club.

78
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,710
Short books. Videos.

79
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,070
I can fix it. I know a spell.

80
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,350
No! No more spells.

81
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,637
Then what? This isn't something
that's gonna be fixed by a video club.

82
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,822
I know I messed up, OK?
And I wanna fix it.

83
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:16,791
I can't believe we're
talking about this again.

84
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,514
You know how powerful magic is,
how dangerous.

85
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,995
You could hurt someone.
You could hurt yourself.

86
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,829
But I know a spell that will make her
forget she was ever in Heaven.

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,757
What is wrong with you?

88
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,855
I'm gonna go get that phone
you probably don't hear.

89
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,635
High-pitched ring. Ears like a dog.

90
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,115
I'm gonna help you with that.

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,829
Do you think I'm stupid?

92
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,872
I know you used that spell on me.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,278
- Tara, I'm sorry.
- Don't! Just... don't.

94
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,752
- There's nothing you can say.
- Tara, I didn't mean to...

95
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,236
To what? Violate my mind like that?

96
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,919
How could you, Willow?

97
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,918
How could you, after what Glory did to me?

98
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,196
Violate you?

99
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,595
I didn't mean anything like that.

100
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,316
I just wanted us not to fight any more.

101
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,557
- I love you.
- If you don't wanna fight, you don't fight.

102
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,035
You don't use magic
to make a fight disappear.

103
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,278
But I just wanted to make things better.
Better for us.

104
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,676
But you don't get to decide
what is better for us, Will.

105
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,997
We're in a relationship.
We are supposed to decide together.

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,156
OK.

107
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,475
I realise I did it wrong.

108
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,194
You did it the way you're doing everything.

109
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,791
When things get rough,
you don't even consider the options.

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,388
You just... you just do a spell.

111
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,637
It's not good for you, Willow.

112
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,830
And it's not what magic is for.

113
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,353
But I just wanna help people.

114
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,029
Maybe that's how it started,
but you're helping yourself now,

115
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,232
fixing things to your liking.

116
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,839
Including me.

117
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,916
Tara, no!

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,150
I don't think this is gonna work.

119
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,436
It is. It's working.

120
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,590
Tara, please.

121
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,678
I need you, baby. I need you.

122
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,272
I don't need magic. I don't. I...

123
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,554
Let me prove it to you, OK?
I will go a month without doing any magic.

124
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,831
I won't do a single spell. I swear.

125
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,750
Go a week, one week without magic.

126
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,713
Fine. Fine. That's easy.

127
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,950
Go a week, and then we'll see.

128
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,635
I don't know, I just think we both
need some - I don't know - space?

129
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,551
I can't believe I'm saying this.

130
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,319
Are you saying you're gonna leave me?

131
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,636
I have to.

132
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,073
You have to be strong. I'm trying to...

133
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,236
Trying to what?

134
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,229
Desert me? Abandon me? Leave me
all alone when I really need somebody?

135
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,754
- I don't want to leave.
- So don't.

136
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,876
Please, don't.

137
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,878
- I can't do this without you.
- You can.

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,956
That's why I'm going.

139
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,219
As long as I stay,
you'll always turn to me...

140
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,358
if something comes up that you feel
you can't handle.

141
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,835
And I'll step in because...

142
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,952
because I can't bear to see you suffer.

143
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,517
Me, too. Hate suffering.
Had about as much of it as I can take.

144
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,599
Believe me, I'm loath
to cause you more, but this...

145
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,751
I taught you all I can
about being the Slayer,

146
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:14,632
and your mother taught you about life.

147
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,512
You...

148
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,075
You're not gonna trust that
until you're forced to stand alone.

149
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,910
But why now? Now that you know
where I've been? What I'm going through?

150
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,679
Now more than ever.

151
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,917
The temptation to give up
will be overwhelming. I can't let...

152
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,191
So I won't. No giving up.

153
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,118
You can be here and I can still be strong.

154
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,277
Buffy, I've thought this over and over.

155
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,794
I believe it's the right thing to do.

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,752
You're wrong.

157
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,314
Willow, come on. You ready?

158
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,948
Not so much. You go ahead. Tell Giles
to hold up. I'll be there in a sec.

159
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,992
Fine.

160
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,874
Hurry up. You don't wanna miss
the lowdown on our latest featured creature.

161
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,277
For Buffy and Tara, this I char.

162
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,430
Let Lethe's Bramble do its chore.

163
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,074
Purge their minds of memories grim

164
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,794
of pains from recent slights and sins.

165
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,393
When the fire goes out, when the crystal
turns black, the spell will be cast.

166
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,876
Tabula rasa. Tabula rasa. Tabula rasa.

167
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,432
- So what have we got?
- Sorry?

168
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,476
What kind of oogly-booglies? Lizardy
types or zombies or vampires, or what?

169
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,595
There are no oogley-boogleys, Dawn.

170
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,720
Thanks for the jacket. It's cold out there.

171
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,230
Not a problem. The cold only makes
me stronger and more macho-like.

172
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,956
I'm glad you're here.

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,389
I have something to tell you all.

174
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,438
I know it feels like we've
been through this before.

175
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,950
Why don't you just jump to the chase?
Tell them that you're...

176
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,477
- Spike?
- Holy moly!

177
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,239
- You need to give me asylum.
- I'll say.

178
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,272
No need to get cute. It's a disguise.

179
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,718
Happens there's a bloke
I'd rather not see just now.

180
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,878
You met him. Toothy bloke
with baby-seal breath. Nasty fellow.

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,232
Ugly, too. A mouthful of choppers waiting
to be yanked out and worn as necklaces.

182
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,075
Well, now we've recovered
from Spike's sartorial humour,

183
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,393
I'll jump to the chase.

184
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,236
I'm headed back to England.

185
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,591
And I plan to stay. Indefinitely.

186
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,874
Now? Not now.
I mean, not after... everything.

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,992
- Yes, now.
- For real this time?

188
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,380
Cos honest to Pete, a shopkeeper's heart
can only take so much.

189
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,398
Not that I want you to go.

190
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,229
I can't do this. I just... I need to...

191
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,391
Buffy, listen.

192
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,831
I know this must be awful for you.

193
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,997
And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for...

194
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,350
"I'm sorry. " Everybody's sorry.

195
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,035
I know that you guys
are just trying to help, but it's too much.

196
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,113
And I can't take it any more.

197
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,915
If you guys...

198
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,349
If you guys understood how it felt.

199
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,675
How it feels.

200
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,995
It's like I'm dying.

201
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,631
Hello?

202
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,950
Who are you people?

203
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,514
- Don't worry.
- Please don't hurt me.

204
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,393
It's OK. I don't know anyone here either.

205
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,877
Yeah? Who are you?

206
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,316
OK. Who are you freaks?

207
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,234
- You don't know me?
- Not a clue.

208
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,476
But you were just all, like, "Oh, hey. "

209
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,319
Cos I thought you were a girl
and I'd remember, but...

210
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,912
I am a girl. I'm not sure
who I am exactly, but...

211
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,077
OK. Why was I on the ground?
And why are you all staring at me?

212
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,279
Is this some psych test? Am I getting paid?

213
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:28,352
It's not just you.

214
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,914
Does anyone remember anything?

215
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,516
No.

216
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,270
Well, maybe we all got terribly drunk,
and this is some sort of blackout.

217
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,154
- I don't think I drink.
- I don't see any booze.

218
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,600
I don't feel any head bumps.

219
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,110
- I don't see Allen Funt.
- Who?

220
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,677
OK. I'm not panicking. I'm not. I'm not.
Stop looking at me like I'm panicking.

221
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,156
Hey, take it easy, guy.
OK. No one's hurt, right?

222
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,638
And none of us look all hatchety-murdery,
so we're probably safe here.

223
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,790
Wherever "here" is.

224
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,434
Look at this stuff on these shelves.

225
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,154
Weird jars of weird stuff.

226
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,870
Weird books with weird covers,
like Magic for Beginners.

227
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,151
This is a magic shop. A real magic shop.

228
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,272
Maybe that's it.
Maybe something magic happened.

229
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,154
Magic? Magic's all balderdash and chicanery.

230
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,952
I'm afraid we don't know a bloody thing.

231
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,390
Except I seem to be British,
don't I? And a man.

232
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,709
With glasses. Well, that
narrows it down considerably.

233
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,241
I don't like this.

234
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:43,197
Don't worry. We'll take care of each other.

235
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,313
We'll get our memory back.
It'll all be right as rain.

236
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,467
Listen to Mary Poppins!

237
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,230
He's got his crust all stiff and
upper with that nancy-boy accent.

238
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,034
You Englishmen are always so...

239
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,679
Bloody hell. Sodding, blimey,
shagging, knickers, bollocks.

240
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,634
- Oh, God. I'm English.
- Welcome to the nancy tribe.

241
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,320
You don't suppose you and I...

242
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,194
- We're not related, are we?
- There is a ruggedly handsome resemblance.

243
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,394
And you do inspire a...

244
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,957
well, a particular feeling
of familiarity and...

245
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,956
disappointment.

246
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,913
- Older brother?
- Father.

247
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,837
- Oh God, how I must hate you.
- What did I do?

248
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,633
There's always something.
What's with the trollop?

249
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,715
- Hey!
- Her?

250
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,479
- I saw you. Sleeping together.
- Resting together.

251
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,670
Look!

252
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,836
It's OK. We're engaged.

253
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,717
- It's a lovely ring.
- Great.

254
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,400
- A tarty stepmom, half old Daddy's age.
- Tarty?

255
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,512
Old? You little twerp.
I'm young enough to still get carded.

256
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,870
Carded! Driver's licences.

257
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,117
It's me. "Alexander Harris. "

258
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,272
Cute picture. Hey, I exist.

259
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,234
I'm Willow Rosenberg.
Willow. Funny name.

260
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,238
- I think it's pretty.
- What d'you got?

261
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,238
Tara. And look,
I'm a student at UC Sunnydale.

262
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,158
Me, too. Hey, maybe we're study buddies.

263
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,990
I don't have a wallet.

264
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,429
Don't worry. Me neither.

265
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,796
But here, look.

266
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,629
- You're Dawn.
- Or Umad.

267
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,558
I'm called Rupert Giles.

268
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,274
- Rupert.
- Rupert!

269
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,755
You're not too old to put across my knee,
you know, sonny.

270
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,235
Anyway, what did I call you?

271
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,515
"Made with care for Randy. "

272
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,877
Randy Giles?

273
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,675
Why not just call me "Horny" Giles,
or "Desperate for a shag" Giles?

274
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,715
- I knew there was a reason I hated you.
- Randy's a family name, undoubtedly.

275
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,596
Hey, I have a name on my jacket.

276
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,839
- Harris.
- Harris? That's my last name.

277
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,838
Maybe I have a brother
and you go out with him.

278
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,076
Or maybe you go out with me.

279
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,718
We did wake up all snuggly-wuggly.
Maybe you're my boyfriend.

280
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,229
Either that, or I got one
pissed-off brother.

281
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,273
I'm Anya! This key fits this lock.

282
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,838
And the forms next to the cash register say
that Rupert and Anya own the shop together.

283
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,713
This is our magic shop?

284
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,196
That's very progressive of me.

285
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,793
- So you don't have a name?
- Of course I do.

286
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,150
- I just don't happen to know it.
- You want me to name you?

287
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,238
That's sweet,
but I think I can name myself.

288
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,319
I'll name me... Joan.

289
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,636
What? Did you just "ugh" my name?

290
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,910
No! I just...

291
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,039
I mean, it's so blah. Joan?

292
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,118
I like it. I feel like a Joan.

293
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,916
Fine. That's your purgative.

294
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,429
- Prerogative.
- Whatever, Joan.

295
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,357
Whatever, Umad.

296
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,153
- Boy, you're a pain in the...
- Boy, you're bossy.

297
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,635
- Do you think we're...?
- Sisters?

298
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,276
You never showed me affection like that.

299
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,312
- I'd wager.
- We need to figure out what's going on.

300
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,830
- We need to get help.
- Looks like Joan fancies herself the boss.

301
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,235
- We have a kid here.
- A teenager.

302
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,911
A teenager. And we have no idea what's
wrong with us. A hospital's our best bet.

303
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,358
Yes. Let's head out.

304
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,674
Any suggestions on how to get there?

305
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,634
Dad can drive. He's bound to have
some classic midlife-crisis transport.

306
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,069
Something red, shiny, shaped like a penis.

307
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,515
- Did you guys see that?
- Vampires!

308
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,596
- Maybe it's Hallowe'en.
- Doesn't feel like it.

309
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,833
Even if it is, those guys are not kids,
and those are definitely not costumes.

310
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,758
- Randy's right. We have vampires.
- Slayer!

311
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,998
- They're definitely not knocking for candy.
- We need to check for other doors,

312
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,351
make sure they're locked,
then put large objects in front of 'em.

313
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,468
Monsters are real. Did we know this?

314
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,115
I don't know. But we need our memories
back. We have to get to a hospital.

315
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,073
As proprietor of a magic shop,
I propose we fight them.

316
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,159
We can use things in the shop.
Magic tricks, or whatever they're called.

317
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,150
Send out Spike!

318
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,156
They seem to want spikes.

319
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,280
- Here. Let's give 'em these.
- Well done.

320
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,436
- What are they going to do with them?
- Slayer, come out and play!

321
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,518
"Slay her." That's just
what they said before.

322
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,838
- They're gonna use the spikes to...
- To slay someone? A female someone.

323
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,272
- Who do those jerks think they are?
- Bloodsuckers. They kill by sucking blood.

324
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,519
You guys.

325
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,794
There's a trap door.
It seems to lead to the sewer.

326
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,273
Let's go!

327
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,355
I'm not sure what I am, so bear with me.
"Now I lay me down to sleep... "

328
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,072
Shema Yisrael.

329
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,033
- You owe us.
- Fine. Take your damn spikes.

330
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,551
- Don't be stupid.
- Get your hands off me, you son of a...

331
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,557
- I said, you owe us.
- Who? Me?

332
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,240
- You've got the boss's kittens.
- Kittens?

333
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,915
Hey! Stay away from Randy.

334
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,633
- Whoa!
- What did you just do?

335
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,589
I don't know.

336
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,109
But it was cool.

337
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,994
The boss ain't gonna like this!
I'll be back. And I won't be alone!

338
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,278
I think I know why Joan's the boss.

339
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,630
I'm like a superhero or something.

340
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,232
The boys wanna taste blood, boss.
They wanna break down the door.

341
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,669
The boys are barbarians.

342
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,590
There's no need to do that.
The humans will turn on him soon enough.

343
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,234
If they don't, we'll burn
the place to the ground.

344
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,875
- OK. I've got a plan.
- I'm all ears.

345
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,039
They seem to want Randy. And I seem
to be pretty strong. Wicked strong.

346
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,358
So, you go via the sewers to the hospital.
Randy and I'll give the monsters a fight.

347
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,436
- That's your plan?
- Yes.

348
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,515
Right.

349
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,475
I'm not leaving the shop. I have to protect
the cash register and do some spells.

350
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,068
Well, magic might help. It's worth a shot.

351
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,159
All right. You work on that, then.
We need to go. Ready, Randy?

352
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,714
- Ready, Joan.
- Son?

353
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,957
Come here. Please.

354
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,794
- Right.
- Good, then.

355
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,632
- Randy!
- Hey! I'm a superhero, too!

356
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,316
Joan, where are you going?

357
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,240
Joan! Wait up!

358
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,638
Almost there. C'mon. There we go.

359
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,468
- There you go.
- Thanks.

360
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,112
This must be nice for us.

361
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,037
Sorry?

362
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,896
I mean, I know there's
the vampire problem, and...

363
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,395
our memory loss, and all that.

364
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,830
But still, to spend this time together alone

365
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,835
must be nice.

366
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,473
Yes, yes. I'm sure that's right.

367
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,036
Which book shall we start with?

368
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,790
- This is the book for us.
- Good.

369
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,117
Does it focus on mind control
or memory loss?

370
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,629
Not exactly. I just...

371
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,389
My intuition tells me this is the book.
I figure, being a magic-shop owner

372
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,115
and a natural at the supernatural,
I should trust my intuition.

373
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,709
That's fine. But as you recall,
I, too, am a magic-shop owner.

374
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,235
True. But my intuition says that
you're not so much the magic guy

375
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,476
and more of a paperwork type.

376
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,955
OK. Here we go.

377
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,793
- You don't even know...
- "Bara bara himble gemination. "

378
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,872
Wait up!

379
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,311
Bloody hell! What are you doing?

380
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,155
You don't know who you are.

381
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,636
- Right. None of us do. We're being chased...
- You're a vampire.

382
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,349
How can you say...?

383
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,836
- I? Me? A vampire? No.
- Check the lumpies. And the teeth.

384
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,238
- I kill your kind.
- And I bite yours.

385
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,954
So how come I don't wanna bite you?

386
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,514
And why am I fightin' other vampires?

387
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,916
I must be a noble vampire, a good guy,

388
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,793
on a mission of redemption.

389
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,151
I help the helpless.
I'm a vampire with a soul.

390
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,796
A vampire with a soul?

391
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,956
Oh, my God! How lame is that?

392
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,799
- Perhaps we should try another book.
- No.

393
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,515
This book made the little fluffers.
This book's gonna send 'em back.

394
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,676
I've got it this time, OK?

395
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,473
"Himble abri. Abri voyon. "

396
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,437
Yes, dear.

397
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,158
I'm a hero, really. I mean,
to be cast such an ugly lot in life,

398
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,575
and then to rise above it.

399
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,353
To seek out better, nobler things.
It's inspirational.

400
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,270
And the two of us, natural enemies, thrown
together to fight the forces of darkness.

401
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,029
Utter trust. No thought of me biting you.
No thought of you staking me.

402
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,994
Depends on how long you keep on yapping.

403
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,075
Come on. This way. Up the ladder.

404
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,596
He's coming.

405
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,395
Clearly that is not a helpful book, darling.

406
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,432
Come down and we will fix this
in a sensible fashion!

407
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,348
Sensible? Is it sensible for me to go
down into that pit of cotton-top hell

408
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,516
and let them hippity-hop over my flesh?

409
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,349
Fine. Then stay there and keep
making bunnies! That's a capital plan!

410
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,074
What capital? I never know
what you're talking about.

411
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,191
Loo, shag, brolly - what is all that?

412
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,551
There's no way that you could
remember me saying those words.

413
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,238
Bugger off, you brolly!

414
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,399
Note to self: learn to duck.

415
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,838
Get a different book!

416
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,916
Put that book down, do you hear?

417
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,031
Not that book!

418
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,153
How you doing, Dawn?

419
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,953
I'm OK. It's scary.

420
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,430
But, weirdly, kind of familiar.

421
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,395
I know what you mean.

422
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,796
How are you?

423
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,310
A little confused. I mean,
I'm all sweaty, and trapped,

424
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,194
no memory, hiding in a pipe from a vampire.

425
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,429
And I think I'm kinda gay.

426
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,553
Look what you've done, you lunatic woman!

427
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:58,073
Don't blame me, you snobby, snotty,
thinks-he's-so-great kinda jerk.

428
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,760
I feel compelled to take
some vengeance on you.

429
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,234
No wonder I'm leaving you.

430
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,759
What?

431
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,839
Look. A one-way ticket to London
and out of this engagement.

432
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,080
Of all the nerve.

433
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,555
Now look at what you've done.
That thing is gonna eat my ring.

434
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,150
I smell fear. And it smells good.

435
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,514
"Fatas... venga... mata... waray!"

436
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,196
That's better.

437
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,589
Thank goodness.

438
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,517
I'm so sorry, dear.

439
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,154
No. Rupy, I'm sorry.

440
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,799
You were right. That was the wrong book.

441
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,311
Yes, it was. But I'm still sorry.

442
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,238
Don't leave me.

443
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,313
Oh, Anya.

444
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,116
Hey, big guy. Check out
this throbbing jugular.

445
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,153
Alex!

446
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,355
Don't mess with Joan the V...

447
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,232
Buffy! Buffy!

448
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,193
Sorry. I just got back
the memory of seeing King Ralph.

449
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,235
We should get back.

450
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,236
- This place certainly needs a good tidying.
- Oh, yes.

451
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,555
Yes. Yes.

452
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,230
From dust... to dust.

453
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,478
You're an odd duck, Mr Spike.

454
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,195
Fighting your own kind.
Palling around with a slayer.

455
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,470
And that suit!

456
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,034
"Chutzpah" must be your middle name.

457
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,389
Hey, look, about our little debt problem.
It's OK. I don't need the kittens.

458
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,194
You'll get paid. I'm no welsher.

459
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,279
Right. Sure.
You're good for it. I know that.

460
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,153
I'm just going to... Yeah.

461
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,832
You all right?
