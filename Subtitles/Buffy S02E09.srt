1
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:18,261
"Are you a people person or do you
prefer keeping your own company?"

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,049
Well, what if I'm a people person
who keeps his own company by default?

3
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:25,922
- So, mark "none of the above".
- Well, there are no boxes for

4
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:28,558
"none of the above".
That would introduce too many variables

5
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,758
into their mushroom-head
number-crunching little world.

6
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:33,735
I'm sensing bitterness.

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,842
No, it's just these people can't tell
from one multiple choice test

8
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:39,926
what we're gonna be doing
for the rest of our lives. It's ridiculous!

9
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,745
I'm kinda curious to find out
what sort of career I could have.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,568
And suck the spontaneity out of being
young and stupid?

11
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:49,728
- I'd rather live in the dark.
- We're not gonna be young for ever.

12
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:52,889
Yes, but I'll always be stupid.

13
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:56,507
OK, let's not all rush to disagree.

14
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,160
You're not stupid.

15
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:02,054
"I aspire to help my fellow man." Check.

16
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:06,428
As long as he's not smelly,
dirty or... something gross.

17
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:10,777
Cordelia Chase - always ready to give
a helping hand to the rich and the pretty.

18
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:14,855
Which, lucky me, excludes you. Twice.

19
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,415
Is murder always a crime?

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,664
- Do I like shrubs?
- That's between you and your God.

21
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:25,132
- What did you put?
- I came down on the side of shrubs.

22
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:27,138
Go shrubs! OK. Oh...

23
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:30,592
I shouldn't even be bothering with this.
It's all mootville for me.

24
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:33,495
No matter what my aptitude test says,
we already know my deal.

25
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,890
- Yep! High-risk. Sub-minimum wage.
- Pointy wooden things?

26
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:42,053
- Then why are you even taking the test?
- It's Principal Snyder's hoop of the week.

27
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:45,503
He's not happy unless I'm jumping.
Believe me, I would not be here otherwise.

28
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:49,761
You're not even a teensy weensy bit curious
about what kinda career you could've had?

29
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:52,689
I mean, if you
weren't already the Slayer 'n' all.

30
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:55,460
Do the words "sealed" and "fate"
ring any bells for you, Will?

31
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:58,893
- Why go there?
- You know, with that kind of attitude,

32
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:02,734
you could've had a bright future
as an employee at the DMV.

33
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:05,402
I'm sorry. It's just...

34
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:09,419
Unless Hell freezes over and every vamp
in Sunnydale puts in for early retirement,

35
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,907
I'd say my future is
pretty much a non-issue.

36
00:02:17,914 --> 00:02:21,564
- Read it again.
- I'm not sure. It could be, uh...

37
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:27,924
"deprimere ille bubula... linter,"

38
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,625
Debase the beef... canoe.

39
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:39,249
Why does that strike me as not right?

40
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:42,313
Spike, come dance.

41
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:47,058
Give us some peace, would you?
Can't you see I'm workin'?

42
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:52,586
I'm sorry, kitten.

43
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:57,303
It's just this manuscript.
It's supposed to hold your cure,

44
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:59,831
but it reads like gibberish.

45
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:03,060
Even Dalton here, the big brain,
he can't make heads or tails of it.

46
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:08,232
I... I need to change Miss Edith.

47
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:18,586
Oh, forgive me.

48
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,962
You know I can't stand
to see you like this.

49
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:27,692
We're runnin' out of time.

50
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:33,034
It's that bloody Slayer. Whenever
I turn around, she's muckin' up the works.

51
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:38,844
Shh... You'll make it right. I know.

52
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:55,470
Well...

53
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:59,316
Come on now...

54
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:03,226
Enlighten me.

55
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:08,511
Well... it looks like Latin, but it's not.
I'm not even sure it's a language. I...

56
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:12,005
Then make it a language!
Isn't that what a transcriber does?

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,270
- Well, not exactly...
- I want... the cure.

58
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:18,315
- Don't...
- Why not?

59
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,083
Some people find pain...
very inspirational.

60
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:25,296
He can't help you.

61
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:28,505
Not without... the key.

62
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,941
The key? You mean this book
is in some kind of code?

63
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:34,260
Yeah.

64
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:45,187
- Is that where we'll find this key?
- Yeah...

65
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:48,122
I'll send the boys pronto.

66
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,992
Now will you dance?

67
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:54,780
I'll dance with you, pet...

68
00:04:56,623 --> 00:05:00,260
on the Slayer's grave.

69
00:05:56,559 --> 00:06:02,806
<b>"What's My Line?" (part 1)</b>

70
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,072
Does "rest in peace" have
no sanctity to you people?

71
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,919
Oh. I forgot. You're not a people.

72
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:33,909
One down...

73
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:37,621
One... gone.

74
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,458
Buffy... You scared me.

75
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:04,352
Now you know
what it feels like, Stealth Guy.

76
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:08,515
Just droppin' by for some
quality time with Mr. Gordo?

77
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:12,695
- Excuse me?
- The pig.

78
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,906
Oh! I, uh...

79
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,158
What's up?

80
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:20,911
Nothing.

81
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:26,503
Well, you don't have a "nothing" face.
You have a "something" face.

82
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,848
And you don't have to whisper.
Mom's in LA till Thursday -

83
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,904
art buying or something.

84
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:35,089
Then... why'd you come in
through the window?

85
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,301
Habit.

86
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,498
I wanted to make sure you're OK.
I had a bad feeling.

87
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:45,422
There's a surprise.
Angel comes with bad news.

88
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,982
Oh, God! I'm sorry. Look...

89
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:53,485
I've been Cranky Miss all day.
It's not you.

90
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,569
- What is it, then?
- It's nothing.

91
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,920
- We're having this thing at school...
- Career week?

92
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:05,832
- How did you know?
- I lurk.

93
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,145
Right. Well, then you know

94
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,365
it's a whole week of What's My Line,
only... I don't get to play.

95
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,291
- Sometimes I just want...
- You want what?

96
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:22,597
It's OK.

97
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:25,141
The Cliffs Notes version?

98
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:29,010
I want a normal life, like I had before.

99
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:31,328
Before me.

100
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,955
No, Angel, it's not you.

101
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:41,025
You're the one freaky thing in my freaky
world that still makes sense to me.

102
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:45,376
I just get messed sometimes.

103
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:47,914
I wish we could be regular kids.

104
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:51,296
Yeah. I'll never be a kid.

105
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:53,476
OK, then. A regular kid and her

106
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:56,535
cradle-robbing,
creature-of-the-night boyfriend.

107
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:06,224
Was this part of your normal life?

108
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:13,344
Oh, my gosh! My Dorothy Hamill phase.
My room in LA was pretty much a shrine.

109
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,238
Dorothy dolls, Dorothy posters.
I even got the Dorothy haircut.

110
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,447
Thereby securing a place for myself
in the geek hall of fame.

111
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:24,106
- And you wanted to be like her.
- I wanted to be her.

112
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:28,580
My parents were fighting all the time
and... skating was an escape.

113
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:30,940
I felt safe.

114
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,730
When was the last time
you put on your skates?

115
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:36,671
About a couple of hundred demons ago.

116
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:42,485
There's a rink out past Route 17
that's closed on Tuesdays.

117
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:48,227
- Tomorrow's Tuesday.
- I know.

118
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,779
Oh, here I am. Personal shopper
or motivational speaker. Neato.

119
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:04,311
Motivational speaker on what?
Ten ways to a more annoying you?

120
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:09,287
Um... What about you? You're...

121
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,456
What?

122
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:15,074
What!

123
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:17,712
You and Angel are going skating? Alone?

124
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:21,887
Unless some unforeseen evil pops up.
But I'm in full see-no-evil mode.

125
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:25,800
- Angel ice-skating?
- I know. Two worlds collide.

126
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:28,490
Wouldn't you two say you know me
about as well as anyone else?

127
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,508
- Maybe better than I know myself?
- What's this about?

128
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:35,274
When you look at me,
do you think prison guard?

129
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:38,400
Um... Crossing guard maybe,
but prison guard?

130
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:40,491
They just put up the assignments
for the career fair

131
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,656
and according to my test results I can
look forward to being gainfully employed

132
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:47,058
in the growing field of corrections.

133
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:50,287
Well, at least you'll be
on the right side of the bars.

134
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:52,335
Laugh now, missy.
They assigned you to the booth for

135
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,666
law enforcement professionals.

136
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:59,531
- As in police?
- As in polyester, doughnuts and brutality.

137
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:03,141
But... doughnuts!

138
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:06,883
Well, I'll just jump off that bridge
when I come to it.

139
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:09,040
First I have to deal with Giles.

140
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,896
He's on this Tony Robbins
hyper-efficiency kick.

141
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,299
Expects me to check in every day
after homeroom.

142
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,013
Police?

143
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:20,517
You... didn't check to see which seminar
I was assigned to, did you?

144
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:23,320
- I did and you weren't.
- I wasn't what?

145
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:26,059
- On the list.
- But I handed in my test.

146
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,557
- I used a No.2 pencil!
- Then I guess you must have passed.

147
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:32,717
It's not the kind of test you pass or fail.

148
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,544
Your name wasn't up there, Will.

149
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:49,597
Buffy. Thank you.

150
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:54,277
I've been indexing the Watcher diaries
covering the last couple of centuries.

151
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:56,293
You'd be amazed at how numbingly pompous

152
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:58,556
and long-winded
some of these Watchers were.

153
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:01,092
- Color me stunned.
- So, uh...

154
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,296
I trust last night's patrol was fruitful?

155
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:05,702
Semi. I caught one out of two vamps

156
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,567
after they stole something
from this jumbo mausoleum.

157
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:11,531
- They were stealing?
- They had tools, flashlights,

158
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:14,662
whole nine yards.
What does that mean anyway?

159
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:18,542
Whole nine yards. Nine yards of what?

160
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:21,846
Now it's gonna bug me all day.

161
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:24,907
Giles, you're in pace mode. What gives?

162
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:29,803
Um... This vampire who escaped,
did you see what he took?

163
00:13:29,838 --> 00:13:32,264
No, but I can guess
and say it was something old.

164
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:35,087
You made no effort
to find out what was taken?

165
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:40,710
Have a cow, Giles. I just figured it was
your everyday vamp high jinks.

166
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:43,403
What if it wasn't?
This could be very serious.

167
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:46,424
I mean, if you'd made an effort to be
more thorough in your observations...

168
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,863
If you don't like the way I'm doing my job,
why don't you find somebody else?

169
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:54,851
Oh! That's right. There can only be one.
As long as I'm alive there is no one else.

170
00:13:55,453 --> 00:14:00,055
Well, there you go. I don't have
to be the Slayer. I could be dead.

171
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,161
That wasn't terribly funny.
You notice I don't laugh.

172
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:07,175
Wouldn't be much of a change.
Either way I'm bored, constricted.

173
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,996
I never get to shop, and my hair
and fingernails still continue to grow.

174
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:14,522
So, really, when you think about it,
what's the diff?

175
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:17,911
Do we have to be introspective now?

176
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:22,534
Our only concern is to discover what
was stolen from that mausoleum last night.

177
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:30,947
This is it, then.

178
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:35,362
It hums. I can hear it.

179
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:41,004
Once you're well again,
we'll have a coronation down main street.

180
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:43,830
And invite everyone.
And drink

181
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:47,118
- for seven days and seven nights.
- What about the Slayer?

182
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,883
She almost blew the whole thing for us.
She's trouble.

183
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:52,762
You don't say!

184
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:59,201
Trouble? She's the gnat in my ear.

185
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:02,510
The gristle in my teeth.

186
00:15:02,545 --> 00:15:06,171
She's the bloody thorn
in my bloody side!

187
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:10,848
- Spike?
- We've gotta do something.

188
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:15,909
We'll never complete your cure
with that bitch breathing down our necks.

189
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:22,982
I need to bring in the big guns.

190
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:25,322
They'll take care of her once and for all.

191
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,825
- Big guns?
- The Order of Taraka.

192
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,520
The bounty hunters?

193
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:34,056
They're coming to my party.

194
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,607
Three of them.

195
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:41,439
Yes, but... The Order of Taraka, I mean...

196
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:45,411
- Isn't that overkill?
- No.

197
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:49,846
I think it's just enough kill.

198
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:04,679
Willow? What are you doing here?

199
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,377
Fly. Be free, little bird.
You defy category.

200
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:09,332
I'm looking for Buffy.

201
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,721
Oh, she went with Giles about an hour ago.
Some kind of field trip deal.

202
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:15,292
If she doesn't get back soon,
Snyder's really...

203
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,113
done a great job with the fair this year,
hasn't he, Xander?

204
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:21,919
Principal Snyder, great career fair, sir.
Really. In fact,

205
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:25,246
I'm so inspired by your leadership,
I'm thinkin' principal school.

206
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:28,762
I wanna walk in your shoes.
Not your actual shoes, of course,

207
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:32,697
because you're a tiny person.
Not tiny in the small sense, of course.

208
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:34,905
OK, I'm done now.

209
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,781
- Where is she?
- Who?

210
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,975
- You know who.
- You mean Buffy?

211
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:42,096
- I just saw her...
- And don't feed me that

212
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:44,932
"I just saw her a minute ago,
she's around here somewhere" story.

213
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:50,580
But I did... just see her a minute ago
and she is around here somewhere.

214
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:54,346
- For what it's worth...
- It's worth nothing, Harris.

215
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,517
Whatever comes out of your mouth
is meaningless waste of breath,

216
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,616
an airborne toxic event.

217
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:03,049
Well, I'm glad you feel comfortable enough
to be so honest with me.

218
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:06,965
And I can only hope that one day I'm
in the position to be that honest with you.

219
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,257
Fascinating.

220
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,645
Well, love to chat, but I got
an appointment with the warden

221
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:17,167
- on standard riot procedure. Ciao.
- OK. See ya.

222
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,605
Willow Rosenberg? Come with us, please.

223
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,758
- Excuse me?
- Let's walk.

224
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:40,543
Try the canapé. It's excellent.

225
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:44,704
- What is all this?
- You've been selected

226
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:48,728
to meet with Mr. McCarthy, head recruiter
for the world's leading software concern.

227
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:52,236
The jet was delayed by fog at Sea-Tac,
but he should be here any minute.

228
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,259
Please, make yourself comfortable.

229
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:56,762
But I didn't even get my test back.

230
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:59,990
That was irrelevant.
We've been tracking you for some time.

231
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:03,118
- Is that a good thing?
- I would think so.

232
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:05,572
We're extremely selective. In fact,

233
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:09,511
only one other Sunnydale student
met our criteria.

234
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:25,599
Canapé?

235
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,941
Buffy! Slow down, please!

236
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,887
Giles, we have work to do, remember?
Get with the program.

237
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:34,932
You're behaving remarkably immaturely.

238
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:38,589
You know why? I am immature.
I'm a teen. I've yet to mature.

239
00:18:38,624 --> 00:18:42,538
I was simply offering
some... constructive criticism.

240
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:45,006
No. You were harsh.

241
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,939
God, you act like I picked this gig,
but remember I'm the picked.

242
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:53,074
What you have... is more than a gig.
It's a sacred duty.

243
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:58,765
Which shouldn't prevent you from
eventually procuring some...

244
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:03,220
more... gainful form of employment.
Such as I did.

245
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:06,348
Giles, it's one thing to be
a watcher and a librarian.

246
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:10,851
They go together,
like chicken and... another chicken...

247
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:14,887
or... two... chickens, or something.
You know what I'm saying!

248
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:18,720
The point is, no one blinks an eye if you
want to spend all your days with books.

249
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:21,150
What am I supposed to do?
Carve stakes for a nursery?

250
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:25,106
Point taken.
I must admit I've never really...

251
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:29,162
Now, there's a thought!
Have you ever considered law enforcement?

252
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:33,872
What?

253
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,117
Oh!

254
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:52,352
- May I?
- Be my guest.

255
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,127
It's a reliquary...

256
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:04,105
used to house items
of religious significance.

257
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,403
Most commonly a finger
or some other body part from a saint.

258
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:09,896
Note to self: religion - freaky.

259
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,667
Du Lac.

260
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:19,655
- Oh dear, oh dear.
- I hate when you say that.

261
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,862
Josephus du Lac was buried here.

262
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:24,340
He belonged to a religious sect
that was excommunicated

263
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:26,189
by the Vatican at the turn of the century.

264
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:30,580
Excommunicated and sent to Sunnydale.
There's a guy big with the sinning.

265
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:35,103
You remember the book that was stolen from
the library by a vampire a few weeks ago?

266
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:38,999
- Yeah.
- It was written by du Lac. Damn it!

267
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:41,875
I let it slip my mind
with all the excitement.

268
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,743
I'm guessing it wasn't
a Taste of the Vatican cookbook.

269
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:49,281
No, the book was said to contain rituals
and spells that reap unspeakable evil.

270
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:54,331
However, it was written in archaic Latin so
that only sect members could understand it.

271
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:57,555
- So everything's cool then.
- It's not.

272
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,213
First the book was taken
from the library, and now the

273
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:03,302
vampires have stolen something
from Du Lac's tomb.

274
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:06,134
Do you think they figured out
how to read the book?

275
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:10,672
Something's coming, Buffy. Whatever it is,
I can guarantee it's not good.

276
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:15,399
<i>Bus 219, continuing service to Los Angeles,</i>

277
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,743
<i>now arriving in Sunnydale
at the west gate.</i>

278
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:10,298
- Mrs. Kalish?
- Yes.

279
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,564
Hello. I'm Norman Pfister
with Blush Beautiful Skincare.

280
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,561
I'm not selling anything,
so I'm not asking you to buy,

281
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:19,484
just to accept a few free samples.

282
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,546
- Free?
- Absolutely.

283
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:51,740
What the hell...?

284
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:57,439
Hey, you're not supposed to be in here!

285
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:00,690
Hey, come on!

286
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:32,234
So Giles is sure the vampire
who stole his book...

287
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,324
is connected to the one
you slayed last night?

288
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:38,128
- Or... is it "slew"?
- Both are correct.

289
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:40,819
And yes. I'm sure.

290
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:44,141
Du Lac was both a theologian
and a mathematician.

291
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:48,989
This article describes an invention of his
which he called the du Lac Cross.

292
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:51,684
So, why go to all the trouble
of inventing something

293
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:53,936
and then giving it a weak name like that?

294
00:23:53,971 --> 00:24:00,834
I mean, I'd have gone with the
Cross-o-matic or the Amazing Mr. Cross.

295
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:02,927
The Cross was more than a mere symbol.

296
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:05,348
It was used to understand
certain mystical texts.

297
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:07,916
To decipher hidden meanings and so forth.

298
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:12,174
So you're saying these vampires went to
all this hassle for a basic decoder ring?

299
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,698
Actually, yes. I suppose I am.

300
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:20,134
According to this, du Lac destroyed
every Cross except the one buried with him.

301
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,067
- Why destroy your own work?
- Perhaps he feared what might happen

302
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:24,813
if it fell into the wrong hands.

303
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:28,224
A fear we'll soon get to experience
for ourselves up close and personal.

304
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,739
Unless we can pre-empt their plans.

305
00:24:30,774 --> 00:24:33,136
- How?
- Uh, by learning

306
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,621
what's in the book before they do.

307
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:38,525
Which means we can expect
to be here later tonight.

308
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,868
Goody! Research party!

309
00:24:40,903 --> 00:24:42,851
Will, you need a life in the worst way.

310
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:45,590
Speaking of... I really have to bail,
but I promise

311
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:48,627
I'll be back bright and early
tomorrow and ready to slay.

312
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:52,278
- This is a matter of some urgency, Buffy.
- I realize that.

313
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:55,346
Well, you have to admit
I kinda lack in the book area.

314
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:58,241
I mean, you guys are the brains,
I'd only be here for moral support anyway.

315
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:00,692
That's untrue, Buff.
You totally contribute.

316
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:03,106
You go for snacks!

317
00:25:04,122 --> 00:25:08,222
She should go... you know...
gather her strength.

318
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,676
Perhaps you're right.
There may be fierce battles ahead.

319
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:15,249
But Ho-Hos are a vital part
of my cognitive process!

320
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:18,649
Sorry, Xand. Someplace I have to be.

321
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,492
Buffy!

322
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:13,793
He is passing
under our feet right now.

323
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:18,794
No worries.
We're close to decoding the manuscript.

324
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:20,889
We just need a bit more time.

325
00:27:20,924 --> 00:27:23,085
Time is ours.

326
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:28,110
It brings the Slayer closer to them.

327
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:33,486
The Hellmouth presents...
Dead Guys on Ice,

328
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,845
Not exactly the evening we were aiming for.

329
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,079
You're in danger.
You know what the ring means?

330
00:27:39,152 --> 00:27:42,272
- I just killed a Super Bowl champ?
- I'm serious!

331
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:45,517
Just go home and wait
till you hear from me.

332
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:48,036
Are you OK?

333
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:52,707
- What about you? That cut...
- Forget about me. This is bad, Buffy.

334
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:54,692
- We gotta get you out of here.
- What? You mean hide?

335
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:58,280
- Let's just get you someplace safe!
- No! Your eye...

336
00:27:58,547 --> 00:28:00,492
Hey!

337
00:28:00,527 --> 00:28:02,814
Don't be a baby. I'm not gonna hurt you.

338
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,246
- It's not that. I...
- What?

339
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:09,466
You shouldn't have to touch me
when I'm like this.

340
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,250
Oh...

341
00:28:22,864 --> 00:28:26,006
I didn't even notice.

342
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:59,269
This guy was hard-core, Giles.
And Angel was power-freaked by that ring.

343
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,460
I'm afraid, he was not overreacting.

344
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:06,482
This ring is worn only by
members of the Order of Taraka.

345
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,319
It's a society of deadly assassins
dating back to King Solomon.

346
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:13,198
And didn't they beat the Elks
this year in the Sunnydale

347
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,804
adult bowling league championships?

348
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,778
Their credo is to sow discord
and kill the unwary.

349
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:21,885
- Bowling is a vicious game.
- That's enough, Xander!

350
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:29,801
Sorry. It's just not the time for jokes.
I need to think.

351
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:31,852
These assassins -
why are they after me?

352
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,959
'Cause you're the scourge
of the underworld?

353
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:36,044
I haven't been that scourgey lately.

354
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,689
I don't know, I don't know.

355
00:29:38,724 --> 00:29:42,676
I think the best thing we can do
is to find a secure location.

356
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:47,987
Somewhere out of the way you can go until
we decide on the best course of action.

357
00:29:48,657 --> 00:29:53,322
OK. Now you and Angel
have both said to head for the hills.

358
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:55,426
Are you saying I can't handle this? That...

359
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,548
I'm not strong enough
to fight these people?

360
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,260
They're a breed apart, Buffy.

361
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:04,290
Unlike vampires,
they have no earthly desires...

362
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:07,916
but to collect their bounty.

363
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:10,741
They find a target and, uh...

364
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,842
they eliminate it.

365
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:16,418
You can kill as many of them as you like.
It'll make no difference.

366
00:30:16,453 --> 00:30:20,910
Where there's one,
there will be another and another.

367
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,950
They won't stop coming
until the job is done.

368
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,307
Each one of them works alone, his own way,

369
00:30:31,342 --> 00:30:38,081
Some are human, Some... are not,

370
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:44,084
You won't know who they are
until they strike,

371
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:37,506
Try it!

372
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:41,602
- Try what?
- Uh... I'm sorry.

373
00:31:42,353 --> 00:31:45,481
I'm still not clear
what I'm supposed to try.

374
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:49,847
Nothing. God, I'm sorry. I...

375
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:54,988
That is a tense person.

376
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:32,864
I wish there was more we could do.

377
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:35,198
We're doing all that we can.

378
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:41,300
The only course of action is to try
and find out what was in that stolen book.

379
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:45,567
I've never seen Buffy like that.
She just took off.

380
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,561
Well, she didn't go home.
I let the phone ring

381
00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:51,198
a few hundred times before
I remembered her mom is out of town.

382
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,341
Well, maybe Buffy unplugged the phone.

383
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:59,180
No, it's a statistical impossibility
for a 16-year-old girl to unplug her phone.

384
00:32:59,531 --> 00:33:02,695
Well, perhaps
my words of caution were...

385
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,257
- a little too alarming.
- You think?

386
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:08,390
It's good that
she took you seriously, Giles.

387
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:10,936
I just wish we knew where she was.

388
00:33:27,784 --> 00:33:29,619
Angel?

389
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,848
We're closed! Can't you read the sign?

390
00:35:10,428 --> 00:35:13,830
Oh. Hey, Angel.

391
00:35:14,594 --> 00:35:17,666
I didn't recognize you
in the dark there.

392
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:21,773
What, uh... What can I do for you tonight?

393
00:35:21,908 --> 00:35:24,514
- I need some information.
- Yeah?

394
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:29,597
Man, that's too bad 'cause...
I'm stayin' away from that whole scene.

395
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:33,870
- I'm livin' right, Angel.
- Sure you are, Willy.

396
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:37,638
And I'm takin' up sunbathing.

397
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:41,244
Come on, man... Don't be that way.

398
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:46,815
I treat you vamps good.
I don't hassle you. You don't hassle me.

399
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,752
We all enjoy the patronage
of this establishment.

400
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:53,179
- Everybody's happy, right?
- Who sent them?

401
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:57,639
- Who sent who?
- The Order of Taraka.

402
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:01,942
I... I tell ya...
I haven't been in the loop.

403
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:06,848
Let's try again. The Order of Taraka.
They're after the Slayer.

404
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:09,546
Come on, man...

405
00:36:10,572 --> 00:36:13,054
Was it Spike?

406
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,726
Look, Angel. I got some good pig's
blood in. Good stuff, my friend said...

407
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,741
You know... I'm a little rusty
when it comes to killing humans.

408
00:36:21,742 --> 00:36:25,552
- It could take a while.
- Spike will draw and quarter me, man!

409
00:36:25,587 --> 00:36:27,570
I'll take care of Spike.

410
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:29,615
You know he ordered those guys!

411
00:36:29,616 --> 00:36:32,277
Spike's sick of your girl
getting in his way! Ow!

412
00:36:32,312 --> 00:36:34,545
- Where can I find him?
- I tell you that,

413
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,674
I'm gonna need relocating expenses.
It'll cost ya!

414
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:40,483
- It'll cost who?
- OK, OK.

415
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:42,795
He and that freaky chick of his are...

416
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,607
Who are you?

417
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:28,678
If you tell me what I need to know,
I won't hurt you.

418
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,158
You think this is funny?

419
00:37:36,908 --> 00:37:39,111
I tink it is funny now.

420
00:37:39,411 --> 00:37:44,570
- Dat girl. De one I saw you wit before...
- You stay away from her.

421
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:48,167
I'm afraid you are not
in a position to treaten.

422
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:50,238
When I get outta here,
I'll do more than threaten.

423
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,173
Den I suggest you move quickly.

424
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,437
Eastern exposure.

425
00:37:57,438 --> 00:38:00,749
De sun will be comin' in a few hours.

426
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:07,727
More dan enough time
for me to find your girlfriend.

427
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:17,365
Xander?

428
00:38:17,574 --> 00:38:20,082
No, no, I-I haven't heard from Buffy yet.
Look, look,

429
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:24,428
I-I-I think you should
go to her house and check on her.

430
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:28,979
Well, right a-, right away.

431
00:38:29,014 --> 00:38:32,191
I don't know! Get Cordelia to drive you.

432
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:49,664
- Willow...
- Don't warn the tadpoles!

433
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:52,245
- Are you all right?
- Giles, what are you doing here?

434
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,695
It's the library, Willow. You fell asleep.

435
00:38:56,071 --> 00:39:00,776
- Oh, I...
- Don't warn the tadpoles?

436
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:05,147
I... I have frog fear.

437
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:07,567
I'm sorry. I conked out.

438
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:12,253
What? Please. You've gone
quite beyond the call of duty.

439
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:16,930
But... fortunately, I think
I may have found something finally.

440
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:18,989
- You did?
- I found a description

441
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,479
of the missing du Lac manuscript.
It's a ritual, Willow.

442
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:29,055
Now, I-I haven't managed to...
decipher the exact details, but I-I...

443
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,701
I believe the purpose is to restore

444
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,683
a weak and sick vampire
back to full health.

445
00:39:34,718 --> 00:39:38,428
- A vampire like Drusilla?
- Exactly.

446
00:39:47,372 --> 00:39:51,626
By George, I think he's got it!

447
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:55,667
The key to your cure, ducks.

448
00:39:55,702 --> 00:39:58,507
The missing bloody link. It was...

449
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:02,517
Right... right in front of us...

450
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:05,984
the whole time.

451
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:13,566
I can't even believe you. You got me out of
bed for a ride?

452
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:16,919
- What am I? Mass transportation?
- That's what a lot of guys say,

453
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:18,953
but it's just locker-room talk.
I wouldn't pay any mind.

454
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:21,536
Oh, great. So now, I'm your taxi
and your punching bag.

455
00:40:21,571 --> 00:40:24,890
I like to think of you more as
my witless foil, but have it your way.

456
00:40:26,161 --> 00:40:29,097
Buffy!

457
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:31,814
Come on, Cordelia. You wanna be
a member of the Scooby Gang

458
00:40:31,815 --> 00:40:34,086
you gotta be willing to be
inconvenienced every now and then.

459
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:38,232
Oh, right. 'Cause I lie awake at night
hoping you tweekos will be my best friends.

460
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:42,020
And that my first husband will be
a balding, demented homeless man.

461
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:44,937
- Buffy could be in trouble.
- And what if she is exactly?

462
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:47,543
What are you gonna do about it?
In case you haven't noticed,

463
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,376
you're the lameness and
she's the superchick, or whatever.

464
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:53,531
At least I'm the lameness who cares,
which is more than I can say about you.

465
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:55,230
Buffy!

466
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:57,700
I'm gonna check upstairs.

467
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:02,598
Buffy!

468
00:41:20,264 --> 00:41:24,326
Good day. I'm Norman Pfister with
Blush Beautiful Skincare and Cosmetics.

469
00:41:24,361 --> 00:41:28,087
I was wondering if I might
interest you in some free samples?

470
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:30,269
Free?

471
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,775
You must be number two.

472
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:21,367
Thanks for the wake-up,
but I'll stick with my clock radio.

473
00:42:30,334 --> 00:42:32,420
Come on. Don't make me
do the chick-fight thing.

474
00:42:32,837 --> 00:42:35,662
- Chick fight?
- You know...

475
00:42:56,611 --> 00:42:58,488
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

476
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:00,558
You attacked me!
Who the hell are you?

477
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,491
I am Kendra.
The Vampire Slayer.
