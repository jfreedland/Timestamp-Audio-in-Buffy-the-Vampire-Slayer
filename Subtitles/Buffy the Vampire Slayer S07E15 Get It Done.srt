<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:04,976 --> 00:00:08,286
Evil. They want an apocalypse?
We'll give 'em one.

3
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,968
Cos we just became an army.

4
00:00:10,056 --> 00:00:11,330
lt's not a happy scenario,

5
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:14,328
but we're dealing with the Big Bad
that can be any dead person it wants.

6
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,328
What do you want from me,
Jonathan slash the First?

7
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,249
- l have an assignment for you.
- You want me to hurt the girls?

8
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:24,170
- The girls must die.
- Nice place. Bit of a mess.

9
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:26,816
<i>- (Dawn) They're all slayers?</i>
- Potential slayers.

10
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:31,651
Waiting for one to be called. There were
many more like them all over the world.

11
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:34,534
Now there's just a handful,
all on their way to Sunnydale.

12
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:35,765
Glad we talked.

13
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:39,974
- ln the spirit of air-clearing...
- Yeah?

14
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:42,490
l feel like l need to be honest
about something.

15
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:49,165
<i>(Buffy) Spike has a soul now. That's what's</i>
<i>gonna stop him from hurting people.</i>

16
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:53,454
- Buffy...
- He can be a good man, Giles. l feel it.

17
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:03,570
- l guess we should talk.
- How do you know about slayers?

18
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:06,489
My mother was one.
She was killed when l was four.

19
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:10,046
- Something got her. A demon...?
- A vampire.

20
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,811
- So, how do you two know each other?
- He works with me.

21
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:16,615
You know, in the struggle against evil.

22
00:01:16,696 --> 00:01:18,687
- He's a vampire.
- l should move out.

23
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:23,611
- No. You have to stay.
- You've got another demon fighter now.

24
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:26,130
- That's not why l need you here.
- Why's that then?

25
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:28,525
Cos l'm not ready for you to not be here.

26
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:32,051
- You're not my mother.
- Like to know who killed me?

27
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:34,809
<i>You met him. You know him.</i>

28
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:40,050
- <i>You fought at his side.</i>
- Spike.

<i>(sobbing)</i>

31
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:36,413
Chloö?

32
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:38,726
lt is Chloö, right?

33
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:48,848
lt's not enough.

34
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:59,327
l'm a bright girl. Good education,
quick on the uptake.

35
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:04,729
So, why in the name of almighty Grothnar
would l let myself become human again?

36
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,727
You're talking to the wrong fella.

37
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:09,933
Sure, the vengeance demon gig
has some downsides...

38
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,452
- All jobs do.
- But being human? Urgh!

39
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:17,892
You're always icky on the inside
and disgusting on the outside.

40
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:20,695
Your outside's not so bad.

41
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:26,888
The only thing worse than being human is
being trapped inside a house full of humans.

42
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:30,173
- Preaching to the choir, love.
- lt's like Slayer Central.

43
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:35,410
l swear, if Buffy rooms or boards one more
of the potential girls, l'm gonna call a...

44
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:38,568
- l'm gonna call a health inspector.
- l like my plan better.

45
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:42,012
Get up, get out, get drunk.
Repeat as needed.

46
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:44,087
lt's just more elegant.

47
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:50,575
- Thanks for having me along.
- Don't mention it.

48
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:55,013
At first l thought "lt's weird -
is Spike asking me out on a date?"

49
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:57,166
Cos that would just be...

50
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:00,246
- nuts.
- Right.

51
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,725
l'm just out for the alcohol.

52
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:05,284
Right there with you, scooter.

53
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:10,370
- Tonight l plan to drink you under the table.
- You're on, then.

54
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:12,253
Good.

55
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:16,526
Of course, once you're down there,
l could join you.

56
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,733
Kidding. l like my sex on top of the table.

57
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:24,253
Would you let it go?
You're like a dog with a bone!

58
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:27,089
- So what?
- lt's my bone. Just drop it.

59
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:29,371
OK. OK.

60
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:33,686
l wasn't proposing.
Time goes by, a girl gets hungry.

61
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:35,209
- Oh, thank God.
- What?

62
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:36,934
- Demon.
- Huh?

63
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:42,045
- D'Hoffryn says you die.
- Of course he does.

64
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,611
Oh, hey!

65
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:55,326
- This may mean more than you think.
- ls that so?

66
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,976
l think we have a couple of chuckle-heads

67
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,695
who thought that a cafeteria fistfight
would impress.

68
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:04,086
l'm not impressed.
Buffy, are you impressed?

69
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:08,454
Still, l'm gonna
cut you guys some slack this time.

70
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:15,645
Third fight this week,
and it's just getting worse.

71
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:20,685
Plus, a rise in vandalism,
three students missing.

72
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:24,166
Tell me something, Buffy,
in your professional opinion.

73
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,247
<i>(screaming)</i>

74
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,286
lt's started, hasn't it?

75
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:38,165
The Hellmouth has begun its semi-annual
percolation. Usually it blows around May.

76
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:40,008
Was it like this before?

77
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:43,532
ltjust seems as if things are
getting bad faster than we thought.

78
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:47,734
- We're a little ahead of schedule.
- l can't say l'm too surprised.

79
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:51,365
l knew l signed on for something,
but, Buffy, l'm just a guy.

80
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:54,971
Granted, a cool and sexy
vampire-fighting guy, but still.

81
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:58,844
- Don't forget "snappy dresser".
- Mm. Thank you.

82
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:02,292
- But this is gonna get bigger than me.
- Yeah, it is.

83
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,734
That's why l've decided to give you this.

84
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:12,371
- What is it?
- An emergency kit.

85
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:16,328
This bag belonged to my mother.

86
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:21,690
- A slayer keepsake. l couldn't.
- Well, you have to.

87
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:25,655
Technically, it should have been
passed down to you through the years.

88
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:30,526
After my mother died,
l guess l just couldn't part with it.

89
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:32,571
Wow.

90
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:36,854
l don't know what's inside,
but it has something to do with her power.

91
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:41,373
- Well, your power now.
- l don't know what to say.

92
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,447
Try "Thank you, Principal Wood."

93
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:47,575
- Thank you, Principal Wood.
- Ah, call me Robin.

94
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:50,728
And now l'd like to see where you work.

95
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:56,568
Here, actually.
This is my desk, and...

96
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:59,216
- these are my pencils.
- No.

97
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:02,129
Where you do your other work.

98
00:08:03,136 --> 00:08:07,368
So, all the potential slayers - who keep
popping up from every corner of the earth -

99
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:09,253
were getting killed.

100
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:11,406
- By the First.
- Agents of.

101
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:15,284
We thought the Council could protect them,
but no one protected the Council.

102
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:19,255
All their watchers were killed.
They've all been coming here since.

103
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,975
Nothing like the end of the world
to bring us together.

104
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:23,569
lt's heart-warming.

105
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:27,046
Anyway, this is... it.
Command Central.

106
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:32,891
Where the hell have you been?
This funnel cake is kicking my ass.

107
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:35,126
Yeah, l hear they're tricky.

108
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:37,491
Robin Wood, this is Andrew.

109
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,806
lt's a pleasure.

110
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:41,887
Andrew is our...

111
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:44,012
Actually, he's our hostage.

112
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:48,055
l like to think of myself more as a "guestage."

113
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:51,014
So, you hold him here against his will?

114
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:55,408
Well, he was evil, and people got killed,
and now he... bakes.

115
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:56,929
- lt's a thing.
- Oh.

116
00:08:57,016 --> 00:09:00,850
Could we try to just keep our
secret headquarters a little bit secret?

117
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:03,496
Keep bringing people in,
they'll see everything.

118
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,885
They'll see the big board.

119
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:09,096
Andrew, we don't have a big board.

120
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,373
- l made it myself.
- l wouldn't have guessed.

121
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:22,168
This is us. And this represents
the First in various incarnations.

122
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:29,048
And there's no pattern to the naked eye yet,
but the instant one emerges, l'm on it.

123
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,048
Where do we put our receipts?

124
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:45,088
You'll have to forgive Andrew.
Or not. Your call.

125
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:48,930
We do have a lot more working for us
than just the "big board".

126
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:51,405
So l see.

127
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:53,373
Huh!

128
00:09:53,456 --> 00:09:55,765
Punch block combo!

129
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,654
- Huh!
- Cross block kick!

130
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:02,051
- Huh!
- Chamber your energy.

131
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:05,846
Punch block combo!

132
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:07,927
- Huh!
- Hold it!

133
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:12,128
What do you call that, potential?
ln the field, you are dead.

134
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:14,810
- Drop and give me 20.
- 20 what?

135
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:16,887
Push-ups, maggot!

136
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:29,174
l love this job! Did you see that?
l called that girl a maggot.

137
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:33,568
- Hi. Who the hell are you?
- An ally.

138
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:37,535
So, what do you think?
My girls ready to kick some ass, or what?

139
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:40,369
- Looking strong.
- But...?

140
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:45,132
l'm just not sure the First has an ass
you can actually, you know, kick.

141
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:48,811
- Guess we'll see.
- Principal Wood, hi!

142
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:52,169
lt's so weird seeing you outside of school.

143
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:55,692
What are you waving at, potential?

144
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:57,573
- Attention!
- Huh!

145
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,567
- You're right.
- Rising sun!

146
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:03,126
- lt's not enough.
- That's not what l said, Buffy.

147
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:07,414
- lt's an impressive group of recruits.
- They're not recruits.

148
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:10,568
Recruits are... recruited.

149
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:12,408
These girls were chosen.

150
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:14,930
You're doing the best you can
with what you've got.

151
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:16,927
They're not all gonna make it.

152
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:20,691
Some will die,
and nothing l can do will stop that.

153
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:24,051
Oh, hi. Hey.

154
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:27,651
Well, Buffy, l see that our preparation

155
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:34,050
for the school pep dance
cheer drill contest are coming along.

156
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:38,526
- Bring it on!
- lt's OK, l filled him in on everything.

157
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:44,088
Oh, thank God! lf l had to explain
all these weapons, l had nothing.

158
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:50,325
Buffy tells me you've been -
Oh, how shall l put it? - experimenting.

159
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:54,292
- With the magics?
- Oh! Yeah.

160
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:58,255
Nothing too heavy, though.
Just the lighter, safer stuff.

161
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:01,373
lf Kennedy asks,
her pointy stuff's right there.

162
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:05,165
See you inside.
So much cooler than Snyder.

163
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:15,528
- Did she really almost destroy the world?
- Yep.

164
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:18,892
- Remind me not to make her crabby.
- Might be better if you did.

165
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:20,807
How's that work?

166
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:23,854
Oh, l don't know. lt's just...

167
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:28,246
The First is coming,
and then look at us: the army.

168
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:31,885
We've got a bunch of fighters
with nothing to hit, a wicca who won't-a,

169
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:35,048
and the brains of our operation
wears oven mitts.

170
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:38,811
Well, you're redefining the job,
Buffy, and that takes guts.

171
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:41,888
This isn't your full arsenal anyway.

172
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:44,012
Show me the vampire.

173
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:46,930
- But you just let him go.
- After saving your life.

174
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,328
For now. That was one of D'Hoffryn's killers.
He won't stop coming till he kills me.

175
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,488
Yet here you are, walking, talking, annoying.

176
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:58,205
You fought like a wimpire, with
the lifting and running. Why not kill him?

177
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,685
Anya, think.

178
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:06,726
l fight, demon boy gets lucky,
l get knocked out, you get killed. True?

179
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:13,733
We both know the best way of saving your life
was to keep you with me, away from danger.

180
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:17,729
No need to thank me.
l'm just the one who beat him off.

181
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:22,971
"Repelled him"
would perhaps be the better phrase.

182
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:25,251
- Demon.
- Figured.

183
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:29,295
- l hope we're not intruding.
- Not a bit.

184
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,129
What brings our good principal
to this neck of the gloom?

185
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:34,684
l'm showing him our operation.

186
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:36,414
Us.

187
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,533
Fine by me.
Big fight against evil coming up.

188
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:42,766
The more good guys, the longer we all live.

189
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,768
ls that what you are? A good guy?

190
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:47,972
l haven't heard any complaints.

191
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:52,493
Well, l've heard a few, but then l killed
whoever spoke up, and that was that.

192
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:55,374
- He's joking.
- No, he's not.

193
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:57,447
No, l'm not.

194
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,573
But... that's the old me l'm talking about.

195
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:05,574
- Why don't you tell me about that?
- Not much to tell. l've changed.

196
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:09,331
Oh, now that you have a soul.

197
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:15,085
Yeah. That was a big deal. Very... private.

198
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:17,326
What, are you just telling everyone now?

199
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:21,409
Oh, come on, Spike.
Don't blame Buffy. l asked.

200
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:24,327
Right, the educator.

201
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:33,286
Yeah, l went to great lengths.
Lots of trouble, and now l'm unique.

202
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:37,688
Well, more or less.
Got myself a soul, whatever that means.

203
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,893
- And how's that working out for you?
- ln progress.

204
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:43,092
Well, you've had some time.

205
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:45,815
- You've been in Sunnydale, what...?
- Years.

206
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:47,090
- How many?
- A few.

207
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,212
- Before that?
- Around.

208
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:59,574
- l think we'd better get back upstairs.
- Right. Give him the full tour.

209
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:03,854
You don't want to miss a look
at her weapons' chest.

210
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:10,614
l looked inside that
emergency bag of Principal Wood's.

211
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:12,732
- And?
- Smelled weird.

212
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:15,011
Kinda like Grandma's closet, but worse.

213
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:18,133
l didn't know that was possible.
Anything we could use?

214
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:22,334
Trinkets, weapons, one very large textbook.

215
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,725
Translation's gonna be a bitch, but...

216
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:27,489
Do you know ancient Sumerians
did not speak English?

217
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:31,364
They're worse than the French.
Anything else?

218
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:34,892
Yeah. A box. A big, fat, unopenable box.

219
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,685
l bet the big deal about
this emergency bag is in the box.

220
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:42,086
Good. Keep on it.
Don't you have any real homework?

221
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,768
- You mean schoolwork?
- Yes.

222
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:46,131
l've got a system.
lt's called flunking out.

223
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:48,366
Just kidding.
l'm paying someone to do it.

224
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:52,051
l'm kidding. l love to see your eyeballs
change colour when you think...

225
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,526
What happened? We heard...

226
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:11,091
Dawn, get a knife. l'm cutting her down.

227
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:14,532
Good thinking.
But, on the other hand, why rush?

228
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:18,655
Up or down, l'll still be dead.

229
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:22,092
- You're not Chloö.
- Neither is she any more.

230
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:24,565
Now she's just Chloö's body.

231
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:28,934
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing! We just talked all night.

232
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:36,172
Well, l did most of the talking, but Chloö is...
l'm sorry, <i>was</i> a good listener.

233
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:39,328
Till she hanged herself.
Like when you called her a maggot.

234
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:43,125
- She really heard that.
- Don't listen to it, any of you.

235
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:45,366
- lt's the First.
- Oh, let 'em.

236
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:49,369
Chloö offed herself because
she knew what you're not getting.

237
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:52,926
l'm coming. You're going.

238
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:57,372
All this? lt's almost over.

239
00:16:57,456 --> 00:17:00,254
- We'll be here.
- All of you?

240
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:04,011
But wait. l thought... <i>(Buffy's voice)</i>
"They're not all gonna make it."

241
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:07,930
"Some will die, and there's
nothing l can do that will stop it."

242
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:12,612
<i>(Chloë's voice)</i> Hey, l didn't say it.
But l'll be seeing all of you.

243
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:17,167
One by one. TTFN.

244
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:24,495
- What's "TTFN"?
- lt's "ta-ta for now."

245
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:30,534
- lt's what Tigger says when he leaves.
- Chloö loved <i>Winnie the Pooh.</i>

246
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,566
Dawn, where's that knife?

247
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:21,811
ls everyone here?

248
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:24,494
All accounted for.

249
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:30,009
Anyone want to say a few words
about Chloö?

250
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:32,812
Let me.

251
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:35,649
Chloö was an idiot.

252
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:38,170
Chloö was stupid.

253
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:42,852
She was weak. And anyone in a rush
to be the next dead body l bury, it's easy.

254
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:46,451
Just think of Chloö, and do what she did.

255
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:50,290
And l'll find room for you
next to her and Annabelle.

256
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:53,695
l'm the Slayer.
The one with the power.

257
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:59,007
And the First has me using that power
to dig our graves.

258
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:04,607
l've been carrying you -
all of you - too far, too long.

259
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:07,415
- Ride's over.
- You're out of line!

260
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:11,648
- No, she's not.
- You're gonna let her talk to you like that?

261
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:15,445
Willow, she's not even
the most powerful one in this room.

262
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:18,414
With you here, she's not close.

263
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:23,968
You're new here, and you're wrong.
Because l use the power that l have.

264
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,251
The rest of you are just waiting for me.

265
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:29,453
Well, yeah, but only because
you kinda told us to.

266
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,492
You're our leader, as in "follow the".

267
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:34,215
From now on l'm your leader,
as in "do what l say".

268
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:38,728
<i>Jawohl!</i> But let's not try to forget,
we're also your friends.

269
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:42,885
- l'm not.
- Then why are you here?

270
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:47,766
Aside from getting rescued,
what is it that you do?

271
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:51,326
l provide much-needed... sarcasm.

272
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:55,129
That would kinda be my job, actually.

273
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:59,448
- You're here because you're scared.
- Same goes for everyone in this room.

274
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:03,051
Fine. Anya, all of you,

275
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:06,606
be as scared as you'd like,
just be useful while you're at it.

276
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:10,450
Come on, Buffy. You know everyone
here's doing everything they can.

277
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:12,686
And the First isn't impressed.

278
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:17,008
lt already knows us.
lt knows what we can do, and it's laughing.

279
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:19,769
You wanna surprise the enemy?
Surprise yourselves.

280
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:24,088
Force yourself to do what can't be done,
or else we are not an army.

281
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:29,569
We're just a bunch of girls
waiting to be picked off and buried.

282
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:37,488
- Where are you going?
- Out. Since l'm neither a girl, nor waiting.

283
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:40,613
All this speechifying
doesn't really apply to me, does it?

284
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:42,846
Fine. Take a cellphone.

285
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:48,727
That way, if l need someone
to get weepy or wailed on, l can call you.

286
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:51,728
- lf you've got something to say...
- Just said it.

287
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:54,330
You keep holding back,
you might as well walk.

288
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:58,011
Holding back? You're blind.

289
00:20:58,096 --> 00:21:00,849
l've been here, right in it.
Fighting, scrapping.

290
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:02,972
Since you got your soul back?

291
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:07,288
As a matter of fact, l haven't been
quite relishing the kill the way l used to.

292
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:11,449
- You were a better fighter then.
- l did this for you!

293
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,686
The soul, the changes.
lt's what you wanted.

294
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:18,531
What l want is the Spike that's dangerous.
The Spike that tried to kill me when we met.

295
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:21,972
Oh, you don't know
how close you are to bringing him out.

296
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:24,968
l'm nowhere near him.

297
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:29,969
Dawn, get the potentials upstairs
and break out that emergency kit.

298
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:35,050
- What are you gonna do?
- l'm declaring an emergency.

299
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:40,089
- We thought you'd want to be here.
- You thought right.

300
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:42,292
The emergency bag has some neat stuff in it.

301
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:45,209
Weapons, charms,
advanced reading assignments.

302
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:48,254
Yeah, cool stuff, but we've seen it all before.

303
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,213
Not this. What's inside it?

304
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:52,491
l don't know.
lt hasn't been opened since...

305
00:21:52,576 --> 00:21:54,055
Well, since now.

306
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:59,406
Puppets.

307
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:02,215
That's it. The First hates puppets.

308
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:06,972
Now if we can just airlift Kermit and Miss
Piggy into town, the First'll be a-running.

309
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:10,207
- Those are Muppets.
- And these things are shadow-casters.

310
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:14,175
You put them in motion,
and they tell you a story.

311
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:17,771
lt says you can'tjust watch, you have to see.

312
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,166
- What the hell does that mean?
- lt's cryptic. l don't like it.

313
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:25,727
Every time instructions get cryptic,
someone gets hurt - usually me.

314
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:28,967
"You can'tjust watch,
you have to see?" See what?

315
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:33,572
That's where all my fancy translating skills
break down, but l think it's an origin myth.

316
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:37,615
- The story of the very first slayer.
- l saw her.

317
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:39,607
You saw the First Slayer?

318
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:43,530
The other night, in my dream.
lt's gotta mean something, right?

319
00:22:48,856 --> 00:22:51,928
OK. According to this, l think,

320
00:22:53,336 --> 00:22:55,645
you put on those puppet guys one by one.

321
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:59,445
They cast shadows
and the shadows tell the story.

322
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:02,334
"First, there is the earth."

323
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:10,089
- <i>(# tribal drumbeat)</i>
- What's that sound?

324
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:15,328
- OK. So far, so creepy.
- Hm. OK.

325
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:18,567
"Then there came the demons."

326
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:24,889
- "After demons, there came men."
- <i>(growling)</i>

327
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:29,809
- "Men found a girl."
- <i>(screaming)</i>

328
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:35,846
"The men took the girl
to fight the demon - all demons."

329
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,292
"They chained her to the earth."

330
00:23:41,016 --> 00:23:43,814
"And then..."

331
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:49,531
l can't read this.

332
00:23:49,616 --> 00:23:52,733
- Something about darkness.
- What about darkness?

333
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:56,570
lt says you cannot be shown.
"You cannotjust watch, but you must see."

334
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:59,454
"See for yourself, but only
if you'll make the exchange."

335
00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:01,492
When did you get so good at Sumerian?

336
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:04,454
lt's not in Sumerian any more.

337
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,407
<i>(noises intensify)</i>

338
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:26,534
But what does it mean?

339
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:33,574
- lt means l have to go in there.
- No, it doesn't!

340
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:35,487
Where does it say that? lt doesn't!

341
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:37,692
You don't know what you're exchanging.

342
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,893
- You don't even know if you're ready yet.
- That's the point.

343
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:43,968
We don't know where you're going
or how we'll get you back.

344
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:46,775
- Buffy, you can't!
- How will we get you back?

345
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:48,847
Find a way.

346
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:53,007
- She's gone.
- Huh!

347
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:56,168
What was that about an exchange?

348
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:01,772
This must be the exchange student.

349
00:25:09,816 --> 00:25:12,455
Willow! Use your magic. Send him back!

350
00:25:12,536 --> 00:25:14,572
Um... trying.

351
00:25:14,656 --> 00:25:16,453
<i>Redi!</i>

352
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:23,735
Weapon!

353
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:37,806
Get out of here, all of you.
Unless you wanna end up dead and useless.

354
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:40,046
What are you gonna do?

355
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:42,047
What l do best.

356
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:02,094
- Are you injured?
- Just hurt.

357
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:04,929
Don't make a case out of it.

358
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:08,250
- How about you?
- l think we'll live.

359
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:09,564
Except maybe Spike.

360
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:12,489
ls getting thrown through the ceiling
what he does best?

361
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:15,727
- l'll go check on him.
- We've got bigger problems than that.

362
00:26:15,816 --> 00:26:19,650
- Yeah. Demon loose, no slayer.
- We need Buffy.

363
00:26:19,736 --> 00:26:23,092
You gotta get her back.
Looks like it's spell o'clock.

364
00:26:23,176 --> 00:26:26,009
Which spell?
l mean, didn't you see that thing?

365
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:29,771
You expect to reopen the portal without
sending Willow off the deep end?

366
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,972
- Thanks for your support.
- lt's true.

367
00:26:32,056 --> 00:26:37,255
- We're going to have to find another way.
- There isn't, and Buffy knew it.

368
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:40,772
- l've gotta get her back.
- We don't even know where she went.

369
00:26:57,856 --> 00:27:00,051
Well, guess that worked.

370
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:14,095
<i>(Xander) What's the book say?</i>

371
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:17,885
Not much. Once Buffy left,
it got a little tougher to read.

372
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:19,967
- Oh.
- lt's OK.

373
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,047
We'll start with what we know.

374
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:24,331
Great, so far we know Jack about squat.

375
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:28,455
- You've got the magic, use it.
- l don't even know what magic to use.

376
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:32,893
Why notjust try all 32 flavours?
Worst thing that happens is you go brunette.

377
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:35,410
That's not the worst thing that can happen.

378
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:38,056
She's right. And you know we have a choice.

379
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:43,051
We can risk Willow's life and the rest of ours
to get Buffy back, or we leave her out there.

380
00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:46,094
lf we play it safe back here,
Buffy could stay lost.

381
00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:50,374
You missed her "everyone sucks but me"
speech. Let her find her own way back.

382
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:52,253
The First is already up and running.

383
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:57,012
Every second Buffy's not here is a chance
for it to show up and rip us to pieces.

384
00:27:57,096 --> 00:28:00,975
- Willow, how would you get Buffy back?
- l don't even know.

385
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:04,366
But if another witch was to do it,
where would she start?

386
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:08,529
- Physics, principles, basic laws.
- Such as?

387
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:14,054
Conservation of energies. You can't really
create or destroy anything, just transfer.

388
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:16,366
- l'm sorry, are you helping?
- No.

389
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:18,651
But l'm not going in the wrong direction.

390
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:21,170
- Magic works off physics.
- Not without a catalyst.

391
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:24,054
To transfer energies, you need a conduit.

392
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:28,049
- Like a kraken's tooth.
- Yeah, skin of Draconis,

393
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:31,890
- ground up Baltic stones, something.
- OK. Good.

394
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,252
Plus an exchange, like you said.
l'm thinking a slayer for a demon.

395
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:40,490
Right. lf we want Buffy back, we have
to find that demon and send it through.

396
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,489
- lt matter if it's dead or alive?
<i>- (Spike)</i> l vote dead.

397
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:49,413
The Slayer's counting on you, Willow.
Get cracking on that portal.

398
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:53,205
And don't be stingy with the mojo.
The demon's mine.

399
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:58,211
Hate to say it, "Big Bad", but you look
like you can barely stand. We're trained.

400
00:28:58,296 --> 00:29:02,574
And the only thing we know for sure
about this demon is it kicked your ass.

401
00:29:02,656 --> 00:29:04,647
lt did, at that.

402
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,004
Where are you going?

403
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:10,087
Something l need.

404
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:19,094
Hello?

405
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:22,125
l'm Buffy, l'm the Slayer.

406
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:36,014
Good. That's good then. Um...

407
00:29:36,096 --> 00:29:41,250
We have bigger issues to deal with, but how'd
l understand anything you guys just said?

408
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:44,851
l know. Ancient magics.
l just thought it was neat.

409
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:53,688
The neat of itjust left. End of what?

410
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:00,927
Latest. You mean latest guardian.

411
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:07,329
OK, l have a First to fight, OK?
So just tell me what l need to know.

412
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,735
l came to learn.

413
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,245
You know what l think?
l'm not really here.

414
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:18,169
None of this is actually happening.
This is like a play.

415
00:30:18,256 --> 00:30:23,967
Like some shadow play.
Some non-reality re-enactment hologramy...

416
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:28,448
This is gonna help us how?

417
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,369
The sand forms a circle,
the circle acts as a barrier,

418
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:34,732
and the barrier contains the portal.

419
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:38,206
Now what? We hold hands
and chant "Kumbaya" or something?

420
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:44,974
Maybe. Till we get the magics up and
running, l'm working on my best guess here.

421
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:46,933
- Maybe we should wait.
- For what?

422
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:48,893
Spike. See if he can get that demon.

423
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:55,131
No, l don't think we should wait right now.
Opening a portal this size could take days.

424
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:57,207
Better get started.

425
00:30:57,976 --> 00:31:00,774
l think l might pee my pants.

426
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:03,575
You can do it.
The magics, not the pants thing.

427
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:05,567
OK.

428
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:19,329
<i>Via temporis, iam clamo ad te,</i>
<i>via spatii te jubeo aperire.</i>

429
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:24,653
<i>Aperi!</i>

430
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:29,330
Put on some coffee.
This could take awhile.

431
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:32,415
<i>(screams)</i>

432
00:31:39,016 --> 00:31:41,007
What is this?

433
00:31:57,296 --> 00:31:59,412
l thought l brought me here.

434
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:04,286
Listen, you guys. l'm already the Slayer,
bursting with power. Really don't need more.

435

00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:10,324
No!

438
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,013
By making me less human?

439

<i>(screams)</i>

440
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:53,815

No, this isn't the way.

442
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,894
- Where you going?
- Got a job.

443
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:23,446
- Nice coat. Where'd you get it?
- New York.

444

<i>Via, concursus, tempus,</i>
<i>spatium, audi me ut imperio.</i>

445
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:38,331
Screw it! Mighty forces, l suck at Latin, OK?
But that's not the issue.

446
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:41,965
l'm the one in charge,
and l'm telling you open up, portal, now!

447
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:44,365
- lt's not happening.
- She's getting it.

448
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:47,209
Or something's getting her.
Back up a little.

449
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:49,287
No!

450
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:03,688
Oh, come on now, nancy.
Call yourself a demon?

451
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:06,085
l thought you were up for a proper fight.

452
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,733
Now we're talking.

453
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,535
Yeah!

454
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:44,086
You think l came all this way
to get knocked up by some demon dust?

455
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:45,973
l can't fight this.

456
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,774
l know that now.

457
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,290
But you guys? You're just men.

458
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:54,413
Just the men who did this... to her.

459
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,646
Whoever she was before the First Slayer.

460
00:35:57,816 --> 00:36:00,774
No, you don't understand!
You violated that girl.

461
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:03,324
Made her kill for you
because you're weak, pathetic,

462
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:06,772
and you obviously have nothing to show me.

463
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:37,933
l don't know your feelings, big guy,
but to me, a tussle like that...

464
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,687
is good for the soul.

465
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:58,494
l knew it. lt's always the staff.

466
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:02,132
Tell me something l don't know.

467
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:58,493
Hey.

468
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:01,409
You OK?

469
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:05,808
- You've been kinda quiet since...
- You sucked the life out of me?

470
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,490
Yeah, since then.

471
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:13,604
Look, it's important
that you know... what l am,

472
00:38:13,696 --> 00:38:18,133
what l'm like when l'm... like that.

473
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:24,533
l thought it would be, l don't know,
cool somehow. ltjust hurt.

474
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:27,606
Yeah, l'm really sorry.

475
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:32,486
lt's just... you were the most
powerful person nearby, and...

476
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,885
well, that's how it works.

477
00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:38,809
That's... how l work.

478
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:43,964
l got that. You told me.

479
00:38:49,656 --> 00:38:51,931
l'll see you in the morning.

480
00:39:05,496 --> 00:39:07,771
How you doing?

481
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:11,813
Thanks for bringing me back. Again.

482
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,887
That's what l do.

483
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,490
l was hard on you guys today.

484
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:20,692
Oh, it's all right. You needed to be.

485
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:26,931
Although Twinkies and Kisses?
Also peachy motivational tools.

486
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,851
You OK?

487
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:32,086
l think l made a mistake.

00:39:32,176 --> 00:39:33,973
What?

489
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:38,769
Those men that l met.
You know, the shadow men?

490
00:39:39,496 --> 00:39:44,286
They offered me more power,
but l didn't like the loophole.

491
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,808
So you turned it down?

492
00:39:47,896 --> 00:39:51,730
lt's OK, Buffy.
We'll get by. We always do.

493
00:39:53,336 --> 00:39:55,327
l don't know.

494
00:39:56,656 --> 00:40:00,285

That the First Slayer was right.
