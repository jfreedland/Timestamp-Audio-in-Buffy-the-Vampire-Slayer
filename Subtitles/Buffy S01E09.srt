1
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:03,476
In every generation there is a Chosen One.

2
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:08,858
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness.

3
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:10,944
She is the Slayer.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,660
I will be whole.

5
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:19,520
I will be new.

6
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,106
<i># Learning to love yourself</i>

7
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:50,021
<i># is the greatest love of all.</i>

8
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:56,607
<i># I decided long ago
never to walk in anyone's shadows</i>

9
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:59,593
<i># If I fail
if I succeed...</i>

10
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:03,413
Thank you, Cordelia.
Tha-that's going to be lovely.

11
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:06,654
But I didn't do
the part with the sparklers.

12
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:11,526
We'll, um, save that
for the dress rehearsal. Lisa?

13
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,072
Please!

14
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,714
- If it isn't the great producer.
- Had to see this to believe it.

15
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,987
- Oh, you three.
- The school talent show.

16
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:33,722
How ever did you finagle
such a primo assignment?

17
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:35,792
Our new Führer, Mr. Snyder.

18
00:01:35,827 --> 00:01:39,547
I think they call them principals now.

19
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:42,759
He thought it would behove me
to have more contact with the students.

20
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:46,597
I did try to explain that
my vocational choice of librarian

21
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:49,978
was a deliberate attempt to...
minimise that contact,

22
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,089
but... he would have none of it.

23
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:57,722
Giles, into every generation is born one
who must run the annual talentless show.

24
00:01:57,757 --> 00:01:59,890
You cannot escape your destiny.

25
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,155
If you had any... shred of decency,
you would have...

26
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:05,101
participated. Or at least... um, helped.

27
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:09,104
Nah. I think I'll take on
your traditional role, and watch.

28
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:12,024
- And mock.
- And laugh.

29
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,623
OK. I think maybe we better

30
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:21,266
leave our Mr. Giles
to this business he calls show.

31
00:02:23,737 --> 00:02:25,333
Principal Snyder.

32
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:28,050
So, we think school events are stupid

33
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:31,008
and we think authority figures
are to be made fun of?

34
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:33,469
No, no, we don't. Unless you do.

35
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:38,176
And we think
our afternoon classes are optional?

36
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,732
- All three of you left campus yesterday.
- Yeah, but we were fighting a demon...

37
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:44,610
- Fighting?
- Not fighting.

38
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:46,863
No, we left to avoid fighting.

39
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:49,671
Real antisocial types.

40
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:52,947
You need to integrate
into this school, people.

41
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:57,585
I think I just found three eager
new participants for the talent show.

42
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,046
- What?
- No.

43
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:00,172
Please?

44
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:03,761
I've been watching you three.
Always getting into one scrape.

45
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:06,172
Well, we're really, really sorry,

46
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:08,397
but about the talent show,
please, you can't make us!

47
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:11,009
My predecessor, Mr. Flutie,
may have gone in for all that

48
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:14,983
touchy-feely relating nonsense.
But he was eaten.

49
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,362
You're in my world now.

50
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:21,618
And Sunnydale has touched and felt
for the last time.

51
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:27,918
Can I just mention that detention
is a time-honored form of punishment?

52
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,839
I know the three of you will come up with
a wonderful act for the school to watch

53
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:33,592
and mock,

54
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:35,762
and laugh...

55
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,181
at.

56
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:44,691
No! No.

57
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:55,413
Thank you.

58
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:00,086
Ew! Dummy!

59
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,173
Yeow! Mime?!

60
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:07,305
I think dummies are cute. You don't?

61
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:10,642
They give me the wig.
Ever since I was little.

62
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:12,394
What happened?

63
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:16,400
I saw a dummy. It gave me the wig.
There really wasn't a story there.

64
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,695
Hi, I'm Morgan.

65
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:20,947
And I'm Sid.

66
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:25,537
Hey, Morgan,
would you like to tell some jokes?

67
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,498
Would I?

68
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:30,001
As a matter of fact, it is!

69
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,089
It's also a wood nose
and a wood mouth.

70
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:42,328
I didn't sleep at all last night.

71
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:44,480
All right, time out.

72
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:47,024
Let's stop this before someone gets hurt.

73
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:52,740
Kid, you are the worst.
Even I can see your lips move.

74
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,664
Come on, Sid, you're spoiling my act.

75
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,833
I worked on these jokes for weeks.

76
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:04,840
You call those jokes? My jockey shorts
are made out of better material.

77
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,465
And they're edible!

78
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:17,088
You see? I'm sure
you three can come up

79
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:21,959
with something... equally exciting.

80
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:39,721
Is anybody there?

81
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,438
Hello?

82
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,756
Hello?

83
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:13,515
I will be flesh!

84
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:08,966
<b>"The Puppet Show"</b>

85
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:12,429
I reach into the hat and out comes...

86
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,891
Uh, has anybody seen a rabbit?

87
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,240
- I can't do this.
- Xander, come on.

88
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,827
I-I can't! I have my pride.

89
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,082
OK, I don't have a lot of my pride,
but I have enough so that I can't do this.

90
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:38,297
A dramatic scene is the easiest way
to get through the talent show

91
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,092
because it doesn't require
an actual talent.

92
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:43,679
But we have talent. We can do stuff.

93
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,235
- Buffy, uh...
- What am I gonna do?

94
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:49,789
- Slay vampires on stage?
- Maybe in a funny way.

95
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,483
Willow, you can do stuff...
Uh, the piano.

96
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,652
- You play?
- A little.

97
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:58,048
That's cool. You can accompany us
and we can attempt to sing.

98
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,368
Oh, in front of other people?

99
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:03,206
Then, no, I don't play.

100
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,495
Whatever happened to
corporal punishment?

101
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:10,750
Mm-mm-mm. Look at the goodies.

102
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:14,011
Morgan, you're really getting good.

103
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:16,472
Where did you come up with that voice?

104
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:19,460
It's... kind of an imitation of my dad.

105
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:21,605
- Sounds real.
- It is real.

106
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:25,568
I'm the one with the talent here.
The kid's dead weight.

107
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:29,866
How about you and I do a little
rehearsing on our own, honey?

108
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,118
Hey!

109
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:35,165
You know what they say:
once you go wood, nothing's as good.

110
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:39,270
OK, Morgan, we get the joke.
Horny dummy, ha-ha, it's very funny,

111
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,823
but... you might wanna consider
getting some new shtick,

112
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:45,762
unless you want your prop
ending up as a Duraflame log!

113
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:50,060
Kids today need discipline.

114
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:52,856
It's an unpopular word
these days: discipline.

115
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:56,638
I know Principal Flutie would have said:
"Kids need understanding,"

116
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,531
"kids are human beings."

117
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:03,579
That's the kind of woolly-headed,
liberal thinking that leads to being eaten.

118
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:06,900
I-I think, perhaps, it was
a little more complex than that.

119
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:09,920
This place has quite a reputation.

120
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:12,966
Suicide, missing persons,

121
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,345
spontaneous cheerleader combustion.

122
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,719
You can't put up with that.

123
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:22,075
You gotta keep an eye on the bad element.

124
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,231
Like those three.

125
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:28,653
Kids!

126
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:30,823
I don't like them.

127
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:34,697
From now on you're going to see
a very different Sunnydale High.

128
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:40,456
A tight ship. Clean, orderly, and quiet.

129
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:07,581
- It was Emily.
- Emily? Dancer Emily?

130
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:10,585
Oh, man. I hate this school.

131
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:13,297
It must've happened just after...
dress rehearsals.

132
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:16,510
There was a cross-country meet at Melville.
Sh-sh-she never showed up for it.

133
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:19,515
- Vampire?
- I think not.

134
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:21,767
Giles, share. What happened?

135
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:24,396
- Her heart was removed.
- Yikes.

136
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:28,317
Does that mean anything to you?
Besides "oooh!"

137
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:33,158
There are various demons
which feed off human hearts, but...

138
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:37,913
But demons have claws and teeth.

139
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:40,225
They got no use for a big old knife.

140
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,289
Which more than likely
makes our murderer...

141
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:45,466
- Human.
- Did I mention that I hate this school?

142
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:49,053
So Emily was killed
by a regular human person?

143
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:51,765
The evidence certainly points that way.

144
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:56,189
No, wait. I'm not buying, you guys.

145
00:10:56,981 --> 00:11:00,819
Remember the Hellmouth?
Mystical activity is totally rife here.

146
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,064
- This, to me, says demon.
- I'd like to think you're right.

147
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:07,354
A demon is a creature of... evil -
pure and very simple.

148
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,875
A person driven to kill is-is, um...
It's more complex.

149
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,629
And the creep factor is also heightened.

150
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:17,376
It could be anyone. It could be me.

151
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,137
It's not, though.

152
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,016
Demon or no, we have investigating to do.

153
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,187
I suggest we start with your...
talent show compatriots.

154
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,874
One of them may've been
the last to see her alive.

155
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:32,445
I didn't know her too well. There's
a whole dancer-band rivalry, you know?

156
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:33,824
Heard about that.

157
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,284
But I did speak to her
a little the day that...

158
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,721
- Yesterday.
- How did she seem?

159
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:41,541
She was happy, I guess.
She was psyched to be in the show.

160
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:45,088
She was a really good dancer.
Here, pick a card.

161
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:50,219
No, wait, wait, wait!
Not that one. Pick this one.

162
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:52,881
D'you remember
the last time you saw her?

163
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,876
- She was talking to someone.
- Who?

164
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:58,313
That smart guy, the one with the dummy?
What's his name?

165
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:00,775
- Morgan?
- Yeah, that's it.

166
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:04,255
- He was acting kinda strange.
- Strange, how?

167
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,602
It's just such a tragedy for me.

168
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:11,724
- Emma was like my best friend.
- Emily.

169
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,964
Well, Morgan's just strange. He's always
rubbing his head a lot and moaning.

170
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,998
- Especially the other day.
- He seemed kinda paranoid,

171
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,754
looking around at everyone.

172
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:25,542
And I think I saw him arguing...
with his dummy.

173
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:28,354
All I can think is...
it could have been me!

174
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:30,733
We can dream.

175
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:42,527
Right now, you and me
gotta be on the lookout.

176
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,027
Figure out who's gonna be next.

177
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:47,296
How are we supposed to...

178
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,927
Hi.

179
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:54,264
Hello.

180
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:57,685
I was just working on throwing my voice.

181
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:02,526
Uh, Morgan, did you notice anything weird
going on around here yesterday?

182
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:05,471
Weird? What do you mean?

183
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:07,323
With Emily.

184
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:11,329
Did she... say anything to you?
Was she arguing with anyone?

185
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:14,458
No. She was dancing.

186
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:17,629
- Sid and I were talking.
- Talking?

187
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,799
Rehearsing.

188
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,385
So you didn't notice anything weird at...

189
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,557
Morgan, are you OK?

190
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:30,312
Look, sweetheart, he answered
your question. Now leave him alone.

191
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:33,149
OK, Morgan.
How about talking to me yourself now?

192
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,528
He's said all he's gonna say.

193
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:39,408
It's OK, Sid. We're done.

194
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,839
I'm sorry. Look,
I didn't mean to make you mad.

195
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:52,467
No, I'm...

196
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:55,555
It's him!

197
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:57,933
He's...

198
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,094
We have to go.

199
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,407
Cute couple.

200
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,331
OK, next time we split up,
someone else is on Cordy detail.

201
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:16,791
Five more minutes with her and
we would've had another organ donor.

202
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,203
I think I had a bit more luck.

203
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:21,548
Everyone I talked to seemed to
point their fingers at the same person.

204
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,009
- Morgan?
- Morgan.

205
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:27,014
- We have a winner.
- I fear I was led to the same conclusion.

206
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:30,894
Well, what do we do? We don't slay him,
right? We wanna bring him to justice.

207
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:34,566
We could set up a complex sting operation
where we get him to confess.

208
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,831
- I should wear a wire!
- Whoa, hey, you guys.

209
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:39,908
All we know is that
Morgan is a Grade A large weirdo.

210
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:42,021
That doesn't lead directly to murderer.

211
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:46,415
- The guy talks to his puppet.
- And for his puppet.

212
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:49,528
Yeah, but what about
the whole "it's a demon" theory?

213
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:52,596
I'm looking into that, but...
my investigation is somewhat...

214
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:55,344
hampered by life in the theatre.

215
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,597
Uh, priority check, Giles?

216
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,766
Talent show. Murder.

217
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:03,647
Yeah, we can't do the talent show.
It's unthinkable. I'm not able to think it.

218
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,776
Principal Snyder is
watching us all very closely.

219
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:09,590
If he chooses, he can make
all our lives extremely difficult.

220
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:13,064
A slayer cannot afford that.
We will find this murderer, but...

221
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:17,415
in the meantime...
the show must go on.

222
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,045
- This is so unfair.
- Buffy, you watch Morgan.

223
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,160
Check his locker,
see if there's anything there.

224
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:27,316
- Like a heart?
- Or something.

225
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:31,475
- All right.
- I'll pull up his locker number.

226
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,134
Can I still wear a wire?

227
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,512
OK. Two to the left,

228
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:00,681
three to the right.

229
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:18,180
- Principal Snyder!
- What are you doing?

230
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:21,216
- Uh, looking for something.
- School hours are over.

231
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:23,212
You, therefore, should be gone.

232
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,210
And I'm going any minute now.

233
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,302
There are things I will not tolerate.

234
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:30,872
Students loitering on campus after school,

235
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:33,893
horrible murders
with hearts being removed.

236
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:35,980
And also smoking.

237
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:40,256
Well, I don't do any of those things.
Not ever.

238
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,489
There's something going on with you.

239
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:46,076
I'll figure it out sooner or later.

240
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,873
Do you need something here?

241
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,044
Oh, yeah. Right.

242
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:57,341
Um, a friend wanted me
to get something out of his case.

243
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:10,109
He must have taken it
and forgotten to tell me.

244
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:18,787
Get along home now. It's late.

245
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,633
No, I can't do it!

246
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:29,801
It's the only way.

247
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:33,797
- I don't want...
- She's the one!

248
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:38,104
- But...
- You saw what she did. How strong she is.

249
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:40,816
- I know, but...
- She's the last.

250
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,737
Just this one more and I'll be free.

251
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,534
- I won't.
- I will!

252
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:55,053
Hi, hon. How's it, uh,
going with the talent show?

253
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,422
It'll be over soon.

254
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:01,594
It can't be that bad. l, for one,
am looking forward to seeing your act.

255
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:05,934
Seeing?
In the sense of actually attending?

256
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:08,250
- Of course!
- Uh-uh, no, Mom. Y-y...

257
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,916
You can't. I mean, if I know
you're out there watching,

258
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:14,954
- I'll freeze up. Stage fright.
- But I wanna support what you're doing.

259
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:18,962
Look, Mom, if you really love me
and wanna show your support,

260
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:23,649
you'll stay away.
Far away!

261
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:27,764
Honey, is there...
Is there something bothering you?

262
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:30,467
I mean, besides your fabulous debut.

263
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:34,053
Nothing.

264
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:38,776
There's just a lot going on right now.

265
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:43,151
Well, get some sleep.

266
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:46,780
- You'll feel better in the morning.
- Good plan.

267
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:25,923
Honey, what is it?

268
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:28,229
In the bed, in the covers,
there's something!

269
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:30,506
Where?

270
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,628
There's something there.

271
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,758
Well, there's nothing there now.
Are you sure you didn't have a nightmare?

272
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:43,140
No, there's some... There is...

273
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,684
Yeah.

274
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,283
You're probably right.
I'm sorry I got you up.

275
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:53,655
Don't worry about it.
I was dreaming about bills.

276
00:19:55,615 --> 00:20:00,603
Sweetheart, you shouldn't go to sleep
with the window open.

277
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,080
I didn't.

278
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:12,396
And my lovely... assistant...
steps into... the box.

279
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:21,534
And... Behold!

280
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:25,517
You were supposed to leave.

281
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,443
I don't understand why I ha...

282
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:31,652
Why I have to follow Brett
and his stupid band?

283
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:35,010
Because we have to clear their equipment
before the finale. I've told you!

284
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:38,265
But the mood. It'll be all wrong.

285
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:42,479
My song is about dignity
and human feelings

286
00:20:42,563 --> 00:20:46,576
and personal hygiene or something.

287
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:50,033
Anyway it's sappy, and
no one is gonna be feeling sappy

288
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:52,902
after all that rock'n'roll.

289
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,500
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

290
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:01,045
Um, your hair...

291
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,632
There's something wrong with my hair?

292
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:07,554
Oh, my God.

293
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:11,627
Xander was right.
It worked like a charm.

294
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:16,191
Hello.

295
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,560
You look a bit worse for, uh...

296
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:21,481
What exactly are you the worse for?

297
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:25,361
- Where's Morgan?
- I've, I-I... haven't seen him.

298
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:28,950
- Did he do something to you?
- No, it was his...

299
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:31,537
Sid, the dummy.

300
00:21:32,371 --> 00:21:34,298
OK, everyone look at me
like I'm in a bunny suit,

301
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:37,612
'cause that's how stupid I feel
saying this...

302
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:40,032
I think Sid was in my room last night.

303
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,618
With Morgan?

304
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:45,832
No. He was alone... and alive.

305
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:48,935
- Did you see him?
- I saw something.

306
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:51,497
I-it ran across my floor, under my bed
and then it attacked me.

307
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:55,382
Attacked you? How?
- It was like it pounced on my face.

308
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,250
- Like a cat?
- Yeah, exactly!

309
00:21:57,285 --> 00:21:58,860
But when I turned the lights on
it was already gone.

310
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:01,639
- I think it went out my window.
- Like a cat?

311
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,733
Yeah. No! It was Sid, the dummy.

312
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:08,920
Or possibly the nightmare of somebody
who had... dummies on her mind.

313
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:11,239
You did say they creep you out.

314
00:22:11,274 --> 00:22:13,810
Excuse me, can I have
a little support here, please?

315
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:16,889
I'm not just some crazy person.
I'm the Slayer.

316
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:19,142
The Dummy Slayer?

317
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:21,771
There's nothing funny about that.

318
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:26,235
Well, on the side of the
"Morgan's just crazy" theory, there is...

319
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,404
Well, Morgan.

320
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,820
I'd like to see Morgan
without his better half for a few minutes.

321
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:36,264
Bet he could tell me something.

322
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:42,507
Oh, if it's any consolation,
I may have found a possible demon culprit.

323
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,596
There's this reference in here
to a brotherhood of seven demons

324
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,807
who take the form of the unhumans.

325
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,979
Every seven years these demons
need human organs, a brain and a heart,

326
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:55,053
to maintain their humanity.

327
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:57,805
Otherwise they-they revert back
to their original form

328
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,824
which is... uh, slightly less appealing.

329
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:04,355
So... Morgan could still be the guy,

330
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,448
only Demon Morgan,
instead of Crazy Morgan.

331
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:11,660
Except that these demons
are-are-are

332
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:15,652
preternaturally strong,
and-and Morgan is-is...

333
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:19,633
Well, he seems to be
getting weaker every day.

334
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:23,988
It was as a result of this that
President Monroe put forth the eponymous -

335
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:27,284
meaning "named after oneself" -
Monroe Doctrine,

336
00:23:27,368 --> 00:23:32,166
which, in one sense, established
the US as a local peacekeeper...

337
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:03,708
Looks like someone digs you.
That's adorable.

338
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,754
You and the dummy
could tour in the freak show.

339
00:24:08,756 --> 00:24:13,054
OK, who can tell me
how Spain responded to this policy?

340
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,933
Morgan?

341
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:17,518
Morgan?

342
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:20,188
What?

343
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:22,609
Morgan has other things on his mind.

344
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:28,116
- Give me your puppet.
- I'll put him away.

345
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:31,495
You'll get it back after school.

346
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:40,674
OK, then, in the first part
of the 19th century...

347
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:42,886
I'm still watching you.

348
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:46,819
Morgan, that is enough!

349
00:24:58,448 --> 00:25:00,534
- Mrs. Jackson?
- Morgan.

350
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:04,369
- You said you'd give me...
- Oh, of course.

351
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,970
You know, I wanted to ask you.
Is everything OK?

352
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:17,683
- At home? Here at school?
- Yeah, it's great.

353
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,979
I feel like you've become...
a little detached.

354
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,334
You're one of the brightest kids
I've seen in a long time,

355
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:28,197
but... lately it seems
like you're not all there.

356
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:30,277
Try not to let other things
get in the way.

357
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:34,017
OK! Can I get Sid now?

358
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:36,292
Sure.

359
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:43,676
- It's gone.
- Gone?

360
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,306
What do you mean gone?

361
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:50,720
- Where could he have gone?
- I put it right here.

362
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:54,391
He knew to wait for me.
He knew I'd be back.

363
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:58,195
- What do you mean "he"?
- What did you do with him?

364
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:00,948
Where is he?

365
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,856
Where did you get that?

366
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:17,839
Oh, I... took that out of
Mrs. Jackson's cupboard. I...

367
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:20,213
thought, you said you wanted to
be able to speak to Morgan alone.

368
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,291
And, uh, well, Morgan's alone...

369
00:26:22,395 --> 00:26:25,317
and, uh... Sid's with me.

370
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:30,575
Hi, Buffy. Hi, Willow. Would you
like to hear some off-color jokes?

371
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,732
I really don't think
you should be doing that.

372
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:36,450
What? Come on!
I'm not real.

373
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:39,569
Xander, quit it!

374
00:26:39,604 --> 00:26:43,357
He's not real.

375
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:50,842
I think our demonstration
proves that Sid is wood.

376
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:55,173
Now, why don't you go find Morgan
and prove he is... whatever he is?

377
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,281
I imagine he's looking for his puppet.

378
00:26:57,316 --> 00:27:00,602
I'll go find Morgan.

379
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:03,177
You watch the dummy.

380
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:06,687
Bye-bye now.
I'm completely inanimate.

381
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:11,086
Redrum! Redrum!

382
00:27:12,087 --> 00:27:16,301
- What do we do with him?
- Hey! I'll keep him company.

383
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,054
Willow, we have some hunting
of our own to do.

384
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:24,321
Once again I'm banished to
the demon section of the card catalogue.

385
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:31,488
You concentrate on reanimation theory.
I'll peck about in organ harvesting.

386
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:35,076
- Unless, of course, you'd prefer...
- That's OK. You can have the organs.

387
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,123
So I guess it's just you and me, huh?

388
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:46,342
That looks more comfortable.

389
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,686
Morgan?!

390
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:08,538
Morgan?

391
00:28:39,254 --> 00:28:41,040
Principal Snyder.

392
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:45,129
- Looking for something?
- Have you seen Morgan Shay?

393
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:49,969
You know, with everything
that's been going on recently,

394
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:53,285
I'm not sure how safe it is...

395
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:56,602
for a girl like yourself to be here...

396
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:58,272
Alone.

397
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:00,734
Well, I was just leaving.

398
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,500
And I know how to take care of myself.

399
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:11,210
All right, then.

400
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:28,696
Look what I found in the section of
"Toys and Magic".

401
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:31,894
"On rare occasions inanimate objects
of human quality,

402
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:36,098
such as dolls and mannequins, already
mystically possessed of consciousness,

403
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:42,081
have acted upon their desire
to become human by harvesting organs."

404
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,376
- Emily's heart.
- Morgan's dummy.

405
00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:17,378
- What is it?
- He's gone! Sid's gone!

406
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:19,548
What? Oh!

407
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,119
Morgan?

408
00:31:09,306 --> 00:31:11,493
Morgan.

409
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:20,088
The demon's got himself a brain.

410
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:04,210
Who's ever out there,
I'm gonna hurt you! Badly!

411
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:07,508
If you'll just give me a minute.

412
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:31,419
You win.

413
00:32:31,454 --> 00:32:35,243
Now you can take your heart and your brain
and move on.

414
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,124
I'm sure they would have made
great trophies for your case.

415
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,254
- That would have been justice.
- Yeah, except for one thing.

416
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:45,254
You lost and now you'll never be human.

417
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:48,112
Yeah, well, neither will you.

418
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:52,548
- What?
- What?

419
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:56,589
This is what I do. I hunt demons.

420
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:59,929
Yeah. You wouldn't know it to look at me.

421
00:32:59,964 --> 00:33:05,138
Let's just say there was me, there was
a really mean demon, there was a curse,

422
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:08,885
and the next thing I know
I'm not me any more.

423
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,563
I'm sitting on some guy's knee
with his hand up my shirt.

424
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:16,954
And ever since then
you've been a living dummy?

425
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:20,785
The kid here was right.
I should have picked you to team up with.

426
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,010
- But I didn't because...
- Because you thought I was the demon.

427
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:26,921
Who can blame me for thinking?
Look at you.

428
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:29,995
You're strong, athletic,

429
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,417
limber,

430
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:35,690
nubile...

431
00:33:37,864 --> 00:33:42,397
I'm back. In any case, now that
this demon's got the heart and brain,

432
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:46,321
he gets to keep the human form
he's in for another seven years.

433
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:49,603
I must say, it's a welcome change to have
someone else explain all these things.

434
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:52,874
There were seven of these guys.
I've killed six.

435
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:56,719
If I can get the last one,
the curse will be lifted and I'll be free.

436
00:33:56,754 --> 00:33:59,523
I'm sure it's someone
in that stupid talent show.

437
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:02,179
Yeah, but now that demon has
what he wants, he'll be moving on.

438
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:04,777
So once we know
who's missing from the show...

439
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:06,734
We'll know who our demon is!

440
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:08,427
- The show!
- What?

441
00:34:08,462 --> 00:34:11,113
It's going to start!
I'm supposed to be there!

442
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:13,592
OK, um, start pulling
everyone's addresses in the talent show.

443
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,661
I-if they're not there, maybe
we can catch them at home.

444
00:34:15,696 --> 00:34:19,180
And you, get 'em all on stage.
Form the power circle.

445
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:21,293
Then we can see who's a no-show.

446
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:23,919
- Um, the what?
- The power circle.

447
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:27,121
You get everyone together,
you get 'em, you know, revved up.

448
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:29,306
Right.

449
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,883
How'd he ever get that gig?

450
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,011
15 minutes to curtain, everyone.

451
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:39,507
15 minutes.

452
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,666
I... I can't go out there.

453
00:34:41,701 --> 00:34:46,639
All those people staring at me and
judging me like I'm some kind of...

454
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,745
Buffy!
What if I mess up?

455
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,670
Cordelia, there's an adage
that if you're feeling nervous

456
00:34:54,705 --> 00:34:57,627
then, uh, you should imagine the entire
audience wearing their underwear.

457
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,113
Ew! Even Mrs. Franklin?

458
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:03,750
- Oh.
- Perhaps not.

459
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:10,076
All right, we'll assemble on the stage
in five minutes for the... uh, power thing.

460
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:13,076
So what's your deal, kid?

461
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:17,443
- I don't figure you for a demon hunter.
- I'm a vampire slayer.

462
00:35:17,478 --> 00:35:20,855
You? You're the Slayer?

463
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,511
Damn.

464
00:35:22,546 --> 00:35:25,132
I knew a slayer in the thirties.

465
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:28,978
Korean chick. Very hot.

466
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:34,888
We're talking muscle tone.
Man, we had some times.

467
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:38,643
Hey, that was pre-dummy, all right?

468
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,942
I was a guy.

469
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,738
So, you kill the demon...

470
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:48,583
- And the curse is lifted, right?
- That's the drill.

471
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:51,279
You don't actually
turn into a prince, do you?

472
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:55,650
- I mean, your body...
- Is dust and bones.

473
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:58,617
- When I say free...
- You mean dead.

474
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:00,985
Don't get sniffly on me, sis.

475
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,423
I've lived a lot longer
than most demon hunters.

476
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:06,604
Or slayers, for that matter.

477
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,702
Of course, if you want
to snuggle up and comfort me...

478
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:14,463
So that horny-dummy thing
really isn't an act, is it?

479
00:36:14,498 --> 00:36:16,163
- Nope.
- Yuck.

480
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:19,492
- Is everybody here?
- I think so.

481
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,589
OK, here's our line-up.

482
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:24,643
Quickly, everyone.

483
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:27,343
Um, power circle.

484
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,823
Well, that's that, then.
Everybody, uh, get ready.

485
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:42,587
That's it?

486
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:45,357
All right.

487
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:52,113
Hold on.

488
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,271
- No one's missing.
- So the demon isn't in the show?

489
00:36:58,306 --> 00:37:01,026
It seems not. Tell the others.
It's nearly curtain.

490
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:02,300
I must get the show running.

491
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:05,403
- Right.
- Right.

492
00:37:07,271 --> 00:37:10,451
Sid?

493
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,924
Sid?

494
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,776
I'm never gonna stop washing my hands.

495
00:37:55,811 --> 00:37:57,953
So the dummy tells us
that he's a demon hunter

496
00:37:57,954 --> 00:38:00,103
and we're like "Fine, la-la-la-la".

497
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:02,786
He takes off and now there's a brain.

498
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:05,476
Does anybody else feel like
they've been Keyser Soze'd?

499
00:38:05,511 --> 00:38:07,566
Sid's on the level, I'm sure of that.

500
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:09,888
But why would the demon've
rejected the brain?

501
00:38:09,923 --> 00:38:12,009
I-I mean, I thought Morgan was
the smartest kid in school.

502
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:15,160
He was. Look at his grades. All A's.

503
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:17,277
He was even taking college classes.

504
00:38:17,312 --> 00:38:19,205
- Wait a second.
- What?

505
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,721
- All these sick days.
- He was out for, like, half the year.

506
00:38:22,756 --> 00:38:25,665
Check the school nurse's file.

507
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:31,733
Look at this. "In case of emergency,
contact Dr Dale Leggett,

508
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:35,701
California Institute of Neurosurgery,
Cancer Ward."

509
00:38:35,736 --> 00:38:39,025
- Brain cancer?
- That's why he had all the headaches.

510
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,161
This means that whatever's out there
still needs a healthy, intelligent brain.

511
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:43,972
In other words, I'm safe.

512
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:48,461
And it's gonna be looking for
the smartest person around.

513
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:50,401
What?

514
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:53,914
Yes, if you, you calibrated the units
of weight, then you could calculate the,

515
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:57,115
uh, specific maximum velocity
achieved before the point of impact.

516
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,685
Gee, Mr. Giles! You're really smart.
Could you do me a favor?

517
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,130
What could a demon possibly want from me?

518
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:05,435
What's the square root of 841?

519
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,866
29. Oh, yeah.

520
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:11,588
Don't worry, Willow. As long as you're
with us there's absolutely no way

521
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:13,877
that demon is gonna get what he wants.

522
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,772
- Oh, my.
- Pretty cool, huh?

523
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:25,864
Are you sure there's no one else
who could help you out?

524
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:28,196
- My assistant got sick.
- You won't have to say anything.

525
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:32,694
- I'll show you. Lie down.
- How exactly does it work?

526
00:39:32,729 --> 00:39:36,478
A good magician never tells his secrets.

527
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:40,880
Come on. We haven't got much time.

528
00:39:40,915 --> 00:39:44,893
This is ridiculous. We can't just sit here
and wait for him to come to us.

529
00:39:44,928 --> 00:39:46,737
We have to figure out
who we're dealing with.

530
00:39:46,772 --> 00:39:49,165
- I still vote dummy.
- No!

531
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,130
OK, so we ruled out
all the people in the talent show.

532
00:39:52,165 --> 00:39:56,407
That's because they were all there,
but that's before we found the brain.

533
00:39:56,442 --> 00:40:00,347
Right. So it probably is one of them.

534
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:03,193
And Giles doesn't know it.
He's with them all right now!

535
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:08,747
Ugh, Giles can handle himself.
I mean, he is really...

536
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,994
smart.

537
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:13,095
Giles!

538
00:40:18,272 --> 00:40:20,934
- Shouldn't it be aimed at my neck?
- No!

539
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,704
No, this way your scalp gets sliced off

540
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:28,482
and your brains just...
come pouring out.

541
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:33,346
- What exactly is the trick?
- Trick?

542
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:35,639
Mark?

543
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:44,593
Ma-Mark?

544
00:41:17,464 --> 00:41:20,390
- Where are the keys?
- Mark's got it.

545
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:22,922
Willow!

546
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:26,828
Hurry!

547
00:41:38,504 --> 00:41:40,417
How do you lock this thing?

548
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,901
What's happening?

549
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:01,966
I found you!

550
00:42:13,288 --> 00:42:15,349
Let go!

551
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,417
I must say, all of you,

552
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:31,930
your t-timing is impeccable.

553
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:34,830
And now for the big finish.

554
00:42:34,865 --> 00:42:37,199
What are you doing?

555
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:39,689
It's not enough.

556
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,150
He'll come back.

557
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:47,479
You have to get the heart,
then all of this will be over.

558
00:42:47,514 --> 00:42:51,393
- Let me.
- I got it.

559
00:42:51,428 --> 00:42:53,854
Thanks.

560
00:43:24,075 --> 00:43:27,336
It's over.

561
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:45,610
I don't get it.

562
00:43:45,645 --> 00:43:49,685
What is it? Avant-garde?

563
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,707
O ruler of my country, Oedipus,
you see our company around the altar,

564
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:56,217
- and l, the priest of Zeus.
- Ha-ha.

565
00:43:56,252 --> 00:43:58,315
They prophesied that
I should kill my father,

566
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:00,992
but he is dead
and hidden deep in the soil.

567
00:44:01,027 --> 00:44:03,526
But surely I must fear my mother's bed.

568
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:06,220
Oh, Oedipus, Oedipus, unhappy Oedipus.

569
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:09,599
That is all I can call you
and all that I ever shall call you.

570
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:12,744
Darkness! And horror of darkness.

571
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:17,236
Unfolding, restless, visitant,
sped by an ill wind in haste.

572
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:22,341
Madness and... madness
a-a-and... stabbing pain and

573
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:24,720
and... um, oh...

574
00:44:26,638 --> 00:44:28,516
Oh...

575
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,517
Memory of, uh... ill deeds I have done.

576
