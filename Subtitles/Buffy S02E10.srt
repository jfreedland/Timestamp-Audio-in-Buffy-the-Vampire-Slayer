1
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:10,761
OK. One more time. You're the who?

2
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:13,593
I'm de Slayer.

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,391
Nice cover story, but here's a tip:

4
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:19,042
you might wanna try it on someone
who's not the real Slayer.

5
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:21,905
You can't stop me.
Even if you kill me,

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,334
anodder slayer will be sent
to take me place.

7
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,751
Could you stop with the slayer thing?
I'm the damned Slayer!

8
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:29,129
Nonsense. Dere is but one...

9
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:31,542
and I am she.

10
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:33,667
OK...

11
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,190
Scenario...

12
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:41,251
You back off. I'll back off.

13
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:44,204
But you promise not to go all wiggy
until we can go to my watcher

14
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:47,506
- and figure this out.
- Wiggy?

15
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,612
You know... no kicko, no fighto.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,309
I accept your scenario.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,313
So... you were sent here?

18
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:06,441
Yes. By my Watcher.

19
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:09,810
- To do what exactly?
- To do my duty.

20
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:12,735
I'm here to kill vampires.

21
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:35,767
<b>"What's My Line. Part 2"</b>

22
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:39,014
And your watcher is Sam Zabuto, you say?

23
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:40,984
- Yes, sir.
- We've never met.

24
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,020
- But he, he's, he's very well-respected.
- What?

25
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:45,200
So he's a real guy, as in non-fictional?

26
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:48,008
- And you are called...?
- I am de Vampire Slayer.

27
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,421
We got that part, honey.
He means your name.

28
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:55,396
Oh. Dey call me Kendra.

29
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:57,278
I have no last name, sir.

30
00:02:57,313 --> 00:03:01,534
- Can you say stuck in the '80s?
- Buffy, please.

31
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:04,300
There's obviously some-some
misunderstanding here.

32
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:07,137
- Hey!
- Identify yourself!

33
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:10,249
Back off, Pink Ranger!
This is my friend.

34
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:12,433
- Friend?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:14,716
As in person you hang with? Amigo?

36
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,759
I don't understand.

37
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:19,010
You try. I'm tapped.

38
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:22,479
Kendra, there are a few people -

39
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,989
civilians, if you like -
who know Buffy's identity.

40
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:28,358
Willow is one of them.
And they also...

41
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,496
spend time together... socially.

42
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:33,554
And you allow this, sir?

43
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:36,754
- Well, uh...
- But the Slayer must work in secret,

44
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:39,633
- for security.
- Of course.

45
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:43,297
But, uh, with Buffy,
however, it-it's, um...

46
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,684
Some flexibility is required.

47
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,994
- Why?
- Hi, guys. What's goin' on?

48
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,146
Apparently, there's been
a really big mix-up.

49
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:56,050
It seems somehow that another slayer
has been sent to Sunnydale.

50
00:03:56,085 --> 00:04:00,119
Is that even possible?
I mean, two slayers at the same time?

51
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:02,148
Not to my knowledge. Um...

52
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:06,948
The new slayer is only called
after the previous slayer has died.

53
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,950
Good Lord.

54
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:14,028
- You were dead, Buffy.
- I was only gone for a minute.

55
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:16,073
Clearly that doesn't matter
how long you were gone.

56
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,288
You were physically dead, thus causing
the activation of the next slayer.

57
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:22,329
She died?

58
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:25,589
- Just a little.
- She drowned, but she was revived.

59
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,475
So there really are two of them.

60
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,982
It would seem so.
This is completely unprecedented!

61
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,439
I'm quite flummoxed.

62
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:35,695
What's the flum? It's a mistake,
she isn't supposed to be here,

63
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:37,395
she goes home!
Look, no offense,

64
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,914
I really don't mean this personally,
but I'm not dead...

65
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,434
and, frankly, having you around
creeps me out just a little a bit.

66
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:46,368
I cannot just leave.
I was sent here for a reason.

67
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,261
Mr Zabuto said all de signs indicate

68
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:52,306
dat a very dark power's about
to rise in Sunnydale.

69
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,777
And what's your plan
for fighting this dark power?

70
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:57,181
You're just gonna attack people randomly
till you find a bad one?

71
00:04:57,216 --> 00:05:00,248
- Of course not.
- Then why the hell did you attack me?

72
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:03,389
I tought you were a vampire.

73
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:05,971
A swing and a miss for the rookie.

74
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,049
I had good reason to tink you were.

75
00:05:08,084 --> 00:05:12,170
- Did I not see you kissing a vampire?
- Buffy would never do that!

76
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:16,281
Oh... Except for sometimes you do that.

77
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,935
But only with Angel... Right?

78
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,294
Yes! Right.

79
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:26,490
Look, you saw me with Angel
and he is a vampire, but he's good.

80
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:29,806
Angel? You mean Angelus?

81
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:34,140
I've read about him. He is a monster.

82
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,620
No, no, no. He's good now.

83
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:39,680
- Really!
- He had a Gypsy curse.

84
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:43,003
- He has a what?
- You know, just trust me on this one, OK?

85
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,310
- He's on the home team now.
- I cannot believe you.

86
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,302
He looked to me just like
anodder animal when I...

87
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,342
When you what?

88
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,403
What did you do to him?

89
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,418
- I...
- What did you do?

90
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:56,818
Here you go, friend.

91
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,285
He'll be as good as new in a day or so.
Wait, wait, wait...

92
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,540
We had a deal, right?

93
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:06,643
What's the matter, Willy?
Don't you trust me?

94
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:08,887
Oh, yeah. Like a brother.

95
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:14,343
Talk, and I'll have your guts for garters.

96
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,625
Wild horses couldn't drag it.

97
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:21,533
Oops!
Sorry, friend.

98
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:30,363
- What're you gonna do with him anyway?
- I'm thinkin'...

99
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:32,223
Maybe dinner and a movie.

100
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:34,280
Don't want to rush into anything.

101
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,112
I've been hurt, you know.

102
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,462
Do you have anything in raisin?

103
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:48,518
I know you wouldn't think so,
but I'm both a winter and a summer.

104
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:52,305
$9.99, tax included.

105
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,638
You said that already.
Do you have anything in the berry family?

106
00:07:57,972 --> 00:08:02,341
- Are there more ladies in the house?
- Oh, no. They're not home.

107
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:04,504
You know, nothing personal, but maybe

108
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:07,186
you should look into
selling dictionaries or...

109
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,381
some...

110
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:17,902
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh, he's a salesman

111
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:20,171
and he was just leaving, right?

112
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,625
Uh... OK. Bye-bye. Thank you.

113
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:25,581
OK, Mary Kay. Time to...

114
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:31,377
Time to run!

115
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,618
Find something to cover
the crack under the door!

116
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:48,146
Uh... Here! I don't do worms!

117
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,980
Cover me.

118
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,964
Eww! Eh! Eh!

119
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:01,501
Angel!

120
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,274
- No ashes.
- What?

121
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,030
When a vampire combusts, he leaves ashes.

122
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:13,105
- Yeah, I know the drill.
- So I did not kill him.

123
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,052
And I don't need to kill you!

124
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:19,536
Whoa! There's
a lot of tension in this room.

125
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:24,009
Doesn't anyone just say 'hello'
where you come from?

126
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,399
Dis one is dirty! I can feel it!

127
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,363
That's really good for you,
Percepto Girl,

128
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:32,855
but we're not gonna get anything out of him
if he's, oh, say, unconscious.

129
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,377
- Where's Angel?
- My buddy Angel?

130
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:38,401
You think I'd let him fry?
I saved him in the nick.

131
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:40,476
He was about five minutes away
from being a crispy critter.

132
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:43,509
- Where'd he go?
- He... said he was gonna stay underground.

133
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:46,662
You know... recuperate.

134
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:49,117
Are you telling me the truth?

135
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:52,412
I swear on my mother's grave... Should...
something fatal happen to her, God forbid.

136
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:56,968
Then he is all right. We can return
to your watcher for our orders.

137
00:09:57,003 --> 00:10:00,283
I don't take orders. I do things my way.

138
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:04,514
- No wonder you died.
- Let's go.

139
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:10,238
I... I have to ask. Has...

140
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,531
either of you girls
considered modelling?

141
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:15,776
I have a friend with a camera.
Strictly high-class nude work.

142
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,830
You know, art photographs, but naked.

143
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:24,098
You don't have to answer right away.

144
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:39,303
I was dreaming.

145
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,830
Of what, pet?

146
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:44,778
We were in Paris.

147
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,834
You had a branding iron.

148
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:49,350
I brought you something.

149
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:53,233
And there were worms in my baguette.

150
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,981
Your sire, my sweet.

151
00:10:57,016 --> 00:11:00,345
- Angel?
- The one and only.

152
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,280
Now, all we need is the full moon tonight.

153
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:07,991
And he will die,
and you will be fully restored,

154
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:11,792
my black goddess.

155
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:16,582
My ripe, wicked plum.

156
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:20,822
- It's been...
- Forever.

157
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:33,899
Spike? Let me have him. Mm?

158
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,890
Until the moon.

159
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:44,398
All right. You can play...

160
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:48,067
but... don't kill him.
He mustn't die till the ritual.

161
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:52,068
Bring him to me.

162
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:08,361
You've been a very bad daddy.

163
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,812
Kendra, I-I've, uh, conferred with
your Watcher, Mr. Zabuto, and, uh...

164
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:27,190
we both agree that, uh, until this matter
with Spike and Drusilla has been resolved

165
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:30,492
- that you two should work together.
- Oh, that'll be a treat.

166
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:34,819
So you believe that Spike is attempting
to revive this...

167
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,609
- Drusilla to health.
- Yes, well, I-I-I think that's the, uh...

168
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:40,260
the dark power that your, your
Watcher re-referred to.

169
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:44,578
You see, uh, Drusilla's not only evil,
she's, uh, well, she's also quite mad,

170
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:47,299
and-and-and-and if she's restored
to her full health, then, uh,

171
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,434
well, there's no, absolutely no
telling what she might do.

172
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,532
- Den we will stop Spike.
- Ooh! Good plan!

173
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,144
- Let's go! Charge!
- Buffy...

174
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:55,467
It's a little more complicated
than that, John Wayne.

175
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:58,147
Yes, I'm, I'm afraid it is.
You see, Spike has also called out

176
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,401
the Order of Taraka
to keep Buffy out of the way.

177
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:04,471
De assassins? I read of dem
in de writings of Dramius.

178
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:08,133
- Oh, really? Which volume?
- I believe it was six, sir.

179
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:11,409
- Um... How do you know all this?
- From me studies.

180
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:13,629
So obviously you have a lot of free time.

181
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:15,751
I study because it is required.

182
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:19,333
- De Slayer Handbook insists on it.
- There's a slayer handbook?

183
00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:21,948
Wait. Handbook? What handbook?
How come I don't have a handbook?

184
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:24,989
Is there a T-shirt too?
'Cause that would be cool.

185
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:28,260
After meeting you, Buffy,
I realised that, uh...

186
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:31,008
the handbook would be
of no use in your case.

187
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,047
What do you mean
"it would be of no use in my case"?

188
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:34,602
Wha-what's wrong with my case?

189
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:38,330
Kendra, um, perhaps you'd like to show me
the, the part in, uh, Dramius Six where,

190
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:40,636
uh, uh, it refers to the Order of Taraka?

191
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,929
I, I seem to have never been able to
get through that book. It was a bit stodgy.

192
00:13:43,964 --> 00:13:47,565
It was difficult. All dose footnotes...

193
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,012
Hello, and welcome to
planet pocket protector.

194
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:53,260
Oh, uh... Buffy, Principal Snyder
was snooping round after you.

195
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:56,323
- Eee... Career fair.
- Best make an appearance, I think.

196
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:59,320
- Right.
- Buffy's a student here?

197
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:02,143
- Yes.
- Right. Of course.

198
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:05,200
And I imagine she's a cheerleader as well.

199
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:07,676
Oh, no, well, a-a-actually
she had to give up her cheerleading.

200
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:11,611
Uh, it was quite an
amusing story, actually...

201
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:14,704
L-let's go and find the book, shall we?

202
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:19,429
- Get a load of the she-Giles.
- Creepy!

203
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,192
I bet Giles wishes
I was more of a book geek.

204
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:27,498
Giles is enough of a book geek
for the both of you.

205
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,242
Yeah, but did you see
how they were vibing?

206
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,512
"Volume 6. Ha-ha-ha!"

207
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:34,838
Buffy, no one could replace you.

208
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,564
You'll always be Giles' favourite.

209
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,444
I wonder.

210
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:44,177
Of course you will.
You're his slayer. The real Slayer.

211
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,140
No...

212
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:50,067
I wonder if it would be so bad,
being replaced.

213
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:53,939
- You mean, like, letting Kendra take over?
- Maybe.

214
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:56,977
Maybe after this thing
with Spike and the assassins is over,

215
00:14:57,012 --> 00:15:00,305
I could say "Kendra, you slay.
I'm going to Disneyland."

216
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,892
But not forever, right?

217
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:05,837
No. Disneyland would get boring
after a few months.

218
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:09,940
But I could do other stuff.
Career day stuff.

219
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,822
Maybe I could even have... a normal life.

220
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:21,857
Could you sit down, or change your pattern
or something? You're making me queasy.

221
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,503
Because you're just sitting there.
You should be thinking up a plan.

222
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:27,185
I have a plan. We wait. Buffy saves us.

223
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:30,737
- How will she even know where to find us?
- Cordelia, this is Buffy's house.

224
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:32,628
- Odds are she'll find us.
- What if she doesn't?

225
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:35,500
What am I supposed to do?
Just waste away down here with you?

226
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,332
- No, thank you.
- What are you doin'?

227
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,984
- Going to see if he's gone!
- That's brilliant! What if he isn't?

228
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,178
Oh, right! You think
we should just slack here and hope

229
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:47,060
that somebody else decides to be a hero?
Sorry. Forgot I was stranded with a loser!

230
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:49,301
And yet I never forgot
that I'm stuck with the numb-brain

231
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:51,463
that let Mr. Mutant in the house
in the first place!

232
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:53,931
- He looked normal!
- What, is he supposed to have

233
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:55,952
an arrow with the word
'assassin' over his head?!

234
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:58,142
All it took was the prospect
of a free makeover,

235
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:00,269
and you licked his hand
like a big, dumb dog!

236
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:03,058
You know what? I'm going.

237
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:05,876
I'd rather be worm food
than look at your face!

238
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:08,384
- Then go. I'm not stoppin' ya.
- I bet you wouldn't.

239
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:11,502
I bet you'd let a girl go off
to her doom all by herself.

240
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,230
Not just any girl. You're special.

241
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,817
I can't believe that I'm stuck
spending what will probably be

242
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:18,934
my last few moments on Earth here with you!

243
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:22,920
I hope these are my last moments. Three
more seconds with you and I'm gonna...

244
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:26,451
- I'm gonna what, coward?
- Moron.

245
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,501
- I hate you!
- I hate you!

246
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:41,393
We so need to get outta here.

247
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,896
He's gone.

248
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,438
Oh, my God! My God! Get them off of me!

249
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:15,744
Just get them off! Get them off of me!

250
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,883
Oh, my God! Get them off...

251
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:27,256
OK, OK! Let's get out of here!
Xander, let's go!

252
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,443
OK? Let's go!

253
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:44,294
My tests say that I should look into
law enforcement... - duh! -

254
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:46,315
and environmental design.

255
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,790
Environmental design,
that's landscaping, right?

256
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,866
I checked the shrub box.

257
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:56,673
But landscaping was yesterday,
so law enforcement it is.

258
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,179
Hey, Will, don't look, okay, but...
No, don't look!

259
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,884
That guy over there
is totally checking you out.

260
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:06,690
Oh, that's Oz. He's expressing
computer nerd solidarity.

261
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:10,444
Really? Then why is he
on his way over here right now?

262
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:12,465
Told you.

263
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,530
- Hey.
- Hey.

264
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:18,165
- Your hair is brown.
- Oh, yeah, sometimes.

265
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,889
So did you decide? Are you gonna be
a corporate computer suit guy?

266
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:26,584
Oh... Oh, well, I think I'm gonna
finish high school first.

267
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,665
What about you?

268
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,512
I'm not really a computer person, you know,
or a work-of-any-kind person.

269
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,619
- Then why did they select you?
- Well, I sorta test well,

270
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:40,477
you know, which is cool,
except when it leads to jobs.

271
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:44,695
- Don't you have some ambition?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. E flat diminished ninth.

272
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,174
- Huh?
- Well, the E flat, it's doable...

273
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,331
but it's that diminished ninth,
you know... it's a man's chord.

274
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:53,217
You could lose a finger.

275
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,386
All right, listen up
and answer when I call your name!

276
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:04,751
Buffy Summers?

277
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:17,523
- Get down!
- Look out!

278
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:59,379
He's... He's shot! Are you OK?

279
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:03,350
Yeah... I'm shot, you know! Wow!

280
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:06,524
It's odd... and painful.

281
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,423
She's gone.

282
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,971
W-was that a demonstration?

283
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:20,595
She was definitely in the Taraka gang,
Giles, and way gun-happy.

284
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,575
This, um... Oz chappie, he's all right?

285
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,010
The paramedic said it was only a scrape.
Thank goodness.

286
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:31,709
- Down, girl!
- Who sponsored career day today?

287
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:34,126
The British soccer fan association?

288
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:38,421
We had a rather violent visit
from the Order of Taraka.

289
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:43,095
You wanna talk Order of Taraka?
We just met the king freak of the... Hello!

290
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,519
Oh, forgive me.
Xander, Cordelia, this is Kendra.

291
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:49,827
It's rather complicated,
but she's also a slayer.

292
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:51,748
Hi. Nice to meet you.

293
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,012
A slayer, huh?

294
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:57,140
I knew this "I'm the only one,
I'm the only one" thing

295
00:20:57,141 --> 00:21:00,905
- was just an attention-getter.
- Just say hello, Xander.

296
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,849
Welcome. So...

297
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:08,776
you're a slayer, huh?
I like that in a woman.

298
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:11,277
I... hope...

299
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:15,644
I tank you... I mean, sir, um...

300
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,527
I will be of service.

301
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:22,619
Great! Good. It's good to be a giver.

302
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:26,679
Xander, this assassin you encountered,
what did he look like?

303
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:30,779
Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! I'm showering!

304
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,092
Like that.

305
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,526
You and bug people, Xander.
What's up with that?

306
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,066
No, but this dude was completely different
than Praying Mantis Lady.

307
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:40,908
He was a man of bugs,
not a man who was a bug.

308
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:43,564
The, uh, the-the-the important thing
is everybody's alright.

309
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:45,869
Still, it's quite apparent
that we're under serious attack.

310
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:49,175
These Taraka are definitely serious.

311
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,446
Fortunately for me, so is Kendra.

312
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:53,635
And, uh, I fear
the worst is still to come. I've-

313
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:56,125
I've discovered
the remaining keys to Drusilla's cure.

314
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,810
The, uh, the ritual requires that-
the presence of her sire,

315
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:01,114
and it must take place in a church
on the night of the new moon.

316
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:03,891
- The new moon? But that is tonight.
- Exactly!

317
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:05,968
And I'm sure the assassins were here
to kill Buffy before

318
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:08,827
she could put a stop to things.

319
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:11,921
They need Drusilla's sire.
You mean the vamp that made her?

320
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:16,000
- Yes.
- Buffy, what is it?

321
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:20,632
Angel.

322
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,809
He's Drusilla's sire.

323
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:25,417
Man, that guy got major neck in his day!

324
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:30,814
Will this ritual kill him?

325
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,530
Yes, I'm afraid it will.

326
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:37,030
We need to find this church. We need to
find where this ritual's gonna take place!

327
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,741
Agreed, and we must work quickly.
We have five hours before sundown.

328
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,223
- Don't worry, Buffy. We'll save Angel.
- Angel?

329
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:46,373
- But our priority is to stop Drusilla.
- Angel's our friend!

330
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,441
Except I don't like him.

331
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:51,243
Look, you've got your priorities
and I've got mine.

332
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,644
Right now they mesh.

333
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,824
So are you gonna help me
or are you gonna get out of my way?

334
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:04,206
I'm wit you.

335
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:06,844
Good. 'Cause I've had it.

336
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:09,007
Spike is going down.

337
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:13,051
You can attack me, you can send
assassins after me - that's fine.

338
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:18,496
But nobody messes with my boyfriend.

339
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:34,221
My mommy ate lemons...

340
00:23:34,222 --> 00:23:36,358
raw.

341
00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:40,568
She said she loved the way
they made her mouth...

342
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:43,264
tingle.

343
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,350
Little Anne...

344
00:23:49,835 --> 00:23:53,545
Her favourite was custard, brandied pears.

345
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,825
- Dru...
- Shh.

346
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,147
And pomegranates.

347
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:04,753
They used to make
her face and fingers...

348
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:07,789
all red.

349
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,556
Remember, hm?

350
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:15,712
Little fingers, little hands.

351
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,211
Do you?

352
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:21,309
- If I could...
- Bite your tongue.

353
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,572
They used to eat...

354
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:27,761
cake and eggs and honey.

355
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:33,038
Until you came
and ripped their throats out.

356
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:41,829
There are 43 churches in Sunnydale?
That seems a little excessive.

357
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:44,222
It's the extra evil vibe
from the Hellmouth.

358
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:46,271
Makes people pray harder.

359
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:49,355
Check and see if any of them
are closed or abandoned.

360
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:54,183
Yeah, yeah, we got monsters, we got
demons, but no... bug dude or police lady.

361
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:56,502
Well, you should
have better luck with this one.

362
00:24:56,503 --> 00:25:00,587
There's a whole section
devoted to the Order of Taraka.

363
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:06,916
And dose two,
dey also know you are de Slayer?

364
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:09,513
- Yep.
- Did anyone explain to you

365
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:12,420
what "secret identity" means?

366
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:16,324
Nope. Must be in the handbook, right
after the chapter on personality removal.

367
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,547
- Be careful with that thing!
- Please.

368
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:21,858
I'm an expert in all weapons.

369
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:26,436
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, it's OK.

370
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:29,348
- Kendra killed the bad lamp.
- Sorry!

371
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:34,663
Dis, uh... trigger mechanism is different.

372
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:39,263
Perhaps when dis is over,
you can, uh, show me how to work it.

373
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:45,031
When this is over, I'm thinking
pineapple pizza and teen video movie fest.

374
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:47,810
Possibly something
from the Ringwald oeuvre,

375
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:55,204
Oh, here we go.
I am the bug man, coo-coo ca-choo.

376
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,373
OK. OK...

377
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:03,157
He can only be killed
when he's in his disassembled state.

378
00:26:03,192 --> 00:26:05,178
Disassembled. That means

379
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:08,201
when he's broken down
into his little buggy parts.

380
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,078
I know what it means, dorkhead!

381
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:14,167
Dorkhead! You slash me with your words!

382
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:17,682
Your life is very different to mine.

383
00:26:17,717 --> 00:26:19,872
You mean the part
where I occasionally have one?

384
00:26:19,873 --> 00:26:23,154
- Yeah, I guess it is.
- De tings you do and have,

385
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:27,553
I was taught, distract from my calling.

386
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:31,082
Friends, school,

387
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:33,717
- even family.
- Even family?

388
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:38,443
My parents, dey... sent me
to my Watcher when I was very young.

389
00:26:38,478 --> 00:26:40,955
- How young?
- I don't remember dem, actually.

390
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,249
I've seen pictures, but, uh...

391
00:26:43,284 --> 00:26:46,582
dat's how seriously
de calling is taken by my people.

392
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:49,063
My modder and fadder...
gave me to my Watcher

393
00:26:49,064 --> 00:26:52,940
because... dey believed dat dey
were doing de right ting for me...

394
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:55,903
and for de world.

395
00:26:57,331 --> 00:27:02,163
Please... I don't feel sorry for meself.
Why should you?

396
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,942
I don't know. I... I guess
it just sounds very lonely.

397
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:11,964
Emotions are weakness, Buffy.
You shouldn't entertain dem.

398
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:14,950
Kendra, my emotions give me power.
They're total assets.

399
00:27:14,985 --> 00:27:17,556
Maybe... for you.

400
00:27:17,557 --> 00:27:20,741
But I prefer to keep an even mind.

401
00:27:20,776 --> 00:27:23,477
Mm... I guess that explains it.

402
00:27:23,512 --> 00:27:27,442
- Explains what?
- Oh, well... When we were fighting...

403
00:27:27,477 --> 00:27:32,082
You're amazing. Your technique -
it's flawless. It's... better than mine.

404
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,769
I know.

405
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:38,055
Still... I would have kicked
your butt in the end. And you know why?

406
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,056
- No imagination.
- Really? You tink so?

407
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:45,988
Oh, I know so. You're good,
but power alone isn't enough.

408
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:49,429
A good fighter needs to know
how to improvise, go with the flow...

409
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:52,532
Seriously, don't get me wrong.
You really do have potential.

410
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,738
Potential?

411
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,798
I could wipe de floor
wit you right now!

412
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,846
That would be anger you're feeling.

413
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:06,889
- What?
- You feel it, right?

414
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:10,864
How the anger gives you fire?
A slayer needs that.

415
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,830
Excuse me, ladies.

416
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:19,302
Nice knife.

417
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:23,126
I'm guessing dating isn't
big with your Watcher either.

418
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,753
I'm not permitted to speak wit boys.

419
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,204
Unless you're pummelling them.

420
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,734
- Wait a minute.
- What?

421
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:33,733
That guy... The sleazoid
you nearly decked in the bar.

422
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:38,248
- You tink he might help us?
- I "tink" we might make him.

423
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,348
Say "uncle".

424
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:47,424
Oh, that's right! You killed my uncle.

425
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,897
That's it, then. Off to church.

426
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:52,146
It makes pretty colours.

427
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:56,164
I'll see him die soon enough.
I've never been much for the pre-show.

428
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,112
Too bad.

429
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:01,816
That's what Drusilla likes best,
as I recall.

430
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:03,853
What's that supposed to mean?

431
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:08,195
Ask her. She knows what I mean.

432
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:14,183
- Well?
- Sh... Bad dog.

433
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:17,160
You should have let me talk to him, Dru.

434
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:20,089
Sounds like your boy
could use some pointers.

435
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:22,245
She likes to be teased.

436
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,076
Keep your hole shut!

437
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,528
Take care of her, Spike.

438
00:29:27,563 --> 00:29:30,516
The way she touched me just now?

439
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:34,133
- I can tell when she's not satisfied.
- I said shut up!

440
00:29:34,168 --> 00:29:37,573
Or maybe you two
just don't have the fire we had.

441
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:39,112
That's enough.

442
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:42,465
Spike, no!

443
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:50,254
Oh... Right.

444
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,367
Right... You almost got me.

445
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:59,333
Aren't you a "throw himself to the lions"
sort of sap these days?

446
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:02,929
Well, the lions are onto you, baby.

447
00:30:02,964 --> 00:30:08,182
If I kill you now, you go quick...
and Dru hasn't got a chance.

448
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:10,646
And if Dru dies...

449
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:14,012
your little Rebecca of Sunnyhell Farm
and her mates

450
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:17,209
are spared her coming-out party.

451
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:22,113
Spike, the moon is rising. It's time.

452
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:27,389
Too bad, Angelus.
Looks like you go the hard way.

453
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:31,293
Along with the rest of this miserable town.

454
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,990
Honest! I don't know where Angel is!

455
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:41,950
What about this ritual?
What have you heard?

456
00:30:41,985 --> 00:30:46,037
- Nothing. It's all hush-hush.
- Just hit him, Buffy!

457
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:49,310
She likes to hit.

458
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,775
You know... maybe I did hear
something about this ritual.

459
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,417
Yeah... It's coming back to me.

460
00:30:57,452 --> 00:31:00,397
But, uh... I'd have to take you there.

461
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:04,244
- Let's go.
- First we must return to de Watcher.

462
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,826
Excuse me? While we run to Giles,
this whole thing could go down.

463
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:11,097
- But it is procedure.
- It's brainless, you mean!

464
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:13,508
If we don't go now, Angel could die!

465
00:31:13,543 --> 00:31:17,271
Is dat all you're worried about?
Your boyfriend?

466
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:21,102
- No, it's not all, but it's enough.
- It's as I feared.

467
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:26,584
He clouds your judgement.
We can't stop dis ritual alone.

468
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,964
Are you listening to me? He could die!

469
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:32,256
He's a vampire. He should die.

470
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:35,918
Why am I de only person who sees it?

471
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:41,845
Are you dat big a fool?

472
00:31:44,493 --> 00:31:47,335
Good riddance, then.

473
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:56,343
Here you go. Don't ever say your friend
Willy don't come through in a pinch.

474
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:03,908
Here you go. Don't ever say your friend
Willy don't come through in a pinch.

475
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:21,215
Eligor, I name thee.

476
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,581
Bringer of war, poisoners...

477
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:30,790
pariahs, grand obscenity.

478
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:36,529
Eligor, wretched master of decay...

479
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:39,585
- bring your black medicine.
- Black medicine.

480
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,509
Come!

481
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:46,609
Restore your most impious, murderous child.

482
00:32:46,644 --> 00:32:49,026
Murderous child.

483
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:52,924
From the blood of the sire
she is risen,

484
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:57,452
from the blood of the sire
she shall rise again.

485
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,126
Right, then.

486
00:33:08,127 --> 00:33:10,541
Now we just let them
come to a simmering boil,

487
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:13,042
then remove to a low flame.

488
00:33:13,662 --> 00:33:17,253
Payday, pal. I got your slayer.

489
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:19,432
Are you tripping?

490
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:21,609
You bring her here... now?

491
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:24,728
- You said you wanted her!
- In the ground, pinhead!

492
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:26,754
- I wanted her dead!
- Now, that's not what I heard.

493
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:28,719
Word was there was a bounty on her,
dead or alive.

494
00:33:28,754 --> 00:33:31,984
- You heard wrong, Willy.
- Angel...

495
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:35,693
Yeah! It bugs me too, seeing 'em like that.

496
00:33:36,537 --> 00:33:41,225
Another five minutes, though,
and Angel will be dead, so... I forbear.

497
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,440
Don't feel too bad for Angel, though.
He's got something you don't have.

498
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:48,879
- What's that?
- Five minutes. Patrice!

499
00:33:57,113 --> 00:33:59,346
Who the hell is this?

500
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:02,279
- It's your lucky day, Spike.
- Two slayers.

501
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:04,287
No waiting.

502
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:33,865
Hey, Larva Boy!

503
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,515
Yeah, that's right.
I'm talkin' to you, you big cootie!

504
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:51,309
Welcome, my little pretties.

505
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:19,549
Switch!

506
00:35:24,212 --> 00:35:27,747
- I'd rather be fightin' you anyway.
- Mutual.

507
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:33,322
Die! Die, die, die!

508
00:35:33,357 --> 00:35:36,017
I... We did it, Cordy.

509
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:53,321
Where are you going?

510
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:56,695
Now, there's a way
in which this isn't my fault!

511
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,044
- Oh, they tricked you?
- Mm-hm. They were duplicitous.

512
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,167
Well, then I'll only kill you
just this once!

513
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:03,394
Spike!

514
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:12,318
Hold him steady!

515
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:27,871
That's me favourite shirt!
That's me only shirt!

516
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:40,518
Look out!

517
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:45,785
Sorry, baby. Gotta go.

518
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:50,034
I hope that was enough.

519
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:03,827
I'm good.

520
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,645
Hi.

521
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,696
- Let's get him out.
- Careful.

522
00:37:33,697 --> 00:37:35,875
Come on.

523
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,744
Oh, hey... animal cracker?

524
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:07,499
No, thank you.

525
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:11,343
- How's your arm?
- Suddenly painless.

526
00:38:11,378 --> 00:38:13,887
You can still play the guitar OK?

527
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:16,305
Well, not well, but not worse.

528
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,520
You know, I never really thanked you.

529
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,687
Ooh, no. Please don't.
I don't do thanks.

530
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:26,396
I get all red, have to bail.
It's not pretty.

531
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:29,591
Well then, forget... that thing.

532
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:34,537
Especially with... the part where
I kind of owe you my life.

533
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:36,999
Oh, look! Monkey!

534
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:39,974
And he has a little hat...
and little pants.

535
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:41,641
Yeah, I see.

536
00:38:41,676 --> 00:38:45,690
The monkey's the only cookie animal
that gets to wear clothes. You know that?

537
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:49,286
You have the sweetest smile
I've ever seen.

538
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:52,013
So, I'm wondering, do the other
cookie animals feel sorta ripped?

539
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:56,810
Like is the hippo going "Hey, man. Where
are my pants? I have my hippo dignity."

540
00:38:56,845 --> 00:39:00,168
And the monkey's just
"I mock you with my monkey pants!"

541
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:03,172
And then there's a big coup in the zoo.

542
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:06,076
- The monkey is French?
- All monkeys are French.

543
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:08,055
- You didn't know that?
- No.

544
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:18,304
We need to talk.

545
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,702
OK. Here's the deal.

546
00:39:25,354 --> 00:39:27,771
We don't have to run
every time we see each other in the hall.

547
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:31,973
Right. OK. Why shouldn't we run?

548
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:35,653
What happened...
There's a total explanation for it.

549
00:39:35,688 --> 00:39:37,933
- You're a pervert?
- Me?!

550
00:39:37,968 --> 00:39:39,987
- Yeah.
- No, no, no, no. I seem to recall

551
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:42,383
- I was the jumpee, my friend!
- As if!

552
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:44,669
You've probably been
planning this for months!

553
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:48,294
Right, I hired a Latvian bug man
to kill Buffy, so I could kiss you.

554
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:50,530
I hate to burst your bubble,
but you don't inspire me

555
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:53,881
to spring for a dinner
over at Bucky's Fondue Hut.

556
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:56,120
Fine. Whatever.

557
00:39:56,155 --> 00:39:58,675
You know, the point is:
don't try it again!

558
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,386
I didn't try it!

559
00:40:00,421 --> 00:40:02,577
Forget about the bugs, OK?

560
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:05,732
The memory of your lips on mine
makes my blood run cold.

561
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:08,587
- If you dare breathe a word...
- Like I want anyone to know!

562
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:10,384
- Then it's erased.
- Never happened.

563
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:11,889
- Good.
- Good.

564
00:40:11,924 --> 00:40:13,736
Good!

565
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:29,185
Tank you for de shirt.
It was very generous of you.

566
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,681
Hey, it looks better on...
well, me, but no worries.

567
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:34,601
Now, when you get to the airport...

568
00:40:34,636 --> 00:40:39,954
I get on de plane wit me ticket
and sit in a seat, not de cargo hold.

569
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:41,650
Very good.

570
00:40:41,685 --> 00:40:45,301
- Dat is not travelling undercover.
- Exactly.

571
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:47,541
Relax. You earned it.

572
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:50,290
Sit in your seat, you eat your peanuts,
you watch the movie...

573
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:53,336
Well, unless it's about
a dog or Chevy Chase.

574
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:55,120
I'll remember.

575
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:58,720
I, um...

576
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:03,273
I just... wanted to thank you
for helping me save Angel.

577
00:41:03,308 --> 00:41:05,372
I'm not telling me watcher about dat.

578
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:08,403
It is too strange
zat a slayer loves a vampire.

579
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:12,684
- Tell me about it.
- Still, he is pretty cute.

580
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,856
Well, maybe they won't fire me
for dating him.

581
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,555
- You always do dat.
- Do what?

582
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,324
You talk about slaying like it's a job.

583
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:26,532
It's not. It's who you are.

584
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,750
Did you get that from your handbook?

585
00:41:29,785 --> 00:41:32,170
From you.

586
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:36,317
I guess it's something
I really can't fight.

587
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,747
- I'm a freak.
- Not the only freak.

588
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:43,305
Not any more.

589
00:41:44,343 --> 00:41:47,063
- I don't hug.
- Right. No.

590
00:41:47,098 --> 00:41:50,034
Good. Hate... hugs.

591
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,579
Don't worry, dear heart.

592
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,360
I'll see that you get strong again.

593
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,439
Like me.

594
