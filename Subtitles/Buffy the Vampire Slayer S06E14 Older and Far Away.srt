00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,674
Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,190
You're never here. You can't
even stand to be around me.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,710
- That's not true.
- You didn't wanna come back.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,752
I know that. You wanna go away again.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,189
- I'm in.
- Ante up.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,235
You're gonna play cards?

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,352
I have been called,
and vengeance shall I wreak.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,471
- Hello.
- Halfrek?

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,352
Anyanka?

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,232
Hey! How are you?

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,874
You two know each other?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,437
Halfrek, I didn't summon you to kill Xander,
I called to invite you to our wedding.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,553
Tara. What are you doing here?

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,753
It's OK for you to be here if you
have things that you have to be here for.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,316
I'm doing better. No spells for 32 days.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,000
Buffy, I promise,
there's nothing wrong with you.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,998
There has to be. Why do I feel like this?

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,838
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,229
- Don't tell anyone, please.
- I won't.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,835
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,112
No, we're gonna sit down
and have a real dinner someday.

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,710
I hate running out in the middle.
It's just there's this thing out there.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,798
- Definitely non-vampire.
- I understand.

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,069
Well, maybe when you get back
we can set up for your party tomorrow.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,865
Yeah. This'll take a while, though.
I wouldn't wait up.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,036
Besides, Willow's on birthday patrol,

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,958
- so there's nothing left for us to do.
- Right.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,595
OK, so finish dinner, homework,
and don't stay up too late, all right?

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,870
- OK.
- OK.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,232
Run off, huh? Afraid to face a true warrior?

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,956
Ooh, shiny.

33
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,757
Do you think we should set up
candles for Buffy's party?

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,156
Not if they're that horrible slug kind
you keep trying to unload.

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,669
I don't know why people
get so turned off by slug.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,189
Honey, slugs get turned off by slug.

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,837
- Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.
- Slugs?

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,396
No, the party. Or, Tara at the party.

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,159
- Oh.
- It's just Buffy really wants her there.

40
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,272
It seems important to her,
so I told her I'd ask you.

41
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,916
Oh... Yeah, of course, she should
totally be there. It'll be great.

42
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,397
Hey.

43
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,671
Hey, Dawnie. Buffy out patrolling already?

44
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,478
So, anything new
about Warren and the nerd herd?

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,832
- No, just a big monster hunt.
- A nerd goes into hiding, he really hides.

46
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,157
Does anybody want to come
to the mall for birthday presents?

47
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,990
I would, but I've got my group. You know,
the whole Spellcasters Anonymous thing?

48
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,475
We're still looking for a better name.

49
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,876
Oh. Well, yeah, no, that's good.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,150
You should do that.

51
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,077
- So what about you guys?
- Stuck in doing-the-books-ville.

52
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,943
I'd love to go, but I gotta finish
this new shift schedule...

53
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:41,990
for the crew by tomorrow morning.

54
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,351
Sorry, it just looks like
one of those nights. You know?

55
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,836
- Yeah.
- You OK going on your own?

56
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,430
Yeah. Somehow I'll manage to pull it off.

57
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,035
Buffy?

58
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,231
If we can think of things Jim lost during
his years in Shanghai, and things he gained.

59
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,954
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Who wants to...?

60
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,716
Dawn?

61
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
They need you in the guidance office.

62
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,873
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,878
Just a follow-up after your...

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,835
your loss. Since I'm new, I thought it would
give us a chance to get to know each other.

65
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,188
Great.

66
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,599
I've been looking through your file,
and your grades have slipped a little.

67
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,790
I have really hard classes this quarter.

68
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,390
Still, teachers say that
you've seemed a little distracted lately.

69
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,239
I'm not. I'm fine.

70
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,477
OK. It's just, I know it must seem weird,

71
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,353
talking to a stranger about stuff, but...

72
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,109
I want you to know that if something's
going on, something's up, my job -

73
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,153
the most important part of my job -
is looking out for you.

74
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,871
I'm really OK.

75
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,914
I know there's been a lot of loss.

76
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,714
Yeah. Kinda.

77
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,115
I mean, yes. People keep...

78
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,919
People have a tendency to go away.

79
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,998
And I miss them. And sometimes...

80
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,794
I wish I could just make them stop.

81
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,314
Going away.

82
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,435
But, seriously, it's no big deal. I'm fine.

83
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,719
- We're feeding an army!
- No, they couldn't make it.

84
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,149
So, who's coming?
You invite anyone else?

85
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,999
Just you guys, Willow, Tara. The gang.

86
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,315
Oh, and Sophie from work.

87
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,514
What? Like I'm a loser who can't make
friends outside her tight little circle?

88
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,596
No. I'm friendly.

89
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,837
We bonded instantly.
Peas in a pod. Bonded peas.

90
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,310
Really?

91
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,396
What's Sophie's last name?

92
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,479
- OK, shut up.
- We're all over the new-friend thing.

93
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,591
What new-friend thing?

94
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,393
Well, we invited someone for you.

95
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,437
A guy.

96
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,269
- For Buffy? Really?
- Ah, don't worry, it's not a setup.

97
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,356
Right. No.

98
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,268
Just an attractive single man, with whom
we hope you find much in common.

99
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,551
If you happen to form a romantic
relationship leading to babies,

100
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,229
and many double dates with us
so we have someone else to talk to, yay!

101
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,716
I assume that this was an act of kindness?

102
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,752
That'll help with the not throttling.

103
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,589
Hey, I'm gonna get this stuff out there.
People should be here soon.

104
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,955
Hey! You made it!

105
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,799
Of course, sweetie.

106
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,718
- How're you doing?
- Oh, you know.

107
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,115
Better. Mostly.

108
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,034
Sometimes.

109
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,078
So, is Spike coming?

110
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,514
No. He may be a chip-head, but
he still doesn't play too well with others.

111
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,677
Besides, I'm definitely not ready to...

112
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,030
- Come out.
- Yeah.

113
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,390
I'm all stay-inny.

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,470
- How are you doing?
- The word "gulp" comes to mind.

115
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,909
Just remember, we're all here to...

116
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,714
I have to... with the thing that I...

117
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,308
Coming!

118
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,715
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,996
Hey.

120
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,429
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

121
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,836
I'm fine. How are you?

122
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,918
I'm great! I mean, fine.

123
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,398
I'm Finey McFine fine.

124
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,916
- You look...
- Thanks.

125
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,996
I mean, great.

126
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,031
Thanks.

127
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,993
- You do too. Is that a new...?
- Oh, yeah.

128
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,631
It's nice.

129
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,716
Thanks.

130
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,513
- I'm gonna get something to drink.
- Great. You should.

131
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,995
You really don't wanna get thirsty.

132
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,876
- Hey, how did it...?
- Yes, please.

133
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,113
- Spike.
- Yeah. Willow mentioned the shindig.

134
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,028
Figured we were all part of the team.
Thought I'd swing by.

135
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,994
- Wait. What kind of team is this?
- Hi. We met once before.

136
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,558
Yes. Yes, we did.

137
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,274
You know: more, merrier, that old thing.

138
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,198
- Hi, I'm Clement. Clem.
- Tara.

139
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,515
- Buffy, Richard.
- Hey.

140
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,954
He was wondering
where the best place was to park.

141
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,038
- Oh, that's easy, just...
- Buffy will show ya.

142
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,308
OK. Uh, I'll be right back.

143
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,840
- The guy with the...
- Skin condition.

144
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,394
He doesn't like to talk about it.

145
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,470
Stupid git!

146
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,273
I don't know. He seemed cute.

147
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,549
Was he cute? I mean,
I'm not a very good judge, but...

148
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,989
I think he seemed cute.

149
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,873
I think he seemed cute, yeah.

150
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,198
If we get Buffy, can she start opening the
presents? It's been enough time, hasn't it?

151
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,551
- Not yet, sweetie.
- I think Buffy's busy right now.

152
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,719
Buffy's making a new friend.
A grown-up friend.

153
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,877
What, you mean the guy
you invited to set her up with?

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,877
Nothing.

155
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,959
It's not like I don't understand why
you invited him. I was there, remember?

156
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,392
I can hear you when I'm in the room,
you know? I do understand these things.

157
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,954
Yes, you do!

158
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,436
- You know I'm in high school, right?
- Yes, you are.

159
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,629
- You wanna slip away for a minute, love?
- What?

160
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,231
- I'll let you blow out my candles.
- Here? Now? I don't think so.

161
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,239
You worried about Richard? You don't
wanna make your new boyfriend jealous?

162
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,318
Shut up. He's sweet.

163
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,635
"Shut up, he's sweet. "

164
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,949
Maybe he's not the jealous one.

165
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,993
You think he'll take you out
on his ten-speed, pet?

166
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,476
Maybe he'll let you ride
in that little basket up front.

167
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,556
Jealous, my ass.

168
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,633
It's a battery-operated back massager.

169
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,786
It's portable so you can take it on patrol.

170
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:49,594
Wow.

171
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,316
It's, like, instant gratification
for all your little acheys.

172
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,758
Great! Thanks! What's next?

173
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,030
Here, do mine.

174
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,796
Dawn...

175
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,510
- Do you like it?
- It's gorgeous.

176
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,519
I was so nervous.
I was afraid you wouldn't like it.

177
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,472
It still has the security tag on it.

178
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,434
Huh. That's so weird.
I can't believe they didn't take that off.

179
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,233
Happy birthday, Buffy!

180
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,792
Oh, my God!

181
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,436
- Did you guys make that?
- Yes.

182
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,597
Xander did the building.
I offered helpful suggestions

183
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,871
while observing from a safe distance.

184
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,834
Holds basic weapons,
plus a few non-basic ones too.

185
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,110
Plus, there's a handsome CD holder.

186
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,989
It's something no one else would have.

187
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,352
A Xander Harris original.
I love it. Thank you, guys!

188
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,914
Buffy?

189
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,875
Oh! Sophie! Welcome!
We're somewhere between presents and cake.

190
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,117
- There is gonna be cake eventually, right?
- Hey.

191
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,737
My mom told me to say thank you
right away, cos...

192
00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:15,234
otherwise I usually forget. So thank you.

193
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,070
And also I can't have any chocolate,
or peanuts or egg yolks.

194
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,272
- Is this the friend you brought from work?
- Yes.

195
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,755
- And sometimes dairy.
- No problem.

196
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,598
Our friend is better.

197
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,762
We can do official introductions
now everyone's officially here.

198
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:36,113
Dawn, do you mind getting the door?

199
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,674
Sophie, this is Anya,

200
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,756
and Willow...

201
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,349
Wish granted.

202
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,996
Hey. Great party.

203
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,554
- Everyone's having fun.
- I hope so.

204
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,673
I mean, look what time it is
and no one's even thinking about leaving.

205
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,791
I can't tear myself away.

206
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,512
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

207
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,790
Can I get you a drink?

208
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,554
- I'm good, thank you.
- OK.

209
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,996
I think I'll just head back in.

210
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,314
- Well, I'll look for you.
- OK.

211
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,473
Ooh, Buffy.

212
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,479
"Can I get you a soda pop?
I think I'm in love. "

213
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,994
Stop it. Someone's gonna see.

214
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,316
Mm-hm.

215
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,718
I had a muscle cramp.

216
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,229
Buffy was helping.

217
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,032
A muscle cramp?

218
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,469
In your pants?

219
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,909
What? It's a thing.

220
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,516
Right.

221
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,550
- No, you go.
- No, you go.

222
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,830
- No, you go.
- OK!

223
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,500
It's just a beer run. I'll go.

224
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:44,469
Oh, I can't drink beer, cos,
you know, barley.

225
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,273
- But I'll go with you to get some.
- Perfect.

226
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,755
Here we go. The beer-getting.

227
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,717
- This sucks. I'm out.
- No way. I think you're doing fine.

228
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,710
- You wanna try poker?
- Still say it's weird without the kittens.

229
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,796
No kittens.

230
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,033
He's quirky.

231
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,833
Look, we've already been playing for three
hours. It's two-something in the morning.

232
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,758
- You can't bail now.
- Yeah, come on, Buffy, stay.

233
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,643
I wanna bankrupt somebody.

234
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,919
Oh! We should totally have a slumber party.

235
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,235
Oh, I don't know...

236
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,000
I guess, as long as
everyone's staying up anyway.

237
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,237
Must be some late-night activities
to keep us busy.

238
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,590
How's that cramp, Spike?
Still bothering you?

239
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,154
What? Oh. Yeah.

240
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,272
Maybe you wanna put some ice on it.

241
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,950
Hey, Xander, we gotta be
at work in a few minutes.

242
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,308
OK.

243
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,151
I can't be late today.

244
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,590
You should go. Let's find your coat
and get you on your merry way.

245
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,994
Spike.

246
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,192
- I don't know why I'm not leaving.
- Me either.

247
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,756
Besides, Richard, you can't skip breakfast.
Growing boy like you.

248
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,582
Me, I used to love breakfast.

249
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,829
In the old days, I probably
would have eaten by now.

250
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,238
With that new diet of yours, you wanna be
careful what you put in your mouth, Spikey.

251
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,635
Yeah? I don't know.

252
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,955
Tummy's making all kinds of gurglies.

253
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,676
Maybe I ought to just feed on whatever's
around, even if it doesn't go down well.

254
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,473
- You, uh, work out?
- Okey-dokey.

255
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,070
'Scuse us.

256
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,710
Hey, Passive-Aggressive Guy,
you wanna take it down a notch or two?

257
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,354
What, poor dainty Richard can't take a joke?

258
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,233
We do not joke about
eating people in this house!

259
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,510
What are you gonna do, beat me up again?

260
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,111
I should have thrown you out. I was insane
to think you could hang out with my friends.

261
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,435
And I was insane to think...

262
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,116
No, wait. You were right. You're insane.

263
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,956
Oh, hi.

264
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,036
Hey.

265
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,549
Breakfast.
Didn't really plan for a sleepover.

266
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,876
No, me neither.

267
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,879
It's weird. I have class.
I know I should go...

268
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,913
I know, it's like I wanna leave,
but I don't want to.

269
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,996
Exactly.

270
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,430
- I think it's time for you to go.
- Yeah, well, can't. Daylight.

271
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,073
- OK. I'll go.
- I'll get the door.

272
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,189
- Fine!
- Fine!

273
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,437
- I'm actually trying to move right now.
- Me too.

274
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,718
Well, this can't be good.

275
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,153
- Something's keeping us in this house.
- Or someone.

276
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,316
Has everyone tried to get out?

277
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,355
What if we just, like, as a group,
got up and threw ourselves at the door?

278
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,869
All right. Count of three.

279
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,194
One, two,

280
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,629
three!

281
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,716
Here we go!

282
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,954
- Hence the problem.
- I really need to go.

283
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,992
- I mean, I have a job to get to.
- I have to open the Magic Box.

284
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,159
I have a shift at the Double Meat...
Actually, I'm OK here.

285
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,572
Yeah, I'm fine.

286
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:28,556
Willow and Tara have class,
I got to be at the site...

287
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,069
I know. We all have places
that we'd rather be.

288
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,475
Things we'd rather be doing.

289
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,478
I think the first priority
has to be to find a way out.

290
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,795
Sure. Of course you all wanna leave.

291
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,798
Cos being stuck in here with me
would really suck, right?

292
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,390
No, Dawnie. It's just we have
more important things to do.

293
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,476
Yeah, I know. Important.

294
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,955
Whatever that means, right?

295
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,752
- Dawn?
- What?

296
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,952
- Did you do something?
- Me?

297
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,789
- Do you know something? You can tell us.
- What would I know?

298
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,480
We're not accusing you of anything,
it's just...

299
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,910
you were kind of
taking it personal down there.

300
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,477
Oh. OK. So you've all just decided
that somehow I'm responsible.

301
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,909
Great. Here's me basking in the love.

302
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,079
No, it's just, you're upset cos we all
wanna leave. And now we can't leave.

303
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,398
Only thing missing is a cornfield.
There isn't a cornfield, is there?

304
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,273
Dawn, it's OK.
You know, we're not gonna be mad.

305
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,278
- Yeah, only I didn't do anything!
- You sure?

306
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,870
- Want me to ask my other self?
- We're just figuring out what's going on.

307
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,470
Figure it out yourself.
I'm done being talked to like a kid.

308
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,388
Well, sometimes we do something
that seems like a good idea at the time.

309
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,071
Like, say, invoke the power of a musical
amulet. And it turns out, not so much.

310
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,237
God! I didn't do anything!

311
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,272
I wish I had. I'm glad you're trapped.

312
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,194
How else can I get anybody
to spend any time with me?

313
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,709
Dawn, if you want us
to spend time with you...

314
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,195
I don't. Get out.

315
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,674
Get out, get out, get out!

316
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,471
- I think she's possessed.
- She's a teenager.

317
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,193
The phones are all out.
We're totally cut off.

318
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,910
- She's just so angry.
- It happens. We all went through it.

319
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,235
I know. I just can't figure out
why she didn't come to me.

320
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,239
Well, you have been a little busy lately.

321
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,478
I don't wanna stop the touchy-feelies, but
maybe the encounter group can meet later.

322
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,670
Say when we're not trapped in a house.

323
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,509
Even if Dawn does know something,
she's obviously not gonna help us.

324
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,235
- We need another way.
- I think magic's gonna be our best bet.

325
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,477
Something general, you know?
Cast a wide net.

326
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,511
But... Willow.

327
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,509
No, I'll do it. It's just...
Obviously I didn't bring any supplies.

328
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,872
Well, we don't have any in the house.
We got rid of everything.

329
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,958
Actually, not everything.

330
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,911
I might have

331
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,600
kept one or two things. Sort of.

332
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,476
Just in case.

333
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,316
That's great!

334
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,630
In a very bad way.

335
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,469
Just bring me what you have.

336
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,395
But then I'm doing this alone.
You need to stay away from it.

337
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,193
- So we're supposed to just wait?
- It won't take long.

338
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,108
All right, somebody wanna
tell me what's going on here?

339
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,109
I mean, we're trapped in a house by,
what, some unseen force or something.

340
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,515
Who knows what she's doing in there.

341
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,838
And I have to tell you,
I don't think that's a skin condition.

342
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,273
Release.

343
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,077
Try the door!

344
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,430
No. Can't.

345
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,478
- What the bloody hell was that?
- That's the demon I killed two nights ago.

346
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,352
Demon you thought you killed.

347
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,268
- It looks pretty bad.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

348
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,676
Let's get him upstairs.
We need to get him to a doctor soon.

349
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,476
Hey, it's gonna be OK. Just trust me,
I promise we'll be out of here soon.

350
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,910
Oh, God.

351
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,196
Oh, God.

352
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,357
OK, so maybe "soon"
was a bit of an overstatement.

353
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,110
So, you ever think about not celebrating
your birthday? Just to try it, I mean.

354
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,312
I'm gonna go check upstairs.
Keep an eye on things down here?

355
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,396
You stay here, OK?

356
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,110
What's that noise?

357
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,196
It's in the walls, isn't it?

358
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,273
Sorry.

359
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,832
Why is it so hot in here?

360
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,953
You're just a little freaked out,
that's all. It'll pass.

361
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,470
He's gonna die.
He's gonna die, and we're gonna watch.

362
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,079
An...

363
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,069
And we're just sitting here. Why are we just
sitting? Why aren't we doing something?

364
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,954
We are. We will. We've been through worse.

365
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,390
Not like this. Not trapped like animals.

366
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,153
Seriously, did someone turn on the heat?

367
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,430
I can't breathe, I just...

368
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,676
I just can't breathe...

369
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,472
An, stop.

370
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,909
Stop, An, stop. Stop. An!

371
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,510
Listen to me. You're just freaking out, OK?

372
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,394
It's normal. You're just scared.

373
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,993
We all are. We'll come up with a plan,

374
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,514
and we'll get through it, all right?
We'll do something.

375
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,790
What?

376
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,869
I don't know. Let me get you some water,
OK? It'll cool you down.

377
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,676
I'll be back in a second, OK?
Stay here, don't move.

378
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,628
Aaargh!

379
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,838
Xander?

380
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,318
Grab the sword!

381
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,710
Are you hurt?

382
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,559
- Here, let me see.
- Xander.

383
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,513
It's OK. I'm OK, see? Sh.

384
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,995
It's all right. I'm OK.

385
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,714
This is getting kinda scary. You OK?

386
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,830
Do you care?

387
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,034
Fine. Stay with Spike.

388
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,319
It's not like I meant for this to happen.

389
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,396
I never said that you did.

390
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,476
I didn't want this.

391
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,196
What did you want?

392
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,873
Nothing.

393
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,195
Dawn, come on.

394
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,278
No. You don't know.

395
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,473
You have this thing you do.
You have all these friends.

396
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,195
- You have no idea what it's like.
- What are you talking about?

397
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,278
- I don't know what what's...
- Being alone.

398
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,159
- You're not alone.
- Then why do I feel like this?

399
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,434
We haven't thought
of the right way out yet, that's all.

400
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,534
We can't stay put like cattle,

401
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:32,429
waiting for that thing to pop
out every time it gets peckish.

402
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,870
I'd say we do another spell,
but I think we've tried everything.

403
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,912
Well, that's not completely true, is it?

404
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,395
I mean, not everything.

405
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,310
Not exactly. We're sitting here
with an incredibly powerful witch.

406
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,032
Much more powerful than you, Tara. I'm
sorry, only no one seems willing to say it.

407
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,832
- I can't.
- No, see, that's not exactly true either.

408
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,916
Not "can't". "Won't".

409
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,833
You don't know how much I hate this.

410
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,838
I don't know if there's even
anything I could do.

411
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,317
Yes. And a good way to find out
is to sit around and try nothing.

412
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,396
- That was sarcasm, by the way.
- Look...

413
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,239
- It's dangerous.
- And so is all of us dying.

414
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,352
Will, look, I don't wanna gang up on you,

415
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,550
but Anya kinda has a point.

416
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,549
We brought you back from it once. It's one
little spell. We can bring you back again.

417
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,398
No. I can't.

418
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,229
If I start, I might not be able to stop.

419
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,672
Whose fault is that? If you hadn't gotten
so much of this in your system...

420
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,756
Hey! You're gonna back off!

421
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,158
She said no. That's it. You're not gonna
make her do something she doesn't want to.

422
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,475
And if you try,

423
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,275
you're gonna have to
go through me first. Understood?

424
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,394
Fine. If you all aren't willing to get
us out of this, then I will do it myself.

425
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,630
I wish you would have told me.

426
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,355
You haven't really been...

427
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,388
What? I haven't been what?

428
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,476
Around.

429
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,196
Dawn, the most important job
that I have is looking out for you.

430
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,912
You sound like my guidance counsellor.
She give you a handbook or something?

431
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,634
Talking to the Troubled Teen?

432
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,159
Counsellor?

433
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,068
Wasn't my idea. I didn't even know
we had guidance counsellors.

434
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,272
She called me out of class
like I was a total JD.

435
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,039
And you'd never met her before?

436
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,628
No, not until yesterday.

437
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,709
And she got you to start talking about
things that bothered you at home?

438
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,071
Yeah.

439
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,509
You didn't, by any chance,

440
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,995
happen to express,

441
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,476
like, a wish or something to her?

442
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,074
Maybe just a little.

443
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,719
Honey, come on,
this isn't the way. Calm down.

444
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,671
She knows something.

445
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,633
She knows something.
We have to find out what it is.

446
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,433
- Hey!
- An, just stop for a second.

447
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,518
- There's gotta be a clue in here somewhere.
- Stop it!

448
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,437
Anya, it wasn't her fault.

449
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,151
No!

450
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,831
Half this stuff is from the Magic Box.

451
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,510
How could you do this?

452
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,791
I work hard at that store, and I helped you.

453
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,356
I took care of you.
This is how you say thank you?

454
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,917
Anya, hold on, OK? Tell her
you didn't do this. Tell her it's a mistake.

455
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,516
No!

456
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,472
Buffy...

457
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,117
How are we supposed to trust you, Dawn?

458
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,358
I mean, you say you didn't put us here,
but look at this. How can we believe you?

459
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,836
Look, I don't think she...
I don't think it's all her fault, OK?

460
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,478
Someone pretending to be a guidance
counsellor made Dawn make a wish.

461
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,628
Guidance counsellor? You made a wish
to someone you've never seen before?

462
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,273
Yeah.

463
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,836
Did she wear a pendant
with a dark blue stone?

464
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,509
- And little red flecks.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

465
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,110
Halfrek! It's Halfrek, a vengeance demon.

466
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,437
- You made a wish to a vengeance demon.
- I didn't know.

467
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,314
Only a vengeance demon can break
her own spell. Nothing else will work.

468
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,672
She's the only one who can get us out
of here. Hallie, get your ass down here!

469
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,438
You rang?

470
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,235
I hope you die, you stupid jerkface!

471
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,475
Anya!

472
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,991
The sword!

473
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,988
Her pendant! Get her pendant!

474
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,035
There will be no touching of the pendant.

475
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,355
What? Did you think I'd be stopped
by a sword in the chest?

476
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,072
Flesh wound.

477
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,158
Honestly, Anyanka, you used to know better.

478
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,036
How could you? Why would you do this?

479
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,516
I told you I'd take care
of some business while I was in town.

480
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,598
Yeah, but cursing us?
Some of them are in the wedding party.

481
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,676
I just go where I'm...

482
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,629
William?

483
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,876
Hey, wait a minute.

484
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,355
You guys know each other?

485
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,114
Uh, no. No.

486
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,309
Not really.

487
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,512
I thought vengeance demons
only punished men who wronged women.

488
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,359
Oh, that was Anya's little raison d'être.

489
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,835
Most of us try to be
a little more well-rounded.

490
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,748
And actually,
we prefer "justice demon". OK? FYl.

491
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,429
Well-rounded? Is that how you
explain your thing for bad parents?

492
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,790
Oh, it's not a thing. The children need me.

493
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,319
Hm!

494
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,112
Daddy issues.

495
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,392
Sling all the little barbs at me
that you want, Anyanka.

496
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,036
It doesn't change the fact that this girl
was in pain, and none of you could hear it.

497
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,914
I could hear her crying out
everywhere I went in this town.

498
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,395
It was unbearable.

499
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,954
And none of you knew.

500
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,433
You people deserve to be cursed.

501
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,190
Enjoy your time together.
From now on, all you have is time.

502
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,356
Time, and each other.

503
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,354
Good luck.

504
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,555
Wait... Wait.

505
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,392
Time, and each other.

506
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,949
It's the curse, Hallie.

507
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,240
For crying out loud.

508
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,796
Fine, the curse is lifted!
We can all leave now!

509
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,876
Dammit.

510
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,394
Thanks. For before.

511
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,954
And for taking this stuff with you.

512
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,718
No problem.

513
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,196
Just so you know, I was never gonna use it.

514
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,076
I mean, not really. I...

515
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,237
I just kept it like a safety net.

516
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,358
Cos there was always
this thing in the back of my head.

517
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,552
This, you know, voice, saying, like

518
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,911
"What if things get bad?
I mean really bad?"

519
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,349
"And what if you can't handle it?"

520
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,110
And it made me panic,
so that's why I kept a couple of things.

521
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,715
I kept them so I didn't have
to think about it,

522
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,919
so I could focus on getting better.

523
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,432
I get it.

524
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,198
I really do.

525
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,039
But it's time to work without the net, Will.

526
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,313
You know, I don't know if you noticed,
but it actually did get bad in there.

527
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,638
Really bad, and you still said no.

528
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,238
- You have some weird friends.
- News from the file marked "duh".

529
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,750
- We're gonna get him to the ER.
- Then we're gonna talk about payment.

530
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,000
And, Dawnie, there are two words I want you
to get used to: "punitive damages".

531
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,111
Think it's worn off?

532
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,196
Just one thing to do.

533
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,798
- Who's pushing?
- Oh, look at the stars.

534
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,799
Good party.

535
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,276
I wanna run barefoot
so I can feel the dewdrops between my...

536
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,675
God, look at the stars!

537
