1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,340
In every generation there is a Chosen One,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,070
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness,

3
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:12,089
She is the Slayer,

4
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:18,982
A lot of educators tell students
"Think of your principal as your pal."

5
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:23,519
I say "Think of me as your judge,
jury and executioner."

6
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:29,787
Tell me, who do you think is the most
troublesome student in this school?

7
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,878
Well, it is quite a match between you two.

8
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:40,884
On the one hand, Buffy hasn't stabbed
a horticulture teacher with a trowel.

9
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:44,021
I didn't stab anyone with a trowel.

10
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:45,890
They were pruning shears.

11
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:50,511
On the other hand, Sheila has
never burnt down a school building.

12
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:54,178
Well, that was never proven. The fire
marshal said it could've been mice.

13
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:57,780
- Mice?
- Mice that were smoking?

14
00:00:57,815 --> 00:01:00,281
The two of you seem to be tied
in the class-cutting

15
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:03,512
and fight-starting events.
You really are neck and neck here.

16
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:06,787
- It's quite exciting.
- What does the winner get?

17
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:09,093
Expelled.

18
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,798
Thursday is parent-teacher night.

19
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,927
Your parents, assuming you have any...

20
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:20,546
will meet your teachers,
assuming you have any left.

21
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:25,313
I've decided to put the two of you
in charge of this event.

22
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:28,442
You have three days to prepare
the refreshments, make the banners...

23
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:34,074
and transform the school lounge
into a habitable place for adults.

24
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,806
This will incur my goodwill and may affect
what I tell your parents when I meet them.

25
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:42,835
- Are we clear?
- I'm clear.

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,661
Don't you feel clear?
We're very clear.

27
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:49,449
Good. Because you mess up this time

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,607
and your parents will be coming
to clean out your lockers.

29
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:56,473
Well, it shouldn't be that hard. We can
work on the banners at lunch tomorrow

30
00:01:56,474 --> 00:02:02,459
- and figure out refreshments then?
- Yeah, sure. Whatever. Hey, meat pie!

31
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:04,875
Snyder's got you, guys,
making party favors, huh?

32
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,243
His two worst students. That's what
my mom sees when she looks at me.

33
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:11,134
- A Sheila.
- Well, Sheila's definitely intense.

34
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:14,023
That guy with her? That's the guy
she can bring home to mother.

35
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:17,978
She was already smoking in fifth grade.
Once I was lookout for her.

36
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,481
- You're bad to the bone.
- I'm a rebel.

37
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:25,467
It's not fair. I'm a slayer. It requires
a certain amount of cutting and fighting.

38
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:28,549
- What's Sheila's excuse?
- Homework. She won't do it.

39
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:30,393
And most teachers respect that now.

40
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:33,188
Oh, you might wanna keep away any sharp
implements when you're working with her.

41
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:36,442
D'you think any other slayers
ever had to go to high school?

42
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:39,234
It's no biggy. You'll have a nice soiree.
Parents will love it.

43
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:42,181
As long as nothing bad happens
between now and then, you'll be fine.

44
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:45,393
Are you crazy? What did you say that for?
Now something bad is gonna happen!

45
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:48,221
- Whadaya mean? Nothing's gonna happen.
- Not until some dummy says

46
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:50,284
'as long as nothing bad happens.'

47
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,837
- It's the ultimate jinx.
- What were you thinking?

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,813
Or were you even thinking at all?

49
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:03,323
Well, you guys don't know.
Maybe this time it'll be different.

50
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,397
Home sweet home.

51
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,998
<b>"School Hard"</b>

52
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:35,986
The Master is dead.
Someone has to take his place.

53
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:40,468
As long as the Slayer's alive, whoever
takes his place will be sharing his grave.

54
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:44,321
Then let the soul who kills her
wear his mantle.

55
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,376
Can you do it?

56
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,580
Yes.

57
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:52,011
This weekend,
the Night of St Vigeous,

58
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:56,216
our power shall be at its peak.

59
00:04:56,251 --> 00:05:02,529
When I kill her, it'll be
the greatest event since the Crucifixion.

60
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,915
And I should know. I was there.

61
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,266
You were there?

62
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,735
Please!

63
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:16,805
If every vampire who said he was
at the Crucifixion was actually there,

64
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,489
it would have been like Woodstock.

65
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,854
I oughta rip your throat out.

66
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,766
I was actually at Woodstock.

67
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,038
That was a weird gig.

68
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:30,152
I fed off a flower person, and

69
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:34,277
I spent the next six hours
watchin' my hand move.

70
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,958
So, who do you kill for fun around here?

71
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:43,123
- Who are you?
- Spike.

72
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,502
You're that Anointed guy.

73
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:51,749
I've read about you.

74
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:57,380
You've got slayer problems.
That's a bad piece of luck.

75
00:05:57,415 --> 00:06:00,273
Do you know what I find
works real good with slayers?

76
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,095
Killing them.

77
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,823
- Can you?
- A lot faster than nancy boy there.

78
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,963
Yeah, I did a couple of slayers in my time.
I don't like to brag.

79
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:15,168
Who am I kidding? I love to brag.

80
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:19,585
There was this one slayer
during the Boxer Rebellion, and...

81
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,525
Drusilla.

82
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:31,864
You shouldn't be walking around.
You're weak.

83
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:35,051
Look at all the people.

84
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:38,746
- Are these nice people?
- We're gettin' along.

85
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,075
This one has power.

86
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,038
I could feel it from the outside.

87
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:49,519
Yeah. He's the big noise in these parts.
Anointed, and all that.

88
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:52,921
Do you like daisies?

89
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:55,620
I plant them but they always die.

90
00:06:56,302 --> 00:07:00,273
Everything I put in the ground
withers and dies.

91
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:05,934
Spike? I'm cold.

92
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:13,198
I got you.

93
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm a princess.

94
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,639
That's what you are.

95
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:34,479
Me and Dru, we're movin' in.

96
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:42,770
Now... Any of you want to test who's got
the biggest wrinklies round here...

97
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,318
step on up.

98
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:49,406
I'll do your slayer for you.

99
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:54,782
But you keep your flunkies from
tryin' anything behind my back. Deal?

100
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:00,444
I can't see her. The Slayer... I can't see.

101
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:04,356
It's dark where she is.

102
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,759
Kill her. Kill her, Spike.

103
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:11,847
- Kill her for me?
- It's done, baby.

104
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:14,423
Kill her for Princess?

105
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,094
I'll chop her into messes.

106
00:08:20,155 --> 00:08:23,184
You are my sweet.

107
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,376
My little Spike.

108
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:30,751
So, how about this slayer?

109
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,390
Is she tough?

110
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,575
What's wrong?

111
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,271
I spent a good part of my allowance
on this cream rinse,

112
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:41,055
and it's neither creamy nor rinsy.

113
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,023
Life is hard, dear.

114
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:45,519
Don't I know it.
Is that a split end?

115
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:47,847
- I got the mail.
- Good.

116
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:51,067
Which included a reminder notice
about Parent-Teacher night.

117
00:08:51,102 --> 00:08:53,244
- Thursday.
- Less good.

118
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,923
Which you were planning on
telling me about...?

119
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:59,203
Oh, for... the last two weeks.

120
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:03,777
Uh-huh. So, what do you think
your teachers are gonna tell me about you?

121
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:07,201
Well, I think they'll all agree that...

122
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:10,466
I always bring a pen to class,
ready to absorb their knowledge.

123
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:14,891
And, uh, this absorption rate. How is it
reflected in your homework and test scores?

124
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:17,959
What can you tell about
a person from a test score?

125
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:20,165
Whether or not she's ever
going out with her friends again.

126
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,965
Oh, that.

127
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:24,398
Well, I look forward
to meeting your principal.

128
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,018
Won't that be something.

129
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:32,092
Look, sweetheart.
Life is more than

130
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:36,307
grades, and homework,
and not getting kicked out of school.

131
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:38,133
- I know.
- But we moved once

132
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:41,448
because of you getting in trouble,
and I had to start a new business,

133
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:44,883
not to mention a new life,
in a whole new town.

134
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,387
And you don't want to do it again.

135
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:51,714
What I don't want is to be
disappointed in you again.

136
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:56,185
Mom, that's the last thing
that I want, too.

137
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,481
I'm trying, I really am. I just...

138
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:03,030
I have a lot of pressure on me right now.

139
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:05,760
Wait till you get a job.

140
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:07,995
Sleep tight.

141
00:10:19,301 --> 00:10:21,613
I have a job.

142
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,168
Sheila's a no-show?

143
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:30,297
She goes to this really rank bar,
the Fish Tank.

144
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:34,680
Sometimes they have raids,
and other stuff that could make you tardy.

145
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:37,313
Do you think you could help me
cram some French tonight?

146
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:40,309
I don't want Mr. DeJean
telling my mother I'm an imbecile.

147
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:42,008
I thought we were going
to the Bronze tonight.

148
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,938
'Cause of how you thought
Angel might show?

149
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:47,093
If he does, he'll meet some other
nice girl. Studying comes first.

150
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:49,170
We're going to the Bronze.

151
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:53,074
I can study, and party,
and do parent-teacher night,

152
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:55,563
and make my mother proud
as long as I don't have to

153
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:57,680
- Buffy!
- ...fight vampires.

154
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:01,465
There is nothing in the Chronicles
about an extraneous lunar cycle.

155
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:05,276
The Order never accurately calculated
the Mesopotamian calendar.

156
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,755
Rupert, you have got to read something
that was published after 1066.

157
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,517
- Very funny.
- What's the up, guys?

158
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:15,816
Ms Calendar has been researching, well, uh,
surfing on her computer a-and she's...

159
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:19,207
Well, according to her calculations,
this Saturday is the night of St. Vigeous.

160
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:21,710
Let me guess.
He didn't make balloon animals.

161
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:24,839
No, he led a crusade of... of vampires.

162
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:27,342
They swept through Edessa,
Haran, and points east.

163
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:29,169
And they didn't leave much behind.

164
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:31,268
Well, if I survive
parent-teacher night tomorrow,

165
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,126
I'll see what I can do about Saturday.

166
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,545
You're being a tad flip, don't you think?
This is serious.

167
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,501
And getting kicked out of school
is laughs aplenty?

168
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:44,196
You know what happens when you let
your life interfere with your slaying.

169
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,662
OK, well, if my slaying
doesn't get me expelled,

170
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:49,401
Then I promise my banner-making
won't get me killed, OK?

171
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:51,322
Just please let me get through this week.

172
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:53,929
This Saturday's going to need
a great deal of preparation.

173
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,680
- Well, we'll help.
- Yeah. I'll whittle stakes.

174
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:59,237
- A-and I can research stuff.
- And while I'm whittling...

175
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:01,372
I plan to whistle a jaunty tune.

176
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,162
Your help will be greatly appreciated.

177
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:06,430
But when it comes to battle,
Buffy must fight alone.

178
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:09,019
You are, after all, the Slay...

179
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:10,853
Slay-ve...

180
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:15,201
Slaves. You're all slaves
to the, uh... television.

181
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:16,888
- Yes.
- Young people nowadays.

182
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,655
- Shall we go?
- Mm, let's.

183
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,075
You wouldn't be helping Buffy
in Sheila's place, would you?

184
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,245
- No.
- We're hindering.

185
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,539
She ditched.

186
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:30,614
I feel an expulsion coming on.

187
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,633
No, no, actually, Sheila's
been helping us for hours.

188
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:37,805
Um, she just... went out
to get some more... paint.

189
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:45,179
Oh! Oh, is there no more teal
in the art room?

190
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:49,427
I know you wanted everything to be perfect,
but let's go with what we have.

191
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:55,233
Just make sure
everything is perfect on Thursday.

192
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:59,713
Thanks for covering.
The guy's a serious rodent.

193
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,373
No problem.

194
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:08,232
Did you really burn down
a school building one time?

195
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:11,962
Well... not actually one time.

196
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:13,764
Cool.

197
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,685
<i># A drink you can't resist</i>

198
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,895
<i># And in your head...</i>

199
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:23,546
La vâche doit me touche...

200
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:26,751
de la... jeudi,

201
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:31,172
- Was it wrong? Should I use the plural?
- No, but...

202
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:34,288
You said "The cow should
touch me from Thursday."

203
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:38,549
- Maybe that's what I was feeling.
- Then you said it wrong.

204
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,525
Oh, je stink.

205
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,394
You're just not focused.
It's Angel missage.

206
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:48,774
Well, he didn't say for sure. It was
a "Maybe see you there" kind of deal.

207
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:51,176
Guys, I'm all alone out there.
Somebody has to dance with me.

208
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:54,015
- Well, we are studying.
- Come on, one dance.

209
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,426
- You've been studying nearly 12 minutes.
- No wonder my brain's fried.

210
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:01,010
Come on.

211
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:03,728
<i><b>(# "Stupid Thing" by Nickel)</b></i>

212
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:14,170
<i># I-I-I... did a stupid thing last night</i>

213
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:17,467

214
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,595

218
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,890
Go get something to eat.

219
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,376
Where's the phone?
I need to call the police.

220
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:09,063
There's some big guy out there
trying to bite someone.

221
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:24,035
- Slayer.
- Slayee.

222
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,566
Get her out of here!

223
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:41,820
And a stake would be nice!

224
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,428
I don't need to wait for St Vigeous.

225
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:03,680
You're mine.

226
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:09,729
Spike! Give me a hand.

227
00:16:10,397 --> 00:16:11,982
Buffy!

228
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:25,228
Nice work, love.

229
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:29,774
- Who are you?
- You'll find out on Saturday.

230
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:32,299
What happens on Saturday?

231
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,982
I kill you.

232
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:50,572
All right. Which one's Dwayne
and which one's Dell? Don't tell me.

233
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,074
Dell's the one with the tattoos.

234
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:56,036
You guys weren't lyin'
about havin' a Cadillac, were you?

235
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:59,135
'Cause I'm crazy about a Cad.

236
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:02,562
Just the feel of the leather
makes me wanna...

237
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:06,716
Where'd you go?

238
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:11,310
What's going on?

239
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:17,581
Where are you guys?

240
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:22,027
Not funny.

241
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:27,570
- Who are you?
- Who do you want me to be?

242
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:30,421
- Did you see...
- Those two losers

243
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,923
who thought they were
good enough for you?

244
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:36,252
- What happened to 'em?
- They got sleepy.

245
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:39,553
- Huh?
- And you...

246
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:44,729
got something... a whole lot better.

247
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:48,656
Hey! Wait up.

248
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:51,745
What's your name?

249
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:57,754
Spike... That's what
the other vampire called him?

250
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,537
- That's a little unorthodox, isn't it?
- Maybe he's reform.

251
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:06,089
Perhaps he went by another name
in... times past.

252
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:09,117
Well, whoever he is, we'll need
all the help we can get come this Saturday.

253
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:11,821
So, this Night of St Vigeous deal.

254
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:14,707
If they're gonna attack in force,
aren't we thinking "vacation"?

255
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:18,278
We can't run. That would be wrong.
Could we hide?

256
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:21,929
I mean, if that Spike guy
is leading the attack...

257
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,689
Well, he can't be any worse
than any other creature you've faced.

258
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,947
He's worse.

259
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:32,329
Once he starts something, he doesn't stop
until everything in his path is dead.

260
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:35,100
Hm. So he's thorough, goal-oriented.

261
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:40,363
We were at the Bronze before.
Thought you said you might show.

262
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:43,791
You said you weren't sure
if you were goin'.

263
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:48,733
I was being cool. Come on. You've been
dating for what, like, 200 years?

264
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,970
You don't know what a girl means
when she says maybe she'll show?

265
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,139
Wow. Two centuries of dating.

266
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:59,991
If you only had two a year, that's still
like 400 dates with 400 different...

267
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,982
Why do they call it a mace?

268
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:05,637
Uh, we do have slightly more...
urgent matters to discuss.

269
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:08,766
Yeah, like keeping my mom away from
principal Snyder tomorrow night.

270
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:11,068
And not dying Saturday.

271
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:15,081
Angel, do you know if this Spike fellow
goes under any other name?

272
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:21,744
OK, that's it. I'm puttin' a collar
with a little bell on that guy.

273
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:26,613
St Vigeous,
you who murdered so many...

274
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:31,976
we beseech you,
cleanse us of our weaknesses:

275
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:35,711
mercy, compassion, pity...

276
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:40,994
Miss Edith speaks out of turn.

277
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:45,886
She's a bad example,
and will have no cakes today.

278
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:52,382
- Darling, are you going to eat something?
- I'm not hungry.

279
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,573
- I miss Prague.
- You nearly died in Prague.

280
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:58,827
Idiot mob.

281
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:01,430
This is the place for us.

282
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:03,933
The Hellmouth will restore you,

283
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:08,313
put color in your cheeks,
metaphorically speaking,

284
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:10,817
and in a few weeks' time...

285
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:13,987
The stars will align and smile down on us.

286
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,325
And then... God, this town will burn.

287
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,946
A pretty fire.

288
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:29,417
- They're preparing.
- St Vigeous is coming up.

289
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:31,466
Should be a party.

290
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:34,195
- You should go up with them and cleanse.
- Dru...

291
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,736
The boy doesn't trust you.
They follow him.

292
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:45,568
I think sometimes that
all my hair will fall out and I'll be bald.

293
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:47,637
Never happen.

294
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:51,066
All right, I'll go up
and get chanty with the fellas.

295
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:54,391
But you got to do me one favor.

296
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,730
Eat something.

297
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:06,555
You see, Miss Edith? If you'd been good,
you could watch with the rest.

298
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:31,966
"For three nights the unholy ones
scourge themselves into a fury,

299
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:36,238
culminating in a savage attack
on the Night of St Vigeous."

300
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:38,984
Does anybody remember when
Saturday night meant date night?

301
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,038
- You sure don't.
- Ooo. Parents start arriving in an hour.

302
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:45,004
OK. So, um, banners are in place,
the lounge is comfy...

303
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:47,610
- What am I forgetting?
- Punch?

304
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:50,639
- Punch! I need, I need punch!
- My fingers are cramping.

305
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:53,142
- How long have I been doing this?
- Three minutes.

306
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:56,270
So, can I go now?
She doesn't need this many stakes.

307
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:58,587
I mean, if this guy, Spike,
is as mean as you all said,

308
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:01,088
it should be over pretty quickly.

309
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:03,994
We're still all rooting for you
on Saturday. I'd be there for you myself

310
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:06,383
if I didn't have a leg wax.

311
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,554
You guys hold down the fort.
I'm punchbound.

312
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,560
No.

313
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:31,822
- What kind of punch did you make?
- Lemonade. I made it fresh.

314
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:34,726
How much sugar did you use?

315
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:36,921
Sugar?

316
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:40,921
It's very good.

317
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,574
OK. Now all I have to do is keep my mother
and Snyder from crossing paths

318
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:47,308
- for the rest of the night.
- Hi, Mrs. Summers.

319
00:22:47,343 --> 00:22:50,264
Hi, Willow. Hi, honey.
Did you, uh... do all this?

320
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,706
Yeah. Um... Here. Have some lemonade.

321
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,505
Right after Willow shows you the library.
I have to stay here and hostess.

322
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,985
Right, the library. Uh...
Oh, no. Giles and everyone...

323
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,782
Is locked in there studying.
Right. French class it is.

324
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:11,721
- Was that your mother?
- Here... Oh!

325
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:14,449
Oh, sorry! Um... Yeah, yeah.

326
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:17,504
I was gonna introduce you, but, um...
she wouldn't have said much.

327
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,882
You know, she doesn't speak
a word of English.

328
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:39,511
Giles has us locked up in that library
working on your weapons.

329
00:23:39,546 --> 00:23:42,557
Even slaves get minimum wage.

330
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,263
- What?
- You're starting to look a little slagged.

331
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:49,418
What, are you just
skipping foundation entirely now?

332
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:53,646
Cordelia, I have at least three lives
to contend with, none of which mesh.

333
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:58,493
It's kind of like oil, and water,
and a... third unmeshable thing.

334
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:01,646
Yeah. And I can see the oil.

335
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:06,188
Is that your mom? Now that is a woman
that knows how to moisturize.

336
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:08,691
Did it, like, skip a generation?

337
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:12,771
Well, I believe that I have seen
every classroom on campus.

338
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:17,234
And, just as I get there, all your teachers
miraculously have stepped out.

339
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:21,241
Oh. Oh, um...

340
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,208
But you haven't seen the boiler room yet.
And you know,

341
00:24:23,243 --> 00:24:27,547
that's really interesting, what with
the boiler being in the room and all.

342
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:30,468
Hi. I'm Joyce Summers.
I'm... Buffy's mother.

343
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:33,457
Principal Snyder.

344
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:37,637
I'm afraid we need to talk.
My office is down here.

345
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:46,831
- He didn't look very happy.
- But you did such a good job.

346
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:50,578
- When they're done talking...
- What?

347
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:53,267
My guess?
Tenth high-school reunion?

348
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:55,494
You'll still be grounded.

349
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:59,701
Cordelia. Have some lemonade.

350
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,410
Oh, there you are.

351
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:05,181
There who is?

352
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:07,763
Our new friend Spike.

353
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,446
He's known as William the Bloody.

354
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:13,894
Earned his nickname by torturing
his victims with railroad spikes.

355
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:15,798
Very pleasant.

356
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,076
Oh, here's some good news.
He's barely 200.

357
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:21,430
He's not even as old as Angel is.

358
00:25:21,465 --> 00:25:25,373
- Oh...
- That's a bad look, right?

359
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:32,775
I think your suggestion of running away
this Saturday might have been a good one.

360
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:37,400
Spike has fought two slayers
in the last century, and...

361
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,761
He's killed them both.

362
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:51,108
In the car - now.

363
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,605
What can I say?

364
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:28,459
I couldn't wait.

365
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:47,945
Nobody gets out, especially the girl!

366
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:51,140
Everybody this way. Come on! Come on!!

367
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,470
Hey!

368
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:09,054
- What the hell...?
- It's Spike and his army! Look out!

369
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:11,289
Get back!

370
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:15,633
In here! Now!

371
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:38,319
- We cut the power. Nobody got out.
- And the Slayer?

372
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,009
She either went that way...
or that way.

373
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:44,497
I saw two others.

374
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:47,107
You don't know?

375
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:55,441
I'm a veal kind of guy.
You're too old to eat.

376
00:27:58,064 --> 00:28:01,085
But not to kill.

377
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:03,414
I feel better.

378
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,448
They've cut the phones.

379
00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:10,043
Wait a minute.

380
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:12,570
There's an old boarded up-cellar
behind the stacks.

381
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:16,111
You can get out that way. Find Angel.
He knows about Spike. We need him.

382
00:28:16,146 --> 00:28:18,714
No, I'm not going anywhere until I know
that Buffy and Willow are alright.

383
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:22,053
No one will be all right
unless we get some help.

384
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,241
Who are those people?
What do they want?

385
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,977
I didn't get much of a look, but is there
something wrong with their faces? I...

386
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:31,638
Yes! PCP.

387
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:35,695
It's a gang on PCP.
We've got to get out of here.

388
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:37,638
You can't go outside. They'll kill you!

389
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:40,640
You don't tell me! I tell you.

390
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:43,569
They will kill everybody in this room.

391
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:47,396
Nobody goes out, nobody comes in
until I say so. Do you hear me?

392
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,173
Who do you think you are?

393
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:53,399
I'm the one that knows how to stop them.

394
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,977
Buffy, are you crazy?

395
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:57,360
Look, I know you've been
accused of fighting and other things,

396
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,962
but those guys are serious.
You can't go out there!

397
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:03,139
I know. That's why I'm going up there.

398
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:13,803
Don't worry, Mom.

399
00:29:13,883 --> 00:29:16,389
Slayer?

400
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,730
Here, kitty, kitty.

401
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,288
I find one of your friends first,
I'm gonna suck 'em dry.

402
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,438
And use their bones to bash your head in.

403
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:38,344
Are you getting a word picture here?

404
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:40,473
Oh God! Oh God!

405
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:43,601
Spike!

406
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,564
Listen.

407
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:58,091
Someone's in the ceiling...

408
00:29:59,913 --> 00:30:03,142
Hey! What are you doing? There are
at least three vampires in that hall!

409
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,270
God only knows
how many others in the building!

410
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:10,250
Listen! I am the Watcher! I am responsible
for her, and I have, I have to go!

411
00:30:10,285 --> 00:30:12,407
Rupert?

412
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:16,504
- Be careful.
- Push these back as soon as I...

413
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:22,864
Buffy! You're all right.

414
00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:26,138
How are the others?

415
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:28,183
Principal Snyder, my mother
and four others

416
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:30,610
are locked in the science room
across the hall.

417
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:35,058
Willow and Cordelia ran the other way.
I don't know if they're...

418
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:36,974
- Where's Xander?
- He got out through the stacks.

419
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,958
- He's getting Angel.
- Good. OK. I'm gonna take

420
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:41,939
the vamps out in the hall. After that
you get my mother and the others

421
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:44,572
- out the same way.
- Let me help you.

422
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:46,746
Giles, my mother's in that room.

423
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:49,515
If I don't make it out of here,
I know you'll make sure she does.

424
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:54,054
Bloody right I will.
Fair enough. What's your plan?

425
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:58,009
Well, they split up to hold us here,
so I'm gonna take 'em one on one.

426
00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:00,857
Set 'em up, and knock 'em down.

427
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:06,369
Watch your back.

428
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:13,354
- Why don't you sit down?
- This is my school.

429
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:16,757
What I say goes,
and I say this is not happening.

430
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:19,061
Well, then, I guess the danger's over.

431
00:31:19,062 --> 00:31:20,926
I'm not waiting for them
to open the doors.

432
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:22,794
- I'm gettin' out!
- Don't be an idiot!

433
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:27,020
I'm beginning to see a certain
mother-daughter resemblance.

434
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,581
- No! Look, you heard what Buffy said.
- She's a student. What does she know?

435
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:44,951
The, uh... door is solid.

436
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:47,586
Use your head.

437
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:58,899
You! Come with me.

438
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:05,650
I did it!

439
00:32:38,232 --> 00:32:42,543
You know a lot about this Spike guy
so, um... you got a plan?

440
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:43,989
Good plan.

441
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:48,077
- I think he's gone.
- He could come back.

442
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,365
What are we gonna do?

443
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,418
Pray?

444
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:21,860
Hey! Guard the door. I'm almost in.

445
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:35,964
- Buffy, are you OK?
- I'm fine, Mom.

446
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:38,651
Buffy, get out of here, OK?
We'll be all right.

447
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:42,494
Look, just hang on for one more minute
until I tell you to open the door.

448
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:52,881
Sheila! Where have you been?

449
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:56,410
Sorry I'm late.
There's some really weird guys outside.

450
00:33:56,445 --> 00:34:00,550
Sh! Yeah, I know.
They're trying to kill us.

451
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:05,902
This should be fun.

452
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:18,302
- Angelus!
- Spike.

453
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:21,082
I'll be damned!

454
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:29,111
I taught you to always
guard your perimeter.

455
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:31,154
You should have someone out there.

456
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:34,483
I did. I'm surrounded by idiots.

457
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:37,069
- What's new with you?
- Everything.

458
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:40,340
- Come up against this slayer yet?
- She's cute.

459
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:45,220
Not too bright, though.
Gave the puppy-dog, "I'm all tortured" act.

460
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:47,975
Keeps her off my back when I feed.

461
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:53,355
People still fall for that
Anne Rice routine? What a world!

462
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,825
I knew you were lyin'. Undead liar guy!

463
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:03,471
Wanna bite before we kill her? Hm?

464
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,318
Stay behind me.

465
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:28,982
Buffy, look out!

466
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:51,059
- Mom, now!
- Come on, let's go.

467
00:35:52,803 --> 00:35:54,769
- Get them out.
- You're coming too.

468
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,907
In a minute. Go!

469
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:58,327
Buffy!

470
00:35:58,961 --> 00:36:01,730
Haven't seen you
in the killing fields for an age.

471
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:05,218
- I'm not much for company.
- No, you never were.

472
00:36:05,253 --> 00:36:07,401
So, why are you so scared of this slayer?

473
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:08,988
- Scared?
- Yeah.

474
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:13,088
Time was you would have taken her out
in a heartbeat. Now look at you.

475
00:36:13,123 --> 00:36:17,734
I mean, this... tortured thing is an act,
right? You're not... housebroken?

476
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:20,036
I saw her kill the Master.

477
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:22,673
Hey, you think you can take her alone?

478
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,969
Be my guest. I'll just feed and run.

479
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:28,797
Don't be silly. We're old friends.

480
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:32,538
We'll do it together. Let's drink to it.

481
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,101
You think you can fool me?!

482
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:48,673
You were my sire, man!
You were my... Yoda!

483
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:53,203
- Things change.
- Not us! Not demons.

484
00:36:53,238 --> 00:36:56,746
Man, I can't believe this! You Uncle Tom!

485
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:02,899
Come on, people!
This isn't a spectator sport.

486
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,313
Fee, fi, fo, fum.

487
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:19,551
I smell the blood of a nice, ripe... girl.

488
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:26,251
- Do we really need weapons for this?
- I just like them.

489
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,519
They make me feel all manly.

490
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:41,470
The last slayer I killed...

491
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:44,743
She begged for her life.

492
00:37:45,935 --> 00:37:50,531
You don't strike me as the begging kind.

493
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:52,651
You shouldn't have come here.

494
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:56,581
No. I messed up your doilies and stuff.

495
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:59,452
But I just got so bored.

496
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:05,507
I'll tell you what.
As a personal favor from me to you,

497
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,319
I'll make it quick.
It won't hurt a bit.

498
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:11,912
No, Spike. It's gonna hurt a lot.

499
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:28,952
Come on, everyone. This way!

500
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:58,239
Now that hurt.

501
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:02,840
But not as much as this will.

502
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,729
You get the hell away from my daughter.

503
00:39:17,837 --> 00:39:19,996
Women!

504
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:30,604
Nobody lays a hand on my little girl.

505
00:39:36,086 --> 00:39:38,401
Take care of this.

506
00:39:43,168 --> 00:39:46,438
- Hello, Bob.
- It's over. They all got away.

507
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:50,674
I got a body inside, and I got
another one on the south lawn.

508
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:52,865
And it looks like he was pulled
right through the window.

509
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,444
I told him not to go through that window.

510
00:39:56,935 --> 00:40:00,578
Well, another wonderful fun-filled evening.

511
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:06,953
Yes... You know, um... I will understand
if you decide to start avoiding me.

512
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:15,045
So, when you gave him my neck to chew on,

513
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,256
why didn't you clock him
before he had a chance to clock you?

514
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:21,341
I told you I couldn't make the first move.
I had to see if he was buying it or not.

515
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:25,796
- And if he bit me? What then?
- We would have known he bought it.

516
00:40:26,347 --> 00:40:29,037
What's the deal with
you being Spike's sire?

517
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:30,899
What's a sire?

518
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:34,397
I need to say something
to the media people.

519
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:38,528
- So?
- So, do you want the usual story?

520
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:42,636
- Gang-related? PCP?
- What'd you have in mind? The truth?

521
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:45,328
Right...

522
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:48,689
Gang-related. PCP.

523
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:54,694
So... What did you
and Principal Snyder talk about, anyway?

524
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:58,010
Principal Snyder said
you were a troublemaker.

525
00:40:58,261 --> 00:41:02,886
And I could care less. I have
a daughter who can take care of herself.

526
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:08,254
Who's brave, and resourceful,
and thinks of others in a crisis.

527
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:12,779
No matter who you hang out with or what
dumb stuff you think you need to do,

528
00:41:12,814 --> 00:41:16,199
I'm gonna sleep better knowing all that.

529
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:21,239
But how long till this wears off
and you start ragging on me again?

530
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:23,714
Oh, at least a week and a half.

531
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:26,486
Very cool.

532
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,927
And if you get me out of this, I swear

533
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,068
I'll never be mean to anyone ever again.

534
00:41:36,103 --> 00:41:39,886
Unless they really deserve it.
Or if it's that time of the month.

535
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:44,267
In which case I don't think you
or anyone else can hold me responsible...

536
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,425
Ask for some aspirin.

537
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:49,924
And can you please send some asp... Hey!

538
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:03,132
- Spike, did she hurt you?
- It was close, baby, but...

539
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,967
Aw. Come here.

540
00:42:06,686 --> 00:42:11,727
A slayer with family and friends.
That sure as hell wasn't in the brochure.

541
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:15,872
You'll kill her. And then
we'll have a nice celebration.

542
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:21,523
- Yeah. A party.
- Yeah. With streamers, and songs.

543
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:26,259
- How's the Annoying One?
- He doesn't wanna play.

544
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:28,098
Figures.

545
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:32,413
Well, I suppose I'd better go make nice.

546
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:45,323
- You failed.
- I, um... I offer penance.

547
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,133
Penance? You should lay down your life!

548
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:50,876
Our numbers are depleted.

549
00:42:50,877 --> 00:42:54,184
The Feast of St Vigeous has been ruined
by your impatience!

550
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:56,606
I was rash.

551
00:42:56,948 --> 00:43:00,557
And if I had to do it all over again...

552
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:03,255
Who am I kidding?

553
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:06,835
I would do it exactly the same,

554
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,633
only I'd do this...

555
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:10,614
- No!
- ...first.

556
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,065
From now on,

557
00:43:25,107 --> 00:43:28,103
we're gonna have a little less ritual,

558
00:43:29,494 --> 00:43:33,537
and a little more fun around here.

559
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:46,744
Let's see what's on TV.

560
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:58,008
Subtitles extended and timed by UAR

561
00:44:37,118 --> 00:44:39,949
