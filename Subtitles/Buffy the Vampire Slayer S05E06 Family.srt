1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:03,931
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:05,241
Buffy, I love you.

3
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:09,684
We conjure the goddess Thespia
to help us locate demonic energy.

4
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:11,604
Are you sure we're ready for that?

5
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:17,249
Or not.

6
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,245
Tell me where the Key is.

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:24,849
The Key is energy. It's a portal.

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:28,892
- My brethren sent it to you.
- Dawn.

9
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:33,764
- She's not my sister?
- She doesn't know that.

10
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:37,488
Tell me a story.

11
00:00:37,573 --> 00:00:42,886
OK. Once upon a time, there was a kitty.

12
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:47,603
She was very little and she was all alone
and nobody wanted her.

13
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:51,447
- This is a very upsetting story.
- But it gets better.

14
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:54,969
Cos one day the kitty was running
around the street and a man came,

15
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:57,487
and swooped her up,

16
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:59,723
and took her to the pound.

17
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:05,012
At the pound there were lots of other kitties
and there were puppies and some ferrets...

18
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:07,129
Were there dolphins?

19
00:01:07,213 --> 00:01:09,852
Yes. Many dolphins at the pound.

20
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,969
Was there a camel?

21
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:16,170
There was the front of a camel. A half-camel.

22
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:19,325
Did the kitty get chosen
by some nice people?

23
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:22,531
Well, now you ruined the ending.

24
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:24,808
I'm sleepy.

25
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:28,363
Do you mind if I keep the light on?
I was gonna look up some spells.

26
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:32,082
It's fine. I don't need to be snuggled.

27
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,484
Vixen!

28
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:39,087
You've been Spell Gal night and day lately.

29
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:41,448
Well, I just wanna keep up with you and...

30
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:45,446
Well, I just like to be useful.
You know, to the gang?

31
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,004
I just... never feel useful.

32
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,842
You are. You're essential.

33
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:04,562
- Think Buffy found out anything tonight?
- At the factory? I don't know.

34
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:08,441
If there was something,
I figured she'd call us.

35
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:15,082
I don't know what to say.

36
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:18,527
Tell me about it.

37
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,162
She has no idea?

38
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:25,848
No. She thinks she's my kid sister.

39
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,124
Are you going to tell her?

40
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:34,204
How can I?

41
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:40,332
She'd freak and that's the last thing we need.

42
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:45,844
We have to keep her safe.

43
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:54,045
This woman, this whatever she was.
She knows you now.

44
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:57,889
Should we be thinking
about sending Dawn away?

45
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,203
Away where?

46
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:03,648
I don't know.

47
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,803
Your father's?

48
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:08,009
Yeah. He's...

49
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,607
in Spain, with his secretary.

50
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,724
Living the cliché.

51
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,731
I called him when Mom got sick.
He hasn't even...

52
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,804
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:28,407
When he bailed on us,
I remember Dawn cried for a week.

54
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:33,164
Except she didn't.

55
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:39,851
She wasn't there,
but I can still feel what it was like.

56
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:49,202
They sent her to me, Giles.

57
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:53,486
I think I have to take care of her.

58
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,842
I want to.

59
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:03,530
- Do we tell the others?
- No. No one.

60
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:10,727
They'd act weird around her,
and it's safer for everyone if they don't know.

61
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:14,164
Yes.

62
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:21,291
We have to find out who this woman is
and what she needs Dawn for.

63
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:27,085
- If she comes after you...
- She'll come.

64
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,044
She'll come for us.

65
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,730
OK. Now I'm upset.

67
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:47,164
- Thumb! Necessary opposable thumb!
- Sorry. Crybaby.

68
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:50,563
- You know what, guys? Just leave it here.
- Got it.

69
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,962
- I don't need help.
- Just be careful.

70
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:59,163
But we just helped her
move the stuff in a few days ago.

71
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,169
And it was fun!

72
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:06,246
People help each other out, Anya.
It's one of our strange customs.

73
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:10,884
Giles, you're doing the smallest amount
of helping that can actually be called helping.

74
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:13,931
Well, I saw myself
in more of a patriarchal sort of role.

75
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:16,766
You know. Lots of pointing and scowling.

76
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:20,241
- You two, stop that!
- He started it.

77
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,962
He called me a bad name.
I think it was bad. It might've been Latin.

78
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:28,285
- Stop it, or you're going to break something.
- Or I'm going to break something.

79
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:31,251
Can't believe you're giving up
this cherry corner suite.

80
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,608
Just a few days after we moved you in!

81
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:36,448
It's no big.

82
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:40,163
You know, with Mom not being well,
I'm hardly ever here.

83
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:43,404
Just figured I'd save a little cash
for this semester.

84
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:46,485
- I think that's smart.
- Still, it's hard to give up.

85
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,724
Two entrances. A lot of opportunity
for bawdy French farce.

86
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:52,611
- Everybody loves bawdy...
- Where's Dawn?

87
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:55,730
- I think she just walked out.
- Dawn!

88
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:59,567
- Some of your CDs are my CDs.
- I know. Come help me fold.

89
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,171
Feeling that fight?

90
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:12,529
Nothing like getting your ass kicked
to make your ass hurt.

91
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:15,525
- You'll take her next time.
- Cos you'll have backup, baby.

92
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:19,526
- She's messing with all of us.
- Yes. We'll find her weaknesses and then...

93
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:24,243
Yeah. You learn her source and
we'll introduce her to her insect reflection.

94
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:33,092
That was funny
if you studied Taglarin mythic rites.

95
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:36,927
- And are a complete dork.
- Then how come Xander didn't laugh?

96
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:39,004
I don't know that Taglarin stuff.

97
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,926
Hey. You wanna start
taking stuff down to the car?

98
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:44,083
- Yeah.
- OK.

99
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,686
Stupid.

100
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:49,849
OK. Guys, now remember,
you have to be at the Bronze by eight.

101
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:52,443
Bronze.

102
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,808
Tomorrow night! Tara's birthday!

103
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,123
Right! Right.

104
00:07:57,213 --> 00:08:00,285
We have to bring presents?
Birth is a present thing?

105
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:02,648
I got something picked out, yeah.

106
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:07,727
You guys can all still come, right? I mean,
I know there's this new evil and all, but...

107
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:12,887
No, no. We'll be there. I could definitely
use a break from all this craziness.

108
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:19,242
- What's the story?
- Another crazy. Got her family out there.

109
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,690
- A guess. No history of mental problems?
- Yeah. That makes, like, five this month.

110
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:26,731
They told me Sunnydale
was gonna be interesting.

111
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:30,044
- Aren't you off?
- Yeah, as of now. Have fun.

112
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:19,970
I need a favour.

113
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:24,889
Thank you for coming. We value your
patronage. Come again for more purchases!

114
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:29,012
Could we be a little less effusive, Anya?
Don't want to frighten the people.

115
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:31,971
I'm just so excited. They come in, I help them.

116
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:36,046
They give us money in exchange for goods.
You give me money for working for you.

117
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:41,446
I have a place in the world now.
I'm part of the system. I'm a working gal!

118
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:44,730
Yes. Why don't you start
organising the shipping orders?

119
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:47,566
No, that's boring.
I just wanna do the money parts.

120
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,851
Well, sure I forgot about the party.
There's kind of a lot going on.

121
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:56,211
And it's not, you know, the most
thrilling social event of the season.

122
00:09:56,293 --> 00:10:00,525
Yeah. It's a big deal for Willow, though.
I mean, you are gonna be there?

123
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,888
Yeah. Barring monsters.

124
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:04,406
- Hey.
- Hi.

125
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:07,087
Gimme sugar. I've come to buy sugar.

126
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:12,486
We value your patronage.

127
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:15,451
Any breakthroughs
on the identity of Miss Congeniality?

128
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,808
Well, I've narrowed it down some.

129
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:21,926
Your definition of narrow
is impressively wide.

130
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:26,450
Well, you didn't give me much to go on. She
looks human, so the mug shots are no use.

131
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:29,684
You can't be more specific
about what she's like?

132
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:33,486
She was kinda like Cordelia, actually.

133
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:38,522
- I'm pretty sure she dyes her hair.
- That one, of course. Our work is done.

134
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:42,401
- There must be something on her.
- The answer is somewhere here.

135
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:46,088
It's right in front of us
and we're too blind to see it!

136
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:50,249
I'm helping. I'm reading.

137
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,528
I'm quiet.

138
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,491
So, what'd you get her?

139
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:01,613
Tara. You said you got a present already.

140
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:04,651
Yeah, that was a tangled web of lies, sweetie.

141
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:07,122
I'm not really sure what kind of thing she'd...

142
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:10,762
- I mean, I don't really know her that well.
- I know.

143
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:14,812
- I mean, she's nice.
- Yeah! Yeah, nice. Nice.

144
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:20,449
- I just... I sort of...
- I don't necessarily get her, but she's nice.

145
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,170
- Yeah. There's just that thing.
- That thing.

146
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:28,609
- That thing of not understanding...
- Half of what she says?

147
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:32,402
- As for example. But she's super nice.
- You betcha.

148
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:36,765
Think there'll be a lot of Wiccas there?
Heavy Wiccan crowd?

149
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:41,603
That's sort of her deal. Her and Willow are all
Wiccie. Swinging with the Wiccan lifestyle.

150
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:43,809
- Which is cool.
- Oh, yeah.

151
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,807
I just hope we fit in, not awkward.

152
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:52,211
With Willow, it's like she's got
this whole new thing in her life.

153
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:54,568
But she's still Willow. I can figure her out.

154
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,611
But Tara, I know she likes Willow.
She already has one of those.

155
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,530
I have a present-buying headache.

156
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:04,411
Tara's birthday is
one too many things to worry about.

157
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:06,802
Relax. You should take a few minutes.

158
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,044
Train or stretch out.
Do something to work off the tension.

159
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:54,009
You want me, Slayer, come and get me.

160
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:56,482
Oh, I'm coming. I'm coming right now!

161
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,724
What are you thinking?

162
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,324
All about you, baby.

163
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:13,608
You're my little lamb.

164
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:19,163
- Come up with anything yet?
- Candles maybe, or bath oils of some kind.

165
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:23,246
I saw a really cute sweater at Bloomie's,
but I think I want me to have it.

166
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:28,123
- And you are talking about what on earth?
- Tara's birthday. We're at a loss.

167
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:32,092
You're in a magic shop
and you can't think what Tara would like.

168
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:36,090
I believe you're both profoundly stupid.

169
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:39,085
We don't really know
what kind of things witches like.

170
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:41,926
What, are we gonna get her
some cheesy crystal ball?

171
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:45,449
Bloody well better not.
I've got mine already wrapped.

172
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,568
Are all these magic books?

173
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:53,124
Private collection. Books for sale
are against the walls over there.

174
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:59,446
All these books got spells in 'em?
Turn people into frogs, things like that?

175
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,004
Yeah, we're building a race of frog people.
It's a good time.

176
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:10,085
So, are you all witches or...?

177
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,484
Hey, don't do a spell on me now.

178
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,523
Was there something in particular
you were looking for?

179
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:21,485
Her insect reflection. That is so good.

180
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:25,612
- That'd be funny, if her centre of power was...
- Well, what do you know?

181
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:32,085
What's the matter?
You don't have a hug for your big brother?

182
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,283
Brother?

183
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:48,164
Willow, this is Donny.

184
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,088
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

185
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:55,328
And these are my friends.

186
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,963
What, all of you hang out?

187
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:02,844
Wow. That's more people
than you met in high school.

188
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:06,005
How did you find...
I mean, how come you came?

189
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,284
Well, duh, birthday girl.

190
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:11,925
We came down in the camper,
been all over the campus.

191
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:13,844
"We"?

192
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:17,730
Look what I found!

193
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,603
Dad, hi.

194
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,722
Well, here's my girl.

195
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:32,565
- Such a surprise.
- Yes.

196
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:36,005
- Cousin Beth.
- Hey.

197
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:39,085
One of your dorm-mates
said I might find you here.

198
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:43,448
These are... these are friends.

199
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,967
This is Mr Giles. He runs the shop.

200
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:49,646
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

201
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:53,521
I don't mean to interrupt your plans.
I know we've come kind of suddenly,

202
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:57,049
- but I thought we could have dinner.
- OK.

203
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:02,002
Why don't I pick you up at six,
and we'll do some catching up?

204
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,843
Yes, sir.

205
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:08,608
Forgive me for running out.
We're double-parked.

206
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,448
Nice to meet you all.

207
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,361
That's so weird. Your whole family.

208
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:23,887
Yeah.

209
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,723
- They seem nice.
- You know. They're OK.

210
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:31,849
- Families are always...
- They make you crazy.

211
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,730
Usually.

212
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,684
- Wanna get into research mode?
- Sure.

213
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:46,649
- Honey, I'm home.
- Did you have a good day at work?

214
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,608
It's a rat race.

215
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:57,329
I squared away your stuff.
Wouldn't even know you left.

216
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:01,248
You're a god.
You're like the God of Boyfriends.

217
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:04,485
Nah, I just like it when you owe me favours.

218
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:09,044
Well, this earns you a big favour.
There could be outfits.

219
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,403
Be still, my heart.

220
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,201
- See ya later.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

221
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,365
- Where do you think you're going?
- To Melinda's for dinner.

222
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:21,683
- Since when?
- Now-ish.

223
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:26,324
- You can't. It's not safe for you to walk there.
- It's across the street.

224
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,883
- What's the big deal? I'm just gonna go...
- No.

225
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:34,842
It's family night.
And besides, Melinda's a bad influence.

226
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,369
I don't like you hanging out
with someone that... short.

227
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:42,924
I am so glad you're moving
back into the house.

228
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:45,083
This is the source of my gladness.

229
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,282
She makes me crazy.

230
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:55,086
That's kinda the word I was searching for.

231
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,209
What? She shouldn't be going over there.

232
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:03,242
A lot of young people are experimenting
with shortness. Gotta nip that in the bud.

233
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,450
She can't be running out whenever she'd like.

234
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,131
- It's more than that.
- What do you mean?

235
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,810
You tell me.

236
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,363
We all have to be careful.

237
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:21,763
This demon chick is exciting and new.

238
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:26,527
- I don't know what I'm up against.
- If we're in trouble, I can contact Graham.

239
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:31,004
- Maybe get the government boys on it.
- No! I don't want them anywhere near this.

240
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,084
Just a suggestion.

241
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:39,171
Look, the fewer people
that are involved, the safer I will feel.

242
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,325
Every time I think I'm getting closer to you...

243
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,729
- I gotta take off.
- Wait! What?

244
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:50,168
- I'll call you later.
- Riley.

245
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:53,647
I want you to help. I'm not...

246
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:57,806
Yeah. I know you got a lot on your mind.

247
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:02,921
If you decide you wanna let me in
on any of it, you let me know.

248
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:05,004
I'll come running.

249
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:23,452
The door wasn't locked. I was a little early.

250
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:31,084
I suppose you wanted me
to see all these... toys.

251
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,166
You don't even try to hide it any more.

252
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:40,166
I'd hoped maybe you'd gotten over
the whole witchcraft thing.

253
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:44,371
That if we let you go,
you'd get it out of your system.

254
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,568
Then they told me
to look for you in the... that store.

255
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:53,725
I didn't know that you were coming.

256
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:59,803
Of course we came.
We haven't heard from you in months.

257
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:03,090
Your birthday's getting closer.
You know what that means.

258
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:05,164
I don't think it's...

259
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:09,045
- It won't mean that...
- You're turning 20.

260
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:13,806
It's the same age
your mother was when she...

261
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:19,082
Do your friends even know?

262
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:21,209
Yes.

263
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:23,768
Are you lying to me?

264
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:28,925
You're coming home with us.
You know it's the only way.

265
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:30,446
Home?

266
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,922
You can't control what's going to happen.

267
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:35,846
You have evil inside of you
and it will come out.

268
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:39,528
Letting yourself work all this magic
is only going to make it worse.

269
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,081
Where do you think that power comes from?

270
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:47,452
It... doesn't feel evil, sir.

271
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,408
Evil never does.

272
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:56,282
I don't feel much like eating right now.

273
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:02,647
I'll give you some time,
but we need to be gone by morning.

274
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,686
Your family loves you, Tara, no matter what.

275
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:20,691
How do you think your friends are going
to feel when they see your true face?

276
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,048
Finally. I thought you were
gonna nap the whole day away.

277
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:35,602
Stop whining. I remember
when the Lei-Ach were a proud warrior race,

278
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:40,289
not sneaking around hospitals looking for
sickly types to suck the bone marrow from.

279
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:43,922
But... let's talk about
my problems for 30 seconds,

280
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:46,447
if that's perfectly all right with you.

281
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:51,766
Blonde. Short.

282
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:56,408
Strong for a human, and massively rude.

283
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:59,803
Broke my shoe, took my monk.
Any idea who I'm talking about?

284
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:08,446
A slayer? Oh, God, please don't tell me
I was fighting a vampire slayer!

285
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:11,411
How unbelievably common!

286
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:14,291
If I had friends and they heard about this...

287
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:18,526
And you know she's going around
telling everybody. She's probably just...

288
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:21,650
Pay attention! I am great and I am beautiful,

289
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:24,247
and when I walk into a room
all eyes turn to me,

290
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,564
because my name is a holy name
and you will listen!

291
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:33,330
Get your friends. Find the girl.

292
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:35,802
Kill the girl. OK, baby?

293
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:42,889
You have the cutest little suppurating sores!
Has anyone ever told you that?

294
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,007
- Hey.
- Hey.

295
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:57,368
Was dinner fun?

296
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:02,770
Well, there's Scoobyage afoot. Giles called
a meeting about our spanking new menace.

297
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:06,528
You should go. They don't need me for that.
You can fill me in.

298
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:08,888
No. No, you have to come.

299
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:11,851
This demon chick is
supposed to be really powerful

300
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:15,403
and I was thinking,
maybe we can try that spell.

301
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:18,530
- You know, the one to find demons?
- That didn't work.

302
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:22,891
Yeah, but we only tried it once
and I think I got some ingredients wrong.

303
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:25,692
Well, I'm tired. We can do it tomorrow?

304
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:30,690
- You sure you don't wanna...
- Look, my family's here, OK? I can'tjust...

305
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:33,765
Not everything is about
your friends and stuff.

306
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,648
Sorry.

307
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:40,167
No! No, I mean...

308
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:44,405
There's just so much going on.
I just... I'm really tired.

309
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:47,452
OK.

310
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:50,889
I'll see you in the morning. You can fill me in.

311
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:53,407
Great. We'll be demon hunters.

312
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:19,452
- Am I late? Did I miss any exposition?
- No, I've nothing earth-shattering to relate.

313
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:23,526
I've had a few thoughts and wanted to
make sure that we were on the same page.

314
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:25,649
- Can I buy one of these?
- No.

315
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,008
- With my own money?
- I let you come.

316
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,084
Now sit down and look studious.

317
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:34,249
Well, first of all,
I want to talk to you about safety.

318
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:37,521
- This creature could be...
- Will be.

319
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:40,764
Will be coming after Buffy
and possibly all of us...

320
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:45,244
Blind Cadria, desolate queen,
work my will upon them all.

321
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:49,163
Your curse upon them, my obeisance to you.

322
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:54,808
Now, I may have a lead
on this monk that Buffy spoke of.

323
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,646
There are a few orders that I've read up on...

324
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,286
- I'm sorry, where was I?
- The monk.

325
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:07,171
Yes. I'd like us all
to start looking at these orders.

326
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:11,007
It's possible the one this monk
belonged to was wiped out entirely...

327
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,401
You shouldn't be comin' in here.

328
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:23,563
You got a rep with these monsters.

329
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:27,286
But you come in here, night after night.

330
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:31,521
Were you lookin' to get killed?

331
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:34,363
I come for the ambience.

332
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,730
What can I say? The place just reeks of class.

333
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:43,682
- Yeah. Well, if Willy was here...
- Willy's not here. Hit me.

334
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:48,290
Drinking alone? It's not a good sign.

335
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:51,444
So they tell me.

336
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:58,207
I buy you a drink, neither one of us
has that problem any more. Now, do we?

337
00:25:58,293 --> 00:26:01,683
- Vodka tonic.
- Vodka tonic.

338
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:07,371
I'm Sandy.

339
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:10,047
Riley.

340
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:18,363
- This place is such a dive.
- No, no, it's great.

341
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:22,571
You just have to close your eyes.
Plug up your nostrils. It's fine.

342
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,484
We could go somewhere else.

343
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:31,527
Someplace more private.

344
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:37,010
Oh, Sandy, Sandy.

345
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:39,209
It's no good.

346
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:41,284
My heart belongs to another.

347
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:44,763
Besides, I don't go out with vampires.

348
00:26:47,413 --> 00:26:50,086
They're never interested in my intellect.

349
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:59,642
- Hi, baby!
- Hello, sweetbreads. Have fun?

350
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:02,122
It was so exciting. You wouldn't believe it.

351
00:27:02,213 --> 00:27:06,604
I went to April Fool's
and absolutely everything was on sale.

352
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,604
You paid for it?

353
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,161
Oh, no. I just killed the clerk.

354
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:13,244
Still, a bargain's a bargain.

355
00:27:13,813 --> 00:27:15,804
I ran into Carol Beets.

356
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:19,363
You know? She sired Brandon,
Brandon from the sewer gang?

357
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:24,322
And she said the Lei-Ach demon was
recruiting his brethren to kill the Slayer!

358
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:26,326
How's that?

359
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:30,850
Apparently, he got recruited by some big
nether-wig and now he's on a mission.

360
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:34,928
You think they might actually do it? Kill her?

361
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:37,322
God, that would be pleasant.

362
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:40,723
Well, if they do,
I think we should do something.

363
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:43,611
Like a gift basket or something.

364
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:47,410
- Where are you going?
- To get a decent seat.

365
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:50,451
If the Slayer's gonna die, I'm gonna watch.

366
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,605
- Tara.
- Beth, what are you...?

367
00:28:02,693 --> 00:28:07,164
- I was looking for you.
- I'm sorry we didn't get to have dinner.

368
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:10,962
I just wanted to see if everything was OK.

369
00:28:11,053 --> 00:28:15,331
See if you needed any help
with anything. Packing?

370
00:28:15,973 --> 00:28:20,091
Beth, I'm not coming back with you.

371
00:28:21,253 --> 00:28:23,926
- You're not?
- I don't think so.

372
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:27,486
- You selfish bitch.
- What?

373
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,565
You don't care a bitty bit
about your family, do you?

374
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:33,929
Your dad's been worried sick
about you every day since you left.

375
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:38,131
There's a house that needs taking care of.
Donny and your dad do for themselves,

376
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:42,570
while you're down here
living God knows what kind of lifestyle.

377
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:46,248
I can't wait till your little friends
find out the truth about you.

378
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,530
And they will, you know.
Doesn't matter how innocent you act.

379
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,649
- They'll see.
- No, they won't.

380
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:54,691
They will, unless you do
some kind of spell on them.

381
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,689
- You did!
- No!

382
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:02,606
You did something to them.
I'm telling your father.

383
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:04,684
No! No, it wasn't anything!

384
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:09,251
You think you can just go around
cursing people? Your dad's gonna pop.

385
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,767
It was just so they wouldn't see.

386
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:14,367
So they wouldn't see the demon part of me.

387
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:20,330
Please don't tell Dad. It's harmless.

388
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:46,804
I thought I heard something.

389
00:29:58,453 --> 00:30:00,887
Don't you see how out of control you are?

390
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:06,528
You've lied to these people for a year and
now you've put a spell on them. Is that right?

391
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:08,604
Is that a human thing to do?

392
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,524
Now, I'm telling your father.

393
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:14,207
If he doesn't force you
to come home, and he should,

394
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:17,205
I know he's going
to tell your friends the truth.

395
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:19,932
If I were you, I'd tell them first,

396
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:22,602
and then I'd tell them goodbye.

397
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,962
- Do I get paid overtime for this?
- Certainly not.

398
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:45,250
- Dawn, would you close the door?
- I didn't open it.

399
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:12,365
Giles! There's something in here!

400
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:33,488
Where'd it go?

401
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:37,290
Under there. Go.

402
00:32:02,973 --> 00:32:04,645
You'd be welcome.

403
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:08,687
Where'd it go?

404
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,372
It's over there!

405
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,927
- How many?
- I've been injured once this month!

406
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:22,004
Shut up!

407
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:29,850
Buffy, behind you!

408
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:46,803
- Tara, where is it? Can you see it?
- Oh, God.

409
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:54,004
Blind Cadria, lift your veil.
Give evil form and break my spell.

410
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,522
What in God's name is that?

411
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:27,286
Lei-Ach demon. Fun little buggers.

412
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:29,961
Big with the marrow-sucking.

413
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:34,450
- I don't understand.
- I'm not sure I do either.

414
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:38,650
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

415
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:43,126
I was trying to hide.

416
00:33:44,853 --> 00:33:47,651
I didn't want you to see what I am.

417
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:51,923
- Tara, what?
- What do you mean, what you are?

418
00:33:55,013 --> 00:34:01,452
Demon. The women in our family
have demon in them.

419
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:07,846
Her mother had it.
That's where the magic comes from.

420
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:12,727
We came to take her home before...

421
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:17,252
Well, before things like this
started happening.

422
00:34:19,413 --> 00:34:23,008
You cast a spell on us
to keep us from seeing your demon side.

423
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:25,687
That's why we couldn't see our attackers.

424
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:29,367
Nearly got us killed.

425
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:34,848
- I'll go. I'm very sorry.
- The camper's outside.

426
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:37,288
Wait! Go?

427
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:42,091
She just did a spell that went wrong.
It was just a mistake.

428
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:44,733
It's not the point and it's not your concern.

429
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:48,601
She belongs with us.
We know how to control her problem.

430
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:54,572
Tara, look at me.

431
00:34:56,933 --> 00:35:00,050
I trusted you more than anyone in my life.

432
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:05,329
- Was all thatjust a lie?
- No!

433
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:09,365
Do you wanna leave?

434
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:12,809
- It's not your decision, young lady.
- I know that!

435
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:17,163
Do you wanna leave?

436
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:23,126
You're going to do what's right, Tara.

437
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:27,365
Now, I'm taking you out of here
before somebody does get killed.

438
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:32,447
The girl belongs with her family.
I hope that's clear to the rest of you.

439
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:35,043
It is.

440
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:38,844
You want her, Mr Maclay?
You can go ahead and take her.

441
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:44,207
You just gotta go through me.

442
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:47,171
- What?
- You heard me.

443
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:50,291
You wanna take Tara
out of here against her will,

444
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:52,807
- you gotta come through me.
- And me!

445
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:59,244
Is this ajoke?

446
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:02,851
I'm not gonna be
threatened by two little girls.

447
00:36:03,573 --> 00:36:06,849
- You don't wanna mess with us.
- She's a hair-puller.

448
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:11,089
And you're notjust
dealing with two little girls.

449
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:14,049
- You're dealing with all of us.
- Except me.

450
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:16,283
- Except Spike.
- I don't care what happens.

451
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:21,401
This is insane. You people have
no right to interfere with Tara's affairs.

452
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,927
We are her blood kin!

453
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:27,249
Who the hell are you?

454
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,324
We're family.

455
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:38,003
Dad?

456
00:36:38,093 --> 00:36:40,323
You gonna let 'em just...?

457
00:36:42,853 --> 00:36:48,291
Tara, if you don't get in that car,
I swear by God I will beat you down.

458
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:53,128
And I swear by your full and manly beard,
you're gonna break something trying.

459
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:58,241
Well. I hope you'll all be happy
hanging out with a disgusting demon.

460
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:03,931
- Excuse me. What kind?
- What?

461
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:07,130
What kind of demon is she?
There's a lot of different kinds.

462
00:37:07,213 --> 00:37:12,685
Some are very, very evil, and some have been
considered to be useful members of society.

463
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:18,006
- Well, I... What does it matter?
- Evil is evil.

464
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:20,288
Well, let's just narrow it down.

465
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:25,408
Why don't I make this simple?

466
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,888
- He hit my nose!
- And it hurt... him, I mean!

467
00:37:36,693 --> 00:37:40,368
- And that only works on humans.
- There's no demon in there.

468
00:37:40,453 --> 00:37:45,288
It's just a family legend, am I right?
Just a bit of spin to keep the ladies in line?

469
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:48,806
You're a piece of work. I like you.

470
00:37:51,213 --> 00:37:54,205
- I'm not a demon.
- You're not a demon.

471
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,251
He hurt my nose.

472
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:59,210
Yeah? You're welcome.

473
00:38:01,973 --> 00:38:05,727
Mr Maclay, I would say
your business here is finished.

474
00:38:05,893 --> 00:38:11,525
Tara, for 18 years your family
has taken care of you and supported you.

475
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:14,882
- If you wanna turn your back...
- Dad.

476
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:20,284
Just go.

477
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:36,084
Magic.

478
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:43,044
Are you happy now?

479
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,404
Sorry I'm late.

480
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:38,882
- You came.
- Of course I came.

481
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:47,609
No, see, cos your insect reflection

482
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:51,572
represents your insignificance
in terms of the karmic cycle.

483
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:55,764
But it's still not funny.

484
00:39:57,173 --> 00:40:00,882
This place is so cool. Except I have
to wear this stupid stamp on my hand.

485
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:05,888
- That's to keep you from boozing it up.
- Oh, please. Only losers drink alcohol.

486
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,971
So what's an eagle reflection?

487
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:14,884
My dance?

488
00:40:30,613 --> 00:40:33,366
- Good birthday?
- Best birthday.

489
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:39,364
I still can't believe you didn't tell me
about your family and all that.

490
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:44,206
I was just afraid
if you saw the kind of people I came from,

491
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:47,126
you wouldn't wanna be anywhere near me.

492
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:49,852
See, that's where you're a dummy.

493
00:40:51,573 --> 00:40:54,610
I think about what you grew up with,

494
