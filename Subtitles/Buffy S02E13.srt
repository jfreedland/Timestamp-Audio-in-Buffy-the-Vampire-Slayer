<b>"Surprise" Part 1</b>

19
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,500
Hold on.

20
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,052
Hey.

21
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:23,823
- Is everything OK?
- That's what I was gonna ask you.

22
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,213
You're OK, right?

23
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:29,488
Sure... I'm fine.

24
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:32,065
What's up?

25
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:39,027
I had this... dream
that Drusilla was alive.

26
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:41,785
What happened?

27
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,226
She killed you. Right in front of me.

28
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:47,608
It was just a dream. It wasn't real.

29
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:50,461
- But it felt so real.
- It wasn't.

30
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,254
I'm right here.

31
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:57,023
Angel, this-this happened before.

32
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:59,461
The dreams I had about the Master.
They came true.

33
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:02,928
Still, not every dream you have
comes true.

34
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:05,588
I mean, what else
did you dream last night?

35
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:07,804
Can you remember?

36
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:11,885
I dreamt... I dreamt that Giles and I

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,952
opened an office-supply
warehouse in Vegas.

38
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:16,541
You see my point?

39
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:20,298
Yeah, I do, but...
what if Drusilla is alive?

40
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,864
- We never saw her body.
- She's not.

41
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:27,369
But even if she was, we'd deal.

42
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:29,776
But what if she's...

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,143
What if what?

44
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:45,295
I'm sorry. Were we talking?

45
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,803
I'm sorry. I, um...

46
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,097
- I-I have to go to school.
- I know.

47
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,605
God, you feel...

48
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:18,482
You have to go to school.

49
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:21,987
All right. I know.

50
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,364
This is me. I'm going.

51
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:45,700
You still haven't told me
what you wanted for your birthday.

52
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:49,969
- Surprise me.
- OK.

53
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:52,788
I will.

54
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:03,389
This is nice.

55
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:05,819
I like seeing you
first thing in the morning.

56
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,235
It's bedtime for me.

57
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,771
Well, then, I like
seeing you at bedtime. Um...

58
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:15,026
Um... Y-You know what I mean.

59
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,379
I think so.

60
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:20,154
What do you mean?

61
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:22,959
I like seeing you.

62
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:27,390
And the part at the end of the night
where we say goodbye?

63
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:30,952
It's getting harder.

64
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:35,774
Yeah... It is.

65
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:41,657
"I like you at bedtime"?
You actually said that?

66
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,412
- I know. I know.
- Man, that's like... I don't know.

67
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:49,422
- That's moxie or somethin'.
- Totally unplanned. It just... came out.

68
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:54,144
And he was into it?
He wants to see you at bedtime, too?

69
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:57,914
Yeah, I-I think he does.
I mean, he's cool about it.

70
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,268
Well, of course he is.
'Cause he's cool.

71
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:03,022
I mean, he would never, you know...

72
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:06,538
- Push.
- Right. He's not the type.

73
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:09,871
- Willow, what am I gonna do?
- What do you wanna do?

74
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:16,507
I don't know. I... I mean,
"want" isn't always the right thing to do.

75
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,907
To act on want can be wrong.

76
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:22,893
- True.
- But... to not act on want...

77
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:25,481
What if I never feel this way again?

78
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:28,678
Carpe diem! You told me that once.

79
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:31,421
- "Fish of the day"?
- Not "carp"!

80
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:33,949
Carpe - it means "seize the day".

81
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:35,961
Right.

82
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:39,597
I... I think we're going to.

83
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:41,562
Seize it.

84
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:45,680
Once you get to a certain point,
then seizing is sort of inevitable.

85
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,509
- Wow.
- Yeah.

86
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:51,622
Wow.

87
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,637
Wow!

88
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,012
- Wow.
- Yeah.

89
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,436
Hey, speaking of "wow" potential,
there's Oz over there.

90
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:03,520
What are we thinking?
Any sparkage?

91
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:06,829
He's nice... Hey, I like his hands.

92
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:10,528
Mm. A fixation on insignificant detail
is a definite crush sign.

93
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:14,350
Well, I don't know, though.
I mean, he is a senior.

94
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:16,605
You think he's too old
'cause he's a senior?

95
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,853
Please! My boyfriend
had a bicentennial.

96
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:22,642
That's true. Uh... I guess... I just...

97
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:24,877
You can't spend the rest of your life
waiting for Xander

98
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:28,332
to wake up and smell the hottie.
Make a move. Do the talking thing.

99
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,552
What if the talking thing becomes
the awkward silence thing?

100
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:36,101
Well, you won't know until you try.

101
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:50,138
- Hey.
- Hey!

102
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,102
- Do you guys, uh... have a gig tonight?
- Oh. No. Practice.

103
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:58,688
See, our band's kinda movin' towards
this new sound where...

104
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:01,277
we suck, so... practice.

105
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:04,189
- I think you guys sound good.
- Thanks.

106
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,638
I bet you have a lot of groupies.

107
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:12,463
It happens... I'm livin'
groupie-free nowadays. I'm clean.

108
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,731
Oh.

109
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:19,200
I'm gonna ask you
to go out with me tomorrow night.

110
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:23,106
And I'm kinda nervous about it, actually.
It's interesting.

111
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:27,326
Oh. Well, if it helps at all,
I'm gonna say yes.

112
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:30,363
Yeah, it helps.
It-It creates a comfort zone.

113
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:33,329
Do you wanna go out with me
tomorrow night?

114
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,604
Oh! I can't!

115
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:38,747
Well, see, I like
that you're unpredictable.

116
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:42,867
Oh, it's just it's Buffy's birthday,
and we're throwing her a surprise party.

117
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:46,610
- That's OK.
- But you could come. If you wanted.

118
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:49,502
- Well, I don't wanna crash.
- No, it's fine.

119
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:53,665
You could be... my date.

120
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:57,888
All right. I'm in.

121
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:06,031
I said "date"!

122
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:10,226
So, Buffy's party.

123
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,225
Mañana,

124
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:15,463
Well, just because she's
Miss Save-The-World and everything,

125
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:18,329
you have to make a big deal?
I have to cook! And everything!

126
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:20,929
- You're cooking?
- I'm chips-and-dips girl.

127
00:10:20,964 --> 00:10:23,784
Huh! Horrors!
All that opening and stirring.

128
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:26,084
- And shopping and carrying!
- Well, then you should have a person

129
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,681
who does such things for you.

130
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:30,935
Well, that's what I've been saying
to my father, but does he listen?

131
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:33,732
Um... So... Uh...

132
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:36,976
You're going, and...
and... and I'm going.

133
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:41,778
- Should... we maybe... go?
- Why?

134
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,735
I don't know. This... thing with us,
despite our better judgement,

135
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:47,077
keeps happening. Maybe we should
just admit we're dating.

136
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:50,647
Groping in a broom closet isn't dating.
You don't call it a date

137
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:53,303
- until the guy spends money.
- Fine. I'll spend, then we'll grope.

138
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:55,612
Whatever. I just think
it's some kind of whacked

139
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,443
that we feel we have to
hide it from all our friends.

140
00:10:57,478 --> 00:11:00,292
Well, of course you wanna tell everybody.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

141
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,679
I, on the other hand,
have everything to be ashamed of.

142
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,915
You know what? Enough said.
Forget it.

143
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,102
Must have been my
multiple-personality guy talking.

144
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:10,835
I call him "Idiot Jed",
glutton for punishment.

145
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:17,201
Oh, good morning.
Is everything in order for the party?

146
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:20,546
Absolutely. You ready to get down,
you funky party weasel?

147
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,849
Here comes Buffy. Now remember:
discretion is the better part of valor.

148
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:27,708
You could've just said "Sh". God!
Are all you Brits such drama queens?

149
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:31,390
Buffy! I feel a pre-birthday
spankin' comin' on.

150
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:33,698
I'd curb that impulse
if I were you, Xander.

151
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,716
Check. Cancel spanking.

152
00:11:35,886 --> 00:11:39,921
- You all right, Buffy? You seem fatigued.
- Rough night.

153
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:44,104
I had a dream that Drusilla was alive,
and she killed Angel.

154
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,863
It just really freaked me out.

155
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:49,520
- You fear it was more of a, a, a portent?
- See, I don't know.

156
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,582
I don't wanna start
a big freak-out over nothing.

157
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,490
Still, best to be uh... on the alert.

158
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:59,132
If Drusilla is alive, then it could be
a fairly cataclysmic state of affairs.

159
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:02,751
Again, so many words. Couldn't you
just say "we'd be in trouble"?

160
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,933
- Go to class, Xander.
- Gone.

161
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:11,375
Notice the economy of phrasing.
"Gone". It's simple. Direct.

162
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,023
- Maybe I should get gone, too.
- Don't worry unduly, Buffy.

163
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:16,901
I'm sure it's nothing.

164
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,730
I know. I should
keep my slayer cool, but...

165
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:23,087
It's Angel, which
automatically equals maxi-wig.

166
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,200
I have your package.

167
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:34,743
Just put it on the table,
near the other gifts.

168
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:41,217
Are you dead set on this, pet?

169
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:44,619
Wouldn't you rather
have your party in Vienna?

170
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:47,530
But the invitations are sent.

171
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:51,330
Yeah... But it's just
I've had it with this place.

172
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:53,417
Nothing ever comes off
like it's supposed to.

173
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:56,637
My gatherings are always perfect.

174
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:59,444
Remember Spain?

175
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,519
Hey? The bulls?

176
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:06,763
I remember, sweet.

177
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:12,792
But Sunnydale's cursed for us.
Angel and the Slayer see to that.

178
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:17,180
Shh! I've got good games for everyone.

179
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,899
You'll see.

180
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:31,308
These flowers... are wrong.

181
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:34,863
They're all... wrong.

182
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,613
I can't abide them!

183
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:42,679
Let's try something different
with the flowers, then.

184
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,639
Can I open one?

185
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:54,049
Can I?

186
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,969
Can I?

187
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:01,708
Just a peek, love.

188
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:05,273
They're for the party.

189
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,115
Do you like it, baby?

190
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,244
It reeks of death.

191
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:24,478
This will be the best party ever.

192
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:26,764
Why's that?

193
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,206
Because...

194
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:33,770
it will be the last.

195
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,313
Mall trip for your birthday
on Saturday. Don't forget.

196
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:46,992
Space on a Mom-sponsored
shopping opportunity? Not likely.

197
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,462
- So, does 17 feel any different than 16?
- It's funny you should ask that.

198
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:56,076
You know, I woke up feeling more
responsible, mature and level-headed.

199
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,897
Really? It's uncanny.

200
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:01,668
I now possess the qualities
one looks for in a...

201
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:04,072
- licensed driver.
- Buffy...

202
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:06,465
You said we'd talk about it again
when I was 17.

203
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:09,790
Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?

204
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:37,296
"Jenny Calendar."

205
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:42,745
- You startled me.
- You look well.

206
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:46,598
Yes, I'm fine.

207
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:52,405
I know I haven't written as much lately.
I've been busy.

208
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,192
I cannot imagine what is so important

209
00:15:55,526 --> 00:15:59,412
to make you ignore
the responsibility to your people.

210
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:04,086
- Well, I've been working. And...
- The elder woman has been reading signs.

211
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:07,832
- Something is different.
- Nothing has changed.

212
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:12,418
- The curse still holds.
- The elder woman is never wrong.

213
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:17,171
She says his pain is lessening.
She can feel it.

214
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,331
- There is...
- There is what?

215
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:24,085
- A girl.
- What?!

216
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,697
- How could you let this happen?
- I promise you,

217
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:29,177
Angel still suffers!

218
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:33,151
And he makes amends for his evil.
He even saved my life.

219
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:35,272
So you just forget

220
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:39,915
that he destroyed
the most beloved daughter of your tribe?

221
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:44,619
That he killed every man,
woman and child that touched her life?

222
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:50,985
Vengeance demands that
his pain be eternal, as ours is!

223
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:56,315
If this... this girl gives him one minute
of happiness, it is one minute too much!

224
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:59,125
- I'm sorry. I thought...
- You thought what?!

225
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,480
You thought you are Jenny Calendar now?

226
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:07,912
You are still Janna,
of the Kalderash people!

227
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:13,979
- A gypsy.
- I know... Uncle.

228
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:17,656
I know.

229
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:20,656
Then prove it.

230
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:23,755
Your time for watching is past.

231
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,987
The girl and him, it ends now!

232
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,159
Do what you must to take her from him.

233
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:35,718
I will see to it.

234
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:37,757
And then my mom broke the plate.

235
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,671
It was just like my dream.
Every gesture, every word.

236
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:42,528
It was so creepy.

237
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:46,102
Yes, well, I'd imagine
it would be fairly unnerving.

238
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,118
Hey! It's the woman of the hour.

239
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:51,162
It's happy birthday, Buffy!

240
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:53,749
Not happy birthday, Buffy?

241
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,935
I-it's just that, um, part of the nightmare

242
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,797
that Buffy had the other night
actually transpired.

243
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:01,258
Which means Drusilla might still be alive.

244
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:04,182
Giles, in my dream, I couldn't stop her.
She blindsided me.

245
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,905
Angel was gone before
I knew what happened.

246
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,323
Even if she is alive,
we can still protect Angel.

247
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:11,446
Dreams aren't prophecies, Buffy.

248
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:15,291
You dreamt that the Master had risen,
but you stopped it from happening.

249
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:20,690
- You ground his bones to make your bread.
- That's true. Except for the bread part.

250
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:23,200
OK, so, fine. We're one step ahead,
but I wanna stay that way.

251
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:28,423
Absolutely. Let me read up on Drusilla,
see if she has any particular patterns.

252
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:32,409
Why don't you meet me here at seven?
We'll map out a strategy.

253
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:35,893
- What am I supposed to do until then?
- Go to classes. Do your homework.

254
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:38,149
Have supper?

255
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:41,291
Right... Be that Buffy.

256
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,820
Well, that's not a perky birthday puppy.

257
00:18:46,978 --> 00:18:51,510
So much for our surprise party.
I bought little hats and everything.

258
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:55,959
Oh, well. I guess I'll tell Cordelia.

259
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:59,787
No, you won't.
We're having a party tonight.

260
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:03,024
Looks like Mr Caution Man,
but the sound he makes is funny.

261
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,037
Buffy's surprise party
will go ahead as we planned.

262
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:07,202
Except I won't be wearing a little hat.

263
00:19:07,237 --> 00:19:09,930
- But Buffy and Angel...
- May well be in danger.

264
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:13,059
As they have been before,
and I imagine will be again.

265
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:15,288
One thing I've learned
in my tenure here on the Hellmouth

266
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:17,149
is that there is no good time to relax.

267
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:20,336
But Buffy's turning 17 just this once,
and she deserves a party.

268
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,446
You're a great man of our time.

269
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:27,332
And anyway, Angel's coming, so she'll
be able to protect him and have cake.

270
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:29,237
Precisely.

271
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:38,123
- Buffy.
- Oh, my God! I didn't see you there.

272
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:42,911
Sorry. Um... Giles wanted me to tell you
that there's been a change of plans.

273
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:45,615
Uh, he wants to meet you
someplace near his house.

274
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,413
I guess he had to run home
to get a book or something.

275
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:51,950
'Cause heaven knows there aren't
enough books in the library.

276
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:55,905
- Uh... He's very thorough.
- Oh, which is not to bag.

277
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,505
It's kind of manly in an obsessive-
compulsive kind of way, don't you think?

278
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,360
Mm-hm. Um... You know, my car's here.
Why don't I drive you?

279
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:05,195
OK.

280
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,647
- Are we going to the Bronze?
- I'm not sure.

281
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:16,670
Giles gave me an address.
I'm just following his directions.

282
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:19,389
This looks funky. Stop for a sec.

283
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:24,707
- No, Buffy. Maybe you shouldn't.
- Sorry. Sacred duty, yadda-yadda-yadda.

284
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,118
What is this?

285
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:39,602
Every time I see you,
you're stealing something.

286
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:42,574
You really should speak with someone
about this klepto issue.

287
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:11,859
- Where is she?
- Shh! I think I hear her coming.

288
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,437
Surprise!

289
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:48,568
That pretty much sums it up.

290
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:53,949
- Buffy, are you OK?
- Yes, what happened?

291
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:57,510
Uh... There were these vamps outs...
What's going on?

292
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:01,249
Oh. Erm...

293
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,753
Surprise party.

294
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:06,005
Happy birthday.

295
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:10,260
You guys did all this for me?

296
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:13,840
- That is so sweet.
- Are you sure you're OK?

297
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,683
Yes, I'm fine.

298
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:17,610
Are you OK?

299
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,056
Yeah... Hey, did everybody
see that guy just turn to dust?

300
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,529
Uh... Well, uh... sort of.

301
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:30,025
Yep. Vampires are real.
A lot of 'em live in Sunnydale.

302
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:32,244
Willow will fill you in.

303
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:37,041
- I know it's hard to accept at first.
- Actually, it explains a lot.

304
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:41,547
Hey, somebody give me a hand here?

305
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:46,273
- Those creeps left this behind.
- What is it?

306
00:22:46,337 --> 00:22:50,355
I've no idea. C-Can it be opened?

307
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,894
Yeah. There's a secure release right here.

308
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:23,036
Well, clearly the Hellmouth's answer to

309
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:24,742
"What do you get the slayer
who has everything?"

310
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:29,359
- Good heavens. Buffy, are you all right?
- Man, that thing had major grip.

311
00:23:29,412 --> 00:23:32,860
- W-what was that?
- It looked like an arm.

312
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:36,196
It can't be. She wouldn't.

313
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:39,724
What, a vamp's version of snakes in a can,
or do you care to share?

314
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,207
- Angel?
- It's a legend, way before my time.

315
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:50,565
Of a demon brought forth
to rid the Earth of the plague of humanity.

316
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:54,881
To separate the righteous from the wicked,

317
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,490
and to burn the righteous down.

318
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:04,478
- They called him the Judge.
- The Judge? This is he?

319
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,369
- Not all of him.
- I'm still needing backstory here.

320
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,879
Erm... He... He couldn't be killed, yes?

321
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:18,299
Erm... An army was sent against him.

322
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:21,669
Most of them died. But finally

323
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,877
they were able to dismember him,
but... not kill him.

324
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:29,143
The pieces were scattered,
buried in every corner of the Earth.

325
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:31,561
So all these parts
are being brought here?

326
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:33,139
By Drusilla.

327
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:36,567
- The vamps outside were Spike's men.
- She's just crazy enough to do it.

328
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:40,718
- Do what? Reassemble the Judge?
- Bring forth Armageddon.

329
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,778
- Is anybody else gonna have cake?
- We need to get this out of town.

330
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:48,406
- Angel.
- What?

331
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:51,200
You have to do it. You're the only one
that can protect this thing.

332
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:52,846
- What about me?
- What?

333
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:54,616
You're just gonna skip town
for a few months?

334
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:56,299
- Months?
- She's right. I gotta get this

335
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:59,193
- to the remotest region possible.
- But that's not months.

336
00:24:59,228 --> 00:25:01,796
I can catch a cargo ship to Asia
and maybe a truck to Nepal...

337
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:04,725
You know, those newfangled flying machines
really are much safer than they used to be.

338
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,773
I can't fly. There's no sure way
to guard against the daylight.

339
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:13,371
I don't like this any more
than you do, Buffy.

340
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:15,552
But there's no other choice.

341
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,691
When?

342
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:21,159
Tonight.

343
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:23,806
As soon as possible.

344
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,973
But it's my birthday.

345
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,979
I'll drive you to the docks.

346
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:38,757
You lost it.

347
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,468
You lost my present.

348
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:44,305
I know. I'm sorry.

349
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:49,355
It's a bad turn, man.
She can't have her fun without the box.

350
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,190
The Slayer. She came out of nowhere.
I didn't even see her. She...

351
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:05,883
- Make a wish.
- What?

352
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,667
I'm going to blow out the candles.

353
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,838
You might give him a chance
to find your lost treasure.

354
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,985
He is a wanker, but he's
the only one we've got with half a brain.

355
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,264
If he fails, you can eat his eyes
out of the sockets for all I care.

356
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,323
I'll get it. Please.

357
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,606
I swear.

358
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:38,118
OK.

359
00:26:39,837 --> 00:26:42,324
Hurry back, then.

360
00:27:16,872 --> 00:27:20,024
I should go the rest of the way alone.

361
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:23,088
OK.

362
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,073
But I'll be back. I will.

363
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:29,850
When? Six months? A year?

364
00:27:30,638 --> 00:27:34,113
You don't know how long it's gonna take,
or... if we'll even...

365
00:27:34,393 --> 00:27:36,410
Hey...

366
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,668
If we'll even what?

367
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,631
Well, if you haven't noticed,
someone pretty much always wants us dead.

368
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:47,876
Don't say that. We'll be fine.

369
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:50,954
We don't know that.

370
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:56,189
We can't know, Buffy.
Nobody can. That's just the deal.

371
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:05,054
I have somethin' for you.
For your birthday.

372
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:09,035
I... was gonna give it
to you earlier, but...

373
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:14,899
It's beautiful.

374
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:20,545
My people... Before I was changed,
they exchanged this as a sign of devotion.

375
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:24,294
It's a Claddagh ring.

376
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:30,180
The hands represent friendship,
the crown represents loyalty.

377
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,264
And the heart...

378
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:36,299
Well, you know.

379
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:42,045
Wear it with the heart
pointing towards you.

380
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,103
It means you belong to somebody.

381
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,677
Like this.

382
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,998
Put it on.

383
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:19,017
- I don't wanna do this.
- Me either.

384
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:21,936
So don't go.

385
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:45,339
Buffy?

386
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:47,817
I...

387
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:13,914
Angel! The box!

388
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:24,693
You...

389
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:38,418
Buffy!

390
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:46,161
They should be back by now.

391
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:50,149
Maybe Buffy needed a few minutes
to pull herself together.

392
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:53,232
Poor Buffy. On her birthday and everything.

393
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:56,983
It's sad, granted. But let's look
at the upside for a moment.

394
00:30:57,018 --> 00:30:59,751
I mean, what kind of a future
would she've really had with him?

395
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:02,763
She's got two jobs -
Denny's waitress by day, Slayer by night.

396
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,356
And Angel's always in front of the TV
with a big blood belly.

397
00:31:05,357 --> 00:31:08,378
He's dreamin' of the glory days
when Buffy still thought

398
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:11,124
this whole creature-of-the-night routine
was a big turn-on.

399
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:13,134
You've thought way too much about this.

400
00:31:13,135 --> 00:31:15,297
No, no. That's just the beginning.
Have I told you the part

401
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,834
where I fly into town in my private jet
and take Buffy out for prime rib?

402
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,577
- Xander...
- And she cries?

403
00:31:22,522 --> 00:31:24,539
What happened?

404
00:31:24,664 --> 00:31:27,031
Dru's guys ambushed us.
They got the box.

405
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:30,377
- Where's Jenny?
- Uh, she took Angel to get clothing.

406
00:31:30,412 --> 00:31:33,698
- I-I had some here.
- And we needed clothes because...?

407
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:36,375
We got wet.

408
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:39,165
- Giles, what do we know?
- The more I study the Judge,

409
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,897
the less I like him. His touch can
literally burn the humanity out of you.

410
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:48,887
A true creature of evil can survive
the process. No human ever has.

411
00:31:48,922 --> 00:31:52,601
What's the problem? We send Cordy
to fight this guy, and we go for pizza.

412
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:55,769
Can this guy be stopped? Without an army?

413
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,266
Erm... "No weapon forged can kill him."
Not very encouraging.

414
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:03,669
If we could only stop them
from assembling him.

415
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:06,498
We need to find his weak spots, and we need
to figure out where they'd be keeping him.

416
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:09,449
- This could take time.
- Better do a round robin.

417
00:32:09,484 --> 00:32:11,226
- Xander, you go first.
- Good call.

418
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:13,802
- Round robin?
- It's when everybody calls

419
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:17,285
everybody else's mom and tells them
they're staying at everyone's house.

420
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,802
Thus freeing us up for world saveage.

421
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:22,171
And all-night keggers.

422
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,305
What, only Xander gets
to make dumb jokes?

423
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,311
Mom, hi... Xander... Yeah, uh...

424
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:32,268
Willow and I are gonna be studying
all night long, so I'm not gonna be...

425
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:39,862
I think I read this already.

426
00:32:39,897 --> 00:32:42,690
I can't get over
how cool Oz was about all this.

427
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:44,504
Gee, I'm over it.

428
00:32:44,568 --> 00:32:48,124
You're just jealous 'cause
you didn't have a date for the party.

429
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:50,719
No, I sure didn't.

430
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:54,453
Angel? Any luck?

431
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,802
It seems Buffy needed some rest.

432
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:09,423
Yeah. She hasn't been sleeping well.
Tossing and turning.

433
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:14,352
She told me! 'Cause of her dreams?

434
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,698
Now, now!

435
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:03,009
Hands off my presents,

436
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:05,032
No!

437
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:07,873
- Angel!
- Buffy, it's OK.

438
00:34:07,908 --> 00:34:10,109
I'm here. I'm right here.

439
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,218
More music!

440
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:22,218
<i><b>(# "Transylvanian Concubine" by Rasputina)</b></i>

He's perfect, my darling.

454
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,377
Just what I wanted.

455
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:31,769
Cor...

456
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:39,109
- You...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

457
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:45,118
- What's that, mate?
- You two stink... of humanity.

458
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:48,410
You share affection and... jealousy.

459
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:51,277
Yeah! What of it?

460
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,399
Do I have to remind you that
we're the ones who brought you here?

461
00:35:57,796 --> 00:36:00,660
Would you like a party favour?

462
00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:08,735
This one is full of feeling.
He reads. Bring him to me!

463
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:12,735
What's with the bringing?
I thought you could just... zap people.

464
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:18,202
My full strength will return in time.
Until then, I need contact.

465
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:22,023
No! No! No!

466
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:30,084
No! No!

467
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:39,416
Do it again! Do it again!

468
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:46,928
- Buffy, what's happening?
- She had another dream.

469
00:36:46,929 --> 00:36:48,841
I think I know
where Spike and Drusilla are.

470
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:51,652
That's very good.
However, you... you do need a plan.

471
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:54,033
I-I know you're concerned, Buffy,
but you can't just go off half-cocked.

472
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:57,219
I have a plan. Angel and I
go to the factory and do recon,

473
00:36:57,254 --> 00:36:59,203
figure out how far they've gotten
assembling the Judge.

474
00:36:59,238 --> 00:37:01,700
You, guys, check any places
the boxes could be coming into town -

475
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:04,082
shipping yards, airports, anything.

476
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:06,635
We need to stop them
from getting all the boxes in one place.

477
00:37:07,253 --> 00:37:10,514
Yes... Yes, well,
actually that's quite a good plan.

478
00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:14,653
This thing is nasty and it's real, Giles.
We can't wait for it to come get us.

479
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:16,597
Right.

480
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:47,425
I saw this. The party.

481
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:01,314
What? What is it?

482
00:38:08,116 --> 00:38:10,161
We gotta get outta here.

483
00:38:12,397 --> 00:38:15,922
Well, well. Look what we have here.

484
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,090
Crashers.

485
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:20,487
I'm sure our invitations
just got lost in the mail.

486
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:25,002
It's delicious.
I only dreamed you'd come.

487
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,895
- Leave her alone!
- Yeah, that'll work.

488
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:30,837
Now say "pretty please".

489
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,676
- The girl?
- Chilling, isn't it?

490
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,138
She's so full of good intention.

491
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:38,769
- Take me. Take me instead of her.
- No!

492
00:38:38,804 --> 00:38:42,520
Uh, you're not clear on the concept, pal.
There is no "instead".

493
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:46,548
- Just first and second.
- And if you go first,

494
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,442
you don't get to watch the Slayer die.

495
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,514
Don't touch him!

496
00:39:12,993 --> 00:39:14,653
This way!

497
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:23,364
Go!

498
00:39:56,203 --> 00:39:58,801
Come on. We need to get inside.

499
00:40:13,723 --> 00:40:17,012
- You're shaking like a leaf.
- I'm cold.

500
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,419
Let me get you somethin'.

501
00:40:25,612 --> 00:40:29,684
Put these on.
Get under the covers just to warm up.

502
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,935
Sorry.

503
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,261
What?

504
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:50,813
Oh, um...

505
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:53,804
It's OK.
I just have a cut or something.

506
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,956
Can I...

507
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:59,423
Let me see.

508
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:02,489
OK.

509
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:23,819
It's already closed. You're fine.

510
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:41,427
You almost went away today.

511
00:41:41,462 --> 00:41:44,123
We both did.

512
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,727
Angel...

513
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,927
I feel like I lost you.

514
00:41:57,596 --> 00:42:00,278
You're right, though.

515
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,522
- We can't be sure of anything...
- Shhh.

516
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,320
I...

517
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:24,335
You what?

518
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:29,842
I love you.

519
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:32,719
I try not to, but I can't stop.

520
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:35,118
Me... Me too.

521
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:38,471
I can't either.

522
00:42:52,661 --> 00:42:54,789
- Buffy, maybe we shouldn't...
- Don't.

523
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:58,708
Just kiss me.

524
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:30,023
Ah! Buffy!

525
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:36,420
Buffy!

526
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:42,685
