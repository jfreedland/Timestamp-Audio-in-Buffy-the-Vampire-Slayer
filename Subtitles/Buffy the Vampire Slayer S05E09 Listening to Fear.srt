00:00:03,653 --> 00:00:06,326
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:18,049
This dark spell I hold in my worthless
hand is our gift to you, Glorificus.

3
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:19,851
Please, call me Glory.

4
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:24,245
- What if she's something else altogether?
- Something new, you mean?

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,291
Something old.
So old it predates the written word.

6
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:30,410
Lady, whatever you are, please...
I have two daughters.

7
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,648
The Key is energy.

8
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:45,088
- My brethren sent it to you.
- Dawn.

9
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:48,688
- She has no idea?
- No.

10
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:51,529
She thinks she's my kid sister.

11
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:54,252
I have to take care of her.

12
00:00:57,053 --> 00:00:59,726
Your mother has low-grade glioma.

13
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:01,804
It's a brain tumour.

14
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,291
Listen, you two, I know
this creamed spinach is delicious,

15
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:10,809
but I won't be offended
if you go out for some real food.

16
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:13,043
You kidding me? This is the good life.

17
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:16,330
Relaxing in bed
while people bring you food on trays.

18
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:19,564
- I like the Jell-O.
- Help yourself.

19
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:23,168
Food that moves by itself
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

20
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:28,281
It's good and wiggly. A girl at school told me
gelatin is made from ground-up cow's feet,

21
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:31,570
and if you eat Jell-O
some cow out there is limping with no feet.

22
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:35,885
But I told her I'm sure they kill 'em
before they take off their feet.

23
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,372
Right?

24
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:41,210
You're the one who insisted on
teaching her to talk.

25
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:45,763
Oh, hello, Dr Kriegel.
You know my girls, Buffy and Dawn.

26
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:49,368
Yes. You two are becoming
part of the regular crew around here.

27
00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:51,444
- Just keeping her company.
- Good.

28
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:55,526
- Just be careful you don't wear her out.
- Oh, don't worry about that.

29
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:59,606
I woke up exhausted.
There's really no more exhausted to get.

30
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:02,888
Well, maybe some good news'll help.

31
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:05,771
The blood work's back from the lab.
Everything's fine.

32
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:11,325
So we've scheduled your surgery for the
day after tomorrow at ten in the morning.

33
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,051
How's that sound to you?

34
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,365
I think they had me scheduled for volleyball,
but I can work around it.

35
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,683
All right then. Joyce, you take care.

36
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:23,322
Make sure and get some good solid rest.
And I mean that.

37
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:30,889
The day after tomorrow. I can't stand
to stay here another two days just waiting.

38
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:34,852
Waiting? Give me a break, we got tons to do.

39
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,369
We have soap operas to watch
and trashy magazines to read.

40
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:42,492
And an adjustable bed to fiddle with.
That alone will keep me busy for four hours.

41
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:46,202
I really don't need you to stay here.
I know you've got patrolling to do.

42
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:49,603
Not tonight. Tonight I have
"Mom taking care of" to do.

43
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:53,527
Riley's filling in with the others.
I'm sure they have it all under control.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,074

45
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:37,483
- Human chest! Human chest!
- Sorry!

46
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:47,931
My God. What a rough night.

47
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:52,529
I dusted two of 'em! Yay on me!
That was pretty cool.

48
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:57,050
Except the part where I was all terrified
and now my knees are all dizzy.

49
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,081
Not so much a big success night for me.

50
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,403
But I should get points just for showing up.

51
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,327
Unlike some Riley Finn
who shall remain unnamed.

52
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,803
That was disappointing.
Things would have been easier if he'd come.

53
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:14,010
Piffle! Who needs him
when I'm dusting two at a ti...

54
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:17,483
Whoops. Maybe it would've
been good if he had showed up.

55
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,564
Perhaps he forgot.

56
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:51,609
Care package!
Special delivery for the Summers girls.

57
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,481
Let's see what I have in this sack of mine.

58
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:58,361
I feel just like Santa Claus,
except thinner and younger and female

59
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,648
and, well, Jewish.

60
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:04,931
This is an extra-special gift for your mom
that I know she'll need.

61
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:11,410
A beer hat! See? It's got cup holders and
a straw that goes directly into your mouth.

62
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,609
You can fill it with other stuff than beer.

63
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:17,447
And somehow, when I was in the store,
this seemed the most important idea,

64
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,888
and now there's
the whole part where I'm crazy.

65
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:23,727
It's perfect. Thank you, Willow.
You're very sweet.

66
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:28,051
Let's see who's next. Dawn, I believe
I have something in here for you.

67
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:31,523
- Headache?
- Just a little one.

68
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:33,968
Biggish little one.

69
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:39,005
I'm fine! Go on, what else
is in that sack of goodies, Willow?

70
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:43,323
All right. Dawn, to keep you busy.

71
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:45,608
Ooh, spells! Thank you, Willow!

72
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,851
You got her a book on spells. The girl who
can break things by just looking at them

73
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:54,243
now has a book to teach her
to break things by looking at 'em?

74
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:59,407
It doesn't actually have spells in it.
Just history and anecdotes, stuff like that.

75
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:02,724
Oh, Buffy, I have this for you.

76
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:08,445
Homework? I don't believe
in tiny Jewish Santa any more.

77
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:12,005
- And a yo-yo.
- Thank you.

78
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:16,325
The book is just in case you get a chance
to look it over. We're doing World War I now.

79
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:20,611
The last exam was really pretty easy,
just underlying causes and trench foot.

80
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:24,208
- Should be no hassle to make it up.
- I don't know if I'll take that exam.

81
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,807
I'd rip it in half and stick it in bed with me!

82
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:31,850
Mom?

83
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:38,848
- I think I'm gonna take a little rest now.
- OK.

84
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:42,921
We'll be right outside if you need us.

85
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:57,162
What was she talking about?
I mean, that was weird.

86
00:07:57,253 --> 00:08:00,529
- She's gonna be fine.
- It's OK.

87
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:04,845
I'm sorry. The doctor spoke to me,
and I should have told you.

88
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:08,602
The thing that's pressing on her brain,

89
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,446
sometimes it might
make her say weird things.

90
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:16,684
- Does she know she's saying them?
- Not really.

91
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:20,891
It's sort of like a flash. But you saw her
two seconds afterward - she was normal.

92
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:23,567
And after the operation, no more pressing.

93
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:25,723
She'll be all normal all the time.

94
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:29,203
- Is that right?
- Hey, Santa doesn't lie.

95
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:34,482
- Oh, excuse me.
- Careful, the facts say a picnic is in order.

96
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:38,485
What is that thing? There's no data.

97
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:44,724
There's no pictures on this one there!
What is the data? There's no one in there.

98
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:48,603
- Buffy?
- Come on, honey. Don't worry about it.

99
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:52,765
I'm going home?

100
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:55,287
Home? Home, home, home...

101
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:57,804
What's wrong with him?

102
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,327
Is it like Mom? A thing in his head?

103
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:05,725
I don't think so. I think it's different.
Don't worry about it.

104
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,247
I guess I missed that. Was he bothering you?

105
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,449
Hey, Ben. This is my friend Willow.

106
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:11,852
- Hi.
- Hi.

107
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:16,211
And, yeah, the crazy man was a little,
you know, crazy, but it's OK.

108
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:19,046
- Are they gonna send him home?
- Don't get me started.

109
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:22,648
The mental ward's booked
beyond capacity, nowhere to put them,

110
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,486
so the ones with families
are being sent home.

111
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:30,567
Like his family is able to take care of him!
He has to have someone watch him 24-7.

112
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,564
What was he saying to you?

113
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:35,087
Oh, he was just babbling.

114
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:51,288
- You know what's weird?
- Japanese commercials are weird.

115
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:52,931
Yes.

116
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:58,133
And also, you know,
some of the stars we're looking at

117
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:00,886
don't even exist any more.

118
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:05,808
In the time that it takes for
their light to reach us, they've died.

119
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,723
Exploded.

120
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:10,405
Poof.

121
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:15,611
Were things rough at the hospital?

122
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:22,528
You know, I used to love
to look up at them when I was little.

123
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:29,291
They're supposed to make you feel all
insignificant, but they made me feel like...

124
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:34,042
like I was in space.

125
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,124
Part of the stars.

126
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:41,048
There's Canis Minor.

127
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,249
And Cassiopeia.

128
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,764
And the Big Pineapple.

129
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:52,847
You know, I'm not sure I remember that one.

130
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,128
Oh, it's a major one.

131
00:10:56,493 --> 00:11:00,042
See those three bright stars right over there?

132
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:04,208
Yeah.

133
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:06,682
And see those stars along there?

134
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:10,962
That's the bottom of the pineapple.

135
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:15,211
- It's big.
- Hence the name.

136
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:20,926
The real ones never made sense to me.
I sort of have my own.

137
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:24,244
Teach me.

138
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:30,368
See those stars over there?

139
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:32,762
Short Man Looking Uncomfortable.

140
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:38,484
Moose Getting a Sponge Bath.

141
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,242
Little Pile o' Crackers.

142
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:47,604
That was a bit of a stretch.

143
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:53,931
You do it. What would you call... that one?

144
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:57,051
I see...

145
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:03,482
a huge flaming meteor
about to crash into something.

146
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:37,806
I know what I said.
I said I won't go away far.

147
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:39,963
A person needs to respect a man...

148
00:12:45,493 --> 00:12:48,883
..get some fresh air
and find some fresh spaces.

149
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:53,484
And some fresh space!

150
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:57,532
And needs to walk to get where he's going.

151
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:22,892
This thing doesn't work! It isn't working!

152
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,362
I'm sure they heard you.

153
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:29,890
I bet it's not even hooked up to anything.
Just like the push buttons at the crosswalk.

154
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:31,804
I'm sure someone's...

155
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:35,169
What, the push buttons
aren't hooked up to anything?

156
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:38,808
Oh, tell him, Buffy. Tell him, OK?

157
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:43,888
- Look, Dr Kriegel, we wanna go home.
- Well, of course.

158
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:48,603
- You can visit your mother in the morning.
- No. We.

159
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:52,652
I mean all of us. My mom, too.

160
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:58,250
Well, I understand that, but it's not
necessarily the first thing I'd recommend.

161
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:04,568
I can't. I can't stay here waiting for two days
for this operation. I just can't.

162
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:09,044
- It makes my head hurt to be here.
- Joyce, there's no reason to get upset.

163
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:14,526
No reason to get upset? Right, sorry. I must
just think there is cos of my brain tumour!

164
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:21,008
Here, Dawn, why don't you
get something from the machine?

165
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:31,532
- I'm sorry I said that. I'm just tired.
- I know.

166
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:37,085
Listen, Doctor, I don't see why we can't
take her home, you know, just until...

167
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:42,042
Wouldn't it be better for her to rest someplace
where she felt safe and comfortable?

168
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:46,609
Even if it would mean
some work for you, taking care of her?

169
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:48,923
- Oh, thank God.
- I'll do it. Anything.

170
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:53,050
There are medications to administer.
I'd have to show you how.

171
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:57,046
And I'd need for you to check her vitals,
watch her pretty closely.

172
00:14:57,133 --> 00:15:01,809
- I'm afraid you won't get a lot of sleep.
- I'm not much of a sleep person anyway.

173
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:04,168
- Can we go now? Let's go now!
- Hold on!

174
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:08,132
Let me get all the medications and
the instructions on how to do everything.

175
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:12,411
She's right. Let's do this right.
We don't wanna forget anything.

176
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:24,932
Everyone stay close.

177
00:15:25,013 --> 00:15:28,483
- I'm glad you called me in on this.
- Glad you answered.

178
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:31,292
Oh, yeah. Sorry about last time.

179
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:34,251
- Heard I missed out on some fun.
- Oh, yeah, fun was had.

180
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,723
Also frolic, merriment
and near-death high jinks.

181
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,804
Look. There it is.

182
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:45,051
Wow. We have a meteorite.

183
00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:50,008
Is it hot?

184
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:53,483
Cos if there's radiation,
you could go all sterile.

185
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:59,402
No, it's not hot. It's warm.

186
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,724
And broken.

187
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,524
- It's sort of...
- Hollow.

188
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:09,046
Yeah.

189
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,601
So, we're all thinking the same thing, right?

190
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:14,366
Festive pinata? Delicious candy?

191
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,729
Something evil crashed to earth in this
and then broke out

192
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:20,646
and slithered away to do badness.

193
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,728
In all fairness, I don't think
we know about the "slithered" part.

194
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:27,611
Oh, no. I'm sure
it frisked about like a fluffy lamb.

195
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:31,242
Let's look around.
Maybe we can figure out where it went.

196
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:48,404
It went here!

197
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:02,891
No pulse.

198
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,729
Yep, the space lamb got him.

199
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:15,283
- I don't see any marks on him.
- I know him. He was at the hospital.

200
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:18,763
A mental patient. They released him today.

201
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:28,651
- Riley, what are you doing?
- I'm not sure, there's something...

202
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:37,886
That might be toxic. Don't touch it.

203
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,248
Yeah, touching it was my first impulse.

204
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,849
Luckily I've moved on to my second,
which involves heaving and running like hell.

205
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,810
Oh, man, does that smell.

206
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:50,772
- So what do we do now?
- We can't call Buffy.

207
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,650
- I wanna call Buffy.
- You can't.

208
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:55,452
She's got life stuff. That has to come first.

209
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,492
So we'll just figure this out ourselves.
We're experienced.

210
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:03,282
Yes, cos it seems like we're always
dealing with creatures from space.

211
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,364
Except that we don't ever do that.

212
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,562
This is definitely new territory.

213
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:14,929
Perhaps we should explore a bit more,
head into the woods a bit.

214
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:21,128
- Who votes research?
- Better idea.

215
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:23,602
Good call. Could've been
other cases like this.

216
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:28,528
I'm gonna stay here, examine the body
some more, look around a little bit.

217
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:31,204
Yeah, don't do anything hunterly.

218
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:35,332
No, no, I'm just not great at research,
which I'm sure you guys figured out.

219
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:39,008
- I like me a good crime scene.
- Give us a call if you need help.

220
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:43,848
Believe me, if something jumps out at me
in the dark, you'll hear me without the phone.

221
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,925
- Call me if you learn anything.
- You got it.

222
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:50,403
I don't wanna be the one
that finds the bodies any more.

223
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:05,690
I need to speak to the man
at the desk. This is A...

224
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:08,128
This is Riley Finn.

225
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,683
You have an Agent Miller,
Graham Miller. He'll tell you who...

226
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:14,412
Yes. Emergency frequency.

227
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,604
Cold. Cold.

228
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:32,567
Wait! You can't go!

229
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:35,087
Don't you be that kind of barn owl!

230
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:39,162
Please! Please don't go! Please!

231
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:41,847
Please don't go.

232
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:43,808
Please.

233
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:46,885
Please. Please don't...

234
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,291
I can't see you! I can't see you!
I can't see you!

235
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:25,088
Well, I guess we're all set, then.

236
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:28,165
You've got my home phone number,
my pager number. And here.

237
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:33,725
These are the medications I talked to you
about - the sedative and so forth, painkillers.

238
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:35,804
Right. No problem.

239
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:39,962
If this is gonna be too much,
we can make your mom comfortable here.

240
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:43,887
No. No, no, I got this.
We really, really appreciate...

241
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:47,010
You lookjust like your father when he cries.

242
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:49,561
And what do you think he was begging for?

243
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:52,608
- I told you she's been...
- I know.

244
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:54,770
Joyce?

245
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:58,530
Joyce. We're all done here.

246
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:02,891
- Why don't you take your girls home now?
- Yes. Yes, thank you.

247
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:07,171
- Thank you for all your help, Doctor.
- I'll see you in a couple of days.

248
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:10,728
Let's get the hell outta here.

249
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,724
Here we go.

250
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:27,284
Oh, it's nice to be home.

251
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:31,651
- Do you wanna go into bed, Mom?
- Oh, Buffy, no. That light, it's too bright.

252
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,452
- It's too bright. It's too bright.
- OK. OK.

253
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:38,287
- Buffy, it hurts. It hurts my eyes.
- It's off, it's off.

254
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:43,606
Shut off the lights in the living room. I will
take you upstairs and we'll shut off the lights.

255
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,684
Come on.

256
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,127
- You Finn?
- Yeah.

257
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:36,764
Major Ellis. I'm in charge. What's the
situation? Just the one civilian casualty?

258
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:39,162
That I know of. This way.

259
00:22:39,253 --> 00:22:41,847
You found a stiff in the woods
and called us in?

260
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:45,812
Don't you usually call your girlfriend
for this kind of thing?

261
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:56,252
I wouldn't touch that stuff
in his mouth if I were you.

262
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,642
- Toxic?
- No, just messy.

263
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:03,209
Guy seemed to have
simply choked on the stuff.

264
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:06,649
Near as I can tell,
it's some kind of protein alkaloid.

265
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:13,606
Does this fit the profile
of any sub-T you know?

266
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:17,083
It's not subterrestrial, Major. Extraterrestrial.

267
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:20,564
It came out of that.

268
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:25,405
- Set the trackers for a protein signature.
- Yes, sir.

269
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:29,926
No good, Major. This alkaloid's
breaking down at an accelerated rate.

270
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:33,801
- It's dissolving too fast to track.
- You got a better idea?

271
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:37,852
Thing came from space.
Gotta be some trace radiation.

272
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,924
We have Geiger counters in the packs.

273
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:42,766
Shouldn't be too much
background gamma noise here.

274
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:44,844
Break 'em out.

275
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:24,412
Mom?

276
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:33,043
Oh, my God!

277
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,169
Mom, what are you doing?

278
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:39,847
I'm making breakfast.

279
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:43,323
You shouldn't eat any more.
You're disgustingly fat.

280
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:52,412
- Oh, Buffy, I don't know what I'm doing.
- You just need some rest.

281
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:55,164
We'll put you back to bed.

282
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:10,968
OK, there you go.

283
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,248
That will help you sleep.

284
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:16,325
Come on. Let's get you all tucked into bed.

285
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,644
Don't touch me!

286
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,042
You... you thing!

287
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:30,044
Mom, please!

288
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:31,771
Get away from me!

289
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:34,208
- You're nothing, you're a shadow!
- Mom...

290
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:37,603
- I don't know what you are or how you came.
- Mom, it's Dawn.

291
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:40,082
Dawn? Honey, what's wrong?

292
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:44,243
She's just tired. We all are.

293
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,722
Come on, go to sleep.

294
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,488
I'll check in on you in a little bit.

295
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:04,891
She hates me.

296
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:09,364
No.

297
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:11,808
She called me a thing.

298
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:14,123
She loves you. OK?

299
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:16,044
She's not herself.

300
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:19,091
I told you what the doctor said
about the tumour.

301
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:22,563
No. Notjust Mom.

302
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,207
People. They keep saying
weird stuff about me.

303
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:30,171
Are you talking
about the man in the hospital?

304
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,972
He called me a thing, too.

305
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:37,251
And there was another one.
A weird guy outside the magic shop.

306
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:41,442
He said I didn't belong.

307
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,922
He said I wasn't real.

308
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:48,248
Why does everybody keep doing that?

309
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:52,326
- What's wrong with me?
- Nothing. It's not you.

310
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:59,284
There's something that happens in people's
brains when there's something wrong.

311
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:01,933
It's like a short circuit.

312
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:07,885
And it makes them feel like nothing's
real except for them. That's all it is.

313
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:14,932
Look, it is not you. OK?

314
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:20,725
And if anyone says anything
like that to you again, don't listen.

315
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:22,804
Even if it's Mom.

316
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:30,010
- I hate it.
- I know.

317
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:34,764
Just don't listen.

318
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:41,092
Look at how teeny Mercury is
compared to, like, Saturn.

319
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:43,733
Whereas, in contrast,
the cars of the same name...

320
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:46,327
Xander, please, we have work to do here.

321
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:52,805
I still don't get why we had to come here
to get info about a killer snot monster.

322
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:56,169
Because it's a killer snot monster
from outer space.

323
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:59,284
I did not say that.

324
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:04,604
Demons enter our world in all sorts of
different ways. This one came from above.

325
00:28:04,693 --> 00:28:08,481
And the library's astronomy section
is the home of aboveness. Got it.

326
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:11,485
Hey, digging this study material, too.

327
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:15,805
We've scoured the periodicals for
other meteorite landings in the last week.

328
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:19,568
- Big zippo.
- Well, then the world is not being invaded.

329
00:28:19,653 --> 00:28:24,010
- I'm pretty pleased about that.
- Guys? I've got some stuff.

330
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:29,292
The most recent meteoric anomaly
was the Tunguska blast in Russia in 1917.

331
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:32,683
Some witnesses
claimed the meteor was hollow.

332
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:35,162
Maybe with a chewy
demon centre like ours.

333
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:38,290
- How far back does this list of anomalies go?
- Pretty far.

334
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:41,843
- To the Queller impact in the 12th century.
- The what?

335
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:46,404
Queller. I don't know why they call it that.
It didn't hit a place called Queller.

336
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,961
It landed just outside of Reykjavik in Iceland.

337
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:53,922
Wait, I just saw... Queller. Quell...

338
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:56,485
Here, here.

339
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:59,849
"Primitive people used to believe
the moon caused insanity."

340
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:03,926
"They would pray to the moon to send a
meteor to fix the problem the moon caused."

341
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:09,167
"These meteors
were expected to 'quell' the madmen."

342
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:12,326
The man in the woods -
he was a mental patient.

343
00:29:12,413 --> 00:29:14,802
And he got pretty well... quelled.

344
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:17,202
OK, I'm looking in history right now.

345
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:21,812
It says in the Middle Ages there were
these sweeping plagues of madness.

346
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:26,887
People were losing their marbles everywhere,
but then it would suddenly subside.

347
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,806
And these dates look pretty close.

348
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,363
Like maybe it happened
after each one of the meteor events.

349
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:38,083
As if something emerged from the meteors
and quelled the madmen.

350
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:40,209
Meteor go boom, crazy guy goes bye-bye.

351
00:29:40,293 --> 00:29:45,208
Xander's little book made it sound like
this Queller thing had to be summoned.

352
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:47,853
So who summoned it?

353
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:52,529
Who else? My money's on Glory,
our resident beastie summoner.

354
00:29:52,613 --> 00:29:56,606
We should call Buffy.
Except we can't call Buffy.

355
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:59,446
- Can we?
- No, but we better call Riley.

356
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:02,764
- A Queller demon?
- Yeah, that's our perp.

357
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:06,163
- A scavenger that can be summoned to kill...
- Crazy people.

358
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:07,845
Yeah. How'd you know?

359
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:12,051
- Cos I have five corpses at the mental ward.
- You're at the hospital?

360
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:18,606
Listen, Riley, I saw Buffy's mom earlier
and she was acting kinda wacky.

361
00:30:18,973 --> 00:30:21,282
Insane wacky, if you know what I mean?

362
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:25,889
It's OK. Joyce was released earlier today.
That intern, Ben, told me.

363
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:28,282
- They're safe at home.
- Oh, good.

364
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:31,763
And the thing, the Queller, is it still there?

365
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:35,528
We've... I think I've got it
cornered in the air ducts.

366
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:42,926
Willow, keep at what you're doing.
Call me if you find out how I can kill it.

367
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:46,050
OK, but shouldn't we come help?

368
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:48,169
OK.

369
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:53,851
I wish someone had told me that there would
be tennis being played! I just didn't know.

370
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,764
Those eyes...

371
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,647
Those eyes, they're like gasoline puddles!

372
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:05,329
Tell me. Tell me because I need to know why.
Why are you staring at me like that?

373
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:09,169
What are you asking me?
You are asking me, aren't you?

374
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:14,247
Is this a test? And if this counts
for the final grade, I need to know now!

375
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,847
OK, teachers put this on the syllabus,

376
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:22,724
but they do not stare down at you, they
do not cling, they do not look down on you.

377
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,412
Does someone know you're here?
They should have said.

378
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:31,532
You are not supposed to be here.
I need to rest now.

379
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:34,685
I don't like the way you're staring at me!

380
00:32:34,773 --> 00:32:36,843
Did they tell you that at the gate?

381
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:40,403
Stop staring at me. I don't like it!

382
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:59,409
- Trail stops here, edge of the parking lot.
- It stops?

383
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:02,644
A car. It hitched a ride, probably underneath.

384
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:05,084
So much for containment.

385
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:09,451
So some poor mental patient checks out
of here today, drives away with this thing,

386
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,603
took it right to its own home.

387
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:15,732
- Checked out today.
- Get me a list of patients discharged...

388
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:19,249
No. I know where it's going.
We've gotta move, now!

389
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:23,645
I'm going to close my eyes, and when
I open them you are going to go away.

390
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:30,168
Get off me!

391
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:51,769
Buffy!

392
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:17,041
Buffy!

393
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:28,290
- What? What is it?
- Something's out there. It's after Mom!

394
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:30,489
Stay in here. Don't leave this room.

395
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:45,685
It's OK, my baby. It's OK.

396
00:35:32,053 --> 00:35:33,771
- Spike?
- Yeah.

397
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:36,845
Listen, did you hear a noise?

398
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:39,527
What the hell are you doing in my house?

399
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:42,411
Right then. Caught me.

400
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:46,168
Your basement's full ofjunk.
And me being in need ofjunk...

401
00:35:46,253 --> 00:35:50,405
- You were stealing?
- Yeah. Can't exactly work at Burger Barn...

402
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,484
Wait. Are those pictures of me?

403
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,091
Buffy!

404
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,124
Cover the room!

405
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:45,011
We're in. Fan out! Take the back!

406
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:47,526
Clear!

407
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:49,604
Are you OK?

408
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:54,567
You just missed a real nice time.

409
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:02,770
- It's gone. I killed it.
- Oh, God.

410
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,845
- It's gone? You promise?
- I promise.

411
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:09,524
Everything is all right.

412
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:12,644
Everything is all right.

413
00:37:31,253 --> 00:37:35,371
It's strange. A body might ask
what exactly it is you think you're doing.

414
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,126
He might ask what all this
was meant to accomplish

415
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:41,125
because to a humble postulant
it looks like chaos.

416
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:45,001
Like unnecessary attention drawn
where it ought not to be.

417
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:48,411
- Get out.
- Sir.

418
00:37:53,213 --> 00:37:57,286
Sir, forgive me. I just want to understand.
Why summon the Queller?

419
00:37:57,373 --> 00:38:00,649
What do you think?
Because I'm cleaning up Glory's mess.

420
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:03,327
Just like I've done my whole damn life.

421
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:43,601
Buffy, I'm gonna ask you something.

422
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:48,008
And if I'm being crazy, you just tell me, OK?

423
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:51,124
You got it.

424
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:54,368
The other day...

425
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:58,844
Actually, I'm not sure when.
The days seem to all bleed together.

426
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:05,524
- It's not important.
- No, I guess it isn't.

427
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:09,805
I do know I was pretty out of it,

428
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:15,206
and I had... not a dream exactly,

429
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:18,251
more like I had this knowledge.

430
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:21,325
Itjust came to me like truth, you know?

431
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,727
Even though it didn't seem possible.

432
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:29,810
- Even though I shouldn't think such things.
- What?

433
00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:33,564
That Dawn...

434
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:38,408
She's not mine, is she?

435
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:53,684
No.

436
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:00,724
She's...

437
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:04,364
She does belong to us, though?

438
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,524
Yes, she does.

439
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:14,291
And she's important.
To the world. Precious.

440
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:18,728
As precious as you are to me.

441
00:40:23,493 --> 00:40:26,291
Then we have to take care of her.

442
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:30,002
Buffy, promise me. If anything happens,
if I don't come through this...

443
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:32,482
- Mom...
- No, listen to me.

444
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:36,282
No matter what she is,
she still feels like my daughter.

445
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:42,366
I have to know that you'll take care of her,
that you'll keep her safe,

446
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:44,842
that you'll love her like I love you.

447
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:49,364
I promise.

448
00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:52,164
Good.

449
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:55,764
Good.

450
00:40:58,653 --> 00:41:00,883
My sweet, brave Buffy.

451
00:41:02,813 --> 00:41:05,611
What would I do without you?

452
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:31,527
