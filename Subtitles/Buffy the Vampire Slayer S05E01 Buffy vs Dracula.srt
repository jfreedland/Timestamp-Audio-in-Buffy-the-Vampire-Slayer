2
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:15,563
Touchdown. Oh, yeah.

3
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:17,723
Go, Team Me.

4
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,323
Anybody ever told Team You
the quarterback throws like a girl?

5
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:27,170
I do?

6
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:34,090
Sorry.

7
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:37,208
No, don't you...

8
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:43,085
I'm exhausted just looking at those two.
All the splashing and jumping and running.

9
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:45,562
Shouldn't relaxing involve less exertion?

10
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:49,202
Absolutely. Exertion can lead to sweatiness.

11
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:54,048
Which can cause the pain and heartbreak
of stinkiness. Better to just stay put.

12
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:57,842
I think we've just put our finger
on why we're the sidekicks.

13
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,486
Game over?

14
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:05,532
Buffy slayed the football.

15
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:09,688
- Where's my burger?
- Yeah, man, I'm starving. Cow me.

16
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,525
The fire's not cooperating.

17
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:15,765
It's comforting to know that I lack
the culinary finesse of a caveman.

18
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:17,332
Ignis, incende.

19
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:22,523
Willow, check you out. Witch fu.

20
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,733
It's no big. You just balance the elements

21
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:29,408
so when you affect one,
you don't wind up causing...

22
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,602
I didn't do it.

23
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:59,208
- Come on, hurry it up. I'm getting soaked.
- I'm trying.

24
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:01,409
This thing weighs.

25
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,127
Nice. Good job.

26
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,681
Look at this. The guy's carting dirt around.

27
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:10,128
Leave it. We'll turn it on its side.

28
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,565
Dirt. Man, rich people are...

29
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,044
There you go. All set.

30
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:27,645
Thank you, Willow. Obstinate bloody
machine simply refused to work for me.

31
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,008
Just call me the Computer Whisperer.

32
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:32,527
Let's get scanning.
I wanna see this puppy go.

33
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:36,970
- Start with those.
- Start? Where is finish?

34
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:42,332
It's essential we begin to archive the library.
Most of these texts have no duplicates.

35
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:46,884
But now? Doesn't winter seem
more like archiving season?

36
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:53,169
Well, you don't have to, Willow.
I mean, you're welcome to leave if...

37
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,403
No. It's fine.

38
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:59,722
It's just you've been Mr Project
all summer, you know?

39
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:02,964
Labelling the amulets
and indexing your diaries.

40
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,851
I draw the line at making
giant rubber-band balls.

41
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,527
That's when you'll just have to get a life.

42
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:14,050
That's what I'm trying to do,
actually, is get a life.

43
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:17,728
- It might go better if you left the house.
- Willow...

44
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:20,202
you mustn't repeat
what I'm about to say.

45
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:21,931
Especially not to Buffy.

46
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:27,127
- You promise?
- Oh, God.

47
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:31,448
I guess. Now that I know there's
something to know, I can't not know,

48
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,684
just because I'm afraid
somebody'll know I know, you know?

49
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:38,403
- Did that mean yes?
- Yeah.

50
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:43,521
We're doing this because I want you all to
have everything you need at your fingertips.

51
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:45,843
You see, I'm going back to England.

52
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,123
You're what?

53
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:52,727
But you can't. You're Buffy's watcher.

54
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:56,602
I mean, in a fired way, but...

55
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:59,287
It's obvious that Buffy
doesn't need me any more.

56
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:03,764
I don't say that in a self-pitying way.
I'm quite proud, actually.

57
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:08,929
But what about the rest of us?
We still need to be watched.

58
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:12,926
Personally, I can't get through a day
without a little hairy eyeball.

59
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:16,130
I appreciate the sentiment, but it's just not so.

60
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:19,091
You'll be fine. You all will.

61
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:23,724
And we'll stay in touch.
You can always call me whenever you like.

62
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:28,562
When are you gonna tell Buffy?

63
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:33,932
Soon. It won't be easy,
but I know she'll understand.

64
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:37,410
Thanks, Mom. Everything was yummy.

65
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:41,930
You up for dessert?
We could take a drive, get some ice cream.

66
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:44,925
You know, I would
but I kinda have to get out on patrol.

67
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,243
Now? It's 8.30.

68
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,611
Vamps don't really care what time it is.
You know, dark equals dinner bell.

69
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:53,684
Right. Of course.

70
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:59,209
You know, I'm gonna have to get used to
this place without you again. It gets so quiet.

71
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:03,411
Maybe we should make a regular
date of this when school starts.

72
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:07,529
I'm sorry. Duty calls. It's a total drag.

73
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:54,330
Very impressive hunt.

74
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,164
Such power.

75
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:02,970
That was no hunt.
That was just another day on the job.

76
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,684
Care to step up for some overtime?

77
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:10,007
We're not going to fight.

78
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:13,451
- Do you know what a slayer is?
- Do you?

79
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,683
Who are you?

80
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,492
I apologise. I assumed you knew.

81
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:25,004
I am Dracula.

82
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:29,843
Get out.

83
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:37,882
Xand, what if somebody had a secret

84
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:42,410
and that somebody promised somebody
else that they wouldn't tell anyone?

85
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:45,246
Newsflash, Will. Everybody knows.

86
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,767
No, this isn't about me and Tara.

87
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:51,768
Not that I wouldn't be all ears
if you wanted to tell me a secret.

88
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:53,684
Even if it was very, very naughty.

89
00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:57,971
Sorry, this is of the non-naughty variety.
And I'm not telling you.

90
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:01,646
OK. Wanna see if Buffy's
hanging around the headstones?

91
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:04,805
Sure. So if I was gonna tell you,
which I'm not going to...

92
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:09,325
So let me get this straight.
You're "Dracula".

93
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:11,529
The guy. The Count.

94
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:15,523
- I am.
- This isn'tjust some fan-boy thing?

95
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:20,812
Cos I've fought a lot of pimply overweight
vamps that called themselves Lestat.

96
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:27,204
You know who I am. As I would know without
question that you are Buffy Summers.

97
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,403
You've heard of me?

98
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:36,123
Naturally. You're known
throughout the world.

99
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,883
No. Really?

100
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:42,567
Why else would I come here?

101
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:44,644
For the sun?

102
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:49,444
I came to meet the renowned killer.

103
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,923
Yeah, I prefer the term "slayer".
"Killer" just sounds so...

104
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:54,685
Naked?

105
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:57,812
Like I paint clowns or something.

106
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:00,849
I'm the good guy, remember?

107
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:04,483
Perhaps, but your power
is rooted in darkness.

108
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,564
You must feel it.

109
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,566
No. You know what I feel?

110
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,642
Bored.

111
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:23,648
OK, that's cheating.

112
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:26,249
Hey, Buff, what's up?

113
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,052
- You look like you just...
- Get out of here. Now.

114
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:32,011
Fine. I was gonna give you
a sip of my double-mint mocha...

115
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,288
Behind you.

116
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:36,692
Hi.

117
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:40,891
Nice. Look who's got
a bad case of Dark Prince envy.

118
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,170
I have no interest in you. Leave us.

119
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:47,207
No, we're not going to "leave you".

120
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,727
And where'd you get that accent?
Sesame Street?

121
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,122
Von, two, three... three victims.

122
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:54,204
- Mah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Xander.

123
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:57,444
I'm pretty sure that's Dracula.

124
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:01,088
Wow, really?

125
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:04,529
Sorry, man. I was justjokin' around.

126
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:07,923
This is not the time.

127
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:12,048
I will see you soon.

128
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:20,484
Bat.

129
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:27,166
Buffy's all "Look out!" And then frigging
Dracula's standing right behind us.

130
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:31,292
- And then he lunges at us, like, whoosh.
- He totally looked shorter in person.

131
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:35,412
I told you he'd heard of me. Can you
believe that? Count Famous heard of me.

132
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:39,930
I couldn't believe it the first 20 times
you told us, but it's starting to sink in now.

133
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:42,004
I'm sorry. Am I Repeat-O-Girl?

134
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,124
I was just blown away.

135
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:47,603
It's not that surprising that he's
heard of you. You are the Slayer.

136
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,971
I guess. Just the way he said it, you know?
I mean, he made it sound so...

137
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:54,851
Sexy? I bet he made it sound sexy.

138
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:59,643
Kinda. He of the dark,
penetrating eyes and lilty accent.

139
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:04,728
- I wonder if he knows Frankenstein.
- You thought Dracula was sexy?

140
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,043
No. He was yuck.

141
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:11,726
Right. Except for the whole tall,
dark and handsome thing, yucko.

142
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:15,726
- How would you know?
- Well, we hung out a few times.

143
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:20,728
Back in my demon days.
You know, once or twice. He's pretty cool.

144
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:24,123
You know, from a whole
evil-thing perspective.

145
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:26,289
Please. He was no big whoop.

146
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:30,764
"No big whoop"? What about when he turned
himself into a bat? That was awesome.

147
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:34,368
It must have been, yes.
I must admit, I'm sorry I missed that.

148
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,727
Me too.

149
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:40,011
The whole time I was thinking "I wish
Giles were here. He'd know what to do."

150
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,402
Didn't you guys think that?

151
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:46,411
Actually, I was more thinking "Bat!"

152
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:49,685
- How come he can do that?
- I have no idea.

153
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:52,608
There's a great deal of myth about Dracula.

154
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:56,971
I imagine the trick to defeating him
lies in separating the fact from the fiction.

155
00:12:57,053 --> 00:13:01,251
Great point. That is so Giles
to think of something like that, you know?

156
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:04,446
That we would have never.

157
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:09,002
So we should take things slow with Dracula.
He said we would meet again,

158
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:11,527
but I want to wait
until we do some homework.

159
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:15,162
He may have a bunch of swell party tricks,
but he's still just a vampire.

160
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:18,604
- Let's load up with stakes and go after him.
- Second.

161
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:21,924
Buffy's right. Dracula's too slick
to fall for the usual stuff.

162
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:25,369
So we hold off. No killing until
we know what we're dealing with.

163
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:29,651
You're notjust saying that because of
those dark penetrating eyes of his? Are you?

164
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:31,844
No. His eyes were...

165
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,686
They were... There was no penetration.

166
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,252
Cross my heart.

167
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,928
All right. Willow, you and Tara
find out everything you can

168
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:45,133
about the legend of Vlad the Impaler
on the Internet and I'll check the library.

169
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:49,091
The Initiative would have
found everything in a few hours.

170
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:51,289
We may not be as fast, but we'll find him.

171
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,171
You guys'll reconvene here in the morning?

172
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:57,762
- What's your plan?
- Big sleep.

173
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,413
My Count encounter wiped me out.

174
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:03,849
I'm kinda wired.
Maybe I should just let you get your rest.

175
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,448
You sure? I mean, maybe
if you just lie down with me...

176
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:10,366
Nothing you are about to say will lead to rest.

177
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:14,610
I guess you're right.
I'll see you in the morning?

178
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:17,161
- With doughnuts.
- Heaven.

179
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:24,282
See? A little sugar and I'm all yours.
Dracula schmacula.

180
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:28,522
I doubt he'd remember me.
I was just a silly young thing.

181
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:32,925
Like 700 or so. But he did say
that this guy I cursed was doomed for ever,

182
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,442
which was really sweet, don't you think?

183
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:36,682
Adorable.

184
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:41,403
It was a great spell. I made this jerk
incredibly fat, like a human minivan.

185
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:46,524
You should just mention my name
if you see him again.

186
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:51,926
Or why not sit on top of a crypt and flaunt
your neck cleavage until Dracula shows up?

187
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:55,164
- Then you two can talk private.
- Don't tell me you're jealous.

188
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:58,165
No. Just because you're panting over the guy.

189
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:00,369
I am not panting.

190
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:04,086
Now stop being silly. I'll see you tomorrow.

191
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:07,765
- You don't wanna come back to my place?
- It's whites day.

192
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,083
The bleach smell makes me nauseous.

193
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:14,483
Fine. I suppose Dracula doesn't use bleach?

194
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:18,164
He's a darks-only man.

195
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:31,533
Great. Perfect.

196
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:35,885
You know what? You're not so big.

197
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:40,205
One round of old-fashioned fisticuffs,
I bet you'd fold like a bitty baby.

198
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:45,292
OK, let's do it. And no poofing.

199
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:48,162
Come on, Puffy Shirt. Pucker on up...

200
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:50,608
- Silence.
- Yes, master.

201
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:53,523
No, that's not...

202
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:58,289
You will be my emissary.
My eyes and ears in daylight.

203
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:03,483
- Your emissary?
- Serve me well, you will be rewarded.

204
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,608
I will make you an immortal.

205
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:11,524
A child of darkness that feeds on life itself,

206
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,205
on blood.

207
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:16,363
Blood? Yes.

208
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:19,763
I will serve you, Your Excellent Spookiness.

209
00:16:20,453 --> 00:16:22,489
Or "master". I'll stick with "master".

210
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:25,963
You are strange and off-putting. Go now.

211
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,604
But, master, how can I find...?

212
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:34,444
Brilliant. What an exit.

213
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:37,204
Guy's a genius.

214
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,644
Well, well.

215
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,201
You can take the boy out of the Initiative,

216
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:02,729
but you can't take the Initiative out of the boy.

217
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,531
I'd put that down, unless
you're bucking for one hell of a headache.

218
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,888
I can't be too careful.

219
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:14,646
I got quite a few demons after me these days.

220
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:18,569
I'm looking for some information.
Might pay a little.

221
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,284
I'll play.

222
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:25,643
What can you tell me about Dracula?

223
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,084
Dracula?

224
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,807
Poncy bugger owes me
11 pounds, for one thing.

225
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:36,966
- You know him?
- Know him? We're old rivals.

226
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:42,526
But then he got famous.
He forgot all about his foes.

227
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:48,526
I'll tell you what. That glory hound's
done more harm to vampires than any slayer.

228
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:52,652
His story gets out and suddenly everybody
knows how to kill us. The mirror bit?

229
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:56,089
But he's notjust a regular vampire.
He has special powers, right?

230
00:17:56,173 --> 00:18:00,007
Nothing but showy gypsy stuff.
What's it to you, anyway?

231
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:04,602
He's in town. Making his presence known.

232
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:07,810
Drac's in Sunnydale?

233
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:12,206
I guess the old boy needed closure after all.

234
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:18,168
Actually, he's gunning for Buffy. But I'm out
to find him before he gets another shot at her.

235
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:22,326
Tough talk, cowboy. But you're not
gonna catch him napping in a crypt.

236
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:29,091
The Count has to have his luxury estate and
his bug-eaters and his special dirt, don't he?

237
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:33,844
You're saying I should check out
mansions? That sort of thing?

238
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,163
No.

239
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:41,168
I'm saying you should go home
to your superhoney.

240
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,608
Have a nice, safe snog.

241
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:46,727
You're out of your depth on this one, boy.

242
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:52,964
You've helped Buffy before, so she has a
problem with killing you now you're helpless.

243
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:55,044
I don't.

244
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,404
I'd like to see you try.

245
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,324
Would you?

246
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,124
You're never gonna find him.

247
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,524
Not before he gets to her.

248
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,727
You are magnificent.

249
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:12,446
I bet you say that before you bite all the girls.

250
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,524
No, you are different.

251
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,563
Kindred.

252
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,889
Kindred? Hardly, I...

253
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:22,964
Pull your hair back.

254
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:31,610
This isn't how I usually fight.

255
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:41,281
You think you can just waft in here with your
music-video wind and your hypno eyes...

256
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:46,450
I have searched the world over for you.

257
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,608
I have yearned for you.

258
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:55,212
For a creature whose darkness rivals my own.

259
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:02,803
You have been tasted.

260
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:08,204
- He was...
- Unworthy.

261
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:16,044
He let you go.

262
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,401
But the embrace,

263
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,484
his bite,

264
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,605
you remember.

265
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:34,524
No.

266
00:21:40,653 --> 00:21:42,644
Do not fight.

267
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,051
I can feel your hunger.

268
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:45,886
- Here's ajelly one. You want it?
- No.

269
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,611
Got it. Mine.

270
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:52,287
Well, I think we have Dracula factoids.

271
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,211
Like any of that's enough
to fight the Dark Master.

272
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,842
- Baiter.
- A lot of it we already knew.

273
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:02,686
Turn-offs: wood, fire, crosses, garlic.

274
00:23:02,773 --> 00:23:07,801
Turn-ons: nice duds, minions,
long, slow bites that last for days.

275
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:11,488
Yeah, I did a little research, too.
Dracula likes to live in style.

276
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:15,327
Which means we can rule out
the usual dumps vampires haunt.

277
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:18,883
He's smart enough to figure that
we know that. I say he's laying low.

278
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:23,444
Actually, my research backs Riley up.
Drac isn't the lay-Iow type.

279
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:25,763
So we can check out the nicer places.

280
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:29,007
Don't you think, Buffy?

281
00:23:30,373 --> 00:23:32,364
Buffy?

282
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:37,204
Yeah. We'll check all the swanky places first.
What else did you guys get?

283
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:39,848
Well, Willow has most of it, actually.

284
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,048
Only because you gave me super pointers.

285
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,693
- I would never...
- Just go ahead, Willow.

286
00:23:46,613 --> 00:23:51,368
OK. Dracula's modus operandi
is different from other vampires.

287
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:56,049
He will kill just to feed, but he'd rather
have a connection with his victims.

288
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:59,648
And he has all of these mental powers
to draw them in.

289
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,886
He can read and control minds,
and appear in dreams.

290
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:09,290
Makes sense. That stare...

291
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:12,046
He just kinda looked right through you.

292
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:14,772
Didn't you feel it, Buffy?

293
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:19,441
No, I didn't.

294
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:22,886
See. Buffy didn't feel it.

295
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:27,012
I think you're drawing a lot of crazy
conclusions about the Unholy Prince.

296
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:29,604
Baiter.

297
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:34,172
The point is, though he goes through
the motions of an intimate seduction,

298
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:37,290
the end result is the same -
he turns them into a vampire.

299
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,407
Well. That is intimate.

300
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:44,762
Dracula's gifting these ladies
with his own blood.

301
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:48,289
And blood is life.

302
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:52,764
According to them.

303
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,808
Just be aware that he tends
to form a relationship with his prey.

304
00:24:57,893 --> 00:25:01,363
It's not enough for him to take her.
She must want to be taken.

305
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:03,603
She must burn for him.

306
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:06,726
That's interesting. I'm gonna go find him.

307
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,973
You shouldn't go by yourself.
He's dangerous.

308
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:11,884
It's cool, I got it.

309
00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:20,965
Take off that scarf.

310
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,044
What? No.

311
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,772
You're under the thrall of the Dark Prince.

312
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:29,447
I am not under the thrall of the Dark Prince.

313
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:32,208
Then take off the scarf.

314
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:35,251
Let go of me. This is ridiculous.

315
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,003
- Why didn't you say anything?
- She didn't want to worry us.

316
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,369
- It's just a scratch.
- Two deep puncture-y scratches.

317
00:25:59,653 --> 00:26:01,803
I'm not sure why I tried to hide it.

318
00:26:04,653 --> 00:26:08,532
There was just this voice
and it was telling me to cover it.

319
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:11,243
And what did I tell you? That's thrall.

320
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:16,528
Like Dracula has mind control over her?
You're watching too many creature features.

321
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:19,571
It does seem like
he has this control over me,

322
00:26:19,653 --> 00:26:22,406
even though a big part of me is resisting.

323
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:25,053
No, it's OK. I shouldn't take this personally.

324
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:29,365
What with Angel, it's understandable
that there would be transference.

325
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:32,923
I mean, they're both broody immortals.

326
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:36,764
I am not transfer-y.

327
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:40,764
I swear to you.

328
00:26:40,853 --> 00:26:43,413
I'm your girl and I'm gonna stay that way.

329
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:47,565
OK. But you are not going
anywhere near him again.

330
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:52,730
Riley's right. You should stay out of sight.
Let the rest of us look for Dracula.

331
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:55,611
I can't go home. He already got inside once.

332
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:58,242
Come to my place.
I'll make sure you stay put.

333
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:02,212
Good. Riley and I can search for Dracula,

334
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:06,286
and Willow, you and Tara could do
a protection spell at Buffy's house,

335
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:08,045
prevent him from returning.

336
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:11,446
Got it. How'd he get inside anyway?

337
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:15,242
He seemed so nice and normal. A little pale.

338
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,769
A good Sunnydale rule of thumb:
avoid white-skinned men in capes.

339
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:23,005
I'm not like this. I don't invite
strange men over for coffee. It's just...

340
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:26,331
When you girls are older,
you'll understand.

341
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:31,123
It's hard to date. Sometimes you just
feel like giving up on men altogether.

342
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:40,601
Another bust.

343
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,526
It's getting dark.
I should have turned up a better lead.

344
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:45,604
There must be an easier way to find him.

345
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:49,766
Too late to worry about that now.
If we hurry, we can hit these last places.

346
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:53,448
How come I have to slayer-sit
while the others get to look for Dracula?

347
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:56,525
- I mean, just because I'm...
- What time is it?

348
00:27:56,973 --> 00:27:59,441
Almost six.
I mean, I'm the one who knows him.

349
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:02,331
I'm the one who had
a good look at him, so...

350
00:28:06,693 --> 00:28:09,810
I'm supposed to deliver you
to the master now.

351
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:14,445
There's this whole deal where
I get to be immortal. You cool with that?

352
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:16,524
Take me to him.

353
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,332
Come on, Xander. This isn't funny.

354
00:28:34,573 --> 00:28:38,088
Master? I deliver the Slayer.
She who you most desire.

355
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:40,132
Sorry. "Whom".

356
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:45,132
Now comes the immortality, right?
You do the thing...

357
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:48,808
Leave us. We must not be interrupted.

358
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:51,404
You bet.

359
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:58,088
I knew you'd come.

360
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,924
Why?

361
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:03,684
Because I'm under your thrall?

362
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,410
Well, guess again, pal.

363
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:09,731
- Put the stake down.
- OK.

364
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:18,247
Right. That was not you.

365
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:24,249
I did that because I wanted to.

366
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:29,487
Maybe I should rethink that thrall thing.

367
00:29:37,813 --> 00:29:42,284
I've lived in Sunnydale a couple of years now.
Know what I've never noticed before?

368
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:44,841
- A castle?
- A big honkin' castle.

369
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:12,370
Stay away from me.

370
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:16,046
Are you afraid I will bite you?

371
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:20,525
Slayer, that's why you came.

372
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:23,641
No. Last night...

373
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:27,409
It's not gonna happen again.

374
00:30:28,013 --> 00:30:31,085
Stop me. Stake me.

375
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:34,131
I... Any minute now.

376
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:37,364
Do you know why you cannot resist?

377
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:39,929
Cos you're famous?

378
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:42,323
Because you do not want to.

379
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:46,968
- My friends are...
- They're here.

380
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,843
They will not find us.

381
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,128
We are alone.

382
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:57,728
Always alone.

383
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,405
There is so much I have to teach you.

384
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:06,485
Your history. Your power.

385
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:08,968
What your body is capable of.

386
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:13,330
- I don't need to know.
- You long to.

387
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:18,608
And you will have eternity
to discover yourself.

388
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:25,209
But first, a little taste.

389
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:28,928
I won't let you.

390
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,406
I didn't mean for me.

391
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:48,601
Nobody harms my master.

392
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:52,481
- Your master?
- You want him? You come through me.

393
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:58,009
Okey-dokey.

394
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,324
Good show, Giles.

395
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:20,125
At least you didn't get knocked out
for a change.

396
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:27,682
Ladies.

397
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:30,241
You would be the three sisters, yes?

398
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:34,327
Excellent. Right.

399
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:37,689
I'd heard that you were a myth.
Obviously erroneous.

400
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:44,965
That tickles.

401
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:50,164
Oh, dear God.

402
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:57,486
- What are you...?
- All these years fighting us,

403
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:00,485
your power so near to our own.

404
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:06,768
And you've never once wanted to know
what it is that we fight for?

405
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,813
Never even a taste?

406
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,882
- If I drink that...
- I have not drunk enough for you to change.

407
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:21,012
You must be near death to become one of us.

408
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:24,085
And that comes only when you plead for it.

409
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:29,968
- I'm not hungry.
- No. Your craving goes deeper than that.

410
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,967
You think you know what you are,

411
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:41,089
what's to come.

412
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:44,773
You haven't even begun.

413
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:14,047
Find it. The darkness.

414
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:17,243
Find your true nature.

415
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:28,251
Wow.

416
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:33,170
That was gross.

417
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:38,164
You are resisting.

418
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:43,091
- Looks like.
- Come here. Come to me.

419
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:48,170
You know, I really think the thrall
has gone out of our relationship.

420
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,165
But I wanna thank you
for opening up my eyes a little.

421
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:54,165
- What is this?
- My true nature.

422
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:56,445
You want a taste?

423
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,324
Buffy? Are you in...?

424
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:16,523
Giles.

425
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:22,725
- Come on. Grab my hand.
- Thank God you came.

426
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:23,962
Come on.

427
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:26,442
There was no possible escape.

428
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,249
My shoe. Silly me, I'll just pop...

429
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:41,370
No, sir. No more chickpit for you. Come on.

430
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:21,206
A guy like you should think
about going electric. Seriously.

431
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:36,884
How do you like my darkness now?

432
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:52,532
Buffy. You OK?

433
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,847
Yeah. Chock-full of free will.

434
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:58,324
And Dracula?

435
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:00,569
Eurotrashed.

436
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:05,008
Where's the creep that turned me
into a spider-eating man-bitch?

437
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:06,805
He's gone.

438
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:10,806
Dammit. You know what?
I'm sick of this crap.

439
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:15,006
I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects
and gets the funny syphilis.

440
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:17,448
As of this moment, it's over.

441
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:21,090
I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey.

442
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,529
Check. No more butt-monkey.

443
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:28,492
At least you weren't makin' time
with the Dracu-babes, like Giles here.

444
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:33,601
I was not. I was about to kill those loathsome
creatures when Riley interrupted me.

445
00:37:33,693 --> 00:37:36,366
Really? You were gonna
nuzzle 'em to death?

446
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:42,242
Of course not. I was in complete control.

447
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:03,567
You think I don't watch your movies?
You always come back.

448
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,523
I'm standing right here.

449
00:38:16,053 --> 00:38:19,284
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Thanks for coming.

450
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:22,729
- Can I offer you some tea?
- No, thanks.

451
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:27,612
Cookies. How come I rate
little-cookie treatment?

452
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:31,129
Well, actually, I have something to tell you.

453
00:38:31,213 --> 00:38:34,523
Actually, I have something
that I'd like to talk to you about, too.

454
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,524
Well, you go first, by all means.

455
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:38,808
- No, go ahead.
- No, I insist.

456
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:45,568
You haven't been my watcher for a while.

457
00:38:47,373 --> 00:38:49,364
I haven't been training

458
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:55,011
and I haven't really needed
to come to you for help.

459
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:57,764
I agree.

460
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:03,245
And then this whole thing with Dracula.

461
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:06,607
It made me face up to some stuff.

462
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:13,724
Ever since we did that spell
where we called on the first slayer,

463
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,930
I've been going out a lot.

464
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:21,572
- Every night.
- Patrolling?

465
00:39:22,773 --> 00:39:27,403
Hunting. That's what Dracula called it.

466
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:30,487
And he was right.

467
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:33,565
He understood my power better than I do.

468
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:37,043
He saw darkness in it.

469
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:42,283
I need to know more.

470
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:47,163
About where I come from.
About the other slayers.

471
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:53,249
Maybe if I can learn to control this thing,
I could be stronger. I could be better.

472
00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:57,250
But I'm scared.

473
00:39:58,373 --> 00:40:00,762
I know it's gonna be hard.

474
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:05,123
And I can't do it without you.

475
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:09,323
I need your help.

476
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:14,451
I need you to be my watcher again.

477
00:40:20,093 --> 00:40:22,732
Boy, I just keep talkin', don't I?

478
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:25,532
I'm sorry. You had something
you wanted to say?

479
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:30,451
No. It's nothing.

480
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:42,563
Riley and I are going to the movies.

481
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:45,042
OK. Have a good time.

482
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:49,922
What are you doing here?

483
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:56,411
Buffy? If you're going out,
why don't you take your sister?

484
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,131
Mom!

485
