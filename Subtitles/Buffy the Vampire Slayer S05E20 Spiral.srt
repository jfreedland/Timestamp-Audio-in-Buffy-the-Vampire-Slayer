00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,090
Previously on "Buffy The Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:05,686
We had to hide the Key.

3
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:09,368
- Made it human and sent it to you.
- Dawn.

4
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:13,207
- What kind of demon am I fighting?
- Glory isn't a demon. She's a god.

5
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:18,003
Your sister took my Key and she won't
give it back. I bet you know where she put it.

6
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:20,766
"They had to be certain the Slayer
would protect it with her life,

7
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:24,129
so they sent the Key to
her in the form of a sister."

8
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:27,762
You're the Key. Go.
Before she finds you. She's here.

9
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:28,683
I love you.

10
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:31,970
The only chance you had with me
was when I was unconscious.

11
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,572
Let's see what you are. Or who you are.

12
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,644
One soldier in a vast army.

13
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:42,010
The Key is the link. The link must be severed.

14
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:46,644
- Where is the Key?
- I'd die a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.

15
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:51,564
No. No.

16
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:53,123
Tara.

17
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,605
No.

18
00:00:57,853 --> 00:00:59,571
Tara, I'm so sorry.

19
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:03,812
- What are you gonna need?
- They gave me a lot of stuff to keep her calm.

20
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:14,172
- I told you this wasn't over.
- Oh, look at that.

21
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:16,721
Such pure green energy.

23
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:32,445
Vozdukh, priyevratis v kulak.

24
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:52,406
- Buffy.
- Keep moving.

25
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:54,484
I can't.

26
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,047
I really hate it when people touch my things.

27
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,405
- Last words, slay-runt?
- Just one.

28
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:15,846
Truck.

29
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:27,131
- No. Not now, you idiot.
- Let go of my body.

30
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:30,687
Oh, God.

31
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:26,161
And then, whoosh! All of a sudden
Glory's standing in front of us,

32
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:30,804
skanky and blonde and thinkin' she's all that
cos some bumpy heads kiss her stinky feet...

33
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:35,284
She does have nice feet. She's coming at us
and Buffy's standing there, not even blinking,

34
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:37,762
like "Bring it on" and... wham!

35
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:41,490
- Hell-bitch in orbit.
- Go, Buff.

36
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:44,133
I knew you'd best Glory.
Our years of training...

37
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:46,488
A truck hit her.

38
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:50,962
You threw it at her?

39
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:54,648
Well, no. She more kind of
waited for it to hit Glory.

40
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:58,851
But then Buffy ran
really fast and we got away.

41
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:02,926
I don't know how. That truck couldn't have
slowed her down for more than a second.

42
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:07,928
Well, how isn't important. All that matters
is that the two of you are safe.

43
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,685
Safe?

44
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:14,972
We've barely managed not getting seriously
dead every time we've crossed paths.

45
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:17,851
Now that she knows that Dawn is the Key...?

46
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:23,732
There must be something in the Book
of Tarnis that we can use against Glory.

47
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:25,531
Piano.

48
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:29,925
Because that's what we used
to kill that big demon that one time.

49
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:33,610
No, that was a rocket launcher.
What are you talkin' about?

50
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:35,968
We should drop a piano on her.

51
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:40,649
It works for that cartoon rabbit running from
that nice man with the speech impediment.

52
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:46,012
Or we could paint a convincing tunnel on the
side of a mountain. Let's just keep thinking.

53
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:50,207
- We'll reassemble at the magic shop, see if...
- Can't fight her.

54
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:54,445
- Well, not yet, no...
- No, not ever. She's too strong, Giles.

55
00:04:55,293 --> 00:05:00,083
We won't win this with stakes, or spells,
or pulling out some uranium power core.

56
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:03,882
She's a god and she's coming for us.
So let's not be here when she knocks.

57
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:06,123
Run away?

58
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,489
Finally, a sensible plan.

59
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:10,962
That's not what she meant.

60
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:13,006
Is it?

61
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:18,247
We can't stay here. She'll just kill us one by
one till there's no one between her and Dawn.

62
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:23,249
We understand the severity of this,
but there must be another...

63
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,972
No. We stay, we die.

64
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,886
Show of hands for that option?

65
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,526
All right. Nobody goes home,
nobody tells anybody we're leaving.

66
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:39,525
Just pack whatever supplies we need
and we're gone.

67
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:43,242
Cool. Don't have to study
for that geometry test.

68
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:48,486
What about wheels? I don't think
everybody'll fit in the Xandermobile.

69
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:52,168
Just get your stuff together.
I'll handle the rest.

70
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:59,686
This is terrible. I'll never be able to mend this.

71
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:03,686
- Not really my colour, anyway.
- Oh, yes. Inappropriate humour.

72
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:08,369
Most amusing. Don't suppose you know
what led to this sartorial tragedy.

73
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:11,931
- That's not how it works.
- Yes. Of course.

74
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:15,085
I just thought maybe after
Her Magnificent Incandescence

75
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:19,883
was returned to this manly and
painfully handsome assemblage,

76
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,093
you might have noticed
something interesting.

77
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:26,210
A Key in human form, perhaps?

78
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:28,887
Lounging about unattended?

79
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:33,967
- If I did, do you really think I would tell you?
- Why do you fight the inevitable?

80
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:37,966
No one can stand against
Her Blindingly Scrumptious Luminescence.

81
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:43,764
Glory. Her name is Glory,
and she's your god, you little scab, not mine.

82
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,970
With all due respect
and fear of sharp objects,

83
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:51,171
you exist, sir,
only because of Her Divine Greatness.

84
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:55,092
You mean Her Divine Failure, don't you?

85
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:03,683
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be normal.

86
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,082
We play the hand we're dealt.

87
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:10,166
Nothing's mine, is it?
This life, this body, it's all infected.

88
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:13,609
The only thing I've ever cared about,
she's taken away from me.

89
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:18,130
- You know why I wanted to be a doctor?
- Flattering drawstring pants?

90
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:23,810
To be close to people. To witness their lives
and their deaths, to be there alongside them,

91
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,202
a part of everyday humanity.

92
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:31,006
- Maybe it's the drugs.
- Drugs, sir?

93
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:33,812
Find the right combination, keep her buried.

94
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:38,091
Impossible. Her Magnificence
can never be fully contained.

95
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:43,566
She is a perfect, all-encompassing light, one
you should feel honoured to be bathed in.

96
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:48,329
I'm thrilled. Especially with the part where
she gets her Key back and I cease to exist.

97
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:52,765
True, this oh-so-appealing form
will of necessity be shrugged off.

98
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:57,165
- Not if I get the Key first.
- And if you did, what then?

99
00:07:57,773 --> 00:07:59,923
Could you do it?

100
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:04,208
Take a human life with your own hands?

101
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:09,925
Oblivion is such a small inconvenience
in the service of a deity. Accept your fate.

102
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:16,883
I mean, you said it yourself. This life
was never really yours anyway, was it?

103
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:21,967
It doesn't matter how I came by it.
It's mine. And I plan on keeping it.

104
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:28,170
- Anybody else feel that?
- What?

105
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:31,928
- Cold draught of paralysing fear.
- We just need to stay calm.

106
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,847
- Calm. Right.
- We gotta be like Sergeant Rock.

107
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,606
Cool and collected
in the face of overwhelming odds.

108
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:42,402
Overwhelming? How much more
than whelming would that be exactly?

109
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:48,090
Everything will be all right, we just need to
stay here calmly. As soon as Buffy arrives...

110
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:51,969
we'll feel oddly worse.

111
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:08,165
- What's he doing here?
- Just out for ajaunt.

112
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:11,450
- Thought I'd swing by and say howdy.
- Out.

113
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:14,163
- He's here because we need him.
- The hell we do.

114
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:17,768
He's the only one besides me
with any chance of protecting Dawn.

115
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:21,687
- Buffy, come on...
- Look, this isn't a discussion. He stays.

116
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,445
Get over it.

117
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:31,286
Buckle up, kids.
Daddy's puttin' the hammer down.

118
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:38,604
Sign here.

119
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:47,404
OK, that should do it.

120
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:52,403
See? Did I not tell you
how easy it would be for us to...

121
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:58,964
My pen.

122
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,402
The trees are singing water.

123
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,647
- You have him.
- Yes, General.

124
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:26,485
- Our brother has returned to the fold.
- Welcome home, Orlando.

125
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:31,126
I swear by my sword
your sacrifice will not go unavenged.

126
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,565
Shiny.

127
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:37,283
Yes, I suppose it is.

128
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,967
Pretty little girl, she's shiny too.

129
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,641
Watch him, make sure he's comfortable.

130
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,724
So shiny.

131
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:47,523
Pretty little shiny Key.

132
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,089
The Key? You've seen it?

133
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:55,162
Pretty little shiny girl.

134
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:58,966
The monks, they've made it human.

135
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:04,247
We know the Slayer's protecting the Key.
If what Orlando says is true...

136
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,085
- Prepare to advance.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:08,164
We end this now.

138
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:37,083
Shouldn't somebody be asking
"Are we there yet"?

139
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:41,085
Isn't that what
small irritating children do?

140
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:45,331
That kinda only works
if you know where you're going.

141
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,691
Do we know where we're going yet?

142
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:53,322
We'd be somewhere if Captain Slowpoke
would give up the wheel.

143
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,210
Gramps, bloody step on it.

144
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:58,922
Step on what?
I've driven tricycles with more power.

145
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:07,971
- Is anybody else queasy?
- He doesn't travel well. He's like fine shrimp.

146
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:14,090
I should've nicked that Porsche. There's
just enough room for me, you, and big sis.

147
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:18,206
- What?
- Would you give it a rest, or...

148
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:22,730
- Or you'll toss your cookies on my shoes?
- Or you can be undead man walking.

149
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:25,805
See how fast you can hitch a ride
with a flaming thumb.

150
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,804
Fine. Shrimp.

151
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:35,451
That guy is bloodsuckin'
the last nerve outta me.

152
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:39,924
Well, Buffy has a point.
In a confrontation, Spike may prove...

153
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:43,366
useful.

154
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:47,810
I don't know if Buffy's thinkin' too clear
on that one, or anything else right now.

155
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:54,052
- I've never seen her so...
- She's been through more than her fair share.

156
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:57,808
She just needs a chance
to catch her breath, regroup.

157
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,771
- She'll be all right.
- Yeah. She'II...

158
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,602
Yeah.

159
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:12,444
Any luck?

160
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:16,492
If you define luck
as the absence of success, plenty.

161
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:21,642
There's a couple of barrier spells,
but they only work on fixed locus.

162
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:24,770
I haven't found anything
that'll work while we're moving.

163
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:27,003
So pretty. Can I have one?

164
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:30,283
Come on.

165
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:32,807
- Anyone hungry?
- Snacks.

166
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,131
The secret to any successful migration.

167
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:42,084
Who's up for some tasty fried meat products?

168
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:47,368
Tara, no. What did I tell you?

169
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,890
I'm sorry. She didn't mean to.
She doesn't know what she's doing.

170
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,647
- We know.
- No biggie.

171
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,042
The skin's already stopped smokin'.

172
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:03,842
You go ahead and play peekaboo
with Mr Sunshine all you like.

173
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,203
Keeps the ride from getting boring.

174
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:08,648
All the light's gone.

175
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:12,806
No, baby. The light's still outside, OK?

176
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,325
All dark. All dark.

177
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:19,168
- Dark.
- All dark.

178
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:21,565
Soon.

179
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:27,163
Soon. Soon.

180
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:34,847
It's coming. The signs are in alignment.
Soon victory will be in our grasp.

181
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:39,849
All we need do is seize the moment
and squeeze until it bleeds.

182
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:51,851
Hey.

183
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,801
I think Anya's gonna try to cook.

184
00:14:56,213 --> 00:15:00,001
Wanna come watch
the tears and recriminations?

185
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:03,084
Maybe later.

186
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:12,802
Thanks.

187
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,645
For what?

188
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,531
You know. Pretty much everything.

189
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:24,611
Yeah. I'm doin' a greatjob.

190
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:26,684
You are.

191
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:31,489
I'm the Slayer. The Chosen One.

192
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:33,803
All mythic and defender-y.

193
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:38,842
Evil nasties are supposed to flee from me.
Not the other way around.

194
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:43,491
You're not fleeing.
You're moving at a brisk pace.

195
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:47,881
Quaintly referred to in some cultures
as the big scaredy runaway.

196
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:54,762
It's the most amazing thing
anyone's ever done for me.

197
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:01,123
Itjust keeps coming.

198
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:04,610
Glory,

199
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,365
Riley,

200
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:08,091
Tara,

201
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:10,165
Mom.

202
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,688
I know.

203
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:19,207
But there's a bright side.

204
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:24,808
- There is?
- At least things can't get any crazier. Right?

205
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:30,845
You know this is your fault for saying that.

206
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:33,722
Armando.

207
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,842
Bring up the ranks. Advance.

208
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:49,852
- Giles.
- I see them.

209
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:52,288
See who?

210
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:56,648
Arrows. They're throwing arrows.

211
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:03,571
Dawn, get down under the table.

212
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,245
Horsies.

213
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:06,968
Tara.

214
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:11,684
- Weapons?
- Hello. You're driving one.

215
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:14,766
- Don't hit the horsies.
- We won't.

216
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:16,965
Aim for the horsies.

217
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,323
Did we shake 'em?

218
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,203
Stay low.

219
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,045
Watch out for...

220
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:52,289
Now might be a good time
for something heroic.

221
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,403
Xander. Hatch.

222
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,085
Up.

223
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:50,890
- Keep the pressure on.
- I always do, sweet bit.

224
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,203
Not a piano, but hey.

225
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:05,883
Everyone all right?

226
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:36,963
- We gotta find shelter.
- Yeah, bloody quick. I'm burnin' up out here.

227
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,725
Careful.

228
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:49,966
Spike.

229
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:51,725
Careful. Up.

230
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,963
- OK. Will?
- I'm on it.

231
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,444
Careful.

232
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:07,285
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yeah. But Spike's hurt.

233
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,845
- Easy with the delicates.
- They'll heal.

234
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:15,652
Florence bloody Nightingale to the rescue.

235
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:21,609
You have a plan, right? One that doesn't
involve pointy knives and a Winnebago?

236
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:24,526
We'll rest here for a minute,
then we have to move.

237
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:26,683
- Where?
- I don't know.

238
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,162
We can't stay here. It's too close to the wreck.
We're too easy to find.

239
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:33,403
- Buffy.
- Will, how is he?

240
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:37,925
- Will?
- I think I've slowed the bleeding, but...

241
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:41,767
OK, just give me a minute.

242
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:45,844
Dawn, get down.

243
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:55,362
We got company.

244
00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:59,682
And they brought a crusade.

245
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:08,242
- Willow.
- I'm working on it.

246
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:19,846
Go. Come on, let's move.
Come on, move it.

247
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:25,772
Buffy.

248
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,610
The Key.

249
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:06,490
Enemies, fly and fall.
Circling arms, raise a wall.

250
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:17,881
They have the General. Clerics.

251
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:32,292
- Energy barrier. A most powerful one.
- Can it be breached?

252
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:35,763
The witch's magic pales
to the might of our god.

253
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:39,050
The infidel's wall shall tumble before us.

254
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:42,922
Will? How long will it hold?

255
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,841
Half a day, maybe.

256
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:56,487
Or until Heckle and Jeckle
punch a hole through it.

257
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:05,765
So, what's the story
with these role-playing rejects?

258
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,848
Let's find out.

259
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:18,567
You sure Scarface can habla the English?

260
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:20,564
He understands me.

261
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,603
Don't you?

262
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:28,644
- You were warned we would return, Slayer.
- Took you long enough.

263
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:32,963
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of chief?

264
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:35,166
General.

265
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:40,163
In charge of what, getting captured?

266
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,322
You do not frighten me, child.

267
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:47,649
The instrument of chaos must be destroyed.

268
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:53,250
Look at her that way again,
and she will be the last thing you ever see.

269
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,683
As I've been told,
you protect the Key of the Beast.

270
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:04,287
- It's not that simple.
- Yes.

271
00:25:05,813 --> 00:25:09,601
The Key has been transformed,
given breath, life.

272
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:15,522
Yet this makes no difference.
The Key is the link.

273
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,810
The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.

274
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:23,330
She doesn't remember anything
about being this Key you're all looking for.

275
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:28,965
The only thing she remembers is growing up
with a mother and a sister that love her.

276
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:35,208
What kind of god would demand her life
for something that she has no control over?

277
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:38,688
We are not your enemy.

278
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:42,082
Tell your men to stand down.

279
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:45,812
No.

280
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:49,727
It is not her fault. She's human now.

281
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:55,170
The Key is too dangerous
to be allowed to exist,

282
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,290
no matter what form it has been pressed into.

283
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:01,285
I will not let anyone tell me...

284
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:09,008
- What happened?
- I don't know. She just went nuts.

285
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:12,482
Time. Time. Time.

286
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:14,891
Tara?

287
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:19,885
Tara.

288
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:24,806
We have to do something.
She can'tjust stay this way.

289
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:27,691
- Buffy.
- Time. Time. Time.

290
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:32,491
Time. Time.

291
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,642
No, it's not time for your med.
Just lie back and...

292
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:45,083
- Doctor. Doctor McCarthy.
- Time.

293
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:00,484
- It's time.
- No.

294
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:06,324
There's nothing to fear, my brother.
The Beast may have taken your mind,

295
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:10,167
but I swear to you,
she will never know the taste of your heart.

296
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,571
Clerics.

297
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:22,087
I want the witch's barrier down.

298
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,765
Now.

299
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:31,326
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

300
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:35,882
We should've stayed.
If we had, none of this would have happened.

301
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:37,565
Don't.

302
00:27:39,653 --> 00:27:44,010
What you did was necessary.

303
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:48,366
What I've always admired.

304
00:27:48,453 --> 00:27:50,728
Running away?

305
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:54,089
Being able to place your heart above all else.

306
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:01,043
I'm so proud of you.

307
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:03,883
You've come so far.

308
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:08,041
You're everything a watcher...

309
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:12,002
everything I could have hoped for.

310
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:35,452
Willow.

311
00:28:36,693 --> 00:28:38,843
Open a door.

312
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:56,045
Speak.

313
00:28:56,133 --> 00:29:01,651
- My friend was hurt when you attacked us.
- Ten of my men are dead. Honourable men.

314
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:04,293
Shall we balance the scale?

315
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:07,331
Will you let someone
come and help him or not?

316
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,722
Give quarter to an agent of the Beast?

317
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:12,964
What madness
would move me to such action?

318
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:15,521
- I'm done asking.
- Whoa.

319
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:19,328
This is war, isn't it?

320
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:25,325
And if there's one thing I've learned from
Sergeant Rock, it is in war, there are rules.

321
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:30,362
Or at least there should be, if you're
as honourable as you think you are.

322
00:29:30,453 --> 00:29:33,445
Plus, we do have
your General Forehead Guy.

323
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:39,803
Discharge and bring life.

324
00:29:44,253 --> 00:29:46,562
Handier than a Swiss knife.

325
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:51,643
Look, the door to my crypt's got
this nasty squeak, maybe you could...

326
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:54,201
Hey. It's Buffy.

327
00:29:54,973 --> 00:29:57,885
I need to ask you a really big favour.

328
00:30:17,453 --> 00:30:20,604
You forgot to mention
the costume party outside.

329
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:24,169
Sorry. I didn't know who else to call.

330
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:28,087
No, it's OK. I mean, yeah,
not how I pictured seeing you again,

331
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:30,528
but I'll take what I can get.

332
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,208
Thank you for coming.

333
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:39,884
My pleasure.

334
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:56,128
I think I got him stabilised, but there's a lot
of damage. We need to get him outta here.

335
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:59,842
I think the guys with the pointy swords
kinda have other ideas.

336
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:02,242
Don't they always.

337
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,131
I know this must seem
extra Outer Limits to you.

338
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:07,602
I've seen things you wouldn't believe.

339
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:12,050
You know, emergency room,
full moon on a Saturday night.

340
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:16,411
Look, if this gets too weird,
just tell me. I'll understand.

341
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:20,930
Don't worry about me. I won't leave
until I've worn out my welcome.

342
00:31:46,253 --> 00:31:47,845
Thanks.

343
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:53,532
You know, those things'll kill you.

344
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:56,564
Oh. Right.

345
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:02,291
I mention today how much I don't like you?

346
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:06,524
Might've let it slip in once or twice.

347
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:12,048
How're your feelers?

348
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:18,331
It's nothing compared to the little bits we'll
get chopped into when they kick the door in.

349
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:22,042
- And here we bloody sit.
- It's not like we got much of a choice.

350
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:27,161
We could make a break for it. Use General
Armour-All as a shield, get to the doc's car...

351
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:31,405
Great plan. While all the hacking and
slashing's goin' on, what are you gonna do?

352
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:34,610
- Throw migraines at 'em?
- Look, we stay here, we all die.

353
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:39,892
- At least this way, some of us might get...
- No. We're all gonna make it.

354
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:42,168
I'm not losing anyone.

355
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:47,245
Check the supplies. See if anyone's hungry.

356
00:32:56,133 --> 00:33:00,923
Dissension in the ranks.
Seldom a harbinger of glad tidings.

357
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:07,084
Shut up.

358
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,922
Poor frightened girl.

359
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:15,289
You've no idea what
you've gotten yourself into.

360
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:18,968
- Why don't you tell me?
- Would it make a difference?

361
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,928
What do you know of the Beast?

362
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:25,481
Strong. Fast. Hell god.

363
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:31,243
- From a dimension of unspeakable torment.
- A demon dimension. I know.

364
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,969
She ruled with two other Hell gods.

365
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:39,252
They were a triumvirate of suffering
and despair. Ruling with equal vengeance.

366
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:43,611
But the Beast's power grew beyond
even what they could conceive.

367
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:46,571
As did her lust for pain and misery.

368
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:50,726
They looked upon her,
what she had become, and trembled.

369
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,893
- A god afraid?
- Such was her power.

370
00:33:56,253 --> 00:34:00,212
They feared she would attempt to seize
their dimension for herself,

371
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:03,888
and decided to strike first.
A great battle erupted.

372
00:34:04,853 --> 00:34:08,129
In the end,
they stood victorious over the Beast.

373
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,011
Barely. She was cast out.

374
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:14,449
Banished to this lower plane of existence,

375
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:19,846
forced to live and eventually die
trapped within the body of a mortal.

376
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,369
A newborn male, created as her prison.

377
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:26,445
That is the Beast's only weakness.

378
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:29,411
Kill the man and the god dies.

379
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:35,451
Unfortunately, the identity of
the human vessel has never been discovered.

380
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:40,766
I don't understand. I've seen Glory. Not
a lot goin' on in the hairy-chest department.

381
00:34:40,853 --> 00:34:45,324
You have seen a glimpse of the true Beast.
Her power was too great to be contained.

382
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:49,201
She's found a way to escape
her mortal prison for brief periods

383
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:55,732
before her energies are exhausted and she's
forced back into her cell of meat and bone.

384
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:57,769
What about me?

385
00:34:57,853 --> 00:35:00,413
- What about the Key?
- Dawn.

386
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:06,290
- I want to know.
- The Key is almost as old as the Beast itself.

387
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:11,731
Where it came from, how it was created:
the deepest of mysteries.

388
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:15,772
All that is certain is that its power is absolute.

389
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:20,324
Countless generations of my people
have sacrificed their lives in search of it,

390
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:23,689
to destroy it
before its wrath could be unleashed.

391
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:28,642
- But the monks found it first.
- Yes, and hid it with their magics.

392
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:31,486
Why didn't they just destroy it?
If it's so dangerous...

393
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:36,488
They were fools. They thought they could
harness its power for the forces of light.

394
00:35:36,573 --> 00:35:39,724
They failed, and paid with their blood.

395
00:35:39,813 --> 00:35:42,122
What do I do?

396
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,363
What was I created for?

397
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:48,844
You were created to open
the gates that separate dimensions.

398
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:52,332
The Beast will use your power to return home

399
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:55,689
and seize control of the Hell
she was banished from.

400
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:00,044
That's it?

401
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:03,603
That's Glory's master plan? To go home?

402
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:06,322
You misunderstand.

403
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:10,372
Once the Key is activated, it won'tjust
open the gates to the Beast's dimension.

404
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,648
It's going to open all the gates.

405
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:15,770
The walls separating realities will crumble.

406
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:18,048
Dimensions will bleed into each other.

407
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:22,331
Order will be overthrown
and the universe will tumble into chaos.

408
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,485
All dark. For ever.

409
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:30,809
That is what you were created for.

410
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:39,168
Dawn.

411
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,564
You think it's true?

412
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:45,924
What he said?

413
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:56,564
I don't know.

414
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:00,962
Destroyer of the universe.

415
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:06,083
Guess cutting school
doesn't seem so bad now.

416
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:09,531
It's not you. You know that.

417
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:13,643
But it's in me, isn't it?

418
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:16,884
It's inside me.

419
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:24,403
What are we gonna do?

420
00:37:27,893 --> 00:37:30,487
I won't let anything happen to you.

421
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:35,164
I promise.

422
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:42,165
Wriggling.

423
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:45,811
Come on, Tara, you have to eat something.

424
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:49,169
- Want me to try?
- I don't know.

425
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:52,643
I'm gettin' used to pickin' food out of my hair.

426
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:55,285
You.

427
00:37:57,813 --> 00:38:00,486
You are not a part of this, are you?

428
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:04,644
- Just a friend of the family.
- Would you die for them?

429
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:11,966
That is what will happen if you align yourself
with the Slayer and her misguided people.

430
00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:16,167
It's my life, and I'll do what I please with it.

431
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,562
It's notjust your life.

432
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:23,443
Unimaginable legions will perish,
including everyone here.

433
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:27,813
You can stop this.

434
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:30,691
You can save all their lives by ending one.

435
00:38:31,253 --> 00:38:33,403
The little girl.

436
00:38:33,493 --> 00:38:39,284
The Key. Destroy it, and the will of the Beast
will be broken, she will fade.

437
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:42,004
A distant memory.

438
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:45,565
And all of this madness will end.

439
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:57,567
- Sorry.
- Is...

440
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:02,563
- Is he gonna be OK?
- He was hurt pretty bad, Dawn.

441
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:07,761
It's because of me.

442
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:11,683
- It's all my fault.
- No, it isn't.

443
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:15,041
You don't know what's happening.

444
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:17,684
I don't have to.

445
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:23,644
I just know that sometimes
terrible things happen to good people.

446
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:26,452
It shouldn't, but it does.

447
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:29,763
It's nobody's fault.

448
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,933
It's just the way life is.

449
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:43,123
Is that gonna help?

450
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,445
Ben?

451
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,848
- You have to let me out.
- Ben?

452
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:57,925
- I gotta get out. Open a door now.
- What happened?

453
00:39:58,013 --> 00:40:00,481
- I don't know, he just freaked out.
- Let me out.

454
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:02,962
- OK. Will, open a door.
- No.

455
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,609
What do you know?
Little Ben finally did something right.

456
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:16,490
The Beast.

457
00:40:16,573 --> 00:40:18,564
Hey, it's Gregor.

458
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:24,932
Now it's not.

459
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:39,601
Buffy.

460
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:45,764
- The Beast. Prepare to attack.
- Great.

461
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,404
Attack.

462
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:52,485
Dawn.

463
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:59,012
Willow. Get it down, now.

464
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:01,249
Hear my plea.

465
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,722
Circling arms protecting me.

466
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:14,891
We have to...

467
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:23,684
The Beast.

468
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:29,604
The car. Get the keys.

469
00:41:32,613 --> 00:41:36,925
Buffy, we have to find Dawn.
We can't let Glory...

470
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:39,804
Buffy. Buffy.

471
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,372
Buffy, you have to get up. We need you.

472
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,324
Buffy, please.

473
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,605
Buffy...

474
