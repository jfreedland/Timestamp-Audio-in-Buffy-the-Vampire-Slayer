00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:03,931
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:08,052
You are the Slayer.
Into each generation a slayer is born.

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,442
- Let's start with "Hi, I'm Buffy".
- Xander.

4
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:11,568
- Cordelia.
- Willow?

5
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:13,245
- Mr Giles.
- Angel.

7
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:06,167
Gave me a pretty good run there.

8
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,244
Bet the blood's just pumpin'.

9
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:13,046
- Bet it's hot.
- Don't hurt me.

10
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,769
Don't hurt you?

11
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:19,450
What's going on?

12
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,689
Help me. Call the police.

13
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:26,686
- Get outta here, girl.
- Are you guys havin' a fight?

14
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:29,241
Cos, you know, fighting's not cool.

15
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:34,211
- Get out of here.
- No, she wants to stay.

16
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,403
I don't mind a little appetiser.

17
00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:43,324
Have you ever heard the expression
"Biting off more than you can chew"?

18
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,165
OK.

19
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:47,972
How about the expression "vampire slayer"?

20
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:51,762
- What the hell you talkin' about?
- Wow. Never heard that one.

21
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:56,085
OK. How about "Oh, God, my leg"?

22
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,248
Oh, God! My leg!

23
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:04,083
See? Now we're communicating.

24
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:41,927
Wow. Been a long while since
I met one who didn't know me.

25
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,124
You should get home.

26
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:53,245
- How'd you do that?
- It's what I do.

27
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:55,490
But you're just a girl.

28
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,324
That's what I keep saying.

29
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:01,405
- Something goin' on out back?
- Vampire.

30
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:08,766
- Anything?
- Nothing you want to hear.

31
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:12,004
- The ritual is...
- Explain it again.

32
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:15,130
- There's nothing new to...
- Go through it again.

33
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:24,529
The Key was living energy.

34
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:30,165
It needed to be channelled, poured
into a specific place at a specific time.

35
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:36,328
The energy would flow into that spot, the
walls between the dimensions break down.

36
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:39,723
It stops, the energy's used up,
the walls come back up.

37
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:43,171
Glory uses that time to get
back into her own dimension,

38
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:47,326
not caring that all manner of Hell will
be unleashed on Earth in the meantime.

39
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:54,326
But only for a little while, right?
The walls come back, no more Hell?

40
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:57,926
That's only if the energy is stopped.

41
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:03,326
And now the key is human, is Dawn...

42
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:10,924
"The blood flows, the gates will open.
The gates will close when it flows no more."

43
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:13,447
When Dawn is dead.

44
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:16,884
I have places to be.

45
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:24,610
Why blood? Why Dawn's blood?

46
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:27,884
I mean, why couldn't it be a lymph ritual?

47
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:31,090
Cos it's always got to be blood.

48
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:35,451
- We're not discussing dinner right now.
- Blood is life, lackbrain.

49
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,603
Why do you think we eat it?

50
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:42,562
It's what keeps you going.
Makes you warm. Makes you hard.

51
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,644
Makes you other than dead.

52
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,285
Course it's her blood.

53
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:52,412
Pretty simple math here. We stop
Glory before she can start the ritual.

54
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:56,281
- We still have a couple of hours.
- If my calculations are right. But...

55
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,489
- I don't wanna hear it.
- I understand that.

56
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:00,723
No, you don't understand.

57
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,883
We are not talking about this.

58
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:06,726
Yes, we bloody well are!

59
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:16,086
If Glory begins the ritual,
if we can't stop her...

60
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:22,809
Come on. Say it.
We're bloody well talking about this.

61
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,084
Tell me to kill my sister.

62
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:30,367
She's not your sister.

63
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:34,653
No. She's not.

64
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,084
She's more than that.

65
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:41,606
She's me.

66
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,082
The monks made her out of me.

67
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:49,047
I hold her, and I feel closer to her than...

68
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:56,603
It's notjust the memories
they built. It's physical.

69
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,482
Dawn is a part of me.

70
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:03,804
The only part that I...

71
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:09,013
We'll solve this. We will.
Don't have another coma, OK?

72
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:15,844
If the ritual starts, every living creature
in this and every other dimension imaginable

73
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,811
will suffer unbearable torment and death.

74
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,010
Including Dawn.

75
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:25,683
Then the last thing she'll see
is me protecting her.

76
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:31,768
You'll fail. You'll die. We all will.

77
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:37,567
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:42,369
I love you all, but I'm sorry.

79
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:50,602
OK. All in favour of
stopping Glory before the ritual.

80
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:54,608
Suggestions? Ideas? Time's a-wastin'.

81
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:57,048
- When you say you love us all...
- Shut up.

82
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:01,729
Willow, I bet you've got some dark
spell a-brewin'. Make her a toad?

83
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,122
Little hoppy toad?
We hit her with a hammer?

84
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,921
Hoppy toad.

85
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,483
What about Ben? He can be killed, right?

86
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:16,088
I know he's an innocent
but not like Dawn innocent.

87
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:19,531
We could kill a regular guy.

88
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:25,367
God.

89
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,568
It's doubtful he'll surface again
this close to the ritual.

90
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:33,611
We can expect it's Glory we're dealing with.

91
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:38,244
We don't have to kill her. We just
have to stop her from doing the ritual.

92
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,245
There's only the one time
that she can do it, right?

93
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,042
Yeah. We get her on the ropes,
we keep her occupied till it's too late.

94
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:48,125
OK. But I'm still not hearing enough ideas.

95
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:52,491
- She's a god. Let's think outside the box.
- You go think outside the bleeding box.

96
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:57,601
Yes, Anya. Apart from your uninfectious
enthusiasm, have you anything to contribu...

97
00:08:57,693 --> 00:09:00,685
- The Dagon Sphere.
- Sorry?

98
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:02,605
When Buffy first met Glory,

99
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:06,606
she found that magical glowy sphere
that was meant to repel Glory.

100
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:11,164
We've got it in the basement.
It might drive her away or hurt her.

101
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:15,649
And Olaf the troll god's enchanted hammer.

102
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,201
You wanna fight a god,
use the weapon of a god.

103
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:20,609
Nah. That thing's too heavy to...

104
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,082
Yeah. Good.

105
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:26,212
- I like this. Thanks.
- Here to help. Wanna live.

106
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:28,363
Smart chicks are so hot.

107
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:33,163
You couldn't have
figured that out in tenth grade?

108
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:37,926
Well, we have some ideas if we could
actually get Glory on the run, but...

109
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:40,573
But we still have no idea how to find her.

110
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:45,090
Big day. It calls me. I have to be there.

111
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,166
Big day.

112
00:09:56,733 --> 00:10:01,488
They said you have to
put this on for the ceremony.

113
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,610
What if I don't?

114
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:10,045
- Come on. Just...
- What if I don't like the colour?

115
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:13,842
Look, I wish there was another way.

116
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:17,812
And I wish you'd fall on your head
and drown in your own barf, so...

117
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,487
I guess we're both disappointed.

118
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,609
I think it'll be quick.

119
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:27,886
Actually, sir, the bleeding is quite
a slow process to give the portal time to...

120
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:30,487
Thank you for the information.

121
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,691
- I'll do what I can...
- Change.

122
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:38,482
- What?
- Change. Be her. I don't wanna look at you.

123
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:41,041
- Dawn, I don't think you wanna...
- Be Glory.

124
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,322
Be Glory.

125
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:48,247
Will you just stop... shouting already?

126
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:57,051
So, what's the hubbub, bub?
What do you got against old Benjy?

127
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:01,044
He's a monster.

128
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:04,209
At least you're upfront about it.

129
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:07,011
Don't be so hard on the boy.

130
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:11,891
He just wants to live.
Most guys'd do the same.

131
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:17,491
Besides, he's probably the reason your sis
and her little cartoon pals are still alive.

132
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:22,442
That little nagging pinch of humanity that
makes me go for the hurt instead of the kill.

133
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:25,088
Lowering myself
to trade blows with the Slayer

134
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:28,324
when I should have just
put my fist through her heart.

135
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:30,404
It's gotta be Ben.

136
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,768
Or maybe you just can't take her.

137
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,803
Funny thing.
You've been here a few hours,

138
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:44,203
and I haven't seen big sis
galloping in to save you.

139
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:47,126
She probably knows
what a terrible mistake that'd be.

140
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:49,044
She's not afraid of you.

141
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:52,682
No, sweetie, baby.
I'm talking about the ritual.

142
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:59,889
Cos, you know, I bleed you,
the portals open, but once you die they close.

143
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:03,124
The faster you die,
the better for your sorry species.

144
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:07,252
I'm bettin' Buffy knows that.

145
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:12,043
Since she's not really your sister,
I'm guessin' she isn't gonna show.

146
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:16,648
And if she does, it might not be to save you.

147
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:25,844
Buffy.

148
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:38,131
- Sure you're not gonna tire yourself out?
- I'm sure.

149
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,891
We're still working on ideas.

150
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:48,402
Time's short, but best
leave it to the last moment.

151
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:53,283
If we go in too early and she takes us out,
no chance of getting her to miss her window.

152
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,931
Then we wait.

153
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:01,323
I imagine you hate me right now.

154
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,723
- I love Dawn.
- I know.

155
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:15,168
But I've sworn to protect this sorry world.

156
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:21,203
Sometimes that means saying
and doing what other people can't.

157
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,169
What they shouldn't have to.

158
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:30,007
You try and hurt her,
and you know I'll stop you.

159
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,085
I know.

160
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:45,807
This is how many apocalypses for us now?

161
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:52,484
Six at least.

162
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,044
Feels like a hundred.

163
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:02,332
I've always stopped them. Always won.

164
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:04,404
Yes.

165
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,406
I sacrificed Angel to save the world.

166
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:12,004
I loved him so much.

167
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:17,242
But I knew what was right.

168
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:21,804
I don't have that any more.

169
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:25,364
I don't understand.

170
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:30,886
I don't know how to live in this world
if these are the choices.

171
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:34,887
If everything just gets stripped away,

172
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,164
I don't see the point.

173
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,604
I just wish...

174
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,567
I just wish my mom was here.

175
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:04,402
The spirit guide told me
that death is my gift.

176
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:09,323
Guess that means a slayer
really is just a killer after all.

177
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:13,642
- I think you're wrong about that.
- It doesn't matter.

178
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:17,206
If Dawn dies, I'm done with it.

179
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:20,882
I'm quitting.

180
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:36,002
Everything is prepared.

181
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:42,367
OK, campers, it's almost stab time.

182
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:45,251
You two, get her.

183
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,850
No.

184
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,924
Buffy!

185
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:53,208
See you in a few.

186
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,807
Any luck? Have you
found the Dagon Sphere?

187
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,328
I'm sure it's here. Just be a minute.

188
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:28,372
Yeah, we're on it. Let's look over here,
where we didn't look yet.

189
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:32,332
- Time is a factor.
- Yes. Not to worry.

190
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:40,408
So, are you more relaxed?

191
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:42,131
No.

192
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:48,482
No? I mean, it sounded like you arrived.

193
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,564
No. Yes.

194
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:55,570
I had the pleasure moment, and
the blissful calm that comes right after it.

195
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:58,451
But it lasted two seconds
and now I'm terrified again.

196
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,524
Well, you don't have to be.

197
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:03,847
What?

198
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:08,606
Spike's sex-bot. Why didn't they
just melt it down into scrap?

199
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:12,044
Maybe Willow wanted it.

200
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,601
I don't think Willow feels
that way about Buffy.

201
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:20,686
- She's gone through a lot of changes, but...
- To study it.

202
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:24,482
Right. Robotics. Science.

203
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:29,843
- Pervert.
- Other pervert.

204
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,842
And don't frighten me like that.

205
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,925
God, who would put
something like that there?

206
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,481
Is this supposed to be
some sort of sickjoke?

207
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,643
I mean, things aren't bad enough?

208
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:44,402
This is an omen.

209
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:47,286
No, it's an omen.

210
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:51,605
It's a higher power, telling me through
bunnies that we're all gonna die. Oh, God.

211
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,491
No, it's not.

212
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,609
It's OK.

213
00:17:56,693 --> 00:18:00,891
No. You see, usually when
there's an apocalypse, I skedaddle.

214
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:03,931
But now I love you so much
I have inappropriately timed sex,

215
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:09,007
try to think of ways to fight a god, and worry
terribly that something might happen to you,

216
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:11,084
and also that something'll happen to me.

217
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:15,803
I have guilt that I'm not more worried about
everyone else, but I just don't have enough.

218
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:22,207
I'm on total overload, and I don't think that
I could be more nervous than I am right now.

219
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:24,284
Care to wager on that?

220
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:34,130
Anya, you wanna marry me?

221
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:42,810
- Can I take that as a maybe?
- You're proposing to me.

222
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:44,208
Yes.

223
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:46,728
You're proposing to me cos we're gonna die.

224
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:49,122
And you think it's romantic and sexy,

225
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,922
and you know you won't have to go through
with it cos the world's gonna end.

226
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:57,689
- I'm proposing to you, Anya, because it's not.
- You can't know that.

227
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,841
I believe it. And I think
we're gonna get through this.

228
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,086
I think I'm gonna live a long and silly life,

229
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:09,609
and I'm not interested in
doing that without you around.

230
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:17,124
- OK.
- OK?

231
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:21,092
Yes. I mean, yes.

232
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:27,527
- No.
- No?

233
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,282
After.

234
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:33,845
Give it to me when the world doesn't end.

235
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:44,361
- What have you got for me?
- Some ideas. Well, notions.

236
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:47,490
Or theories based on wild speculation.

237
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:50,770
Did I mention I'm not good under pressure?

238
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:53,287
I need you, Will. You're my big gun.

239
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:57,810
I'm your... No, I was never a gun.
Someone else should be the gun.

240
00:19:57,893 --> 00:20:01,203
I could be a cudgel. Or a pointy stick.

241
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,007
You're the strongest person here.

242
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,812
- You know that, right?
- No.

243
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:11,442
Will, you're the only person
that's ever hurt Glory. At all.

244
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:16,731
You're my best shot at getting her on the
ropes, so don't get ajelly belly on me now.

245
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:20,806
Well, I do sort of have this one idea.

246
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:25,967
But, last few days, I've mostly been
looking into ways to help Tara.

247
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:28,886
I know that shouldn't be my priority...

248
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:32,322
Of course it should.

249
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:36,325
Well, I've been charting their essences.
Mapping out.

250
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:42,522
I think, if I can get close enough,
I may be able to reverse what Glory did,

251
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:45,173
take back what she took from Tara.

252
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:49,041
It might weaken Glory,
or make her less coherent.

253
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,363
Or it might make all our heads explode.

254
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:54,167
Buffy?

255
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:56,764
I'll try to work it.

256
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,892
Don't worry, love. It won't be long.

257
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:09,245
Bitch. I'm supposed to work on the factors.

258
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:13,244
I'm not...

259
00:21:18,573 --> 00:21:20,564
I'm gonna bring you back.

260
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:26,849
No, that's good. That could be pivotal.

261
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:29,208
- Thank you, guys.
- You're gonna need some...

262
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,648
- Way ahead of you. We have time?
- If you hurry.

263
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,769
OK. I'll grab some weapons too.

264
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:37,812
- I'm looking for something in a broadsword.
- Don't swing that thing near me.

265
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,965
- I happen to be...
- A glorified bricklayer?

266
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:44,807
- I'm also a swell bowler.
- Has his own shoes.

267
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:49,364
- The gods themselves do tremble.
- Spike, shut your mouth. Come with me.

268
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:57,647
Weapons are by the TV.
I'll grab the stuff upstairs.

269
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:00,244
Buffy...

270
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:07,606
If you wannajust hand them
over the threshold...

271
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,488
Come in, Spike.

272
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,771
Presto. No barrier.

273
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,083
I won't bother with the small stuff.

274
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:33,327
Couple of good axes should hold off Glory's
mates while you take on the lady herself.

275
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:37,125
We're not all gonna make it. You know that?

276
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:40,447
Yeah.

277
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:44,082
Always knew I'd go down fightin'.

278
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:47,729
I'm counting on you to protect her.

279
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:52,171
Till the end of the world.

280
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:54,448
Even if that happens to be tonight.

281
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:58,443
I'll be a minute.

282
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:03,923
I know you'll never love me.

283
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:09,088
I know that I'm a monster.

284
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:12,643
But you treat me like a man. And that's...

285
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:18,044
Get your stuff. I'll be here.

286
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:39,764
She will come to you soon.

287
00:23:51,773 --> 00:23:54,162
We on schedule?

288
00:23:54,253 --> 00:23:56,289
Yes, it's time.

289
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:58,364
Will?

290
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,484
Tara, baby?

291
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,324
Is there somewhere you should be?

292
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:13,282
They held me down.

293
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:17,082
No one's holding you. It's the big day, right?

294
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:21,569
Do you wanna go?

295
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:32,451
You're a killer.

296
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,524
This is all set down.

297
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:40,763
Stay close but don't crowd her.
We'll follow in a minute.

298
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:45,290
Everybody knows theirjobs.
Remember, the ritual starts - we all die.

299
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:49,206
And I'll kill anyone who comes near Dawn.

300
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:56,129
Well, not exactly the
St Crispin's Day speech, was it?

301
00:24:56,933 --> 00:25:01,768
- We few. We happy few.
- We band of buggered.

302
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:40,089
- Shpedoinkel.
- What is that?

303
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,933
The portal must open up there.

304
00:25:43,573 --> 00:25:45,768
Will, you're up.

305
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:49,608
Need anything?

306
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:51,684
Could use a little courage.

307
00:25:53,413 --> 00:25:55,165
The real kind.

308
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,847
But thanks.

309
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:18,964
You. What are you doing here?

310
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:22,008
She's with me.

311
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:36,006
What the frickin' hell did that bitch do to me?

312
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,249
You look fine. Truly.

313
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:43,884
She made a little... She made a hole.

314
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:47,568
- I need a brain to eat.
- Take mine, O Groovetastic One.

315
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:50,327
I said a brain, you worthless dirt.

316
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:56,443
Big day. I got places to be.
Big day. Need a brain.

317
00:26:57,973 --> 00:27:00,692
Suppose I could always use yours.

318
00:27:00,773 --> 00:27:02,764
OK, then.

319
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:06,971
Come and get it.

320
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:16,811
You don't seem very well.

321
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:20,522
Your little witch bitch
gave me kind of a headache there.

322
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:23,483
But if you think this is gonna last...

323
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:27,242
I notice you're talking, whereas
in your position, I would attack me.

324
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,328
O, Most Sweaty-Naughty-Feelings-Causing
One, should we...

325
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:33,290
Go guard the girl.

326
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:36,729
- This is a...
- Diversionary tactic?

327
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:39,122
Go guard.

328
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:48,365
It's strange. You're not
as blurry with speed as usual.

329
00:27:48,453 --> 00:27:50,603
- The witch...
- It's not her.

330
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:53,808
Might be this.

331
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:56,009
I heard it's supposed to repel you.

332
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:59,369
So my guess is you probably
shouldn't touch it, either.

333
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:06,362
You're gonna wish you...

334
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:14,050
Stand fast. Kill anyone who dares approach.

335
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:17,489
This will be our day of glory.

336
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:19,609
- Well punned.
- Itjust called out to me.

337
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:00,004
Tara.

338
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:15,973
Willow?

339
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:19,768
- Tara?
- Willow...

340
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:25,126
- I got so lost.
- I found you.

341
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,527
I will always find you.

342
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,205
You know what?

343
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:40,169
I'm feeling a little better.
And now I'm a little bored.

344
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:42,562
I'm sorry. Cos you're about...

345
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:49,172
Wow. The Slayer's a robot.

346
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:52,609
Did everybody else know
the Slayer was a robot?

347
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:54,684
Glory?

348
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:01,043
You're not the brightest god in the heavens.

349
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,966
Buffy! I'm up here!

350
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,643
Buffy!

351
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:19,043
No, you don't.

352
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,249
Buffy! I'm up here!

353
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:52,051
Buffy!

354
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:50,412
You lost your hammer, sweetcheeks.
What are you gonna hit me with now?

355
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,452
Whatever's handy.

356
00:32:01,173 --> 00:32:04,131
And the glorified bricklayer picks up a spare.

357
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:11,847
- Has anyone noticed we're going backwards?
- It's crossed my mind.

358
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:17,206
As long as Buffy can keep Glory down
long enough, it doesn't matter.

359
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:19,443
Only a few minutes left to start the ritual.

360
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:29,647
You. You can help me.

361
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:34,485
Untie me. Please. Help me, she's coming.

362
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:40,489
Well, it seems she's running
a bit late, is the thing.

363
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:44,930
And if Her Splendidness
can't be here in time to bleed you...

364
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:49,972
Hey, kid. Wanna see a trick?

365
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:07,048
- How we doing?
- So far it's a tie.

366
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:10,604
We haven't got up to Dawn,
but then neither has anyone else.

367
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:12,846
Someone's up there.

368
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:18,733
- OK, we gotta charge or something.
- We tried that.

369
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:22,931
- Spike, can you hear me?
- Yeah, loud and clear.

370
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:27,212
- Is there someone up there with Dawn?
- Yeah, can't tell who.

371
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:30,172
- Are you talking to us?
- Get up there. Go now.

372
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:34,682
- Yeah, but...
- Go.

373
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:47,244
Well, what do you know?
It's just about that time.

374
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,561
Spike.

375
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:51,728
Doesn't a fella stay dead when you kill him?

376
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:54,289
Look who's talking.

377
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:57,490
Come on, Doc. Let's you and me have a go.

378
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:01,851
I do have a prior appointment.

379
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,962
- This won't take long.
- No, I don't imagine it will.

380
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:17,647
You're just a mortal.
You couldn't understand my pain.

381
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:21,610
Then I'll just have to settle for causing it.

382
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:27,405
- You can't kill me.
- No. But my arm's not even tired yet.

383
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:33,321
You don't come near the girl, Doc.

384
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:37,452
I don't smell a soul anywhere on you.
Why do you even care?

385
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,331
I made a promise to a lady.

386
00:34:46,613 --> 00:34:49,411
Then I'll send the lady your regrets.

387
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:53,084
No.

388
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:55,844
No.

389
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:04,529
- Stop it.
- You're a god.

390
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:08,808
Make it stop.

391
00:35:21,573 --> 00:35:23,848
I'm sorry.

392
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:27,964
Tell her it's over. She missed her shot.

393
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:34,284
She goes. She ever, ever comes
near me and mine again...

394
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:36,933
We won't. I swear.

395
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:45,451
I guess we're stuck with each other, baby.

396
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:54,163
Can you move?

397
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:57,204
Need a minute.

398
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:02,287
- She could've killed me.
- No, she couldn't.

399
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:04,364
Never.

400
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:09,846
And sooner or later Glory will re-emerge,
and make Buffy pay for that mercy.

401
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:11,924
And the world with her.

402
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:17,005
Buffy even knows that.
And still she couldn't take a human life.

403
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:22,404
She's a hero, you see.

404
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:27,011
- She's not like us.
- Us?

405
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,165
Shallow cuts.

406
00:36:46,293 --> 00:36:49,729
Shallow cuts.

407
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,804
Let the blood flow free.

408
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,524
- Dawn.
- Buffy.

409
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:01,401
This should be interesting.

410
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,642
- Here.
- Buffy, it hurts.

411
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:11,090
I got it. Come here. You're gonna be OK.

412
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:19,248
- Go.
- Buffy, it's started.

413
00:37:53,413 --> 00:37:55,165
Xander.

414
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:01,529
Anya.

415
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:08,488
- I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter.

416
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:12,122
What are you doing?

417
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:16,243
- I have to jump. The energy.
- It'll kill you.

418
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:20,613
I know.

419
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:23,526
Buffy, I know about the ritual.

420
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:25,888
- I have to stop it.
- No.

421
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,563
I have to. Look at what's happening.

422
00:38:37,453 --> 00:38:39,808
Buffy, you have to let me go.

423
00:38:40,453 --> 00:38:44,890
Blood starts it, and until the blood
stops flowing, it'll never stop.

424
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,044
You know you have to let me.

425
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,404
It has to have the blood.

426
00:38:56,373 --> 00:38:58,125
Cos it's always got to be blood.

427
00:38:58,453 --> 00:39:02,128
It's Summers blood. It's just like mine.

428
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:04,932
She's me. The monks made her out of me.

429
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:07,124
Death is your gift.

430
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:09,926
- Death...
- ..is your gift.

431
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:32,847
- Buffy, no.
- Dawnie, I have to.

432
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:34,889
- No.
- Listen to me.

433
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:37,813
Please, there's not a lot of time, listen.

434
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:26,692
Dawn, listen to me.

435
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:32,126
I love you. I will always love you.

436
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:34,722
This is the work that I have to do.

437
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:51,364
Tell Giles...

438
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:54,727
Tell Giles I figured it out.

439
00:40:54,813 --> 00:40:57,327
And I'm OK.

440
00:41:06,573 --> 00:41:11,010
And give my love to my friends.
You have to take care of them now.

441
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:15,683
You have to take care of each other.

442
00:41:17,493 --> 00:41:19,484
You have to be strong.

443
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:25,126
Dawn, the hardest thing
in this world is to live in it.

444
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,611
Be brave. Live.

445
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:35,172
For me.
