1
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:10,525
You know how I feel about you.
It's... pretty obvious, isn't it?

2
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,778
There's never been
anyone else for me... but you.

3
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:19,533
And we're... good friends
and it's time to take the next step.

4
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:22,661
Would you, uh...

5
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:24,788
date me?

6
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:27,207
Oh, that's good: "Date me."

7
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,376
- It's terrible, right?
- Huh?

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,212
Oh, no. Well, yes. "Date me" is silly.

9
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:37,675
What I should do is just start
with talking about the dance.

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,970
You know, Buffy,
Spring Fling just isn't any dance.

11
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:44,849
It's a time for students to choose a mate,

12
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:48,731
and then we can...
observe their... mating rituals

13
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,587
and tag them before they migrate.

14
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:53,523
- Just kill me!
- You're doing fine.

15
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:55,679
Why is it so hard?
I should just walk up to her and say:

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,638
"Hey, I like you.
Let's go to the dance together."

17
00:00:57,673 --> 00:01:00,656
- Direct and to the point.
- I'm ready.

18
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,325
I wanna do it now. I gotta do it now.

19
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:06,994
Buffy's not here.
You can practise on me some more.

20
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:10,581
No, I can't wait till tomorrow.
I'll be thinking about it too much.

21
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:12,750
Why didn't Buffy show up tonight?

22
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,212
- What's she doing?
- You know. The usual.

23
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:25,178
- What was that?
- What was what?

24
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:40,402
Someone's out there.

25
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:42,945
That's silly. Who would be out there?

26
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,598
Three in one night.

27
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:14,100
Giles would be so proud.

28
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,794
"The Master shall rise."

29
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:46,005
Yes, this is it!

30
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:48,841
"The Master shall rise

31
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:51,217
and the Slayer..."

32
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,932
My God!

33
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:22,081
The stairs. Under the stairs!

34
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:43,934
Yes! Yes! Shake, Earth!

35
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:47,729
This is a sign! We are in the final days!

36
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:50,566
My time has come! Glory!

37
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:51,984
Glory!

38
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:59,408
What do you think? Five point one?

39
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:54,459
<b>"Prophecy Girl"</b>

40
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,173
Morning.

41
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:04,761
Wow. The damage looks fairly structural.
Are we safe in here?

42
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:07,597
Buffy!

43
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,391
What? Do I have something on my face?

44
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:14,519
No... and yes, we're safe.

45
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:18,148
Probably best not to go up there.

46
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:23,153
How're you doin', Giles?
Get much sleep last night?

47
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:26,114
I've been working.

48
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:30,076
Me too. I went hunting last night
and it is awfully sweet of you to ask.

49
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:32,245
It's getting hairy out there, Giles.

50
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:36,332
I killed three vampires last night. One
of them was practically on school grounds.

51
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:38,960
- Their numbers are increasing.
- And they're getting cockier.

52
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:42,004
Look, I'm not loving it.
Last night was a pretty close call.

53
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:44,422
Yes.

54
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,800
Giles, care?

55
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:49,803
I'm putting my life on the line,
battling the undead.

56
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:53,181
I broke a nail, OK? I'm wearing a press-on.

57
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:56,851
The least you could do
is exhibit some casual interest.

58
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:59,479
You could go "Hm."

59
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,731
Oh, sorry...

60
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:04,858
I'm very glad that you're all right.

61
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:07,111
I need to verify...

62
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:10,239
- I just can't really talk right now.
- Fine.

63
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:13,284
That's OK. I can't put it off any longer.

64
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:16,370
- I have to meet my terrible fate.
- What?

65
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,539
Biology.

66
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:31,342
- Wow, that was boring.
- I don't feel that "boring" covers it.

67
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:33,511
No. "Boring" falls short.

68
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,930
Even I was bored. And I'm a science nerd.

69
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:38,223
- Don't say that.
- I'm not ashamed.

70
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:40,601
It's the computer age. Nerds are in.

71
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:44,521
- They're still in, right?
- Willow, don't you have a thing?

72
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,440
A thing?

73
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:51,284
The thing... that I have...
which is... a thing...

74
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,697
that I have to go to!
See you later.

75
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:57,825
- What on earth is her deal?
- She's Willow.

76
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:00,494
So... Buffy, I wanted to...

77
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,790
There's this thing I wanted to ask you,
to talk to you about.

78
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:07,969
- OK. What's up?
- Let's go over here and sit.

79
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:09,854
- OK. Now you're making me nervous.
- Oh, no, no.

80
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:12,655
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Really. It's silly.

81
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:15,342
Hey! Leave.

82
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:17,093
Thanks.

83
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:21,723
Well?

84
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:31,565
You know, Buffy, Spring Fling is a time
for students to gather and...

85
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:35,027
Oh, God.

86
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,783
Buffy, I want you to go to the dance
with me. You and me, on a date.

87
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,788
I don't know what to say.

88
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:50,667
Well, you're not laughing,
so that's a good start.

89
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:53,670
Buffy, I like you. A lot.

90
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,466
And I know we're friends
and... we've had experiences.

91
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,470
We've fought some bloodsucking fiends,
and that's all been a good time.

92
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:06,629
But I want more.

93
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:09,518
I wanna dance with you.

94
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:13,105
Xander, you're one of my best friends.
You and... Willow.

95
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,899
Well, Willow's not looking to date you.

96
00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:19,486
Or if she is, she's playing it
pretty close to the chest.

97
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,675
I don't wanna spoil
the friendship that we have.

98
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:24,015
I don't wanna spoil it either.

99
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,200
But that's not the point, is it?
You either feel a thing, or you don't.

100
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,335
I don't.

101
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,087
Xander, I'm sorry.

102
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,923
I just don't think of you that way.

103
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,467
Well, try. I'll wait.

104
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:47,470
- Xander...
- No.

105
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:50,307
Forget it.

106
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,183
I'm not him.

107
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:55,853
I guess a guy's gotta be undead
to make time with you.

108
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,731
That's really harsh.

109
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:00,900
Look, I'm sorry.

110
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:03,527
I don't handle rejection well.

111
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:07,156
Funny... considering
all the practice I've had, huh?

112
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:09,283
Xander, I'm sorry. I never...

113
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:11,452
You know what?

114
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:13,620
Let's just not.

115
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,260
Hello. This is Giles.

116
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:33,222
Rupert Giles.

117
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,558
I-I need to see you.

118
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,769
No. I realise that.

119
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:42,856
Come after sundown.
Good. I'll see you then.

120
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,849
You know, that outfit looks
just like the one you wore yesterday -

121
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,033
only wrinklier.
Were you here all night?

122
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:58,287
Sorry, I'm not really
up to socialising just now.

123
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:02,973
Something's going on, Rupert. And
I'm guessing you already know what it is.

124
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,710
What do you know?

125
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:09,548
Well, I have been surfing the Net
looking for unexplained incidents.

126
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:13,552
People are always sending stuff my way.
They know the occult's my turf.

127
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:15,679
Here is the latest.

128
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:20,731
"A cat last week gave birth
to a litter of snakes."

129
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:24,645
"A family was swimming in Whisper Lake
when the lake began to boil."

130
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:30,468
And "Mercy Hospital last night, a boy
was born with his eyes facing inward."

131
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:34,321
I'm not stupid. This is apocalypse stuff.

132
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:37,892
And throw in last night's earthquake,
and I'd say we've got a problem.

133
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:40,687
I would say
the end is pretty seriously nigh.

134
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:42,729
I don't know if I can trust you.

135
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:47,166
I helped cast that demon out of the
Internet. I think that merits some trust.

136
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,419
Look, I'm scared, OK?

137
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:55,258
Plus, I've got this crazy monk e-mailing me
from Cortona about some Anointed One.

138
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:58,302
The Anointed One? He's dead.

139
00:10:58,385 --> 00:11:00,679
- Someone's dead?
- Who is this monk?

140
00:11:01,597 --> 00:11:05,513
Brother Luca something. Keeps sending
out global mailings about a prophecy.

141
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:08,650
I need you to talk to him.
Find out everything he knows.

142
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:10,981
Look, Rupert, you haven't told me jack,
so what's with the order?

143
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:12,941
Just do it!

144
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:15,735
I'll explain later.

145
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:18,496
You'd better.

146
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:21,240
I'll get everything tonight after practice.
The guys'll help me.

147
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:24,152
Well, it's all in the A-V room.
The sound system, and the decorations...

148
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:27,194
And, oh, Aura needs help, uh,
moving the coolers.

149
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:29,438
Don't sweat it!

150
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:33,084
Well, bring everything to the Bronze
and I'll meet you there in the morning.

151
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,222
Done.

152
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:36,880
You're so sweet.
Why are you so sweet?

153
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:40,593
I don't know! 'Cause
I'm usually mean as a snake!

154
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:43,345
Willow!

155
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:45,513
I'll see you in the morning.

156
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:48,225
- I really like your outfit!
- No, you don't.

157
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,477
- No, I really don't. But I need a favour.
- What kind?

158
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,538
Well, the Bronze won't let us
use their sound system,

159
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:55,523
and I need someone who knows
how to hook one up.

160
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:58,817
If you could just show up tomorrow morning,
I'd be really, really grateful.

161
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:01,946
I mean, I'd talk to you
at the dance and everything.

162
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:05,449
- Sure.
- Great. Tomorrow at ten?

163
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,617
Sure.

164
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:12,247
- Hey.
- Hey.

165
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:17,669
- How'd it go?
- On a scale of one to ten? It sucked.

166
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:24,216
Well, I guess it could be worse.
I could have gangrene on my face.

167
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,679
- What did she say?
- Apart from "no", does it really matter?

168
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:32,516
She's still jonesing for Angel.
Couldn't care less about me.

169
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:37,838
- At least now you know.
- Yeah, you're right. The deal's done.

170
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:41,816
The polls are in
and it's time for my concession speech.

171
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:46,913
I know what we'll do. We can go.

172
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:50,257
Be my date. We'll have a great time.
We'll dance, we'll go wild.

173
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:52,159
What do you say?

174
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:54,245
- No.
- Good.

175
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:58,331
- What?
- There's no way.

176
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:00,444
Willow, come on.

177
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,546
You think I wanna
go to the dance with you and

178
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:05,180
watch you wish you were
at the dance with her?

179
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:08,508
Do you think that's my idea of high jinks?

180
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:11,261
You should know better.

181
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:15,806
- I didn't think.
- I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.

182
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,393
I'll see you on Monday.

183
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:23,689
That's OK.

184
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,858
I don't wanna go.

185
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:29,361
I'm just gonna go home, lie down,

186
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:31,864
and listen to country music.

187
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:34,449
The music of pain.

188
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,844
Giles, you are not gonna believe this.

189
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:16,931
It's clear. It's what's gonna happen.
It's happening now.

190
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,016
Angel?

191
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,185
It can't be. You've gotta be wrong.

192
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,151
I've checked it against
all my other volumes. It's very real.

193
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:26,131
Well, there's gotta be some way round it.

194
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,651
Listen, some prophecies are a bit dodgy.
They're mutable.

195
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,279
Buffy herself has thwarted them
time and time again.

196
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:35,782
But this is the Codex. There is
nothing in it that does not come to pass.

197
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:39,244
- Then you're reading it wrong.
- I wish to God I were!

198
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:43,748
But it's very plain. Tomorrow night,
Buffy will face the Master

199
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:48,250
and she will die.

200
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:52,214
Well, have you verified the text?

201
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:11,524
So that's it, huh?

202
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:14,527
I remember the drill.

203
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:19,523
One Slayer dies, the next one's called.

204
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:22,514
I wonder who she is.

205
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:27,606
Will you train her?

206
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:30,959
Or will they send someone else?

207
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:35,680
- Buffy...
- Does it say how he's gonna kill me?

208
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,799
Do you think it'll hurt?

209
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:41,468
Don't touch me!

210
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:47,475
Were you even gonna tell me?

211
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:52,062
I was hoping that I wouldn't have to,
that there was... some way around it.

212
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:56,233
I've got a way around it. I quit.

213
00:15:56,316 --> 00:16:01,154
- It's not that simple.
- I'm making it that simple. I quit!

214
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:03,303
I resign! I'm fired!

215
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:06,368
You can find someone else
to stop the Master from taking over.

216
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:09,870
I'm not sure that anyone else can.
All... the signs indicate...

217
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:11,789
Signs?

218
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:14,917
Read me the signs!

219
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,336
Tell me my fortune!

220
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,297
You're so useful,
sitting here with all your books!

221
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,383
You're really a lot of help!

222
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,886
No, I don't suppose I am.

223
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:30,473
- I know this is hard.
- What do you know about this?

224
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,267
You're never gonna die.

225
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,522
You think I want anything to happen to you?
Do you think I could stand it?

226
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:37,438
We just gotta figure out a way...

227
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:41,869
I already did. I quit, remember?
Pay attention!

228
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,611
Buffy, if the Master rises...

229
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:47,429
I don't care!

230
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:55,055
I don't care.

231
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,300
Giles, I'm 16 years old.

232
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:07,578
I don't wanna die.

233
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,573

Sure.

241
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:21,578
You're probably just full
from that bite of dinner you nearly had.

242
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:24,563
Feel like telling me what's on your mind?

245
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:33,339
- Anywhere. Just for a while. A weekend.
- Honey!

246
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:36,215
No, it'll be great! You and me,
a mother-daughter thing...

247
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:39,003
We can talk about all the embarrassing
things you love to bring up.

248
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,349
- You know the gallery's open on weekends.
- Mom, please.

249
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:45,468
Isn't the prom tomorrow night?

250
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:49,296
Or Spring Fling,
whatever they're calling it?

251
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:52,482
- I guess.
- Nobody asked you?

252
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,529
- Someone.
- But not the right someone.

253
00:18:57,612 --> 00:19:01,366
See, sometimes I actually do know
what you're thinking.

254
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,662
Well, then, uh... This probably
isn't the best time for this but, uh...

255
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,920
I saw you eyeing it at the store.
I figured...

256
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:17,089
Mom, we can't afford this.

257
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:20,675
The way you've been eating,
we can afford it.

258
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,763
It's beautiful.

259
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:27,307
I think you should wear it...
To the dance.

260
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,444
No. I-I can't go to the dance.

261
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,687
Says who? Is it written somewhere?

262
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,941
You should do what you want.
Homecoming, my freshman year of college.

263
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:41,062
I didn't have a date,
so I got dressed up and I went anyway.

264
00:19:41,236 --> 00:19:45,532
- Was it awful?
- It was awful. For about an hour.

265
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:49,563
- Then what happened?
- I met your father.

266
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:52,372
He didn't have a date either?

267
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:54,458
He did. And...

268
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,127
That's a... much funnier story
that you will not get to hear.

269
00:19:58,211 --> 00:20:01,005
Oh, but it was a beautiful night.

270
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:05,635
- And you had your whole life ahead of you.
- Yeah.

271
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:12,574
Must be nice.

272
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:19,314
Kevin said he'd bring everything
to the Bronze last night. He promised!

273
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:21,650
We'll never get everything ready in time!

274
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:25,278
He probably forgot.
It's not that big a deal.

275
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:28,281
You don't understand! I'm not mad.

276
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:33,212
He totally flaked on me. On me!
And I don't even care.

277
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:37,149
God help me, I think it's cute.

278
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,670
There they are!
They're watching cartoons.

279
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:45,339
That's so cu... That's not cute.

280
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:47,215
That's annoying. I'm annoyed.

281
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:49,342
Right. I'm furious.

282
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:52,084
Men! I don't know why
we put up with them.

283
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,221
I hear ya.

284
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:57,767
Obviously, Kevin has underestimated
the power of my icy stare.

285
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:00,812
Oh, my God! Kevin!

286
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:07,359
Kevin!

287
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,222
Buffy!

288
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:40,474
There's something on the news.
Willow!

289
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,311
I've seen so much.

290
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:48,036
I thought I could take anything.

291
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:49,816
But, Buffy...

292
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:53,495
This... This was different.

293
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,864
It'll be all right.

294
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:59,408
I'm trying to think how to say it,

295
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,745
to explain it so you understand.

296
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,873
It doesn't matter as long as you're OK.

297
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:09,001
I'm not OK.

298
00:22:09,085 --> 00:22:11,337
I knew those guys.

299
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,143
I go to that room every day.

300
00:22:15,173 --> 00:22:19,095
And when I walked in there,

301
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:23,473
it wasn't our world any more.

302
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:26,601
They made it theirs.

303
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,263
And they had fun.

304
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:38,265
- What are we gonna do?
- What we have to.

305
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:47,070
Promise me you'll stay in tonight, OK?

306
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:53,042
Buffy.

307
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:57,046
I like your dress.

308
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:04,869
Take care.

309
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:21,903
Soon!

310
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,459
Soon!

311
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:43,715
OK. So this Master guy tried to open
the Hellmouth, but he got stuck in it.

312
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,242
And now all the signs are reading
that he's gonna get out,

313
00:23:46,277 --> 00:23:50,764
which opens the Hellmouth, which
brings the demons, which ends the world.

314
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,767
Yes. That about sums it up, yes.

315
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:58,170
You know, the part that gets me, though,
is where Buffy is the Vampire Slayer.

316
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:59,209
She's so little.

317
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,575
Did you manage to get in touch
with this Brother Luca chap?

318
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,152
As far as I can tell, no one can.

319
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,655
He's disappeared.
Did send out one last global, though.

320
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,491
- A short one.
- What did it say?

321
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,219
Isaiah 11:6. Which I dutifully looked up.

322
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:17,547
"The wolf shall live with the lamb.
The leopard shall lie down with the kid."

323
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,708
"The calf, the lion
and the fatling together,"

324
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,377
"and the little child to lead them."

325
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,886
It's kind of warm and fuzzy
for a message of doom.

326
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,250
Well, it all depends
where he's leading them to.

327
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,467
Aurelius wrote of the Anointed One,

328
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,719
"The Slayer will not know him,
and he will lead her into Hell."

329
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:35,597
So Luca thinks the Anointed is a kid.

330
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,262
If the vampire that Buffy killed
was in fact not the Anointed, then

331
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:42,020
it may well be.

332
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:46,900
- Well, then we need to warn her.
- I don't intend involving her at all.

333
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:49,277
What do you mean?

334
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:53,322
Buffy's not going to face the Master. I am.

335
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:55,449
No, you're not.

336
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:59,704
So I'm looking for a kid, huh?
And he'll lead me to the Master?

337
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:01,804
Buffy, I'm not gonna
send you out there to die.

338
00:25:01,805 --> 00:25:04,555
Now, you were right. I-I've waded around
in these old books for so long,

339
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:08,800
I've forgotten what the real world is like.
It's time I found out.

340
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:10,732
You're still not going up
against the Master.

341
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,495
- I've made up my mind.
- So have I.

342
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,336
I made up mine first.
I'm older and wiser than you and...

343
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:19,976
Just do what you're told for once!
All right?

344
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:23,718
That's not how it goes.
I'm the Slayer.

345
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:27,579
I don't care what the books say.
I defy prophecy and I'm going.

346
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:29,982
There's nothing you can say
will change my mind.

347
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:32,109
I know.

348
00:25:45,747 --> 00:25:48,249
When he wakes up, tell him...

349
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,252
I don't know.

350
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:54,881
Think of something cool.
Tell him I said it.

351
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:58,634
You fight the Master and you'll die.

352
00:25:58,718 --> 00:26:01,511
Maybe.

353
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:04,823
Maybe I'll take him with me.

354
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:28,662
Help me.

355
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:38,004
It's OK. I know who you are.

356
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:55,062
She what?!

357
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:57,189
I told you there was something
going on with her.

358
00:26:57,224 --> 00:27:00,109
And she knew
about this prophecy of yours?

359
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:03,570
- Oh, man. What do we do?
- We stay calm. First thing.

360
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:05,781
- Calm?
- I think he's right.

361
00:27:05,864 --> 00:27:08,589
I'm sorry, calm may work
for Locutus of the Borg here,

362
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,067
but I'm freaked out,
and I intend to stay that way.

363
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:11,828
- Xander...
- How could you let her go?

364
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:15,835
As the soon-to-be-purple area of my jaw
will attest, I did not "let" her go!

365
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,071
Well, how can we help her?

366
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:20,849
Uh, I'm sorry to bring this up, but we
also have an apocalypse to worry about?

367
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:23,495
- Do you mind?
- How come she's in the club?

368
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:27,253
Hey! Once the Master gets free,
the Hellmouth opens,

369
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:29,261
the demons come to party,
and everybody dies.

370
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:32,348
I don't care. I'm sorry. I don't.

371
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:36,017
- Right now, I gotta help Buffy.
- We don't even know where she's gone.

372
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:40,001
No. But I can find out.

373
00:28:14,187 --> 00:28:17,348
Well, look who's here.

374
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:19,850
Mind if I come in?

375
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,935
- Make yourself at home.
- She's gone.

376
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:24,605
- What do you mean?
- Buffy! She's gone to fight the Master.

377
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:28,114
- He'll kill her.
- Rumour has it.

378
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:29,693
Only we're not gonna let it happen.

379
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,820
What do you propose we do about it?

380
00:28:31,904 --> 00:28:35,073
Look, I know
you can find this Master guy.

381
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:37,825
He's underground, right?
Take me to him.

382
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:40,661
You're way out of your league, kid.

383
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:45,041
The Master'll kill you before you can
even breathe, if you're lucky.

384
00:28:47,668 --> 00:28:49,879
How can I say this clearly?

385
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,592
I don't like you.

386
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:59,054
At the end of the day,
I pretty much think you're a vampire.

387
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:02,933
But Buffy's got
this big old yen for you.

388
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:06,186
She thinks you're a real person.

389
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:08,647
And right now,
I need you to prove her right.

390
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,473
You're in love with her.

391
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:14,402
Aren't you?

392
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:17,196
The Master is as old
as any vampire on record.

393
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,491
There's no telling how powerful he'll be
if he reaches the surface.

394
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:22,660
OK. Here's my question.

395
00:29:22,743 --> 00:29:24,829
The Hellmouth opens.

396
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:26,789
Yes.

397
00:29:27,414 --> 00:29:28,665
Where?

398
00:29:28,748 --> 00:29:32,711
If he's underground and it's right
where he is, where's it gonna open?

399
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:36,715
Good point. Look, you have a look
through the "Black Chronicles".

400
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:37,884
Willow.

401
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,380
- Willow!
- Huh?

402
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:42,168
Could you look through
the local histories, please?

403
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:46,432
Check for any common denominators,
locations of incidents and such.

404
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:48,517
Right. OK.

405
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:29,556
Welcome.

406
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:33,935
Thanks for having me.

407
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:37,730
You know you really ought to
talk to your contractor.

408
00:30:37,813 --> 00:30:41,233
- Looks like you got some water damage.
- Oh, good.

409
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:45,321
The "feeble banter" portion of the fight.
Why don't we just cut to the...

410
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:51,035
Nice shot.

411
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:57,165
This way. What?

412
00:30:57,248 --> 00:30:59,042
- You're looking at my neck.
- What?

413
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,044
- You checked out my neck.
- No.

414
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,504
Keep your distance.

415
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:07,008
- I wasn't looking at your neck!
- I told you to eat before we left.

416
00:31:07,884 --> 00:31:10,637
You're not going to kill me
with that thing.

417
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,975
Don't be so sure.

418
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:15,291
You still don't understand
your part in all this, do you?

419
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:19,895
You are not the hunter.

420
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,898
You are the lamb.

421
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:27,301
Now let's think about this.
Vampires have been gathering.

422
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:30,988
They know he's coming.
They will be his army.

423
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,631
Do you think they'll
gather at the Hellmouth?

424
00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:35,473
Well, the last time
the Master tried to rise was the Harvest.

425
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:37,912
He sent a bunch of vampires
to get him fresh blood.

426
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:40,707
- Where did that go down?
- The Bronze.

427
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,875
- The prom!
- We have to warn them.

428
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:46,086
No, we'll go. You have to
concentrate on demon killing.

429
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:48,383
- My car's in the lot.
- Stay close together.

430
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:52,050
- And for goodness sake, be careful!
- We will.

431
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:06,313
You know, for someone who's all-powerful,
you sure do like to hide.

432
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:09,066
I'm waiting for you.

433
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,819
I want this moment to last.

434
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:15,072
Well, I don't.

435
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:24,748
I understand.

436
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:30,003
What if they get to the Bronze
before we do?

437
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:33,798
- Don't need to worry about that.
- Why not?

438
00:32:33,882 --> 00:32:37,010
'Cause they're not going to the Bronze.

439
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:11,267
You tried.

440
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,226
It was noble of you.

441
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,231
You heard the prophecy that I was about
to break free and you came to stop me.

442
00:33:18,315 --> 00:33:21,151
But prophecies are tricky creatures.

443
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:23,779
They don't tell you everything.

444
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:28,992
You're the one that sets me free.

445
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:34,914
If you hadn't come, I couldn't go.

446
00:33:36,332 --> 00:33:38,417
Think about that.

447
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,721
Oh, God! The power!

448
00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:57,977
By the way,

449
00:33:58,061 --> 00:34:00,355
I like your dress.

450
00:34:18,997 --> 00:34:21,875
- What was that?
- It's too late. He's gone up.

451
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:54,072
She's dead.

452
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:04,457
- No. She's not dead.
- She's not breathing.

453
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:08,794
But if she drowned, there's a shot. CPR.

454
00:35:08,878 --> 00:35:11,964
You have to do it. I have no breath.

455
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,687
Come on.

456
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:29,272
Come on!

457
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,817
- Why are they coming here?
- Not caring.

458
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,944
Get in!

459
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:43,285
Come on.

460
00:35:45,162 --> 00:35:47,039
Breathe.

461
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:49,332
Breathe!

462
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,627
Come on.

463
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:01,177
Buffy?

464
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:11,144
Buffy?

465
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:15,440
Xander?

466
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:17,609
Welcome back.

467
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:20,036
I was sitting where
Kevin and I used to park,

468
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:23,281
and all of a sudden
these things are coming at me!

469
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:26,492
- What do we do now?
- We've gotta get to the library.

470
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:28,244
Great.

471
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,417
Of course, we generally walk there.

472
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:42,465
What the...?

473
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:57,355
- What's happening?
- Guess!

474
00:37:13,454 --> 00:37:15,705
Why are they coming here?

475
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:36,600
My world.

476
00:37:37,768 --> 00:37:41,271
My beautiful world!

477
00:37:43,273 --> 00:37:45,734
Easy. Easy.

478
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:52,114
- The Master?
- He's gone up.

479
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,535
No. You're still weak.

480
00:37:59,705 --> 00:38:01,707
No.

481
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:03,876
No, I feel strong.

482
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:07,379
I feel different.

483
00:38:10,215 --> 00:38:11,633
Let's go.

484
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,641
They're coming in through the stacks.

485
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:23,978
The bookshelves!

486
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:28,440
My office.

487
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,326
Somebody help!

488
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,828
So, how do you know
where the Master's going?

489
00:38:49,863 --> 00:38:52,046
I know.

490
00:38:57,343 --> 00:38:59,679
Oh, look. A bad guy.

491
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:10,981
You two wait here.
Keep the other vampires off me.

492
00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:14,526
- Angel, better put on your game face.
- I'm ready.

493
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:18,263
One way or another, this won't take long.

494
00:39:28,372 --> 00:39:30,458
See how you like it!

495
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:33,627
This won't keep 'em out for long!

496
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:38,506
Giles!

497
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:47,015
The Hellmouth.

498
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:01,403
Yes!

499
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:04,239
Come forth, my child.

500
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:07,367
Come into my world.

501
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:10,328
I don't think it's yours just yet.

502
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:13,372
You're dead!

503
00:40:13,456 --> 00:40:14,582
I may be dead,

504
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:16,918
but I'm still pretty.

505
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:19,245
Which is more than I can say for you.

506
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,933
You were destined to die!
It was written!

507
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:25,209
What can I say? I flunked the written.

508
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,471
Come here.

509
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:32,974
Giles!

510
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:59,333
Did you really think you could best me
here when you couldn't below?

511
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,046
- You have fruit-punch mouth.
- What?

512
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:10,552
Save the hypnosis crap for the tourists.

513
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:48,421
Where are your jibes now?

514
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:54,217
- Will you laugh when my Hell is on Earth?
- You're that amped about Hell?

515
00:41:55,677 --> 00:41:57,679
Go there!

516
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:34,464
- The vampires?
- Gone.

517
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:38,802
- The Master?
- Dead. The Hellmouth is closed.

518
00:42:39,928 --> 00:42:41,054
Buffy?

519
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,599
Buffy?

520
00:42:44,682 --> 00:42:46,767
Oh, I'm sorry.

521
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:51,814
- It's just been a really weird day.
- Yeah. Buffy died and everything.

522
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:54,384
Wow! Harsh.

523
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:57,754
I should have known
that wouldn't stop you.

524
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:00,628
Well, what do we do now?

525
00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:03,416
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'd like to get out of this place.

526
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:05,493
I don't like the library
very much any more.

527
00:43:05,827 --> 00:43:08,001
Hey, I hear there's a dance
at the Bronze tonight.

528
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,162
- Could be fun.
-Yeah!

529
00:43:10,197 --> 00:43:13,587
- Buffy?
- Sure.

530
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:17,275
We saved the world. I say we party.

531
00:43:19,841 --> 00:43:22,884
I mean... I got all pretty.

532
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:26,611
What about him?

533
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:31,793
He's not going anywhere.

534
00:43:31,828 --> 00:43:33,812
Loser.

535
00:43:37,732 --> 00:43:40,234
- I'm not dancing, though.
- We'll see.

536
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,695
So what's the story with the car?

537
00:43:42,778 --> 00:43:45,114
I'm really, really hungry.

538
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:50,995
- By the way, I really like your dress.
- Yeah, yeah. A big hit with everyone.
