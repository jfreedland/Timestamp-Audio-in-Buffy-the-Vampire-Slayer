1
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:12,135
"And on that tragic day.
an era came to its inevitable end."

2
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:14,933
That's all there is.
Are you ready?

3
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:16,404
Hit me.

4
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,841
Which of the following best expresses
the theme of the passage?

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,377
"A": violence breeds violence...

6
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:23,413
"B": all things must end...

7
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,448
"C"...

8
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:26,005
"B." I'm going with "B."

9
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,983
We haven't had a "B" in forever.

10
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:31,647
This is the S.A.T.s. Buffy. Not
connect-the-dots. Please pay attention.

11
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:35,453
A low score could seriously harm
your chances of getting into college.

12
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:37,494
Gee. Thanks. That takes
the pressure right off.

13
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:40,121
This isn't meant to be easy. You know.
It's a rite of passage.

14
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:41,926
Is it too late to join a tribe

15
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:43,762
where they just pierce something
or cut something off?

16
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:46,268
Buffy. Please concentrate.

17
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:48,837
Roll!

18
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:50,931
What? Huh!

19
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,275
Unh!

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

21
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,413
Unh!

22
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:09,916
Hmm. I broke
my number two pencil.

23
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:12,394
We'll have to do this
again sometime.

24
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,897
"C": all systems tend
towards chaos.

25
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:17,593
I just know that us
and the undead

26
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:20,899
are the only people in Sunnydale
working this late.

27
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:24,241
Mayor:
I appreciate you coming.

28
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:28,870
I realize it is early...
for you...

29
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:30,880
but I think you'll agree

30
00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:33,712
that this matter is urgent.
also... delicate.

31
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:35,718
I'm a very delicate person.

32
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:37,913
So you feel you can handle this?

33
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:40,013
It's a little out of my element...

34
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,081
but I can get you what you need.

35
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,218
I know a beast who knows a guy.

36
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:47,355
Are you sure that subcontracting
is the way to go here?

37
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:49,729
Well. This guy's worked
your town before...

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,998
and if he lives up to his rep.
this place will be in flames.

39
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:57,734
I've made certain deals
to get where I am today.

40
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:59,742
This demon requires his tribute.

41
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,213
See. That's what separates me
from other politicians. Mr. Trick.

42
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,912
I keep my campaign promises.

43
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:18,056
[Sniffs]

44
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:21,256
Where'd I put that scotch?

45
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,486
Buffy:
And then I was being chased

46
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,495
by an improperly filled-in answer
bubble screaming. "None of the above!"

47
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:29,124
Wow. I hope that wasn't one
of your prophecy dreams.

48
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,598
Probably not.

49
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,365
You know. I took it last year.
I could help you get ready.

50
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:36,929
There's this whole trick
to antonyms. But...

51
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,406
this isn't the place.

52
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:41,444
Oz is the highest-scoring person
ever to fail to graduate.

53
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,207
Isn't she cute when she's proud?

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,474
She's always cute.

55
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:46,209
We could work on it tonight.

56
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:47,648
Work on what tonight?

57
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:49,413
Oh. God. Are we
killing something again?

58
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:50,919
Only my carefree spirit.

59
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:52,455
Buffy S.A.T. prep.

60
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,616
Oz is helping.
He's the highest-scoring...

61
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,126
We know. We did
the impressed thing already.

62
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,253
I hate they make us
take that thing.

63
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,025
It's totally fascist.
and personally...

64
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:03,328
I think it discriminates
against the uninformed.

65
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,459
Actually.
I'm looking forward to it.

66
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,595
I do well on standardized tests.

67
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,536
What? I can't have layers?

68
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,074
So. Buff. Study tonight?

69
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,577
Yes on the studying. No on tonight.
I'm putting in Mom time.

70
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,910
She's been drastic ever since
I got back. And Giles is even worse.

71
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:19,449
I'm supervised 24-7.

72
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:23,043
It's like being in
the Real World house. Only real.

73
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,022
Hmm. Ooh. Candy bars...
lots of'em!

74
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:28,581
Principal Snyder. Thank you!

75
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,149
You weren't visited

76
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:33,162
by the ghost of Christmas past.
by any chance?

77
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,697
It's band candy.

78
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:37,791
Let's hear it for the band. Huh?
Very generous.

79
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,462
You will sell it to raise money
for the marching band.

80
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:41,970
They need new uniforms.

81
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,234
Yeah. Those tall. Fuzzy hats
ain't cheap. Huh?

82
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:45,798
But they go with everything.

83
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:48,174
I'm sure we love the idea
of going all Willy Loman...

84
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:50,076
but we're not in the band.

85
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:53,742
And if I'd handed you a trombone.
that would've been a problem. Summers.

86
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:55,444
It's candy.

87
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,419
Sell it.

88
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,888
Joyce:
But you're not in the band.

89
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:01,720
And yet.

90
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,590
Buffy. What would I do
with 40 chocolate bars?

91
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:07,028
You could hand them out
at the gallery.

92
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:09,463
"Buy something pre-Columbian.
get a free cavity."

93
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,198
20.

94
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,759
You're a good mom.

95
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:15,361
I'm the best.

96
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,398
No. I'm pretty sure the best moms
let their daughters drive.

97
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:20,465
And yet.

98
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,136
Oh. Come on!

99
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:25,010
Look. Let's not have
this conversation.

100
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:27,243
But I took the class.

101
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:29,945
I watched the filmstrips with the blood
and the death and the corpses.

102
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,987
I'm prepped.

103
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:33,114
Honey.
you failed the written test.

104
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,886
They wouldn't even let you
take the road test.

105
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,860
That was a year ago.
and I don't test well...

106
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:41,557
she said. Two days
before the S.A.T.s.

107
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,930
I spend enough time
not knowing where you are.

108
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:46,299
I don't want to add to that
the possibility

109
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,634
that you're on
the highway to Chicago.

110
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:50,037
I can't believe you.

111
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:51,802
I'm not taking off again.

112
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,570
Besides. If I wanted to...

113
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,805
I could just get on a bus.

114
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,211
Stop. Don't.

115
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:01,943
I just don't want you driving. OK?

116
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:03,350
I want you here.

117
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,082
I'm here. Hmm? See me here.

118
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,147
Mm-hmm?

119
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:09,988
Mmm... I got to go.

120
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,755
What. You're going out?

121
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,798
Giles. Slay-study double feature.
Could be late.

122
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,958
Again? Honey.
don't you think Mr. Giles

123
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:19,127
is monopolizing
an awful lot of your time?

124
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:21,599
And does he ever say he's sorry?

125
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:22,994
Ow!

126
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,466
Sorry.

127
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:27,504
Why do I put up with this?

128
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,540
Because it is your destiny...

129
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:32,735
and because I just bought
20 "cocorific" candy bars.

130
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:37,613
OK. You're just doing this
to take funny pictures of me.

131
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:40,981
I'm doing it to test your awareness
of an opponent's location

132
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:43,179
during a fight in total darkness.

133
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:44,653
Now. Wait 5 seconds

134
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,986
and then throw the ball at me.

135
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:50,755
You ran out of new training ideas
about a week ago. Huh?

136
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:54,594
OK. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1.

137
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:01,094
It's not that simple. Is it...

138
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,505
Ow. Ahem.
Yes. Well. Very good.

139
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,509
Thanks.

140
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:09,671
Where are you going?
We have to patrol.

141
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,408
I can't.
Mom's in hyperdrive.

142
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:13,177
She wants me home tonight.
I told you.

143
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,878
But... I...

144
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:18,388
I know. I know. She's out of control.
Enjoy the candy.

145
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,378
Buffy.

146
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:28,758
I didn't know you could do that.

147
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:33,792
I... I'm feeling better.

148
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:35,422
Angel!

149
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:42,363
Let's... get you inside.

150
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:52,782
It's late.
How'd you get away?

151
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,980
Aw. It was easy. Started a fire
in the prison laundry room.

152
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:58,988
Rode out in the garbage truck.

153
00:08:59,056 --> 00:08:59,988
Oh.

154
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:04,227
I'm joking. No garbage.

155
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,728
Smell me.

156
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:24,245
How is... Scott?

157
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,715
Scott?

158
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:29,685
Oh. Um... boyfried Scott.

159
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:33,155
Uh... actually. He's not...

160
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:36,019
He's fine.

161
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:39,154
Uh. That's for you.

162
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,324
Uh... it's fresh from the butcher.

163
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,958
Thanks.

164
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:45,501
[Clears Throat]

165
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,003
You're being careful. Right?

166
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,910
With Scott?

167
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,209
The slaying.

168
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:01,649
Oh. Uh... yeah. Of course.

169
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,710
Full of carefulness.

170
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:06,450
I worry about you.

171
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:10,284
I worry about you:

172
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,526
I'm getting stronger.

173
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:16,293
Pretty soon.
you won't even need me.

174
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,426
That'll be better.

175
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,833
Yeah.

176
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:39,587
Hey. Uh. Sorry I'm late.

177
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:42,592
You know Giles...

719
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:29,897
Aah!

720
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:32,958
Aah!

721
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:39,434
[Rumbling]

722
00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:51,786
What the hell's that?

723
00:39:58,694 --> 00:40:00,127
Lurconis. I'm thinking.

724
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:03,393
Ordinarily. I like other people
to do my fighting for me...

725
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:05,730
but I just gotta see what you got.

726
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:08,167
Just tell me when it hurts.

727
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:09,602
Come on. Baby.

728
00:40:10,673 --> 00:40:12,402
Giles. No!

729
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:15,611
Aah!

730
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:18,674
[Rumbling]

731
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:27,882
[Gas Hisses]

732
00:40:40,336 --> 00:40:41,701
You and me. Girl...

733
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,331
there's hard times ahead.

734
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:47,374
They never just leave.

735
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:49,411
Always got to say somethig:

736
00:40:53,082 --> 00:40:55,516
Can we go home now?

737
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:57,711
Yeah. We can go home.

738
00:40:57,787 --> 00:40:59,755
I've got the S.A.T. s tomorrow.

739
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:02,985
Oh. Blow them off.
I'll write you a note.

740
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:07,394
No... it's OK.

741
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:10,489
Poor babies. Come on.

742
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:13,968
And your friend?

743
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,469
Paid him.

744
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:19,474
The man did his job.
No reason to burn that bridge.

745
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:22,477
This didn't turn out
the way I had planned.

746
00:41:22,545 --> 00:41:24,012
Where's the downside?

747
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,481
You just got yourself one less demon
you have to pay tribute to.

748
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,713
The way I see it.
I did you a favor.

749
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:32,219
I guess you did.

750
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,923
In the future...

751
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:40,360
I'd be very careful
how many favors you do for me.

752
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:51,930
[Bell Rings]

753
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:54,874
Hey. Snyder. Heard you had
some fun Friday night.

754
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:56,605
Have you come down yet?

755
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,146
That's Pricipal Snyder.

756
00:41:58,214 --> 00:42:00,011
And that's a big "yep."

757
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:02,915
Snyder: You look like 4 young people
with too much time on your hands.

758
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:04,350
Not really.

759
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,615
Busy like a bee. Actually.

760
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:08,122
Bee-like.

761
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,058
Good. It seems we had
some vandalism Friday

762
00:42:12,128 --> 00:42:15,097
on school property.
and I was just looking

763
00:42:15,164 --> 00:42:18,361
for some... volunteers
to help clean it up.

764
00:42:23,072 --> 00:42:26,303
"Kiss rocks"?
Why would anyone want to kiss...

765
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,673
Oh. Wait. I get it.

766
00:42:28,744 --> 00:42:31,178
Let's get you some paint remover.

767
00:42:33,682 --> 00:42:36,583
Buffy: It was just
too much to deal with.

768
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:39,485
It was like nothing
made sense anymore.

769
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:42,991
The things that I thought
I understood were gone.

770
00:42:43,058 --> 00:42:45,390
I just felt... so alone.

771
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:48,396
Was that the math or the verbal?

772
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:50,329
Mostly the math.

773
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:54,733
Well. If you scored low.
then you can always take them again.

774
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:55,828
More S.A.T. s?

775
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:57,839
Is there really a point?

776
00:42:57,907 --> 00:43:01,138
I could die before
I even apply to college.

777
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,270
Then you very possibly might not.

778
00:43:04,346 --> 00:43:06,906
Well. Let's just keep hope alive.

779
00:43:06,982 --> 00:43:07,949
Hello.

780
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:09,917
Hi.

781
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:13,648
I say. Your car seems to have
had an adventure. Doesn't it?

782
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:17,351
Uh. Buffy assures me that
it happened battling evil...

783
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:20,589
so I'm letting her pay for it
on the installment plan.

784
00:43:20,663 --> 00:43:21,721
Uh. Hey...

785
00:43:21,797 --> 00:43:23,424
the way things were going...

786
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:25,831
be glad that's the worst
that happened.

787
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:28,096
At least I got to the two of you

788
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,865
before you actually did something.

789
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:35,142
- Right.
- Indeed.

790
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:37,338
Y-Yes.

791
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:15,940
Grrr! Arrggh!

792
