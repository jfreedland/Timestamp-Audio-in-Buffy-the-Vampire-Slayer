00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,190
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,710
So, anything new
about Warren and the nerd herd?

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,360
A nerd goes into hiding, he really hides.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,710
Big wedding coming up,
lots of date possibilities,

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,870
you and Tara are speaking again.
You wanna call her?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,110
No. But if I did call
she wouldn't hang up on me.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,310
You can't even stand to be around me.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,430
- That is not true.
- You didn't wanna come back.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,710
- It's over.
- I've memorised this tune, love.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,550
I'm using you... and it's killing me.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,390
I'm sorry, William.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,870
This is it.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,870
Are you ready to go?

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,950
He's gone.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,420
Xander's gone? Xander's missing?

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,070
What do you mean Xander's missing?!

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,074

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,750
- Oh, man, your face was priceless.
- Yeah, real funny.

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,300
Serves you right
for taking zees on lookout again.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,590
What do you expect? I haven't had
a decent night's sleep since...

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,110
I'm going Jack Torrance in here, you know?
Stuck in this basement for weeks!

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,760
We rented the whole house.
Can't we sleep upstairs?

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,230
We're on the lam.
We have to lay low. Underground?

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,020
It's figurative, doofus!
Did you even read Legion of Doom?

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,110
Enough! Midgetor, back to the monitors.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,190
- The last thing we need is to be surprised...
- Holy Jeez Louise.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,790
- The...
- The fricking Slayer.

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,420
- She's right there!
- All right, don't panic. Andrew.

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,710
Deploy your little friend.

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,310

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,590
Oh. Hi.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,550
You didn't by chance happen
to eat a couple of nerds?

33
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,110
- You're gonna hurt yourself!
- She'll break the needle.

34
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,660
We're gonna have to strap her down.

35
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,580
Hi, um, Tara. How are you?

36
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,070
Hey, I was wondering, maybe,
you would wanna go out sometime?

37
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,940
For coffee, food, kisses and gay love?

38
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,670
Hi, Tara. Guess what? Magic-free now
for - insert number - days now.

39
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,230

40
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,220
Buffy. Buffy.

41
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,540
Come on. It's time for your drugs.

42
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,430
What?

43
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,630
I said, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were on drugs.

44
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,140
OK. Good.

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,590
- Whatcha doin'?
- I'm online, checkin' to see if Xander emailed.

46
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,310
- Any luck?
- No such.

47
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,470
Well, maybe Anya found him
and they're trying to work it out.

48
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,350
How come you're all home, hearth and DSL?

49
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,190
- I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
- Saw her. Saw her completely.

50
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,310
Ouch. Just got a scratch from all that brittle.

51
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,580
It's... When I was seeing her,
she was seeing someone else. A girl.

52
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,910
- You mean...
- I mean... not "seeing" seeing. Well, maybe.

53
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,510
I don't know, it was inconclusive,
and I didn't stick around to find out.

54
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,870
I might have magicked my fist
through a wall or something.

55
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,030
Will, I'm sorry.

56
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
I mean, they're probably just friends.

57
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,590
I press my lips
against my friends all the time.

58
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,060
I'm sure they're just friends.
Once you fall for Willow, you stay fallen.

59
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,110
Thanks, Buffy.

60
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,550

61
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,550
- Hi. I'm back.
- Xander?

62
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,350
Xander, you're here!

63
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,030
- We missed you! Where were you?
- I know.

64
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,310
- I tried calling, but I couldn't without...
- Hey. You don't need to explain to us.

65
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,990
Right. Is she here?

66
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,390
Oh. No. You... wanna find her?

67
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,020
I need to. Her suitcase is gone,
and some of her stuff.

68
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,350
There's a "closed" sign on the Magic Box,
which, like, chills me to the bone.

69
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,270
She left a couple of days ago.

70
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,030
Was she looking for me?
Before she left, did she say anything?

71
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,150
You mean, between sobs?

72
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,830
There was mostly just wheezing.

73
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,460
She was a little... She was... kinda broken.

74
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,990
I don't know how stuff got so mixed up.

75
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,110
- I blew it.
- No.

76
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,710
Well... maybe it wasn't the best time
to break up with her, but...

77
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,230
No. It wasn't about breaking up.

78
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,630
I love her and, God, I miss her so much.

79
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,830
So, you left her at the altar,
but you still wanna...

80
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,150
- You still wanna date?
- I guess.

81
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,950
I know that I'm a better person
with her in my life.

82
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,350
But things got so complicated, with
the wedding, my family, her demons and...

83
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,630
what if it all goes to Hell, and for ever?

84
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,390
But then I left.

85
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,990
And ever since...
I've had this painful hole inside.

86
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,460
And I'm the idiot that dug it out.

87
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,390
- I screwed up real bad.
- Hey. We all screw up.

88
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,950
You lookin' for me?

89
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,750
Really not.

90
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,510
Oh. Right then. Off you go.

91
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,080
- Did you cry?
- What?

92
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,470
The wedding. Two hearts joined for eternity,
great pelting showers of rice and so forth.

93
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,950
You didn't hear.

94
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,910
What? Families get out of hand?

95
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,740
- Tear the place apart?
- No.

96
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,380
Well, yes, absolutely, but...

97
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,630
Xander left. The wedding didn't happen.

98
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,230
Well, gotta say... I didn't see that coming.

99
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,540
It was awful. Anya was devastated.

100
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,750
Is that right?

101
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,430
And Xander thinks maybe they can still
get back together, but... he hurt her a lot.

102
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,270
Yeah, well... some people
can't see a good thing when they've got it.

103
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,510
- Spike.
- I should've known you'd be tagging along.

104
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,270
Hey, guys. I... found Spike and was, uh...

105
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,390
tryin' to figure out what kind of
dangerous contraband he had.

106
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,750
Tell you what, Slayer. Let me get
out of your way. I'll stop bothering you.

107
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,830
Yeah, maybe you should
do that, Spike - just run along.

108
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,990
I guess you know all about that, don't you?

109
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,150
The king of the big exit.
Heard it brought the house down.

110
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,270
- I don't need this crap from you.
- Right. Let's not listen to Spike.

111
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,150
- Might get a bit of truth on you.
- OK, OK. Calm now.

112
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,470
Let's turn around and release
this very manly thing the other way.

113
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,950
I forgot. Willy Wannabite can't hurt me.
Dumb to pick a fight, I guess.

114
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,630
More than happy to beat you
right through the pain, you pathetic poof.

115
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,350
- Guys, don't.
- Buffy, can you hear me?

116
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,910
- What is this?
- Do you know where you are, Buffy?

117
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,550
- Sunnydale.
- No, none of that's real, none of it.

118
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,710
You're in a mental institution.
You've been with us now for six years.

119
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,590
Do you remember?

120
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,630
- Buffy? Are you OK?
- What happened?

121
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,110
It's OK, Buffy. Buffy, it's OK.

122
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,910
Look. Look who's here.

123
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,750
Buffy?

124
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,780
Welcome home, sweetie.

125
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,590
Mom?

126
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,510
- Oh, baby, you're really here.
- Dad?

127
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,230
She's lucid. Keep talking. Maybe
the sound of your voice will ground her.

128
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,310
Sweetheart?
We've missed you very much.

129
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,390
Honey, can you hear me?

130
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,550
- Buffy, stay with us, please.
- Oh... No!

131
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,870
- Here, let's get her back to my crypt.
- Spike, just go, OK?

132
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,910
She's our friend. We'll take care of her.

133
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,790
No, guys, I'm OK. I'm OK.

134
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,670
Come on, Xander. Help me get her home.

135
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,030
Put a little ice on the back of her neck.

136
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,630
She likes that.

137
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,390
I've been having these flashes.
Hallucinations, I guess.

138
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,070
- Since when?
- Uh... night before last.

139
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,470
I was checking houses on that list you
gave me, looking for Warren and his pals,

140
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,860
and then... bam!

141
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,080
Some kind of gross,
waxy demon thing poked me.

142
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,590
- And when you say poke...
- In the arm.

143
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,060
It stung me or something,
and... then I was like...

144
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,990
No. It wasn't "like". I was in an institution.

145
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,270
There were... doctors and...
nurses and other patients.

146
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,990
They told me that I was sick. I guess... crazy.

147
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:58,470
And that Sunnydale and all of this...
None of it... was real.

148
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,990
Oh, come on, that's ridiculous!

149
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,910
What? You think this isn't real just
because of all the vampires and demons

150
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,830
and ex-vengeance demons and the sister that
was a big ball of universe-destroying energy?

151
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,030
I know how this must sound,
but... it felt so real.

152
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,460
- Mom was there.
- She was?

153
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,630
Dad too.

154
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,590
They were together,

155
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,110
like they used to be... before Sunnydale.

156
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,350
OK! All in favour of research?

157
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,550
Motion passed.

158
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,190
All right, Xander, you hit the demon bars.
Dig up any info on a new player in town.

159
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,030
Dawnie, help me research.
We'll hop online, check all the...

160
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,140
..possibilities for a full recovery,
but we have to proceed cautiously.

161
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,270
- If we're not careful...
- Wait.

162
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,220
Are you saying that Buffy could be like
she was before any of this happened?

163
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,260
Mrs Summers, you have to understand the
severity of what's happened to your daughter.

164
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,030
For the last six years, she's been in
an undifferentiated type of schizophrenia.

165
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,550
We know what her condition is.
That's not what we're asking.

166
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,430
Buffy's delusion is multilayered.
She believes she's some type of hero.

167
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,270
- The Slayer.
- The Slayer, right, but that's only one level.

168
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,430
She's also created an intricate latticework
to support her primary delusion.

169
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,110
In her mind, she's the central figure
in a fantastic world beyond imagination.

170
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,270
She's surrounded herself with friends,
most with their own superpowers,

171
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,480
who are as real to her as you or me -
more so, unfortunately.

172
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,870
Together they face grand, overblown
conflicts against an assortment of monsters,

173
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,310
both imaginary and rooted in actual myth.

174
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,390
Every time we think
we're getting through to her,

175
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,670
- more fanciful enemies magically appear...
- How did I miss...?

176
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,790
Warren and Jonathan, they did this to me!

177
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,510
- Buffy!
- Buffy, it's all right.

178
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,540
They can't hurt you here.
You're with your family.

179
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,180
- Dawn?
- That's the sister, right?

180
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,190
The magical key.

181
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,630
Buffy inserted Dawn into her delusion,
actually rewriting the entire history of it

182
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,470
to accommodate a need for a familial bond.

183
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,750
Buffy, but that created
inconsistencies, didn't it?

184
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,990
Your sister, your friends,
all of those people you created in Sunnydale,

185
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,640
they aren't as comforting as they once were.

186
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,670
Are they? They're coming apart.

187
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,590
Buffy, listen to what
the doctor says. It's important.

188
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,270
Buffy, you used to create these grand villains
to battle against, and now what is it?

189
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,550
Just ordinary students you went to
high school with. No gods or monsters.

190
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,230
Just three pathetic little men

191
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,460
who like playing with toys.

192
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,830
- Dude, that poison's got her drooling like...
- Where have you guys been?

193
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,110
Uh...

194
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,910
pickin' up some stuff.

195
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,150
And checking out Buffy
on the van's remote surveillance.

196
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,070
Andrew's demon pet
has done some number on the Slayer.

197
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,310
Got her trippin'
like a Ken Russell film festival.

198
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,070
- Well, what kind of stuff?
- What?

199
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,950
The packages. What's in them?

200
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,790
- Do you think we're plotting against you?
- Better not be.

201
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,190
It's just stuff, big man.

202
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,510
You'll be in the know just as soon
as you stop being all freakazoid.

203
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,510
There's the vault.

204
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,350
I still say we'll need
eight other guys to pull this off.

205
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,900
I never should have let you see that movie.

206
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,940
- Where you going?
- Out. Getting stuff I need.

207
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,710
- I don't really think that's such a good idea.
- Why not?

208
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,270
Well, it's... It's just not safe out there... alone.

209
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,510
You saw how close the Slayer got.

210
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,460
Look, we're a team. Something happens
to you, it happens to all of us. Right?

211
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,630
Look, I know you're antsy. We all are.
But, you see, things are about to pick up.

212
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,260
Big-time. Just gotta be careful.

213
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,070
Right? All right?

214
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,540
Stick together. OK?

215
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,470
Look, Buffy, I found the demon.

216
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,830
Fits your description
and symptoms perfectly.

217
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,950
Look, is this it?

218
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,550
See? It's gonna be OK. Its pokey stinger
carries an antidote to its own poison.

219
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,910
I feel so lost.

220
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,720
I know. You're confused.

221
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,070
- It's that crazy juice inside you.
- It's more than that.

222
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,910
Even before the demon...
I've been so detached.

223
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,950
We've... all been kinda slummin'.

224
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,950
Every day I try to... snap out of it.
Figure out why I'm like that.

225
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,750
Buffy, look at me.

226
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,310
You are not in an institution.
You have never been in an institution.

227
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,350
Yes, I have.

228
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,070
What?

229
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,790
Back when I saw my first vampires...

230
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,910
I got so scared, I told my parents

231
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,100
and they completely freaked out.

232
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,510
They thought there was
something seriously wrong with me.

233
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,550
So they sent me to a clinic.

234
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,710
You never said anything.

235
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,710
I was only there a couple of weeks.

236
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,790
I stopped talking about it...
and they let me go.

237
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,230
Eventually...

238
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,270
my parents just... forgot.

239
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,910
God. That's horrible.

240
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,070
What if I'm still there?
What if I never left that clinic?

241
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,830
Buffy...

242
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,030
Buffy, you're not.

243
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,910
I'm... so sorry you had to go through that.

244
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,670
But... it's the past.

245
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,230
You've gotta trust me.

246
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,440
We're gonna get you that antidote.
Xander's hunting the demon right now.

247
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,990
Alone? Willow, he can't. It's too strong.

248
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,350
Oh, it's OK. We got help.

249
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,750
So she's havin' the wiggins, is she?

250
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,990
Thinks none of us are real.
Bloody self-centred, if you ask me.

251
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,830
Spike, we need muscle,
not colour commentary.

252
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,870
On the other hand,
it might explain some things -

253
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,910
this all being in that twisted brain of hers.

254
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,560
Yeah. Fix up some chip in my head.

255
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,270
Make me soft, fall in love with her,
then turn me into her sodding sex slave...

256
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,750
- What?!
- Nothing. Alternative realities.

257
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,270
Where we're all little figments
of Buffy's funny-farm delusion.

258
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,470
Where you might not
have left your bride at the altar

259
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,950
- and gone through with it like a man.
- One more syllable about Anya...

260
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,710
Oh, balls. You didn't say
he was a glarghk guhl kashmas'nik!

261
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,870
Cos I can't say glargh...

262
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,870
I altered his reality.

263
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,630
Get it? I... Never mind.

264
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,390
I made you some tea.

265
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,630
Thanks.

266
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,470
I'm OK, Dawn.

267
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,030
The thousand-yard stare really helps sell that.

268
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,590
You're burning up.

269
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,750
- I should be taller than you.
- Maybe you're not done growing.

270
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,750
- Coming apart.
- What's coming apart?

271
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,750
- We have to try harder, make things better.
- I'm trying.

272
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,070
Your grades.

273
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,150
Stealing.

274
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,870
Willow's been doing your chores, hasn't she?

275
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,550
What?

276
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,590
No, it's... it's the fever.
It's cooking your brain.

277
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,870
- We have to deal with these things...
- You don't have a sister, Buffy.

278
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,390
- Dawn?
- No, honey.

279
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,900
Say it. It'll help you believe it.

280
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,190
I... don't... have a sister.

281
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,830
I know. I didn't grow up with her.

282
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,310
These monks... they made her.

283
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,020
It's your mind... just playing tricks on you.

284
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,350
You're our little girl, Buffy.
Our one and only.

285
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,830
We have missed you so much.

286
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,390
Mom and Dad just want to
take you home and take care of you.

287
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,550
I'm not even there, am l?

288
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,790
What?

289
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,390
You said it a second ago.

290
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,670
You don't have a sister.

291
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,350
It's your ideal reality,
and I'm not even a part of it.

292
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,510
- Dawn, l... didn't mean...
- I have to go finish my chores.

293
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,590
Hold it.

294
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,870
- Hold it.
- I'll need its arm.

295
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,750
Yeah, I'd like both my arms, too.

296
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,790
Thanks, Spike. I'll help
when the... blistering pain subsides.

297
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,590
Ready?

298
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,190
Xander, go to the magic shop.

299
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,950
I'll need alkanet root
and a handful of nettle leaf.

300
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,270
Just for the medicinal properties. No magic.

301
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,590
Then meet me at the campus lab. I'll try to
brew up an antidote the old-fashioned way.

302
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,910
I'll hold here, keep an eye on the wax job.

303
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,710
- Make sure that's all you're ogling.
- Xander!

304
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,920
Buffy? Wake up.

305
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,950
Got yummy antidote goodness for you.

306
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,070
What happened?

307
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,860
It took a little longer than I'd hoped.
No magic and all.

308
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,230
Went boom twice, but then I got it.

309
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,310
Just... when it's cool, drink it all down,
and everything should go back to normal.

310
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,310
You never stop coming through.
Thank you, Willow.

311
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,310
- How is she?
- Make sure she drinks all that.

312
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,180
I'm gonna let Dawn know
that everything's gonna be OK.

313
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,950
You all right?

314
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,910
You need to leave me alone.
You're not part of my life.

315
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,510
Fine, then.

316
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,060
But I hope you don't think this an...

317
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,070
I hope you don't think this antidote's
gonna rid you of that nasty martyrdom.

318
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,750
See, I figured it out, love.
You can't help yourself.

319
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,990
You're not drawn to the dark like I thought.

320
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,540
You're addicted to the misery.

321
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,150
It's why you won't tell your pals about us.
Might actually have to be happy if you did.

322
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,070
They'd either understand
and help you, God forbid,

323
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,350
or drive you out,
where you could finally be at peace.

324
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,900
In the dark. With me.

325
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,910
Either way, you'd be better off for it,
but you're too twisted for that.

326
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,590
Let yourself live, already.

327
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,750
And stop with the bloody hero trip for a sec.
We'd all be the better for it.

328
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,230
You either tell your friends
about us... or I will.

329
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,270
Buffy?

330
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,150
I don't wanna go back there.

331
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,710
I wanna be healthy again.

332
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,470
What do I have to do?

333
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,390
Oh, please, help me.

334
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,020
I wanna go home with you and Dad.

335
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,660
I know, Buffy.
But first you've gotta get better.

336
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,390
It's not gonna be easy, Buffy.
You have to take it one step at a time.

337
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,070
You have to start ridding your mind of those
things that support your hallucinations.

338
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,590
You understand? There are things
in that world you cling to.

339
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,430
For your delusion, they're safe-holds,
but for your mind they're traps.

340
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,470
We have to break those down.

341
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,590
- Slaying?
- Yes.

342
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,230
But I'm talking about
those things you want there.

343
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,390
What keeps you going back.

344
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,940
- My friends.
- That's right.

345
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,470
Last summer, when you had
a momentary awakening,

346
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,550
- it was them that pulled you back in.
- They're not really your friends, Buffy.

347
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,710
They're just... tricks
keeping you from getting healthy.

348
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,790
You have to do whatever it takes
to convince yourself of that, Buffy.

349
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,750
Whatever it takes.

350
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,430
Oh, Buffy, I didn't see you.

351
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,910
I was just coming to check on you.
You feeling better? Did the antidote work?

352
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,830
I'm... still pretty dazed, but... better.

353
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,620
No more cuckoo's nest?

354
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,470
We still have the big bad
tranked out in the basement

355
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,310
In case it didn't work and we need more parts.

356
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,790
It'll be nice to see you all better.

357
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,620
Thanks.

358
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,630
I can make you some food, something big
with energy, help you clear your noggin.

359
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,310
Come on.

360
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,750

361
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,110
Hello! I'm back!
Clean and with the better smell now.

362
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,990
Friends? Romans?

363
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,230
Anyone?

364
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,030
Hey.

365
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,270
Hey there, sane girl. So did Willow
get that antidote to you all right?

366
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,590
Yeah. I'm better now.

367
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,510
Great. So it's settled. We're real, right?

368
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,710
Let's finish off that demon
and drag it out of the basement.

369
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,390
And tell me you're up for that.
I so don't wanna see Spike right now.

370
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,190
I mean, talk about losing touch.

371
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,710
Hate to say it, but I almost...
feel sorry for the guy. Almost.

372
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,750
The things the poor guy was saying...

373
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,710
I get it, you know.
Been a part of the Buffy obsess...

374
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,990
Buffy...

375
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,110
Willow, what...?

376
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,950
Dawn?

377
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,760
Don't you knock?

378
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,790
I called for you.

379
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,670
Buffy, are you OK?

380
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,870
Where are you going?

381
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,430
I'm going over to Janice's, where
they actually like having me around.

382
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,550
You're not going anywhere.

383
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,910
Why not? You want me gone anyway.

384
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,300
- What do you care?
- I care.

385
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,230
You're going downstairs with the others.
It's the only way I can get healthy.

386
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,510
What are you talking about?

387
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,230
Buffy, you look sick.

388
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,470
What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

389
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,660
Stay away from me! Willow, help!

390
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,870
Buffy, please!

391
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,310
You can't hide, Dawn.

392
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,590
Talk to me. You're hallucinating.

393
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,590
I know. You're just a trap for my mind.

394
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,870
Buffy, please, listen to me. That asylum
and those people, they're not real!

395
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,110
Buffy... look at me.

396
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,110
I'm right here. You're my sister.

397
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,550
I need you and love you.

398
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,670
Somewhere inside you must know that's real.

399
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,620
Sure it is!

400
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,070
Cos what's more real?
A sick girl in an institution...

401
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,910
Don't. Please, listen to me.

402
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,790
..or some kind of supergirl... chosen
to fight demons and... save the world?

403
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,830
That's ridiculous.

404
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,660
- A girl who sleeps with a vampire she hates?

405
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,230
Yeah, that makes sense!

406
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,390
No! Buffy, stop! I'm real!

407
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,390
Buffy, stop it. I'll be good!

408
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,630
I promise. You're not thinking. I'll...

409
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,620
It's OK, Buffy. Don't stress yourself.

410
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,910
Honey, take your time.

411
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,510
Make it as easy on yourself as possible.
There's nothing wrong with that.

412
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,070
Buffy... what are you doin'?

413
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,990
Oh, my God.

414
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,430
Buffy, help me!

415
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,910
I need my hands!

416
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,030
Hello?

417
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,590
Anybody home?

418
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,190
Buffy?

419
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,150
It's gonna be OK, sweetheart.
Whatever it is, it's not real, remember?

420
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,230
Just keep concentrating.
I'm right here, sweetie.

421
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,390
Buffy, help me!

422
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,310
Buffy, help!

423
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,470
Willow?

424
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,230
Eximete!

425
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,070
Vis Zenobia! Solvere!

426
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,070
No! Tara!

427
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,630
- I don't know...
- Buffy, look at me.

428
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,110
- I don't know. I don't know.
- I believe in you.

429
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,740
You're a survivor. You can do this.

430
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,590

431
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,910
Xander. No.

432
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,550
- Willow!
- Buffy?

433
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,230
Buffy! Buffy, fight it.

434
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,590
You're too good to give in.
You can beat this thing.

435
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,030
Be strong, baby, OK? I know you're afraid.

436
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,550
I know the world feels like
a hard place sometimes,

437
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,710
but you've got people who love you.

438
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,190
Your dad and l,
we have all the faith in the world in you.

439
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,220
We'll always be with you.

440
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,150
You've got a world of strength in your heart.

441
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,510
I know you do. You just have to find it again.

442
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,670
Believe in yourself.

443
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,510
You're right.

444
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,270
Thank you.

445
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,230
Goodbye.

446
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,670
Buffy.

447
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,470
I'm so sorry.

448
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,870
- Buffy?
- We're OK. It's all OK.

449
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,990
Buffy, sit down. You'll fall over.

450
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,270
No. I can't.

451
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,980
- Not until I have the antidote.
- OK.

452
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,940
We'll make more. We'll take care of it.

453
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,070
Everything's gonna be OK, Buffy.

454
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,070
I'm sorry, there's no reaction at all.

455
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,150
I'm afraid we lost her.

456
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,790

457
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,910

458
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,870

459
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,550
