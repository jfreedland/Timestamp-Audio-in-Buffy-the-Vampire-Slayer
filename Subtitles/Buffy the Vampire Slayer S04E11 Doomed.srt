1
00:00:02,613 --> 00:00:04,604
Let's try again.

2
00:00:04,693 --> 00:00:06,251
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,291
I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:13,082
- How's with you and Riley?
- Every time we talk, I have to lie.

5
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:14,970
I wish I could just come clean.

6
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:19,251
- Well, you can't.
- Yeah, I know I can't. But Buffy's special.

7
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:31,566
- I guess we have to talk.
- I guess we do.

8

9
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:54,445
Somebody should speak
before one of us graduates.

10
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,163
What are you?

11
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:15,450
Capricorn on the cusp of Aquarius. You?

12
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:19,888
Sorry. That came out
a little blunter than I intended.

13
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:25,128
It's just you're amazing.
Your speed, your strength.

14
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:28,603
Also passionate, artistic and inquisitive.

15
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:32,527
- Who are you?
- You know who I am.

16
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,682
The rest... What I do...

17
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:40,002
I can't tell you.

18
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:47,050
Well, then, let me. You're part
of some military monster squad

19
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,045
that captures demons, vampires...

20
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:56,806
Probably has official-sounding euphemisms
for them, like "unfriendlies" or "non-sapiens".

21
00:01:56,893 --> 00:01:58,645
Hostile subterrestrials.

22
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:04,649
So, you deliver these HSTs to a bunch of lab
coats, who perform experiments on them,

23
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,772
which, among other things,
turn some into harmless little bunnies.

24
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:11,606
- How am I doin' so far?
- A little too well.

25
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:17,325
Meanwhile, by day, you pretend
to be Riley Finn, cornfed Iowa boy.

26
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:22,523
Ever been to Iowa, Riley?
God, if that's even your name.

27
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:25,127
It is. Born and raised.

28
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:30,207
And hey, bulletin: I'm not the only one
who's been a little less than honest here.

29
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:39,770
I thought a professional demon-chaser like
yourself would have figured it out by now.

30
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:42,242
I'm the Slayer.

31
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,452
Slayer. Chosen One.

32
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,652
She who hangs out a lot in cemeteries?

33
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:53,564
You're kidding.

34
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,923
Ask around. Look it up.

35
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:00,402
Slayer, comma, the.

36
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:04,053
And you fight demons?

37
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,363
I mean, you whaled on those guys.

38
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:10,731
- You did pretty well yourself.
- Yeah, but I'm a walking bruise today.

39
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:14,283
You see me with my clothes off, I look like...

40
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:20,012
I mean, I have bruises...
I don't see a scratch on you.

41
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:23,529
- You're not looking hard enough.
- I'm looking pretty hard.

42
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,404
So then...

43
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:39,082
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

44
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,444
I just...

45
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:48,451
I really thought that
you were a nice, normal guy.

46
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,522
I am.

47
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:53,891
Maybe by this town's standards,
but I'm not grading on a curve.

48
00:03:55,333 --> 00:04:00,532
I think we both need a little time
to process everything.

49
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:07,765
- Maybe then...
- Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

50
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:20,092
- I don't think I need to tell you...
- I won't say a word.

51
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:23,085
Good. It'll be safer for all...

52
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:34,732
Over here.

53
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:46,762
Wow. That was some ride!

54
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:56,521
Sorry I'm so excited. It's my first earthquake.

55
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,322
It's not mine.

56
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:00,407
My soddin' sleeping chair's bloody sodden.

57
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:05,484
The quake knocked a couple of pipes loose.
There's a wrench over by the workbench.

58
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,849
- Try tightening the coupling.
- Do I look like a plumber to you?

59
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:13,529
No, you look like a big mooch who doesn't
lift a finger here, but I have to get to work.

60
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:18,403
Yeah, delivering melted cheese on bread,
doing your part to keep America constipated.

61
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:21,883
Mock not. Remember who pays
for the plasma round here, pal.

62
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:24,362
You earn your keep, or you don't get kept.

63
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:30,651
When you're done fixing that leak,
try cleaning up this mess.

64
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:35,523
And doing a little laundry for once
wouldn't kill you, unfortunately.

65
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:46,290
Hey! I was in the library during the quake.

66
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,285
Almost got buried
in some 19th-century literature.

67
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:53,810
And I don't have to tell you how hard it is
to dig through some of that stuff.

68
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,929
- You OK?
- Yeah.

69
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:58,573
A couple of broken knick-knacks,
but no biggies.

70
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,962
Porter Dorm is completely blacked out.

71
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:06,173
So they're dealing with the crisis the only
way they know how: Aftershock Party.

72
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:10,292
The dorm that had the Somebody Sneezed
Party and the Day That Ends In Y Party.

73
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,570
They do seem to be
pretty generous with the milestones.

74
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:18,363
Hey, you should ask Riley to come.
Much carousing by flattering candlelight.

75
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:21,208
Riley's, um, busy.

76
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:25,445
I'm pretty sure. But you go on ahead
and I'll catch up with you there.

77
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,331
I'm on my way for a little Giles one-on-one.

78
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,485
- Anything wrong?
- Wrong?

79
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:33,768
No. Not at all.

80
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,771
- Something horrible's gonna happen.
- It was an earthquake.

81
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:45,971
Not uncommon in southern California.
No reason to think it was anything more.

82
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:51,081
I so have a reason. A darn good reason.
The last time we had an earthquake, I died.

83
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:56,008
Yes, I know that, and therefore
I completely understand your anxiety.

84
00:07:56,093 --> 00:08:00,644
Oh, good. Cos I'd hate for my little untimely
horrible death concern to be ambiguous.

85
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:05,204
But unless evidence suggests otherwise,
we can assume that it's shifting landmasses

86
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:08,285
and not a portent of some imminent doom.

87
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:13,447
Now, in the meantime, I've got a few theories
about our mysterious commando friends.

88
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:19,122
- Really?
- Based on the locations of our sightings,

89
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:23,252
and Spike's reluctant description
of their underground installation...

90
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,245
What if the quake was a sign -
a bad omen - and we ignore it?

91
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,801
There'll be a lot of red faces
when the world ends.

92
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:32,408
Buffy, if the quake heralded
some such catastrophe,

93
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:37,613
I'm sure there will be other signs to follow
which will afford us plenty of time to avert it.

94
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:42,847
I believe the commando installation is either
very close to or directly under your school.

95
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:46,243
If that is the case, one or more of them
may be in your very midst.

96
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,289
- Plague!
- What?

97
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:52,571
If the end of the world comes in the form of
a plague, too many people may be infected...

98
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:57,408
Buffy! Will you stop worrying about
what may be and concentrate on what is.

99
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:02,567
Vigilance is all well and good, but as we're
close, there is a more pressing question.

100
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:04,962
- What's a slayer?
- Slayer?

101
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:08,363
Thrash band. Anvil-heavy guitar rock
with delusions of Black Sabbath.

102
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:12,526
- No. A girl, with powers.
- Oh. The Slayer.

103
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:15,650
- Oh, yeah, I've heard of the Slayer.
- Fill me in.

104
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:19,772
Well, the Slayer is like some kind
of bogeyman for the subterrestrials,

105
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:23,243
something they tell their spawn
to make 'em eat their vegetables.

106
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,450
- You're telling me she doesn't exist.
- Wait a sec.

107
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,808
Am I bursting somebody's bubble here?

108
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:32,886
Maybe this is a bad time
to tell you about the Easter Bunny?

109
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:38,365
Sorry, sorry. It's a myth, Rye.
All a part of that medieval folklore garbage

110
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:42,765
kooks dream up to explain things
we deal with every day.

111
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:46,646
How do you explain
the things we deal with, Forrest?

112
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:52,012
They're just animals. Rarer than the ones
you grew up with on that farm in Smallville...

113
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:09,447
Where's that hypo?

114
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,924
Never mind.

115
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,249
Like I said,

116
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,369
animals.

117
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:28,444
What's that racket?

118
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:32,208
Animals rattling in their cages.
Been doin' it all day.

119
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:37,083
- What's got 'em all worked up?
- Earthquakes. They make everybody crazy.

120
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:41,084
( "Hey" by the Hellacopters)

121
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,724
 You say you wanna help me out

122
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:54,206
 But you just fill my head with doubt

123
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:57,683
 Hey, I got my own reality
and it sure ain't virtual

124
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:02,446
 It's my highway, I choose

125
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:05,093
 My lane and I control the cruise

126
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:08,882
 Yeah, I got feelings
but bet your ass they're not mutual

127
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,091
Percy! Hi!

128
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,528
Hey, Willow. What's goin' on?

129
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:19,126
Stuff. I thought you got
that football scholarship to USC.

130
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:21,773
- I did. Laurie goes here.
- Hey.

131
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,649
Hi.

132
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,769
Some party, huh?

133
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,844
It's OK.

134
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:36,371
- How's Oz?
- Oh, actually, Oz...

135
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:46,371
Listen, we're gonna go get some drinks.
Cool to see you.

136
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,171
Bye.

137
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:50,847
Yeah, catch you later.

138
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:20,608
Hey, you guys serious
about naked limbo? I'm in.

139
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:36,882
( "Mouth Almighty" by Echobelly)

140
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:46,930
Buffy, where are you?

141
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,163
So I can watch you flirt with that redhead?

142
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:54,486
What, Rosenberg? She's just some egghead
who tutored me a little in high school.

143
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,007
She's nice, but come on -
captain of the nerd squad.

144
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,766
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you have a thing for geeks.

145
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:03,050
Uh, no. I like my women hot.

146
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:06,004
Call me old-fashioned.

147
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:17,929
Hello?

148
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:20,004
Anyone in here?

149
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:05,972
Spike, the place looks worse than when I left!

150
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,089
You didn't even fix the drip!

151
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,289
Don't turn around.

152
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:14,048
- Spike, what is it? What happened?
- Don't look at me.

153
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:25,449
I shrunk them.

154
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:29,367
Bleeding shirt, trousers... I hate this place.

155
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:32,092
I'm no happier about you
wearing my stuff than you are.

156
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:34,926
Go out. Get me some decent stuff.
And I want more blood.

157
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:37,322
No! You're not a guest.

158
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,408
You want me to tear
this place apart, you poof?

159
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:43,803
That's it! I am way past through with you.

160
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:47,681
I hate to break it to you, O impotent one,
but you're not the Big Bad any more.

161
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:53,131
You're not even the Kind of Naughty. You're
nothing but a waste of space - my space!

162
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:56,888
And as much as I got a big laugh
watching Buffy kick your shiny white bum,

163
00:14:56,973 --> 00:15:02,366
and as much as I know I can give you a
bum-kicking, I'm here to tell you somethin'.

164
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:06,162
You're not even worth it.

165
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,642
I'm outta here.

166
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:20,084
Buffy! Over here.

167
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:27,207
Wow. I wasn't sure where the party was,
and then I saw the lights and the ambulance

168
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:32,606
and I was, like, "Right, of course.
Death, carnage... It's a Buffy party."

169
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:35,048
I'm so glad you're here.

170
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:40,002
- What happened?
- I found him, this guy, on the bed with me.

171
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:42,926
Dead. Not me dead, he dead.

172
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:45,004
God, are you OK?

173
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:47,769
Vampire?

174
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:51,528
There was so much blood,
and there was a symbol.

175
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:55,401
- And Percy said I was a nerd.
- Percy called you a nerd?

176
00:15:56,613 --> 00:16:01,004
I guess we should report to Giles,
get with the demon-tracking.

177
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,164
Does Percy even go here?

178
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:12,690
OK, that makes 0-4 billion.

179
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:16,243
You don't got game, son.
What's going on in that head of yours?

180
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,928
I'm just trying to make up my mind
about something.

181
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:23,921
Buffy. She's pretty cool, isn't she?

182
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:28,211
Yes already! She's cool, she's hot,
she's tepid, she's all-temperature Buffy.

183
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:31,205
Now can we concentrate on the game here?

184
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:37,649
Good block. Use your face more often.

185
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:40,725
- We have an alpha code-blue situation.
- One of ours?

186
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:44,488
- Negative. Civilian at the Porter Hall party.
- HST attack?

187
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:48,452
Cannot confirm. I couldn't get close
without drawing attention to myself.

188
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,444
Should we mobilise?

189
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:53,889
No, I'll go. Do a little recon.
See if it falls in our domain.

190
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:58,012
You alert Professor Walsh. Tell her we have
a casualty of an indeterminate nature.

191
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:01,847
Let's not make a move
until we get the whole story.

192
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,845
Itjust made me feel
like I was right back in high school.

193
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:08,243
Dumb jock. If it wasn't for you,
he still would be.

194
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:12,246
I mean, I know the Percy thing
isn't really important.

195
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,530
- It's the dead guy on the bed.
- Yeah, that's bad, too.

196
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:20,808
Ooh, and something else.
He - the dead guy - was propped up,

197
00:17:20,893 --> 00:17:24,010
like whatever killed him
wanted to drain the blood out of him.

198
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:29,213
So I'm thinking the "whatever"
took a bunch of the guy's blood with him.

199
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:32,251
And I haven't been a nerd
for a very long time.

200
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,324
Hello! Dating a guitarist!

201
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,687
- Or I was.
- Tell them about the symbol.

202
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:43,291
Right. It was carved into his chest,
like a big creepy eye.

203
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:46,129
It's kind of the CBS logo.

204
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:50,092
Hey, could this be the handiwork
of one Mr Morley Safer?

205
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:53,563
I've seen this somewhere before.
I just can't remember where.

206
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:56,929
- I mean, it's like...
- It's the end of the world.

207
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:58,492
Again?

208
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:01,849
It's the earthquake. That symbol is...

209
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:07,132
I told you. I said "end of the world" and
you're like "Pooh, pooh, southern California."

210
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:11,968
I'm so very sorry. My contrition completely
dwarfs the impending apocalypse.

211
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:16,046
No, it can't be. We've done this already.

212
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,887
It's the end of the world. Everyone dies.
It's rather important, really.

213
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,726
So what do we do?

214
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:25,202
I stop it.

215
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,002
I wonder where I've seen this before.

216
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:37,210
Where else? The place I spend
most of my waking hours

217
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:40,330
memorising stuff
off the sides of mausoleums.

218
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:42,483
Big freaky cereal boxes of death.

219
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:58,326
Door was open.

220
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:54,448
Wow! That flippy thing that you did...

221
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,569
- Where did it go?
- It's gone.

222
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:00,248
- I saw it take off toward the woods.
- And you didn't follow it?

223
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,690
No weapons, no backup. You don't
go after a demon that size by yourself.

224
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:08,368
- I do.
- Yeah, well, I'm no slayer.

225
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:13,605
- Base One, this is Lilac One.
- Lilac?

226
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:14,653
Go.

227
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:19,681
Sighting of an unidentified Sub-T. Mobilise
patrol team for debriefing at 0800 hours.

228
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:21,843
Copy that.

229
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:26,769
Very commandery.

230
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:28,844
Lilac notwithstanding.

231
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,490
What are you doing here?

232
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:37,168
Looking for you.
She who hangs out in cemeteries.

233
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:43,571
Well, I have to get the demon.

234
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:46,042
Don't sweat it. We'll bag it.

235
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:49,362
- It's not that simple.
- Yeah, but...

236
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:52,851
- Look, I really think...
- Riley, I just...

237
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:56,848
- I can't.
- Can't talk?

238
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:59,404
Can't any of it.

239
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:06,803
I can't be with you. It's a huge, black pit
of a mistake and I can't go there again.

240
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:08,929
Again? You've dated me before?

241
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:11,811
No! Look, I was involved...

242
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:18,086
- You don't know what my life is like.
- I'm dying to find out.

243
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:23,566
Dying being the operative word here.
There's too much risk. There is too much...

244
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:29,886
It's just doomed. And I can't do doomed
again right now. I'm sorry.

245
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:32,885
I don't understand where this is coming from.

246
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:35,806
You like me. It's not like
we don't have anything in common.

247
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:39,772
- But that's not enough.
- Buffy, I'm thrown by this.

248
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:41,844
I'm confused.

249
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:46,002
But I can feel my skin humming.

250
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:48,687
My hands, my every inch of me.

251
00:21:49,613 --> 00:21:53,401
I've never been this excited
about anybody before.

252
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:56,963
I'm not trying to scare you
and I'm not gonna force myself on you, but

253
00:21:57,053 --> 00:22:01,285
I am, by God, not gonna walk away
because I think it might not work.

254
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:03,933
I don't know what's happened in your past...

255
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:06,811
Pain, death,

256
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,409
apocalypse.

257
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:11,484
None of it fun.

258
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:16,361
Do you know what a hellmouth is?
Do you have a fancy term for it?

259
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:19,843
Because I went to high school on it
for three years.

260
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:25,049
We do not have that much in common.
This is ajob to you.

261
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:28,330
- It's notjust ajob.
- It's an adventure, great.

262
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,211
But for me, it's destiny.

263
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:34,842
It is something I can't change,
something I can't escape. I'm stuck.

264
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:39,449
You don't have to be.
You're not in high school any more.

265
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,808
- You can change things.
- Riley, no.

266
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,532
- I know it may seem...
- Riley!

267
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,922
My answer is no.

268
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,966
- A Vahrall demon.
- Ew!

269
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,647
- I second that revulsion.
- Yes.

270
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:15,490
"Slick like ghoul and gird in moonlight,
father of portents and brother to blight."

271
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:20,328
"Limbs with talons, eyes like knives,
bane to the blameless, thief of lives."

272
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:26,363
Three metres tall, approximately 100-120
kilograms, based on my visual analysis.

273
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:29,013
- Special hazards?
- Unknown.

274
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:32,085
Probably nothing we haven't handled before.

275
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:36,530
There's no pattern we can discern,
so we assume it's on a "kill, crush, destroy."

276
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:39,328
It isn't digging up the bones of a child for fun.

277
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:42,166
A demon's got some
pretty hilarious ideas about fun.

278
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:44,608
The bones of a child, though.

279
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:46,649
I saw that...

280
00:23:51,773 --> 00:23:56,324
An ancient ritual. It uses the blood of a man,
the bones of a child,

281
00:23:56,413 --> 00:24:00,247
and something called the Word of Valios.

282
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:04,212
It's all part of a sacrifice.
The sacrifice of three.

283
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:06,727
Let me guess - ends the world?

284
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:11,329
Well, yeah.
It's not big with the details, though.

285
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:16,123
It doesn't say how the world ends
or what the ritual entails exactly.

286
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:20,286
The sacrifice of three.
Three people are gonna die?

287
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:24,844
No, they won't. Because Claw Boy
is not getting all of his ingredients.

288
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:28,209
We have to find the Word of Valios,
keep him from getting it.

289
00:24:28,293 --> 00:24:32,571
If he doesn't already have it.
I mean, who knows where he's been?

290
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:36,532
Here's one for the good guys. This thing's
got a pheromone signature a mile wide.

291
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:39,923
Agent Gates has been working
with the detection system.

292
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:43,130
Can't tell where it's going,
but I know where it's been.

293
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:46,967
Residual traces showing up
in populated areas. The thing's not shy.

294
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:50,329
We're going out in civvies.
Weapons stowed in packs.

295
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:55,328
Keep 'em out of sight till nightfall.
Remember, this isn't a capture, it's a kill.

296
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:58,086
Pick up assignments from me.
We'll blanket the town.

297
00:24:58,173 --> 00:25:01,370
I'll check the magic shop
for a book called the Word of Valios.

298
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:05,162
- How about the museum?
- We'll stop by my house, get weapons,

299
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:09,166
and I'll change into something
that isn't quite as anchovy-scented.

300
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:13,769
This thing takes wicked very seriously. Be
careful. I couldn't stand anybody getting hurt.

301
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:17,247
Goodbye, Dru. See you in hell.

302
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:23,127
What are you doing?

303
00:25:23,213 --> 00:25:26,250
Bloody rot! Can't a person knock?

304
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:30,008
- What are you doing?
- You were trying to stake yourself.

305
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:33,165
Fag off! It's no concern of yours.

306
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:37,163
Is too. For one thing,
that's my shirt you're about to dust.

307
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:41,565
For another, we've shared a lot. You should
have trusted me enough to do it for you.

308
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,611
- Xander.
- What? He wants to die, I wanna help.

309
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:48,049
It's ooky. We know him.
We can'tjust let him poof himself.

310
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:52,968
Oh, but you can. You know I'd drain you drier
than the Sahara if I had half the chance.

311
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:56,807
Besides, I'm beyond pathetic.
Stuck in this basement washing skivvies

312
00:25:56,893 --> 00:26:00,249
for a blighter I wouldn't have bothered
to bite a few months ago.

313
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:03,325
I mean, am I even remotely scary any more?

314
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:06,602
Tell me the truth.

315
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:14,363
Well, the shirt is kinda
not very threatening, and the short pants...

316
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:18,844
But it could also be cos I know you can't bite,
which isn't what you really need to hear...

317
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:22,482
- Stop. Look, just clear out, OK?
- Fine. But you break anything else

318
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:26,930
- and you'll be sleeping in the garage.
- We can't leave him here like this.

319
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:30,801
- We'll have to take him to the museum.
- You go on.

320
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:33,885
I won't do anything.
I feel better now. Promise.

321
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:39,882
If we don't find what we're looking for,
we're facing an apocalypse.

322
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,567
Really? You're notjust saying that?

323
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,525
Buffy.

324
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:06,208
- Is this really the time for Donkey Kong?
- What?

325
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:14,282
It takes trace readings
of the creature's pheromones.

326
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:15,442
And?

327
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:20,527
And it's either mating season for this thing
or it's movin' all over town.

328
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:23,768
- You know, Buffy...
- Actually, I need to go.

329
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:27,562
- Big Bad needs to be squished.
- Right. I'm on it, too.

330
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:32,522
It's just, this thing,
this you-and-me thing, it's stupid.

331
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:37,209
I know. Which is why we can't do it,
the you-and-me thing.

332
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:39,648
No, I mean you're stupid.

333
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:42,966
I mean, I don't mean that.

334
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:46,966
- No, I think maybe I do.
- Wow. With sweet talk like that,

335
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:50,045
- you'll definitely melt my reservations.
- I'm serious.

336
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:54,524
You have this twisted way of looking
at things. This doom-and-gloom mentality.

337
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:58,845
You keep thinking like that and things will
probably turn outjust the way you expect.

338
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:03,006
You know, there's nothing more dangerous
than a psych grad student.

339
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:06,130
Buffy, where is the bad here?

340
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:09,728
It turns out that we're even more
well-matched than we thought we were.

341
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,488
I mean, you're a fry cook and so am I.

342
00:28:13,573 --> 00:28:16,371
Yes, but you're an amateur fry cook,

343
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:20,048
and I come from a long line
of fry cooks that don't live past 25.

344
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:24,843
Which is exactly the attitude I'm talking
about. Look, I know the risks of what we do.

345
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:28,482
I also know it's more rewarding than
any otherjob on the planet. And fun!

346
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:33,010
Fun? The last person I know that
believed that is in a coma right now

347
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:35,527
because she had so much fun on the job.

348
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,446
I'm not saying you shouldn't
take your work seriously.

349
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,843
That I should just turn my frown
upside down? Is that it?

350
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:46,529
I wish I could. But this isn't the kind of gig
where you can just hang it up at night

351
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:49,127
- and snuggle with your honey.
- Why can't it be?

352
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:53,764
Because I tried it, OK?
And every time itjust fell apart.

353
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:56,242
Then I get sucked right back
into the Über-evil.

354
00:28:56,333 --> 00:29:02,124
Welcome to the story of the world. Things
fall apart, Buffy. And evil, it comes and goes.

355
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:07,048
But the way people manage is, they don't
do it alone. They pull each other through.

356
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:10,125
If you weren't so self-involved you'd see that.

357
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:15,969
You have no idea what you're talking about.
You barely know me.

358
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,569
I know that it's notjust the job thing.

359
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:23,282
I'm sure there's some good-Iooking guy
who done you wrong in there, too.

360
00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:26,570
But mostly I think you wanna
stay down in the dark place,

361
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:29,645
- cos maybe it's safer down there.
- You are so out of line.

362
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,122
No. See, I don't think so.

363
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:38,524
We have an opportunity, you and me, but
the fact that you're too scared to even try

364
00:29:38,813 --> 00:29:41,008
Is my business.

365
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:43,687
So why don't you just leave me alone?

366
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:49,248
Fair enough.

367
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:03,602
- Great. No Word of Valios.
- Not even a syllable of Valios.

368
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:06,924
So I'm one step closer to melting
in a sea of molten hellfire?

369
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,369
You shouldn't talk like that.
OK, so you can't kill any more,

370
00:30:10,453 --> 00:30:14,082
but there's other fun things
you can do. You'll adjust.

371
00:30:14,173 --> 00:30:19,088
Adjust? And what? End up
like the two of you? No, thank you.

372
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:23,212
Here it goes. "We can'tjust leave him here
to stake himself. It's not right."

373
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:26,444
I should think you would be glad
to greet the end of days.

374
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,764
I mean, neither one of you
is making much of a go at it.

375
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:33,163
You... Kids your age
are going off to university.

376
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:36,450
You've made it as far as the basement.
And Red here,

377
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:41,243
you couldn't even keep Dog Boy happy. You
can take the loser out of high school, but...

378
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,972
You're trying to get us to dust you.

379
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:48,843
Am not! I just don't want pity
from geeks more useless than I am.

380
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:54,087
We're not useless. We help people.
We fight the forces of evil.

381
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:56,641
Buffy fights the forces of evil.

382
00:30:56,733 --> 00:31:01,807
You're her groupies. She'd do just
as well without you, better I'd wager,

383
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,851
since she wouldn't have to save
your hides all the time.

384
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:08,289
That is so not true.
We're part of the team. She needs us.

385
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:12,685
Or you're just the same tenth-grade losers
you've always been

386
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:16,163
and she's too much of a softy
to cut you loose.

387
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:34,562
Oh - as usual - dear.

388
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:18,441
- What happened?
- It's my fault. I should have known.

389
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:20,568
Giles...

390
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:25,408
The Word of Valios
is the name of a talisman, not a book.

391
00:32:25,493 --> 00:32:28,883
- I blame myself entirely. I had it here.
- You had it here?

392
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:31,726
I thought you were being
too hard on yourself, but...

393
00:32:31,813 --> 00:32:35,567
Thank you. I bought it
at a sorcerer's estate sale.

394
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:38,772
I only glanced at it once.
I thought it was a knockoff.

395
00:32:38,853 --> 00:32:42,004
They have it. They probably have
their sacrifices by now, too.

396
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,527
They're on their way
to perform the sacrifice now.

397
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,730
On their way where?
You found out what the ritual is for?

398
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:50,805
The Hellmouth.
They're going to open the Hellmouth.

399
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:55,492
The one in the library.

400
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:04,131
Looks like we're going back to high school.

401
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:21,092
OK, be careful, you guys.
The place doesn't look too stable.

402
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:24,732
Fine by me. Hope we all go under.

403
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:27,805
Why is he even here? It's not like he can fight.

404
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:30,691
If we leave him alone, he'll stake himself.

405
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:33,367
And that's bad because...?

406
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:36,490
Fine. Whatever. Just keep him out of the way.

407
00:33:36,573 --> 00:33:38,564
I do not have time for this.

408
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:44,124
When we get to the library, look out for
victims they're keeping alive for the sacrifice.

409
00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:47,603
- Getting them out is the first priority.
- Will do.

410
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,728
OK. You guys ready?

411
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,724
Let's rock and roll.

412
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:56,364
"Let's rock and roll."

413
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,884
Sunnydale High.

414
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:08,285
If these walls were still walls,
what stories they could tell.

415
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:10,242
Eeuw!

416
00:34:13,173 --> 00:34:15,562
Mayor meat. Extra crispy.

417
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:24,533
I think we're near the library.

418
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,887
Whoa.

419
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:37,692
Check out the new floor plan.

420
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:39,764
Three of them.

421
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:45,891
I don't see any sacrifice people.

422
00:34:45,973 --> 00:34:48,168
They must be around here somewhere.

423
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,723
The ritual's not finished.
And it's not gonna be.

424
00:35:07,053 --> 00:35:08,611
The blood!

425
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:13,171
Get the talisman. They can't do the ritual.

426
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,763
I've got the bones!

427
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:23,804
Here!

428
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:32,408
You're picking on the wrong guy. I've had
a lot of practice at this with my lunch money.

429
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:33,608
Spike!

430
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:36,284
Right, perfect.

431
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:51,922
OK, I guess I won.

432
00:35:54,573 --> 00:35:56,848
The demons! They are the sacrifice!

433
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,450
No pain.

434
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,006
I can hurt a demon.

435
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:28,241
That's right. I'm back,
and I'm a bloody animal! Yeah!

436
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:34,643
- No!
- Spike, not in the hole!

437
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:42,970
What? I was helping.

438
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:52,730
Get outta here!
The building's gonna come down!

439
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:22,287
Don't let him jump in the Hellmouth.
If he does, we're finished!

440
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,283
I'm going in.

441
00:37:45,173 --> 00:37:47,846
You're coming back out.

442
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,651
Buffy...

443
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,887
Well, hey! Willow.

444
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:56,932
And Xander, right?
Jeez, what are the chances, huh?

445
00:38:57,013 --> 00:39:00,244
Yeah, I was just passing by
and I thought I heard people inside.

446
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:04,087
You were just passing by
in your GI Joe outfit?

447
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:10,489
No offence, but you do look
wicked conspicuous.

448
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:12,484
I do?

449
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:16,489
Paintball. Yeah, I was playing paintball.
And then the aftershock...

450
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:21,966
- So, you're one of the commando guys, huh?
- Oh, no, no, no. Commando? No, I mean...

451
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:25,725
- Do I know you?
- Me? No.

452
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:30,250
No, sir. I'm just an old pal of Xander's here.

453
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,324
Oh. That's nice.

454
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,086
- It's kinda weird being back, isn't it?
- Yeah.

455
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:43,448
Everything seems so small.

456
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:45,922
And more charred and ruiny.

457
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:09,084
Come in.

458
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:19,444
- You never called, so I didn't know...
- Oh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm just...

459
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:24,607
I'm a dead man. Secret. Highly.

460
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:29,813
Or it's supposed to be. And then you find out.
I can deal. You're special.

461
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:34,449
But last night was a disaster.
Could I have been less convincing?

462
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:39,209
I was trained to be sneaky and stuff
and I'm, like, "Hi. Paintball. Just passing by."

463
00:40:39,293 --> 00:40:41,409
I should have given 'em
my security code and rank.

464
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:43,961
You have a security code and rank?

465
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:46,442
No. Did I just say...?

466
00:40:47,173 --> 00:40:49,164
This is so not good.

467
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:55,691
Everybody knows about me. I'm finished.

468
00:40:55,773 --> 00:40:58,162
It's the end of the world.

469
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:06,011
No, it's not.

470
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:23,572
What's this? Sittin' around watchin' the telly
while there's evil still afoot.

471
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:26,292
It's not very industrious of you.

472
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:29,922
I say we go out there
and kick a little demon ass!

473
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:35,444
What, can't go without your Buffy,
is that it? Too chicken?

474
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:38,923
Let's find her.
She is the Chosen One, after all.

475
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:43,211
Come on! Vampires! Rrr! Nasty!

476
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:49,607
Let's annihilate them. Forjustice and for
the safety of puppies and Christmas, right?

477
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:52,366
Let's fight that evil!

478
00:41:52,453 --> 00:41:54,762
Let's kill something!

479
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:58,044
Oh, come on!

480
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:04,771
