1
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:13,122
 When I see your face

2
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,650
 My eyes just dilate

3
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,687
 But I can't erase

4
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:24,368
 That I wanna violate

5
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:27,604
- Hey, look. Parker's here.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:31,524
You're not looking?
He looks really cute in green.

7
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:35,003
Teal. He's reflected in the mirror.

8
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:42,331
When you spend all week with a boy,
you are allowed to look at him directly.

9
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:46,050
Not all week. We hung out,...

10
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,124
moderately incessantly.

11
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:52,365
But we're not here together tonight.
I don't wanna crowd him.

12
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:02,367
Hey. You guys ready to load up and go?

13
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,842
Almost. Buffy's lookin' at Parker.

14
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:08,369
Who, it turns out, has a reflection,
so big plus there.

15
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:12,926
- Buffy's having lusty wrong feelings.
- No, I'm not!

16
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:16,609
- No, you're not.
- Oh, I so am.

17
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,443
No, they're not wrong feelings,
cos there's no wrong.

18
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:25,331
You're free, you're both grown-ups.
You are free, right?

19
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:30,728
Hi. I just wanted to let you know
I'm headin' out.

20
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:35,365
And it's not real safe around here, so if you,
you know, walk back to your dorm...

21
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:38,490
How silly of me not to have planned ahead.

22
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,049
- Bye.
- See you, guys.

23
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,604
That was, like, the best set ever.

24
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:57,685
We'll do great in LA.
We'll have 'em glued to their seats.

25
00:01:57,773 --> 00:02:00,845
Uh, Devon? Aren't they supposed to dance?

26
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,606
Well, we can glue 'em to the dance floor.

27
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,049
I don't mean with real glue.

28
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,772
- You got that, right?
- I got that.

29
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,688
Willow?

30
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:18,803
- Harmony! Hi. I haven't seen you since...
- Since graduation.

31
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:21,408
- Big snake, huh?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:25,691
- So, how was your summer vacation?
- Oh, I was gonna go to France.

33
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:30,051
- But I didn't. I was dying to see the stores.
- Oh, and museums.

34
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:33,447
- Museums?
- Yeah. I heard they had 'em.

35
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,763
You know,
a rumour you pick up on the streets.

36
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:39,368
Right. You're always so funny, Willow.
You haven't changed a bit.

37
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:43,446
- No, you neither.
- Oh, maybe a little.

39
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:47,243
Back off, Harmony!

40
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,769
OK. Fine. Hide behind your boyfriend.

41
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,287
But guess what. I have a boyfriend too.

42
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:56,046
And he's gonna be mad
that you were mean to me.

43
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:05,002
- Hobbies?
- Yeah. Hobbies. Interests.

44
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:08,051
I feel like there's so much
I still don't know about you.

45
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,328
What do you like to do?

46
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:13,883
Well, mostly I hang out

47
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:16,567
and do stuff.

48
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:20,567
Yeah, I was into that for a while.

49
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:24,085
- What's that?
- What's what?

50
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,252
- You have a scar.
- Right.

51
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,403
Angry puppy.

52
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,928
So, do I get to see any of your scars?

53
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:44,209
- Oh, mine are all psychological.
- Oh, please. Those are the best kind.

54
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:48,412
Well, my father died last year.

55
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:53,928
Oh. God. Parker, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bring up that stuff.

56
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:57,801
- Bad, bad Buffy.
- No, no, I'm OK to talk about it now.

57
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:01,524
And I'm not doing the deep,
get-sympathy routine.

58
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:07,483
I mean, don't you just hate guys who are all
"I'm dark and brooding, so give me love?"

59
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,767
I don't think I've ever met that type.

60
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:20,049
I just wanted to say that...

61
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:26,332
what made it so sad was that there was
a lot of stuff he didn't get to finish.

62
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:29,563
It made me think about...

63
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:33,890
you know, living for now.

64
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,728
I think about that sometimes.

65
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:45,326
Yeah, I sort of... drowned
a couple of years ago.

66
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,651
But I came back. Obviously.

67
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:55,047
But I don't put stuff off any more.
Like you were saying.

68
00:05:55,613 --> 00:06:02,007
That's great. I mean, everybody says they
get it: "Oh, man, me too. Live for today."

69
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:05,847
But they really want an excuse
to goof off and not study for finals.

70
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,242
Also a valid life choice.

71
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,889
It's cool to find someone else
who understands.

72
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,249
So, Parker Abrams,

73
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:23,929
when you go to sleep tonight,
what are you gonna regret not doing today?

74
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:26,971
I'm going to regret

75
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,729
being too nervous to ask you to go
to the party at Wolf House tomorrow night.

76
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:36,572
- Do you wanna go to the party...
- Yes.

77
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,612
I'm not enjoying this.

78
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,208
Shelve them correctly and we can finish.

79
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:50,571
- I don't get your crazy system.
- My system? It's called the alphabet.

80
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,331
Huh. Would you look at that?

81
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,528
- You should lock your door.
- Believe me, I am kicking myself.

82
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,284
Anya?

83
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:10,612
Last time I saw you, fleeing in terror.
How'd that work out for ya?

84
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:13,163
I need to talk to Xander.

85
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:17,644
Go away.

86
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:23,323
Xander, come with me.

87
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:29,842
- Your mother said you were working here.
- Yeah. I need some money.

88
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:34,961
- So where is our relationship going?
- Our what? Our who?

89
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:39,331
Relationship. What kind do we have,
and what is it progressing toward?

90
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:43,122
I... We have a relationship?

91
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:45,489
We went to the prom.

92
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:49,329
Yes. On our one-and-only date.

93
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:52,007
Second date called
on account of snake, remember?

94
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:55,324
And there's the "you used
to be a man-killing demon" thing,

95
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:59,008
which, to be fair,
is as much my issue as it is yours.

96
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,366
I can't stop thinking about you.

97
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:06,128
Sometimes, in my dreams, you're all naked.

98
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:10,764
Really? If I'm in the checkout line
at the Wal-Mart, I've had that same one.

99
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:14,050
So, I can assume
a standing Friday-night date

100
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,601
and recognise prom night
as our anniversary?

101
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:20,527
Anya, slow down.
In fact, come to a screeching halt.

102
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:24,482
See, these things
kind of have to develop on their own.

103
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:28,122
- All right. How?
- I don't know.

104
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:31,250
Itjust... happens.

105
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,128
This is it. My door.

106
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:41,522
Wood. Maybe some kind of wood veneer.

107
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:44,484
It's nice.

108
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:50,369
Hey! Hi.

109
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:52,683
Hi. Remember Harmony?

110
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:56,607
She's back from her summer vacation.
And she's a little different.

111
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:58,684
- Different?
- Paler.

112
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:02,322
- Is your neck OK?
- Neck. Paler.

113
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:04,530
Puppy. The angry puppy!

114
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:08,003
Yeah. We came to warn you
about the angry puppy.

115
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:13,451
- I should take care of this now.
- I'll pick you up tomorrow night for the party.

116
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,524
I can't wait.

117
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,683
Band-Aid. Now.

118
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,924
Thank you.

119
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:28,804
Harmony's a vampire?
She must be dying without a reflection.

120
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:32,647
She just made me so mad.
"My boyfriend's gonna beat you up."

121
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,406
- "My boyfriend"?
- Well, if you believe her.

122
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:40,521
She always lied about stuff like that. "He goes
to another school. You wouldn't know him."

123
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:44,401
Devon dated her for a while,
but she was too flaky for him, which...

124
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:46,848
Stop and marvel at the concept.

125
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:51,609
A guy dating Harmony dead. Must be, like,
the most tolerant guy in the world.

126
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,404
Hi, baby. I'm back.

127
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:25,810
It's definitely the crypt? I'm not keen
on tunnelling into someone's septic tank.

128
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,646
It's the crypt. The radar soundings are clear.

129
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:33,769
The walls are thinnest here at the bottom.
We have to tunnel from underneath.

130
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:36,447
More work, but I'm sure...

131
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:42,645
You'd better be more than sure, mate.
Cos I'd hate to have to hurt you.

132
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,644
I swear. I swear.

133
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:48,331
How's my little blondie bear?

134
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,412
Harm, does this look like a good time to talk?

135
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:54,530
Are you gonna kill Willow today?
Cos I want you to say:

136
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:58,811
"This is for messing with my sweet girl."
And then, you know...

137
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:06,684
Nobody knows I'm here.

138
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:11,847
Killing the Slayer's best friend would tend to
announce I'm back. We're too bloody close.

139
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:14,572
You almost killed her last year.
Why the big deal?

140
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:18,566
Sod off! Go eat something.
I've got work to do.

141
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:30,082
- This one tastes funny. Take me out to eat.
- He's perfectly fresh.

142
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:36,049
I had a math class with him last year.
I didn't like him then, either.

143
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,806
- Harm!
- I wanna go to a party!

144
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:47,447
Ooh. Right here, baby? In front of Brian?

145
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:51,205
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Maybe I would.

146
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:55,009
After a party.

147
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:03,764
Tonight. I'll take you somewhere nice.

148
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:10,887
 Standin' in the pouring rain

149
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:13,771
 Cos you couldn't even be there
to pick me up

150
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:16,367
 You're taking me for granted again

151
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:19,126
 You're running out of time
and you're out of luck

152
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:22,171
 Just a moment of weakness...

153
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:25,684
This is some party, huh? Last days of Rome.

154
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:27,968
Better. No old Romans.

155
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:34,171
- You wanna dance?
- No. Let's have a meaningful talk instead.

156
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:38,964
Spike.

157
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:43,443
- And Harmony.
- Buffy. Hi.

158
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,972
What a cute outfit - last year.

159
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:49,851
Well, this is interesting.

160
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:52,608
It's sort of a double date.

161
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:56,768
Looks like your friend
started the party a little early, huh?

162
00:12:57,093 --> 00:13:00,244
Say, let's have a look at the new boy.

163
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,611
Hi. I'm Parker.

164
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:06,965
I like him.

165
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,849
He's got... What's the word? Vulnerability.

166
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,527
And you with Harmony.
What, did you lose a bet?

167
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:15,284
Hey!

168
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:19,446
Actually, how we met,
it's a funny story really.

169
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,124
Stay here.

170
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:50,451
What's the matter, Spike?
Dru dump you again?

171
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,604
Maybe I dumped her.

172
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:58,970
She left him for a fungus demon.
That's all he talks about.

173
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:01,044
Harm!

174
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,844
We are going.

175
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,971
It isn't time yet.

176
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,682
Yeah. But as soon as we have
the Gem of Amara, you're gonna be sorr...

177
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:11,764
What? Ow!

178
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,725
Come in.

179
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,522
Anya. Hi again.

180
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:42,765
Your mother sent me around. She also said to
add fabric softener when the timer goes off.

181
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:45,447
- Can we talk some more?
- Yeah, I suppose.

182
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:49,531
Would you care for somethin'?
I have cran-apple.

183
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,844
All right.

184
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:58,086
You know, it is customary
to call before you show up. Not that...

185
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:05,365
Yeah, Spike with Harmony.
If you can believe it.

186
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:09,332
I couldn't figure out why he ran away,
but Harmony said something.

187
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:14,168
Why they were here. They were looking
for the Gem of something. Um, Amara?

188
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,403
The Gem of Amara? Are you sure?

189
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:21,123
- Yeah. What's up?
- Oh, it's just it's not real.

190
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:25,445
It's like the vampire equivalent
of the Holy Grail.

191
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:29,924
A source of some enormous power,
always conveniently vague.

192
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,364
Here it is. Yes.

193
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:38,332
"There was a great deal of vampiric interest
in locating the Gem during..."

194
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,404
Oh, the 10th century.

195
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:44,088
"Questing vampires combed the earth,
but no one found it."

196
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:46,289
"It was concluded that it never existed."

197
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:50,366
Well, Spike seems to think it exists.
And he's lookin' in Sunnydale.

198
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:53,206
Yes, well, I'll research it as best I can.

199
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:55,962
You've done all you can for tonight.
Go to bed.

200
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:59,443
Uh-huh. Sleepy. Yawn. Bye.

201
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:08,652
- Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?
- No.

202
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,212
Oh.

203
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:13,842
- Can I make him a vampire?
- No.

204
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:19,489
Wait. On second thought, yeah.
Go do that.

205
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:22,886
Take your time.
Do Melanie and the kids as well.

206
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:26,807
Hey, I don't have a pulse. Cool!

207
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:30,932
Can we eat a doctor, so I can get a
stethoscope and hear my heart not beating?

208
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:36,292
Harm, what does it take
to get you to shut the hell up?

209
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:45,768
And if my heart's not beating,
then what are all these veins for?

210
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,601
I'm simply covered in these blue veins.

211
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:52,604
See?

212
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:12,562
We've got an extra set of chains.

213
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:15,645
Eeuw! Just because Dorkus went in for that...

214
00:17:17,013 --> 00:17:19,607
- Dru-silla.
- Whatever.

215
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:23,848
- Say her name.
- Dorkus.

216
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,925
- Bite your tongue.
- Do it for me.

217
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,328
At which point the matter is concluded,

218
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:40,850
with both parties satisfied and able
to move on with their separate lives.

219
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,401
To sum up, I think it's a workable plan.

220
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:46,605
So, the crux of this plan is?

221
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:49,844
Sexual intercourse.
I've said it, like, a dozen times.

222
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:54,165
Uh-huh. Just working through
a little hysterical deafness here.

223
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:58,690
I think it's the secret to getting you
out of my mind. Putting you behind me.

224
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:02,561
Behind me figuratively. I'm thinking
face to face for the event itself.

225
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,723
Ah. Right.

226
00:18:06,013 --> 00:18:09,164
It's just we hardly know each other.
I mean, I like you.

227
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:13,241
And you have a certain...
directness that I admire.

228
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,324
But sexual inter...

229
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,732
What you're talking about, well...

230
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:23,804
And I'm actually turning
into a woman as I say this...

231
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:28,330
But it's about expressing something.
And accepting consequences.

232
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:30,927
Oh, I have condoms. Some are black.

233
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:35,371
That's... That's very considerate.

234
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,485
I like you. You're funny,
and you're nicely shaped.

235
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:44,125
And, frankly, it's ludicrous to have these
interlocking bodies and not interlock.

236
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:47,529
Please remove your clothing now.

237
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:52,128
And the amazing thing?

238
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,722
Still more romantic than Faith.

239
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,604
Fabric softener.

240
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:20,926
Parker. I was afraid
I wasn't gonna be able to find you.

241
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:24,050
- I was getting a little worried.
- I'm so sorry.

242
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:28,524
It's just the English guy is an old friend.

243
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:32,045
And he's not supposed to drink.

244
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,966
And I saw him here, you know,
in the land of the beer...

245
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:38,443
Buffy, it's OK.
You did a good thing for your friend.

246
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:44,286
Did you and he used to, like, go out?

247
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:49,002
No.

248
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,967
No, we really, really didn't.

249
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:55,604
Good.

250
00:19:57,773 --> 00:20:00,526
Now, we have time to make up for.

251
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:05,972
Think I could get a dance
with the prettiest girl at the party?

252
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:08,521
And what do I do?
Just stand here and watch?

253
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:16,210
 It was a Monday when

254
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,682
 My lover told me

255
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:22,448
 "Never pay the Reaper with

256
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,524
 Love only"

257
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:27,286
 What could I say to you

258
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:30,126
 Except "I love you"

259
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:33,842
 And "I'd give my life for yours"?

260
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,208
 I know we are

261
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:39,410
 We are the lucky ones

262
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:42,287
 I know we are

263
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:45,490
 We are the lucky ones

264
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:48,041
 I know we are

265
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:51,921
 We are the lucky ones, dear

266
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:03,087
Well, I declared pre-med, but I hated it.
So I switched to history.

267
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:08,365
History? Fascinating dates
and compelling places.

268
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:12,207
But there's something amazing
about these huge events,

269
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:15,683
that when you dig down into them,
they're all about people.

270
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:18,924
Just regular people
just trying to make choices.

271
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:25,562
When you look back, it seems like they were
swept up in events they couldn't control.

272
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:27,928
But I don't believe that.

273
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:31,323
You always have a choice
with everything you do.

274
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:47,484
Is this OK?

275
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,808
Because I could stop if you wanted.
It's your choice.

276
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:57,604
What are you doing?

277
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:01,764
Making a choice.

278
00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:09,450
 I know, I know, I know, I know

279
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:12,366
 I know, I know

280
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:15,286
 I know, I know

281
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:18,843
 It's time to let you know

282
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:21,493
 Time to let you know

283
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,610
 Time to let you know

284
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:31,690
 Time to sit here and say...

285
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:41,847
Hey. This is Buffy and Willow. We're not in
right now, so please leave a message.

286
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:46,404
Buffy, are you there?
Call me. I need to talk to you right away.

287
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,443
 We are the lucky ones

288
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:54,001
 I know we are

289
00:22:54,093 --> 00:22:58,211
 We are the lucky ones, dear

290
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,772
 Dear

291
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:04,210
 We are the lucky ones, dear

292
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:05,612
 Dear

293
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:09,652
 We are the lucky ones, dear

294
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,164
Parker?

295
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:54,643
OK. Just a shirt...

296
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:59,810
Pants. Everybody needs pants.

297
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:04,004
- Hey, you're up.
- You're here.

298
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:08,846
- I live here.
- Oh, I just... I didn't know where you were.

299
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:12,369
It seemed like you were gonna be
out for a while, so I ran for coffee.

300
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:17,163
It's better than what I've got around here -
warm soda and breath mints.

301
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:20,643
Breath mints.
Wouldn't be turning 'em down right now.

302
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,366
So, do you have plans today, or...?

303
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:27,445
Actually, my mom's coming to visit.

304
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:31,772
Oh. Well, I'll just clear out, then.

305
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:37,082
But maybe we could,
you know, talk or something later?

306
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:40,970
- Absolutely. I'll give you a call.
- Great.

307
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:45,089
- Oh, one more thing before I go.
- A kiss?

308
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:48,132
Well, I was going to go with pants, but...

309
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:50,764
a kiss is good too.

310
00:25:02,213 --> 00:25:04,522
So, I'm over you now.

311
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:10,844
OK.

312
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:13,964
OK?

313
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:16,644
Yeah?

314
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:30,408
Harm, what are you doing?

315
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:34,244
I'm writing "Spike loves Harmony"
on your back.

316
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:38,050
- Why?
- I don't know. It's fun. I'm bored.

317
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:40,804
You can write on me.

318
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:44,763
Got to get back to work.

319
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:48,002
You love that tunnel more than me.

320
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:51,321
I love syphilis more than you.

321
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:01,853
- Good morning.
- Giles!

322
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:05,851
- I didn't know you were here.
- Oh, really?

323
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:08,324
I was... studying.

324
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:11,488
At the library.

325
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:13,689
All Saturday night.

326
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:17,645
You know what? I'm an adult
and it's none of your business.

327
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:22,443
And I'm sincerely relieved to hear it.
Now, can we discuss the impending disaster?

328
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:24,683
- Giles found something.
- A text.

329
00:26:24,773 --> 00:26:28,925
It refers to the Gem of Amara
as residing in the "Valley of the Sun".

330
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:32,767
- Demon fancy talk for Sunnydale.
- It seems Spike may know what it's about.

331
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:37,165
The Gem may exist after all, in Sunnydale,
in a sealed underground crypt.

332
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:41,963
Why don't you guys try and locate the crypt?
I'll see if I can find Spike before he gets there.

333
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:45,841
- I'll get started.
- I'll tell Xander and Oz to meet at your place.

334
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,491
Right.

335
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:52,285
It happened, right?
Did it happen? With Parker?

336
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:55,772
- Yeah, it happened.
- Well, and? Details!

337
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:58,287
I mean, not details. I don't need a diagram.

338
00:26:58,373 --> 00:27:01,683
But, you know,
like, maybe a blurry watercolour.

339
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:06,686
It was nice. It was really nice. He's gonna call.

340
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:09,287
I love this part. Don't you love this part?

341
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:12,126
When it's all new
and everything's a discovery?

342
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:15,924
I don't know. I guess I do.

343
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:20,050
- It's here!
- I knew it was here.

344
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:22,601
We're close now.

345
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:27,050
No one leaves the lair till we're in. I don't
want the Slayer tracking us to the tunnel.

346
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:30,170
That means you, Harm.
You're an indoor kitty now.

347
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:32,687
But, Spike, you said you'd take me places.

348
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:36,686
You said we'd go to France,
and now I can't even leave the lair?

349
00:27:40,773 --> 00:27:43,765
Listen to me, you stupid bint.

350
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:47,845
This Gem is everything.

351
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,443
I came back to Sunnydale for it.

352
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:55,607
A place which has witnessed
some truly spectacular kickings of my ass.

353
00:27:56,213 --> 00:28:01,082
Now, when I have the Gem,
they all die, don't worry.

354
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:04,172
But until then, stay inside.

355
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:09,642
And by the way, I would be insanely happy

356
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:14,853
if from this point on I heard bugger all
about sodding France!

357
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:21,565
I don't know why I let you be so mean to me.

358
00:28:22,173 --> 00:28:24,164
Love hurts, baby.

359
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:28,325
 Water turns to sand

360
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:28,853
 And turns to sound

361
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:31,287
 And turns to sound

362
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:36,562
 Follow me, I'm goin'

363
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:39,247
 Underground

364
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:43,969
 This orbit is

365
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:46,487
 An interlude

366
00:28:49,653 --> 00:28:52,690
 Temporary, planetary food

367
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:57,085
You've got one new message, at 9.05pm.

368
00:28:57,173 --> 00:29:00,961
Hi, it's me. I'm at Giles'.
Did Parker call yet?

369
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:06,889
 Lend me your fire

370
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:09,248
 So I can burn

371
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,763
 Save all my ashes

372
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,447
 For my return

373
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:22,369
 Not with a scream

374
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:25,126
 But with a sigh

375
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:55,849
It's real.

376
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:58,688
Ooh. Pretty.

377
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,164
Can I take stuff?

378
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:04,447
Take whatever you want. I don't care.

379
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,923
Eeuw! Like you're too good to work a clasp.

380
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,967
So? Is it doing it?

381
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,524
Do you feel it?

382
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:42,322
I mean, you don't look any different,
if you wondered.

383
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:46,606
I thought maybe you'd look taller,
or glow, or something.

384
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:59,689
You should put some butter on that.
But, hey, maybe it's worth money anyway.

385
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:04,972
And then we could go to France and stay in
a chateau, and you could take me shopping...

386
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,367
I can't believe you just did that!

387
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,051
Hold on.

388
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:23,766
What are you doing, you big freak?

389
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,522
- That's my Gem.
- Don't...

390
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:31,926
Fine! Fine! If that's all that matters to you,
then just take it. Take it.

391
00:31:32,013 --> 00:31:34,004
Take it and get out!

392
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:36,524
That's a good idea.

393
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:40,848
I think I'll go play outside.

394
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:49,051
OK, either I'm borrowing
all your albums or I'm movin' in.

395
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:52,762
There are more important things
than records right now.

396
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:55,242
More important than this one?

397
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:59,892
- I suppose an argument could be made for...
- Whoa! Giles has a TV!

398
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:03,966
Everybody, Giles has a TV.
He's shallow, like us.

399
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:09,165
- I gotta admit, a little disappointed.
- Maybe it doesn't work. It's, like, art.

400
00:32:09,253 --> 00:32:13,132
And in breaking local news,
area residents face traffic disruptions...

401
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:15,204
Public television.

402
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:20,209
Look, come on, we have vital work to do.
Watching television won't help us right now.

403
00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:22,648
..near the UC Sunnydale campus.

404
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:27,966
Officials attributed the unusual occurrence
to weakening of the topsoil support nearby.

405
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:31,682
City work crews deny that any tunnelling
has been done in the area.

406
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:33,809
Tunnelling.

407
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:36,566
Spike. Come on.

408
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:39,447
Xander, find Buffy and meet us there.

409
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:56,970
I mean, it hit me hard, you know? My dad.

410
00:32:57,533 --> 00:33:02,402
Since then I just don't put stuff off any more.
It's about living for now.

411
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:06,251
- Parker?
- Buffy.

412
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:10,210
Buffy Summers, this is Katie Loomis.

413
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:13,004
What's going on?

414
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:17,926
Hey, Katie, you're gonna be late for class.
I'll catch up later, OK?

415
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:24,687
- She's a friend of yours?
- Yeah. You'd like her a bunch.

416
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:27,444
So, what's up?

417
00:33:28,013 --> 00:33:31,210
Well,... you didn't call.

418
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:36,449
I mean, I'd understand, you know,
if you were busy, or sick, or something.

419
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:41,084
It's only been a couple of days.
You need to talk to me about something?

420
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:44,051
- Is everything OK?
- Sure it is.

421
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:46,930
- It is?
- Sure.

422
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:51,128
So, maybe do you wanna do something?

423
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:55,970
- We could do that. Absolutely.
- Great. How about tonight?

424
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:02,363
Well, the thing is I think I'm supposed
to get together with some people later.

425
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,365
Parker,... did I...

426
00:34:11,613 --> 00:34:14,969
- Did I do something wrong?
- Something wrong?

427
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:19,128
No, of course not. It was fun.

428
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:21,764
Didn't you have fun?

429
00:34:22,253 --> 00:34:25,211
Watch out how you answer that.
My ego is fragile.

430
00:34:25,293 --> 00:34:27,284
You had fun.

431
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:31,687
- Is that all it was?
- Well, what else was it supposed to be?

432
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:38,641
It seemed... like... you liked me.

433
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:40,890
I do.

434
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:44,807
But I'm starting to feel like
you thought that meant... What?

435
00:34:44,893 --> 00:34:49,444
Some kind of commitment? I mean,
is that really what you want right now?

436
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:53,968
I just thought...

437
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:58,131
Look, I'm sorry
if you misunderstood something.

438
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,441
I thought things were pretty clear.

439
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:04,048
I didn't mean to mis...

440
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:06,564
I'm sorry.

441
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:10,845
Look, I really have to go now.

442
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,524
Parker, wait.

443
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:25,366
- I did this all wrong.
- No, it's cool. We'll hook up later.

444
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:29,367
Well, that was pathetic.

445
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,124
Isn't it a fantastic day?

446
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:38,728
Birds singin', squirrels making
lots of rotten little squirrels,

447
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:42,283
sun beamin' down in a nice, non-fatal way.
It's very exciting.

448
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,523
Can't wait to see if I freckle.

449
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:55,970
Oh, do it again.

450
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:59,248
It tickles. You know, in a good way.

451
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:01,364
- The Gem.
- Oh, yeah.

452
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:03,650
The Gem of Amara.

453
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:09,446
Official sponsor of my killing you.

454
00:36:16,693 --> 00:36:18,684
Harmony?

455
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:22,443
Being a vampire sucks.

456
00:36:26,013 --> 00:36:28,004
Buffy!

457
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:34,925
Xander. I was looking for you.
You weren't in your musty basement.

458
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:37,402
- Have you seen Buffy?
- No.

459
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:42,252
About what happened.
Well, when I said I was over you, I...

460
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,927
Anya, I don't have time.

461
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:51,442
Harmony, where's Spike?

462
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,050
Does he have the Gem?

463
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:59,603
He staked me, and then he took it.

464
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:04,369
He tried to take it right off my finger.
Like I wouldn't have just given it to him.

465
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:09,811
I would've given him anything he wanted.
He was my platinum baby, and I loved him.

466
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,884
Where did Spike go?

467
00:37:48,453 --> 00:37:50,683
Getting tired, Slayer?

468
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:01,203
Xander, get out of here!

469
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:09,208
So, you let Parker take a poke, eh?

470
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:11,761
Didn't seem like
you knew each other that well.

471
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:15,368
What exactly did it take to pry apart
the Slayer's dimpled knees?

472
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:17,011
You're a pig, Spike.

473
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:21,806
Did he play the sensitive lad
and get you to seduce him?

474
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:25,044
That's a good trick
if the girl's thick enough to buy it.

475
00:38:28,213 --> 00:38:31,205
I wonder what you did wrong. Too strong?

476
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:33,729
Did you bruise the boy?

477
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:37,766
Whatever.
Guess you're not worth a second go.

478
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:41,842
Come to think of it, someone told me
as much. Who was that? Oh, yeah.

479
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,924
Angel.

480
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,845
- Take it off me this way, we both burn.
- Really?

481
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:01,412
Let's see.

482
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:06,209
Ow! God!

483
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:16,050
I like it.

484
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:19,125
- It's small.
- Really worth getting my ribs bashed in.

485
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:22,365
It's obviously very dangerous.
Destroying it would...

486
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:24,762
We don't destroy it.

487
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:30,081
But, Buffy, any vampire that gets his hands
on this is going to be essentially unkillable.

488
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:32,286
Oh.

489
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:39,648
- I have that gig in LA. I could swing by.
- Thanks, Oz.

490
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:42,008
What's goin' on? What's in LA?

491
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:44,926
She's giving the ring to Angel.
Don't make a fuss.

492
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:48,048
Buffy, are you sure?

493
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,203
He should have it.

494
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:59,046
So what I'm wondering is,
does this always happen?

495
00:39:59,853 --> 00:40:02,925
Sleep with a guy and he goes all evil?

496
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,045
God, I'm just a fool.

497
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:10,206
Well, maybe you made a mistake.
But that's OK. Next time...

498
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:12,843
What?

499
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:19,207
Parker said it's OK to make mistakes.
It was sweet.

500
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:21,969
No, it wasn't.

501
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:25,682
He was saying that so you would
take a chance and sleep with him.

502
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:28,048
He's a poophead.

503
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,609
You're right.

504
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:33,605
He's manipulative, and shallow...

505
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:37,808
And why doesn't he want me?
Am I repulsive?

506
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:41,442
If there was something repulsive
about me, you'd tell me, right?

507
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:45,208
I'm your friend.
I would call you "repulsive" in a second.

508
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:50,126
Maybe Parker and I could still work it out.

509
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:53,128
Do you think we could still work it out?

510
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:57,809
I think you're missing something
about the whole poophead principle.

511
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:05,452
You go on ahead.
I think I'm gonna go take a walk.

512
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:07,842
- You sure?
- Yeah.

513
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:48,129
