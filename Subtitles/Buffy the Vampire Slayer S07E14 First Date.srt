<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:04,431 --> 00:00:05,420
<i>(Xander)</i> You killed your best friend.

3
00:00:05,511 --> 00:00:08,583
lt didn't work cos there wasn't enough blood.

4
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:11,301
Maybe that's what the First needed Spike for.

5
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:14,225
- We don't have time to baby-sit a hostage.
- l'll be good.

6
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:17,462
Somebody left this in the courtyard.
l was just returning it.

7
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,827
- That's some full-service principalling.
- l try.

8
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:22,185
Agh!

9
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:24,946
There must be a reason
why the chip is going wonky.

10
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:29,786
His chip. We can either repair it...
or remove it.

11
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:30,860
Robson!

12
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:37,026
Robson blacked out, but the last thing he
remembers is Giles's head about to be axed.

13
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:39,386
lt's started....

14
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,981
l understand. l'll take care...

15
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,145
lt was extraordinary good luck, of course.

16
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,381
And training - years of training.

17
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,348
Chao-Ahn, keep up.

18
00:00:57,431 --> 00:01:02,903
You're new here, Chao-Ahn.
Take note. Remember about training.

19
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:08,782
But l honestly feel the largest part of it
was instinct. lnstinct and reflexes.

20
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:12,341
There's a sort of wary watchfulness
l developed over the years.

21
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,422
lt's like another sense.

22
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:16,743
Spike!

23
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:21,184
- Hey! You're not in pain.
- Hey! You're not the First.

24
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:24,741
- What?
- Anya said you were the First. You were evil.

25
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:27,948
You're supposed to be all go-throughable.

26
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:31,501
Then what did you tackle me for, you berk?
What's that supposed to do?

27
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,263
l didn't think of that.

28
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:38,471
More importantly, you just hit me.
Why didn't your chip go off?

29
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,223
Yeah, well...

30
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:43,189
Well, when we were at the lnitiative...

31
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:48,709
- There was a choice.
- Right. Either repair the chip, or remove it.

32
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,624
You had it remov... You removed the chip?

33
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:53,546
Yeah.

34
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:56,065
- <i>(Spike)</i> Had to make a choice.
- lt really is OK.

35
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:58,824
- What's a chip?
- They removed the chip?

37
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:06,425
- You know this is very dangerous.
- You just heard the horror stories.

38
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:10,299
Wear hoops, they'll catch, rip your lobe off.
Lobes flying everywhere.

39
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,269
That's not what l'm talking about.

40
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:17,701
You mean Spike not having a chip.
Free-range Spike.

41
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:22,911
l have to ask. Why on earth
did you make that decision?

42
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:26,381
l guess it was instinct,
like you were talking about.

43
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:29,862
l made that up!

44
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,580
l knew the Bringer was there
because his shoes squeaked.

45
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,583
Buffy, it's crucial
that we keep these girls safe.

46
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,741
l can't count the dangers.

47
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,982
The First, the Bringers,
random demons, and now Spike.

48
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,982
- And the principal.
- What?

49
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,540
Oh, nothing much. He was in
the school basement, holding a shovel,

50
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:50,303
acting evasive.

51
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:53,747
Plus, he's got that whole
"too charming to be real" thing going on.

52
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:57,506
- l'm looking into it.
- Well, that sounds very responsible of you.

53
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:00,549
Balances out
the "vampire on the loose" issue.

54
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:04,860
Nothing's changed, Giles.
Spike had a chip before, remember?

55
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:08,660
When the First had him kill
and sire all those people.

56
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:12,221
We have no idea if his chip was working then.

57
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:17,339
A new chip might restrain him should
the First attempt to activate him again.

58
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:21,265
Spike has a soul now. That's what's
gonna stop him from hurting people.

59
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:25,424
- Buffy...
- He can be a good man, Giles. l feel it.

60
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:30,585
But he's never gonna get there
if we don't give him the chance.

61
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:36,265
Buffy, l want more for you.

62
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:41,186
Your feelings for him are colouring
yourjudgment. l can hear it in your voice.

63
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:44,547
That way lies a future filled with pain.
l don't want that for you.

64
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,622
We haven't...

65
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:50,461
Things are different since he came back.

66
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:55,341
lt doesn't matter if you're not physical with
each other any more. There's a connection.

67
00:04:55,431 --> 00:05:00,221
You rely on him, he relies on you.
That's what's affecting yourjudgment.

68
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:03,701
You think l'm losing sight
of the big picture, but l'm not.

69
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,626
When Spike had that chip, it was like
having him in a muzzle. lt was wrong.

70
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:13,068
You can't beat evil by doing evil. l know that.

71
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:17,941
Well, l hope you're right.
You're gambling with a lot of lives.

72
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:34,145
Hi, can l help? You seem kinda confused.

73
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:40,066
- You aren't wearing a green apron.
- Confused, but sort of randomly observant.

74
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:43,541
Sorry, l just mean...
you don't work here, right?

75
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:45,906
No. Right. Just helpful.

76
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,066
- l'm Xander.
- Lissa.

77
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,065
And l guess l could use some advice.

78
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:56,780
- l can't tell if l've got the right rope.
- That depends what it's for.

79
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:01,069
Something functional around the house,
or, you know, recreational.

80
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:04,780
By which l mean, for example,
boating or mountain climbing.

81
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:07,590
Not for tying someone up for sexy, funky fun.

82
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:12,300
ln conclusion, rope can be
useful in various ways.

83
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:17,030
- l have a kayak.
- Again with the random. l like it.

84
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,830
Sorry. l need to store my kayak.

85
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,870
So l was thinking maybe l could suspend it
from the ceiling in the garage

86
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:27,546
- with ropes and a pulley, or a winch thing.
- Not a bad plan.

87
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:31,067
You'll need stronger rope.
Wanna have coffee with me later?

88
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:32,266
What?

89
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,821
Oh, you're the only one
that gets to be random?

90
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:54,022
Now, if l were a sign of being evil,
where would l... be?

91
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,467
- Buffy?
- Oh, Principal Wood. lt's you.

92
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:14,543
- You looking for something?
- File folders. And mechanical pencils.

93
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:17,623
l wanna write on a file folder
with a mechanical pencil.

94
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:20,908
The supply cabinet
in the outer office has those things.

95
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:24,950
Oh, this isn't a supply cabinet? My bad.

96
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:26,430
OK. Thanks.

97
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:29,742
- Hey, Buffy...
- Yeah?

98
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:32,629
Um... What are you doing tonight?

99
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,545
Preparing for tomorrow's
counselling sessions.

100
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,462
No, really.

101
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:41,066
Watching a reality show about a millionaire.

102
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:46,305
Well, then... l'd like to take you out to dinner,
if that's all right with you.

103
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:51,829
l mean, you don't have to. l'm not saying
come to dinner if you enjoy having a job.

104
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:56,860
l may have to make up a document saying
l didn'tjust say that and have you sign it.

105
00:07:56,951 --> 00:08:00,148
Sure. l'd be happy to have dinner with you.

106
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:03,703
Great. l'll draw up the paperwork.

107
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:47,264
- So he asked you out to dinner?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:49,819
lsn't that weird? He's a principal.

109
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:53,984
He's a young, hot principal with earrings,
but he's a principal.

110
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:58,110
Why do you think he asked me out?
He could be interested, right?

111
00:08:58,191 --> 00:09:01,024
Yeah, sure. You're a frisky vixen.

112
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:04,147
Or it could be work-related.

113
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:08,019
Maybe l'm getting promoted
for doing such a good job.

114
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:11,660
Oh, right. That makes sense too.

115
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:16,783
Or maybe he knows that l suspect he's
up to something and he's going to kill me.

116
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:19,465
Well, you'll have to dress for the ambiguity.

117
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:21,621
He's not even acting that suspicious.

118
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:25,590
lt's just - there he is.
On the Hellmouth. All day, every day.

119
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:29,505
That's gotta be like being showered
with evil. Only from underneath.

120
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:34,581
- Not really a shower.
- A bidet. Like a bidet of evil.

121
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:39,222
Buff, if he's really interested,
are you interested back?

122
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:42,349
l don't know.

123
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:48,427
He's good-looking, and he's solid.
He's smart. He's normal.

124
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,741
So, not the wicked energy, which is nice.

125
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:53,903
l don't want to only be
attracted to wicked energy.

126
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:57,620
Or what if he is wicked?
ls that why l'm attracted to him?

127
00:09:57,711 --> 00:10:02,546
l'm gonna wait for that sentence
to come around again before l jump on.

128
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:06,783
You know what? Yeah, l think l like him.

129
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:10,989
- And he'd be good for me.
- Right. Help you move on.

130
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,780
Why does everybody in this house
think l'm still in love with Spike?

131
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:19,262
No, l meant move on from
this imposed super-self-reliance.

132
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,990
Let somebody get close.

133
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,106
Oh.

134
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:25,466
- Hey, someone's here.
- Guys, guess what?

135
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:28,145
- Buffy got a date!
- No, l did.

136
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:34,471
- Fine way to steal my thunder.
- Sorry.

137
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,509
lt's Principal Wood,
and l think he's aligned with the First.

138
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:42,301
- Also, like, ten years older than you.
- Which is 100 years younger than your type!

139
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,542
Yay. Someone who doesn't remember
the lndustrial Revolution.

140
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,542
l think they'll end up making out.

141
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:52,386
"Oh, Principal Wood," she'll gasp,
"l love your lack of wicked energy."

142
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:55,585
Watch it, or you can talk
about your new girlfriend

143
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:58,139
who you hold hands with
under the dinner table.

144
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,903
ls yours evil, Xander?

145
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:02,983
Well, there's a good chance,
but l'm hoping for the best.

146
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:06,188
We're going for coffee. She has a kayak...

147
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:09,149
Dear lord, l hate that mall.

148
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:14,066
The shop assistants are rude,
and everything in the food court is sticky.

149
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:17,063
- Looks like you found her some stuff.
- Oh, hello. Yes.

150
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:21,269
That's gotta be rough.
Getting pulled out of your home,

151
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:24,582
being told you're a potential slayer
and not to bring anything.

152
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:27,708
Yes, and the language barrier is formidable.

153
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,942
l was concerned that
my Mandarin is a little thin.

154
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:34,421
As it turns out, she speaks Cantonese,
which is thinner.

155
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:40,108
But we muddled through and, as l suspected,
ice cream is a universal language.

156
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:48,261
What'd she say?

157
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,467
She's grateful to be in a land of plenty.

158
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,950
Let's... go and put away your new clothes.

159
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:01,665
Will, you think you can do
a computer check on Principal Wood?

160
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:04,709
Yeah, sure. Want me to check
your girl out too, Xand?

161
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,784
Nope. l'm goin' in blind.
l'm gonna be an optimist about this.

162
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:12,546
Why go looking for trouble?
lf it's gonna find you, it's gonna find you.

163
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:17,469
"Getting the most out of
your new microwave." Nice.

164
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:23,029
"Clock comma setting the - page 3."

165
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:27,346
You don't need a manual, it's intuitive.

166
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:31,743
There's a button marked "Clock set",
for pity's sake. What kind of a nerd are you?

167
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:36,029
- No wonder you crashed yourjet pack.
- No... Get thee behind me.

168
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:38,306
l rebuke thee.

169
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,586
Take that, the First!

170
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,582
Look, you monkey.

171
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:50,824
Ooh! Ahh! lt burns
as it ineffectually passes through me.

172
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:56,863
l'm not corporeal, remember.
Also, not a vampire, so... a cross?

173
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,989
What do you want from me,
Jonathan slash the First?

174
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:07,542
- l have an assignment for you.
- l follow Buffy's orders now.

175
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:13,342
l'm redeeming myself for... killing you.
l mean, for... killing Jonathan.

176
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:17,219
Really? Why? So you can earn
a spot on her little pep squad?

177
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:20,860
You think she'll ever let you in?
You're a murderer.

178
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:26,344
Confidentially, a lot of her people
are murderers - Anya and Willow and Spike.

179
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:30,390
lnteresting. And you're the only one
she makes seek redemption.

180
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:34,100
- Does that seem fair to you?
- l guess not.

181
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:37,263
You know we're headed
toward a fight, don't you?

182
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,147
Yeah.

183
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:41,064
What do you think the world's
gonna be like after that?

184
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:45,622
Newsflash - there's not gonna be
a slayer gang any more.

185
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:47,827
But there is going to be evil.

186
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,869
And as long as there is evil, l live.

187
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:54,864
And as long as l live,
you can dwell at my side.

188
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:57,949
That sounds nice.

189
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:00,864
Your assignment isn't hard. They're just girls.

190
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:03,670
- You want me to hurt the girls?
- No, not all of them.

191
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:07,266
Not Dawn, not Anya, not Willow,
and not your friend Buffy.

192
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:09,706
Just the potential slayers.

193
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,986
That's... horrible.

194
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:15,947
l'm gonna scream and get Buffy in here.

195
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:21,503
She can't see me. l'm gonna keep talking till
you hear what l have to say, so listen up.

196
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:24,583
The girls must die.

197
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:30,302
l could never do that.

198
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:35,511
All those girls, all that blood.
l didn't like the stabbing before.

199
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:38,424
You don't have to stab. This'll be easy.

200
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,025
Andrew, l want you to think.

201
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:46,902
Willow brought something to this house -
something good, something you can use.

202
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:50,466
The new microwave?

203
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:53,111
The gun.

204
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:57,630
l want you to think hard.
Where did they put the gun?

205
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,422
Hmm.

206
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:07,542
l don't think it's really a date.
That's what l think.

207
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:09,383
Well, it is unclear.

208
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:14,465
That's why my top says l'm comfortable in
a stodgy office or a swinging casual setting.

209
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:16,667
Or killing you, if you're a demon.

210
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:19,390
lt also says "l sometimes
get blood on my shoulder."

211
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,666
Or it might be pizza.

212
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:25,061
- l don't think l can fix it.
- Thanks for trying.

213
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:30,741
l wasn't talking about your date. l was
talking about this sham date of Xander's.

214
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:34,870
- l think it's part of a plan to make me jealous.
- Well, it's not working.

215
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:38,387
Are you nuts? Of course it's working.
Observe my bitter ranting.

216
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,304
Hear the shrill edge of hysteria in my voice.

217
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,463
l should really go find
something else to wear.

218
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:48,146
Fine, go. Leave me here
to stew in my impotent rage.

219
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:55,899
l'm also gonna pee,
so you should probably go.

220
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,980
You look nice.

221
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:13,542
Oh, thanks. Traditionally,
one wears something over this.

222
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:18,140
- Heard you got a date.
- Well, it's unclear.

223
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:21,462
l have this whole theory
about a promotion. Or he's evil.

224
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,987
Buffy, l'm all right.

225
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:26,539
- You don't have to...
- What? Be noble?

226
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,781
l'm not. Really, l'm all right.

227
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:33,261
You think l still dream of a crypt for two
with a white picket fence?

228
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:36,946
- My eyes are clear.
- Good. l'm glad.

229
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:40,467
Thank you.

230
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:44,146
Never much cared for picket fences, anyway.
Bloody dangerous.

231
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:47,826
You should try this too.
The going out thing, l mean.

232
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:51,665
There's that girl you brought
to Anya and Xander's not-a-wedding.

233
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:56,745
Yeah. There's always girls who like the look.
Bad boy - does it for some of them.

234
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,504
Yeah, l can see that.

235
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:02,389
l should go. l don't wanna be late.

236
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,985
Lissa, hi! l was afraid you weren't coming.

237
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,029
You said 8.30. Did you think
l was gonna stand you up?

238
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:24,466
- Well, it would be kind of karmic.
- What?

239
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:27,111
Forget it. You're gonna love the coffee.

240
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:29,944
l got a redeye.
Black coffee with a shot of espresso.

241
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:34,741
- lt's kinda rough if you're not used to it...
- lt's hot cocoa.

242
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,984
Well, sometimes l don't sleep too good.

243
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:43,746
- l just lost macho points, didn't l?
- Who wants macho?

244
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:46,550
l like that you like hot cocoa. Redeye, please.

245
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:50,746
Sounded good.

246
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:52,059
Yeah.

247
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:55,827
Nothing? No records or certificates?

248
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:58,345
College transcripts?

249
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:02,310
The only stuff in the system
about Principal Robin Wood is super-recent.

250
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:04,382
Like, since he moved to Sunnydale.

251
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:09,340
l've Googled till l just can't
Google no more. He's not in there.

252
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:12,104
Well, that's suspicious.

253
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,661
Anya, calm down. They're educational.

254
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:16,740
What's this?

255
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:20,460
Giles made them for Chao-Ahn,
and she's locked herself in the bathroom.

256
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:23,065
The other girls are starting to complain.

257
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:26,382
Those are flash cards l made
to facilitate her training.

258
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:29,668
Chao-Ahn never had a watcher.
The language problem...

259
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,503
You showed her these?

260
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,867
l wanted her to understand
the seriousness of her situation.

261
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:36,942
Holy crap!

262
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:40,099
Perhaps l'll rethink the approach.

263
00:18:40,191 --> 00:18:44,787
You wanna help us get researchy?
We're trying to invade Buffy's date's privacy.

264
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:48,500
- Buffy has a date?
- <i>(Anya)</i> Yes. Didn't you hear?

265
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:50,741
Everybody has a date.

266
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:54,062
Buffy has a date.
Willow's been making out with this girl...

267
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:55,220
Hey!

268
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:59,429
Xander's out with some hardware-store
whore. lt's Date-Fest 2003.

269
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:04,141
Actually, Buffy's investigating
Principal Wood. lt's not a date.

270
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:05,630
Really?

271
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:08,230
Might be a date.

272
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:11,781
For God's sake! How can anyone
think about their social life?

273
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:16,786
We are about to fight the original primal evil.
These girls are in mortal danger.

274
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:21,342
Didn't you see the flash cards?
This isn't right.

275
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:33,546
This isn't right.

276
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,225
lt doesn't look promising,
but this place is great.

277
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:40,702
lt's the best-kept secret in town.
lt's right down this way.

278
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:46,180
Well, it is one of the nicer dark alleys.

279
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:48,944
l promise you, it's just a little bit further.

280
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:50,020
OK.

281
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,427
You set me up, you son of a...

282
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:32,540
What?

283
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:00,908
l guess we should talk.

284
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:13,060
The restaurant's right there.

285
00:21:20,391 --> 00:21:23,940
- And you still have to see her every day?
- Yeah, but l guess that's good.

286
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:27,626
How is that good? lt seems like
she never lets you forget what happened.

287
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:32,102
Well, it's on her mind a lot right now,
because our anniversary's coming up...

288
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,261
lt would have been our anniversary.

289
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:37,866
And maybe l shouldn't
be allowed to forget it. l did...

290
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:41,990
lt was a bad thing, and it hurt her real bad.

291
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:47,828
And if you'd married her, even though
you had doubts, that would've been better?

292
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:48,980
l guess not.

293
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:52,700
Sounds to me like in the long run
you're both better off.

294
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:58,423
l know it turned out good for me,
and that's what really matters, right?

295
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,989
l should have taken you
on a nicer date than this.

296
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,347
Well, l can think of something fun to do.

297
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:08,025
Thank you.

298
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:11,467
This place is nice.
How the hell did you do that?

299
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:14,304
l've had some practice.
Never took on two at once,

300
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:17,781
but l have taken out
a few vamps and some demons.

301
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:21,022
- So, you're freelance?
- Hm...

302
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:23,909
l guess that's a good way to put it.

303
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,981
And you know who l am?

304
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:29,221
You're the Slayer.

305
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:31,620
Right. OK.

306
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:35,624
l'm guessing that you don't work
in an office 15 feet above the Hellmouth

307
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:38,783
because you enjoy
educational administration?

308
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:43,991
Well, l actually do enjoy the work,
but yeah, you're right.

309
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:49,429
l manoeuvred myself into that school,
that office, just like l manoeuvred you there.

310
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:52,628
The Hellmouth draws the bad things in close.

311
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:55,020
Now we're headed for something really big.

312
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:59,024
l need to be here when it happens.
l wanna help.

313
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:03,070
So, you didn't hire me
for my counselling skills?

314
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:09,546
They're valuable too.

315
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:14,341
- Why didn't you tell me about you?
- l wasn't sure about things yet.

316
00:23:15,231 --> 00:23:17,699
- You didn't think you could trust me?
- No, no.

317
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:21,579
l wasn't sure l was ready yet,
ready to jump into this fight.

318
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:23,662
And now you are?

319
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:26,902
Now the fight is starting, or starting to start.

320
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:31,781
l don't have time to worry any more.
l have to do something.

321
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:35,944
So, you knew who l was
before you even came here.

322
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:37,700
Yes.

323
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,067
How? How do you know about slayers?

324
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,782
Right. OK.

325
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,469
When l was a little boy, my mother was one.

326
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,145
The one, actually. The Slayer.

327
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:52,982
Your mother...

328
00:23:55,151 --> 00:24:00,100
Wow, l didn't know
that any slayers had children.

329
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:02,659
l don't know of any others.

330
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:05,784
She was killed when l was four.

331
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:10,983
l still remember her, but it's a little... fuzzy.

332
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:20,189
- Something got her? A demon...?
- A vampire.

333
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:26,105
l went through this whole "avenging son"
phase in my 20s, but l never found him.

334
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:30,021
Now l just dust as many as l can find.
l figure eventually l'll get him.

335
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:32,671
That's probably why we gotjumped outside.

336
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:36,300
l'm not very popular with vampires
and l bet you aren't either.

337
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,382
No. Not most of 'em.

338
00:24:40,591 --> 00:24:44,106
So, do you have any slayer powers?
l'm sorry...

339
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:48,949
l'm just so floored.
l have no idea what to ask.

340
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,261
No, l don't have powers.

341
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:55,310
No super-strength or mythic responsibilities.

342
00:24:55,391 --> 00:25:00,101
l'm just a guy with a few skills, because
her watcher took me in and raised me.

343
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:03,543
So... you decided to tell me?

344
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,190
That's right.

345
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:11,787
ln a darkened, little,
romantic French restaurant?

346
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:16,187
Um... yeah.

347
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:21,784
l'm not really sure
how that happened, but yeah.

348
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:28,146
- Did you find the gun?
- Yes, it was in Buffy's underwear drawer.

349
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:30,222
- She has nice things.
- Show me.

350
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:34,020
l didn't take 'em, but there were
thongs and regular underpants...

351
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:36,944
- Show me the gun.
- Yeah.

352
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:38,464
Here.

353
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:40,781
Willow tried shooting Kennedy with that.

354
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:44,227
Great. There's gonna be panic
and fleeing when you start firing,

355
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:47,269
so you're gonna have to
get 'em trapped someplace.

356
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:49,387
And we're killing them because...?

357
00:25:49,471 --> 00:25:53,862
Because they're the future of the slayer line.
When they're gone, the line is gone.

358
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:56,146
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

359
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:59,029
Why not have Spike do it?
He's the one with the trigger.

360
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:02,820
lt's not time for him yet.
Wait till they're training in the basement,

361
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:06,620
but don't rely on a locked door
to keep them in. You'll need more.

362
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:08,702
OK.

363
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:11,861
Say...

364
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:17,423
do you have any weaknesses l should
know about if l'm gonna work for you,

365
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:21,299
like Kryptonite or allergies?

366
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:25,181
- What are you asking?
- Oh, nothing...

367
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,739
Are you made out
of the evil impulses of humans,

368
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:32,951
so if everyone was unconscious
at the same time, you would fade away?

369
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:36,505
You're asking a lot of questions.

370
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:37,740
Yes, well...

371
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:41,021
l... Because...

372
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:45,502
Because l'm evil,
and l wanna do the best l can at that.

373
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:50,269
So l wanna... know stuff, like when...

374
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:52,911
When do we kill Buffy?

375
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:54,743
Are you wearing a wire?

376
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:58,107
Will, what's going on?

377
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:04,427
You think you can trick the First?

378
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,220
You think you could squirm free?

379
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:10,747
l hold you, Andrew. l made you do this.

380
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:16,626
Jonathan suffered.

381
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:19,100
He was your friend, and he trusted you,

382
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:23,343
and now he spends eternity in pain
because of what you did.

383
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:27,902
- No. What's happening to you?
- This is what you did to him.

384
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:31,028
Took away everything he was
and left him like this.

385
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:35,582
You started down a road with that action.
You have to keep going.

386
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:40,829
Stop looking like Jonathan. You're not him.

387
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:45,982
You're the First, and you're trying to get me
to shoot innocent girls, but l won't do it.

388
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:48,027
l'm good now.

389
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:51,786
When the fight is over,
l'm gonna pay for killing Jonathan.

390
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:56,103
You're gonna pay for more than that.
You know why?

391
00:27:56,191 --> 00:28:01,390
Because the biggest, baddest
First Evil in the world's angry with you.

392
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:06,986
- <i>(Jonathan) You think this was smart?</i>
- l'm hearing something.

393
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:09,346
<i>You think you can trick me?</i>

394
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:11,706
lt's not in the headphones. lt's out here.

395
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,021
<i>You only hear what l want you to hear.</i>

396
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,420
<i>You only see what l want you to see.</i>

397
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:19,424
Agh!

398
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:22,821
So many dead girls.

399
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,981
There'll be so many.

400
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:27,180
l knew it.

401
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:29,580
See? l knew it.

402
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:32,743
Thanks for your help.
The rope l picked wasn't strong enough.

403
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:36,506
That would've been bad.
Listen, is this because l'm friends with Buffy?

404
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,149
- Who's Buffy?
- The Slayer.

405
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:41,701
- You know the Slayer?
- This can'tjust happen.

406
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:45,261
lt can'tjust keep happening
that demon women find me attractive.

407
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,421
There's gotta be a reason.

408
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:51,060
You just seemed like a nice guy, that's all.
l wanted to get to know you.

409
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:53,540
- And kill me?
- Sure.

410
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:57,982
Do the ropes hurt?

411
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:00,901
- Yes.
- Good.

412
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:03,505
So, we're thinking it didn't go too well.

413
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:06,230
- You should've let me do this fast.
- No, l hate that.

414
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,300
Ow!

415
00:29:07,391 --> 00:29:09,746
You tried to record the ultimate evil?

416
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,709
Why? ln a complex effort
to royally piss it off?

417
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,144
Guess we succeeded.

418
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:17,941
God, l never should have gone in wired.
Redemption is hard.

419
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:21,148
Getting back to Spike's question,
why did you try to record it?

420
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:22,141
Ooh!

421
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:26,019
To study it. To see if we could figure
something out from what it was saying.

422
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:29,945
Because, guys, we have to face it,
we know nothing about the First.

423
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:31,100
Owee! Ow, ow!

424
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:34,103
Well, we know not to record it.
That's something.

425
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:37,581
Why did it appear to him?
lt was supposed to be pulling my strings.

426
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:40,788
lt said it wasn't time for you yet. Ow!

427
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:46,670
l'm frightened. And my chest
hurts where the tape was.

428
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,300
lt's OK, Andrew. You did good.
You stood up to it. That's amazing.

429
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:52,905
Thank you. You're a peach.

430
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,904
- What did it want you to do, anyway?
- Shoot all the girls.

431
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,903
- Shoot girls?
- Not you, just the potentials.

432
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:03,506
Oh, well, that's something, anyway.
Something tragic.

433
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:06,471
This proves my point. This time is crucial.

434
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:10,180
We should be circling the wagons
instead of going out on dates

435
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:13,980
when gunplay is imminent.
Willow, call Buffy. Get her back here.

436
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:17,541
We need to dispose of the gun
and figure out our next move.

437
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,622
- l'll go get her.
- l'll call.

438
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:22,020
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- <i>(Amanda)</i> Bet that's her.

439
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:26,150
- Sometimes you think of calling someone...
- No, it's a text message.

440
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:29,940
- Oh, it's from Xander. lt's one of our signals.
- Signals?

441
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:34,468
Yeah, the system we set up
a while back. Like, codes.

442
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:38,146
This one's either "l just got lucky,
don't call me for a while"

443
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:41,587
or "my date's a demon
who's trying to kill me."

444
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:44,629
- You don't remember which?
- lt was a long time ago.

445
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:48,260
- lf we play the percentages...
- Something's eating Xander's head.

446
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:52,424
- Say, that's gratifying.
- Buffy will know what to do.

447
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:54,820
- l'll go get her.
- That's OK.

448
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:58,142
- We don't even know where she went.
<i>- (phone rings)</i>

449
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,824
- That's not good.
- <i>(Spike)</i> l'll go get Buffy.

450
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:06,870
l can probably still track her scent.
She'll be worried about the boy.

451
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:12,070
Oh, my God! Mm.

452
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:15,268
Oh, my God. That might be the best thing
l've ever had in my mouth.

453
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:18,388
lsn't it good? They soak the pears in brandy.

454
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:21,861
Here. You need a bite with the sauce.

455
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:24,987
Mm.

456
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:30,261
- What are you doing here?
- ls there a problem?

457
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:32,946
lt's Xander.

458
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:38,502
Look, l know what happens
if that seal down there gets all excited.

459
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:40,946
l don't think you understand
what you're doing.

460
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:44,103
The seal opens, and a vicious
vampire creature comes out.

461
00:31:44,191 --> 00:31:48,343
Then you do understand.
But what makes you think that's a good idea?

462
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:52,868
The end is coming, the final fight.
Everyone is hearing the drumbeat.

463
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:58,662
lt's telling us to pick our partners,
align ourselves with the good or the evil.

464
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:09,869
Argh!

465
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:25,144
Couldn't have done it without you, Xander.
Thanks for the great date.

466
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:38,780
- You sure he's in the high school?
- Willow did a locator spell. Useful stuff.

467
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:42,864
l'm not surprised.
That school's at the centre of everything.

468
00:32:44,911 --> 00:32:48,984
- How much longer till we get there?
- Ten minutes.

469
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:59,824
- How do you two know each other?
- He works with me.

470
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,186
You know, in the struggle against evil.

471
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,546
Mm. Cool.

472
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,943
Xander!

473
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,110
Buffy!

474
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,982
He's a vampire.

475
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:38,622
<i>(Xander)</i> Oh, God, hurry!

476
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:34,110
Hey.

477
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:56,309
l think your friend's gonna be OK.

478
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:06,462
Hey, Xand. l'm here.

479
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:09,860
So, how's your date going?

480
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:17,865
Where are they? lt's after two.

481
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:21,421
l can't believe Buffy hasn't
brought him home yet. His slut ate him up.

482
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:25,299
His slut didn't eat him up.
Besides, l thought you were all angry at him.

483
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:29,669
- My feelings are changeable, but intense.
- <i>(Andrew)</i> l understand your fear, Anya.

484
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:34,427
l know fear myself cos, you know,
l enraged that primal force.

485
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:38,470
- They're not back yet?
- l'm worried. l think we should go find them.

486
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:41,782
Xander could be injured
or trapped or eaten up.

487
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:45,261
lt is late. A little reconnaissance
might be helpful.

488
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:51,182
She says she can't sleep.

489
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:54,581
l made myself some warm milk.
You can have it.

490
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:00,744
She's shy.

491
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:03,629
They're back! Oh, here they come.

492
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:07,110
- ls Xander all right?
- Looks OK.

493
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:08,783
Damn him!

494
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:16,270
- What happened?
- What do you think happened?

495
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:20,469
Another demon woman was attracted to me.
l've decided l'm turning gay.

496
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:22,826
Willow, gay me up.

497
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:25,266
- Come on, let's gay.
- What?

498
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,581
You heard me. Just tell me what to do.

499
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:32,461
l'm mentally undressing Scott Bakula
right now. That's a start, isn't it?

500
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:33,904
Captain Archer.

501
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,744
Let's get this gay show
on the gay road. Help me out.

502
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:40,062
What if you just start
attracting male demons?

503
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:42,506
- Clem liked you.
- lt would serve you right.

504
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:43,819
Children, enough.

505
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:47,347
- l need some stylish new clothes.
- Oh, enough!

506
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:52,905
Have you learned nothing
from tonight's assorted chaos?

507
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:58,270
There isn't time for fun and games
and quips about orientation.

508
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:02,300
These aren't a joke.

509
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:05,626
This... happens.

510
00:37:07,271 --> 00:37:09,865
Girls are gonna die. We may die.

511
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:16,339
lt's time to get serious.

512
00:37:32,991 --> 00:37:36,779
Did anybody tell you about
what happened around here tonight?

513
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,066
Willow did.

514
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:41,619
The First is back in the mix.

515
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:46,303
lt talked to the little boy.

516
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,700
Said it wasn't time for me yet.

517
00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:57,667
l should move out.
Leave town... before it is time for me.

518
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:01,141
No. You have to stay.

519
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:05,941
- You've got another demon-fighter now.
- That's not why l need you here.

520
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:09,501
ls that right? Why's that, then?

521
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:13,868
Cos l'm not ready for you to not be here.

522
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:25,226
And the principal?

523
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:28,580
How's he fit in?

524
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:51,862
You look good.

525
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,150
You're not my mother.

526
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,984
l give you a compliment,
and you don't say thank you?

527
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:01,428
- Did l raise you that way?
- You didn't raise me at all.

528
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:03,502
Well, l was dead.

529
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:23,506
So you're the First.
Why are you here? Why now?

530
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:28,028
Cos you've been coming up in the world.
Taking the demons out.

531
00:39:28,111 --> 00:39:30,261
lt makes a mother proud.

532
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:32,342
Yeah?

533
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:38,348
Well, think how pleased she'll be
when l help take you out.

534
00:39:38,431 --> 00:39:43,744
Until it's time for that,
l've got no use for you.

535
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:51,143
Would you like to know who killed me?

536
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:57,510
- l know you went looking for him.
- You don't know anything.

537
00:39:57,591 --> 00:39:59,309
ls that right?

538
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:02,463
Well, check it out after l tell you.
Check the timing.

539
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:05,190
Reread what the witnesses said,
and the people...

540
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:07,580
- Who is it?
- You met him.

541
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:11,022
You know him.

542
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:13,981
You fought at his side.

543
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,190
Spike.

544
00:40:18,511 --> 00:40:21,503
Now, what do you say?

545
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:27,390
Thank you.

546
