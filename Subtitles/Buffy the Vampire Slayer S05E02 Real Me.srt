1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,204
I've been going out a lot.

2
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:05,885
- Patrolling?
- Hunting.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:09,170
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

4
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:14,972
That's what Dracula called it.
And he was right.

5
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:18,691
He understood my power better than I do.

6
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:22,681
He saw darkness in it.

7
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,048
I need to know more.

8
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:29,126
About where I come from.
About the other slayers.

9
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:31,648
I need you to be my watcher again.

10
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,052
Dammit!

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,806
You know what? I'm sick of this crap.

12
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:39,966
I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects
and gets the funny syphilis.

13
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:45,366
As of this moment, it's over.
I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey!

14
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,044
What are you doing here?

15
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:56,491
Buffy? If you're going out,
why don't you take your sister?

16
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:58,688
Mom!

17
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:03,487
There is nothing but you.

18
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:08,284
You are the centre.

19
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:13,851
And within you,
there is the core of your being.

20
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:17,723
Of what you are.

21
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:24,283
Find it. Breathe into it.

22
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:29,689
Focus inward.

23
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:32,571
Let the world fall away,

24
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:36,844
fall away,

25
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:40,564
fall away.

27
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:35,762
Can we go now?

28
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:33,004
Nobody knows who I am. Not the real me.

29
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:36,210
It's like nobody cares enough to find out.

30
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:39,524
I mean, does anyone ever ask me
what I want to do with my life?

31
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:41,729
Or what my opinion is on stuff?.

32
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:44,122
Or what restaurant to order in from?

33
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:47,922
No. Underline. Exclamation point.

34
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:50,811
Exclamation point, exclamation point.

35
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,724
No one understands.

36
00:03:57,253 --> 00:04:00,051
No one has an older sister who's a slayer.

37
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:07,122
People wouldn't be so crazy about her
if they had to live with her every single day.

38
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:11,923
Everybody cares what she thinks,
just cos she can do backflips and stuff..

39
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:15,926
Like, that's such a crucial job skill
in the real world.

40
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:21,007
Plus Mom lets her get away with everything.
"Your sister's saving the world."

41
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:24,847
I could so save the world
if somebody handed me superpowers,

42
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:28,528
but I'd think of a cool name
and wear a mask to protect my loved ones,

43
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:31,002
which Buffy doesn't even.

44
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:36,168
If this town wasn't so lame,
everyone would know what she does.

45
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:40,371
I bet they wouldn't even be that impressed,
because, like, killing things with wood?

46
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:43,843
Oh, scary vampires, they die from a splinter.

47
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:51,253
So, Buffy, what are your plans today?

48
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:58,049
Giles and I are gonna go to the magic shop
for supplies for my new training sessions.

49
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,328
- That's great.
- Yeah, I'm actually...

50
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:04,167
You can take Dawn shopping
for her back-to-school supplies.

51
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:06,892
- What?
- Mom, I thought you were taking me.

52
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,203
Honey, I've got the Gurion showing tonight

53
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:11,932
and there's so much to do
to get the gallery ready.

54
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,925
No, but, see, Mom,
that doesn't really work for me.

55
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,686
We're going to the magic shop.
No school supplies there.

56
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:20,162
Yeah, Mom, I'm not going to Hogwarts.

57
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:25,042
Jeez, crack a book sometime.

58
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:28,887
I'm sure Giles doesn't mind
dropping you off at the mall afterward.

59
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:33,012
Actually, he does mind. This is supposed
to be quality watcher/slayer time.

60
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,448
I told you, she ruined my training yesterday.

61
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:39,082
- Did not!
- Oh, you know you did too.

62
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:44,611
Buffy, I realise the importance of your new
slayer thing, but I could really use your help.

63
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:53,766
- Morning, Mrs Summers. You look great.
- Oh, thank you, Riley.

64
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:58,402
- Suck-up.
- What? It's a nice outfit.

65
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:02,612
Besides, "I'm here to violate your first-born"
never goes over with parents.

66
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:04,684
Not sure why.

67
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:08,450
Riley, my sister's boyfriend, is so into her.

68
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,525
They're always kissing... and groping.

69
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,403
I bet they've had sex.

70
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:18,486
- Hey, kid.
- I'm not a kid.

71
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:23,331
Well, this is a surprise of the nicest kind.

72
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:27,247
Now it's my turn to be surprised.
I thought we had plans today.

73
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,972
Plans? We planned plans?

74
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:35,249
Well, you said "Come over tomorrow
and we'll hang" and then I said "OK".

75
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,926
Not the invasion of Normandy,
but still a plan.

76
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:40,446
Right.

77
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,526
- We're not hanging today, are we?
- Giles is on his way to pick me up.

78
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,081
- Slayer training.
- Slayer shopping, actually.

79
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,324
- But equally as important.
- I have no doubt.

80
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:53,132
- OK, we'll hook up later.
- Are you mad at me?

81
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:57,047
No, not at all. I'm plotting your death,
but in a happy way.

82
00:06:57,133 --> 00:07:00,728
- Good.
- Look, Buffy, I know what this means to you.

83
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:04,488
I think it's great that you've got
this new mission. I'll see you tonight.

84
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,732
Bye.

85
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:09,691
- See ya, kid.
- I'm not a kid!

86
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:14,609
I sympathise with you, I truly do.

87
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:19,050
But I'm certain that Riley understands better
than anyone the importance of training.

88
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,931
You can't allow personal
concerns to distract you...

89
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:25,608
Dawn, will you stop fiddling
with the radio and sit down?

90
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:30,243
I don't think Buffy's watcher
likes me too much.

91
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,484
I think it's cos he's just so... old.

92
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:38,766
I'm not sure how old he is, but I heard him
use the word "newfangled" one time,

93
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:41,686
so he's gotta be pretty far gone.

94
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:49,762
There's a lot of books on this list.
Any come on tape, read by George Clooney?

95
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:53,766
You're entering a new realm, one for which
I myself am not entirely prepared.

96
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:56,970
- Are you ready for this commitment?
- I'm just kidding.

97
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,965
This Betty's ready. Colour me committed.

98
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:03,250
- Blast!
- You put it in neutral again, huh?

99
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,167
I'm just not used to
this automatic transmission.

100
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,370
I loathe this just sitting here,
not contributing.

101
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:13,729
- No, it's not working out.
- Are you breaking up with your car?

102
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:16,532
Well, it did seduce me, all red and sporty.

103
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,604
Little two-door tramp.

104
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:22,531
I don't know. I was so at a loose end

105
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:27,562
that I found myself searching
for some way of feeling more...

106
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:29,723
Shallow?

107
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:34,489
Perhaps, as I am to be your watcher again,
a modicum of respect might be in order.

108
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,803
Do I have to?

109
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:41,489
I'm serious, Buffy. There's going to be far less
time for the sort of flighty, frivolous...

110
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:45,532
- Hey, there's Willow and Tara!
- Ooh, they haven't seen my new car.

111
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:52,847
- Hey, Giles! Sharp wheels!
- The rest of the car's nice, too.

112
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,572
- Handles like a dream.
- Where are you guys heading?

113
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:58,406
Magic shop.
I have some charms on back order.

114
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:01,087
- Willow, hi.
- Hey, Dawny!

115
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:05,482
How's my favourite chess partner?
Still leading with your knight?

116
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:09,805
Willow's awesome. She's the only one I know
who likes school as much as me.

117
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:12,248
Even her friends are cool.

118
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,928
- Hey, Dawn.
- Like Tara. She and Willow are both witches.

119
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,289
They do spells and stuff.,
which is so much cooler than slaying.

120
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:22,809
I told Mom I wished they'd teach me
some of the things they do together.

121
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:27,091
And then she got really quiet
and made me go upstairs. Huh.

122
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:30,688
I guess her generation
isn't cool with witchcraft.

123
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,682
Giles and I worked out
a schedule around school.

124
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:38,049
A block of time every day
to just focus on my new slayer training.

125
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:41,887
That's a work ethic.
Buffy, you're developing a work ethic.

126
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:44,441
Oh, no. Do they make an ointment for that?

127
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:49,561
People gotta respect a solid work ethic.
Look at you. Motivated Buffy.

128
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:54,329
Eager to soak up learning. You and I
are gonna have so much fun this semester.

129
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:58,725
That reminds me. With the whole new
training schedule, I had to drop a class.

130
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:01,850
Your slayer studies are way more important.

131
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:04,447
So I won't be taking drama with you.

132
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:08,811
- What? You have to. You promised!
- I know, but Giles said that itjust was...

133
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,407
- The hell with Giles.
- I can hear you, Willow.

134
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:13,927
Drama is just Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons.

135
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,925
You can blow off training Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons.

136
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:19,322
What about "people gotta
respect a work ethic"?

137
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:22,769
Other people, not me.
There's a whole best-friend loophole.

138
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:25,526
Shop's kinda dark. Maybe it's closed.

139
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,604
That's odd.

140
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:47,491
Well, I think "odd" just got upped to "bad".

141
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:50,973
Hello? Anyone here?

142
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:53,283
Mr Bogarty?

143
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:57,043
The owner. I come in here a lot.

144
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,964
Well, maybe this happened
really late at night when nobody was...

145
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:07,570
Will?

146
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:10,042
I'm fine, I just tripped over...

147
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,124
Mr Bogarty.

148
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:16,762
- What is it? Is he OK?
- Nothing you need to see. Go wait outside.

149
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:22,246
I don't wanna wait outside. Ow, that hurts!
You're hurting me. I'm telling.

150
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,291
I don't have time for this.
Just do like I say and wait.

151
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:27,364
Here.

152
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:48,407
What you doing? What are you doing here?
You can't loiter. There's no loitering.

153
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:51,523
That's why I'm a cat.

154
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:54,286
Quiet. See, cat's in the cupboard,

155
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:57,809
but they find you there anyway and it hurts.

156
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,528
Please make it stop.

157
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:04,605
- Shut up! They'll hear you!
- Buffy!

158
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:09,569
I know you.

159
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:12,008
Curds and whey.

160
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:15,210
I know what you are.

161
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:18,285
You don't belong here.

162
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,884
Dawn?

163
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:32,204
Dawn?

164
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:40,044
Dawn, are you OK?

165
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:43,564
Is...

166
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,722
Is that guy dead in there?

167
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,724
Yeah.

168
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:01,848
They're gonna be a little while longer,
doing the detective thing.

169
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:05,721
Best non-Scoobies
like you and me stay out of their way.

170
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:18,168
Do you wanna thumb-wrestle?

171
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:20,244
OK.

172
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:28,845
Judging by the bitefest,
I'd say it was more than one vampire.

173
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,889
I make it four at least.

174
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:33,407
Someone's put together a new fang club.

175
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:37,964
I've crosschecked the inventory list and
things are definitely missing, mostly books.

176
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:43,685
Including A Treatise on the Mythology
and Methodology of the Vampire Slayer.

177
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:48,005
- Oh, shoot. Was that the only copy?
- Come on, Buffy, this could be very serious.

178
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:52,644
Whoever's leading this pack of vampires
is interested in learning more about you.

179
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:56,726
Perhaps searching for
weaknesses or... Good Lord.

180
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:58,647
What?

181
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:03,363
Well, I had no idea the profit margins
on a shop like this were so high.

182
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:07,844
Look at this. Low-overhead
out-of-state orders, international...

183
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:12,443
It's no wonder there's never
any trouble attracting new owners.

184
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:15,570
- A place like this is a virtual...
- Deathtrap?

185
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:19,443
Well, yes, there is that, but... still.

186
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,093
Location, you know, pedestrian traffic...

187
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:25,129
So what's the next step?

188
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:29,092
Buffy, you should begin looking
for their lair straightaway.

189
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:32,483
- I'll get Riley to help me patrol.
- Aren't you forgetting something?

190
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:35,963
- Impressive square footage.
- You're on Dawn duty.

191
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:40,328
Oh, duty. I gotta drop my sister back at home.

192
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,084
My mother's gonna kill me.

193
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,767
I bet the death rate keeps the rent down.

194
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,970
Hello. Something's
been taken from this case.

195
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,487
- Look here.
- What'd they take?

196
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:56,122
I should think an item of value
or power, possibly even...

197
00:14:56,213 --> 00:15:01,003
A unicorn. Ten-inch ceramic unicorn
imported from Thailand.

198
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:05,086
- Was it valuable?
- List price: $12.95.

199
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:10,406
Which begs the question, what kind of
creature fancies cheap, tasteless statuary?

200
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:16,087
OK, hi. First of all, I wanna thank
everybody for a really successful raid

201
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:18,164
on the magic shop last night.

202
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:21,689
Good job, minions! Yes, you deserve it.

203
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:28,568
Secondly, somebody remembered
to pick me up the sweetest little unicorn.

204
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:31,926
What?

205
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:36,689
Brad. Guess someone was feeling guilty
for standing me up in the tenth grade.

206
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:40,971
- I had to get her something. She sired me.
- Sire-whipped.

207
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:44,052
Anyway, the books you brought me
to help with the plan?

208
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:50,845
I've been skimming through the bookjackets
and there's some useful stuff in there, so...

209
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:53,766
Yes... Sorry, forgot your name.

210
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:57,642
- Cyrus.
- Cyrus, right. Peaches's friend.

211
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:01,203
- What's your question?
- When are we gonna do it?

212
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:06,686
Eww! That's rude! I barely know you.
And you're a minion.

213
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:10,284
He means the plan.
When are we gonna do the plan?

214
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:16,491
The plan! Let me tell you, I'm really psyched
about it and I hope the rest of you guys...

215
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,962
- When?
- Tonight!

216
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:24,884
We kill the Slayer tonight.

217
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:35,408
So not only didn't you take your sister
shopping, you brought her to a murder scene.

218
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:39,452
No, I didn't bring her to it.
Itjust sorta came upon us.

219
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,842
It's not like she saw the body or anything.

220
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,925
Oh, well. That makes it
all right then, doesn't it?

221
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:47,402
No, that is not what I meant.

222
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:50,963
I asked one favour of you, Buffy.
To look after your sister.

223
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:54,523
And now you wanna unload her,
so you and Riley can go out.

224
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:58,606
To patrol. I'm working.
It's not like I wanna go to the sock hop.

225
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:02,811
I have to be at the pre-show reception
in half an hour. Who's gonna watch Dawn?

226
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:05,885
- I don't need anyone to watch me!
- Yes, you do.

227
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:11,523
Wait. So what you're saying is if I can get
an acceptable baby-sitter, I can go patrol?

228
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,526
Baby-sitter? I'm 14!
I'm old enough to be a baby-sitter.

229
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:18,571
And who are you gonna get
on such short notice?

230
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:21,008
I can take care of myself.

231
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:24,244
- Xander.
- Xander?

232
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,964
OK.

233
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:35,204
- Dawn patrol.
- Hey.

234
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:39,081
Check this out. They put cheese
on round bread. It's gonna be big.

235
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:42,927
Xander is so much cuter than anyone.
And smarter, too.

236
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:46,164
He totally skipped college
and got a job working construction,

237
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:48,892
which is so kind of deep, you know.

238
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:51,407
He builds things. And he's brave, too.

239
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:55,281
Just last week he went undercover
to stop that Dracula guy.

240
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:58,606
- Have fun. Not too much fun, though.
- Dawn.

241
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:01,853
- Dawn, be good.
- We will.

242
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:04,606
We're just gonna play with matches,
run with scissors,

243
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:08,322
take candy from some guy -
I don't know his name.

244
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:13,569
Xander treats everyone like an equal.
He doesn't look down on people.

245
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:16,611
- Hello there, little girl.
- Even when he should.

246
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,570
We are gonna have fun, fun, fun!

247
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:24,011
Look, I've got Monopoly, Clue and ooh,
The Game of Life! That sounds good!

248
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:26,365
Poor Dawn.

249
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:28,691
She was pretty shaken up.

250
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:33,403
Well, sure. Bloody death and stuff.
She'll be OK.

251
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:36,565
It's just... I think it's tough for her.

252
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:40,362
Not being able to...
allowed to, you know, help.

253
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,688
- Help?
- Out. You.

254
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:47,241
You guys. The Slayer Circle.

255
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,690
Well, Buffy doesn't really need...
and I think Dawn's a little young.

256
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:56,683
I know. You're right.
It's just hard. That outsider feeling.

257
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:02,569
Tara, you're not an outsider.

258
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:06,762
Well, yeah, I kinda am.

259
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:08,844
No. No, you're not.

260
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:13,726
Willow, it's OK. Where does this go?

261
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:16,122
Is somebody making you
feel uncomfortable?

262
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:19,603
- Is it Xander? It's Xander, isn't it?
- Xander's a sweetie.

263
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:24,130
It's Giles! It's cos he's British
and doesn't understand about stuff.

264
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:27,683
It's no one. You guys all
just have this really tight bond.

265
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:31,561
It's hard to break into that.
And I'm not even sure I want to.

266
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:35,689
I'm sure.

267
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:40,164
You're completely one of the gang now.
Everyone accepts that.

268
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:42,642
You're one of the good guys.

269
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:47,603
Maybe I can talk to the rest of the group
and we can do something,

270
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:50,287
some kind of Scooby initiation.

271
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:55,489
Maybe we can wear some kind of special ring
that identifies us as members.

272
00:19:55,573 --> 00:20:00,442
I don't think so. But maybe something
like that would be nice for Dawn.

273
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,969
- I do worry about her sometimes.
- You don't have to.

274
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:07,090
She's got big sister Buffy
happily looking out for her.

275
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:10,563
So then my mom goes off on me about
how I'm supposed to watch out for Dawn

276
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:13,531
and shield her from stuff
that might upset her.

277
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:16,411
- Like dead shopkeepers.
- She didn't see him.

278
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:19,885
A foot, maybe. A dead foot,
which is bad, OK.

279
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:24,888
But hello! I see dead stuff all the time
and you don't see Mom shielding me.

280
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,726
So, you want your mother
to give you space to be a slayer

281
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:30,043
and shield you from it at the same time?

282
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:34,126
Thank you, Logic Boy. Did I mention,
this is a rant? Sense really has no place in it.

283
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:38,047
I'm getting that.
What's the deal, Buffy? You seem really...

284
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,087
Trash can. From a distance it looked kinda...

285
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:46,845
..tense.

286
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:51,131
No, I was gonna say brown, squat, shadowy.

287
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:55,331
Uh-huh. Back to what I was saying
before we were rudely attacked by nothing.

288
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:57,529
You seem really tense.

289
00:20:57,613 --> 00:21:00,491
Yeah, there's a new vampire gang in town.

290
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:05,966
I mean domestically tense.
You're on Dawn's case a lot.

291
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,924
I guess. It's just...

292
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:16,531
I don't know... I know it's always
been this way. She's the baby.

293
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:22,085
But for some reason, lately, it's just
really getting to me. She's always around.

294
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:25,643
- Well, yeah. You're, like, her idol, Buffy.
- Her idol?

295
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:30,171
I don't think so, unless you like to spill things
on your idol's new leather pants and...

296
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:32,323
You know what I mean.

297
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:36,884
You have superpowers and college,
a studly yet sensitive boyfriend...

298
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:41,444
And a pesky life-or-death job
that I can't quit or even take a break from.

299
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:45,249
She doesn't get the sacrifices. She's a kid.

300
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,324
And that's what bugs.

301
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:51,452
She gets to be a kid and she acts like
it's the biggest burden in the world.

302
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:57,122
Sometimes I would like to curl up in Mom's
lap and not worry about the fate of the world.

303
00:21:57,213 --> 00:22:00,922
I'd like to be the one who's protected,
who's waited on...

304
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:04,050
..hand and foot, getting her own way.
Always the favourite.

305
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:07,170
You nut. Your mom loves you both equally.

306
00:22:07,253 --> 00:22:10,723
But if I'm wrong, I find money
usually helps tip the scale.

307
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:15,125
Slip Joyce a 10 or a 20 once in a while.
Then we'll see who's the favourite.

308
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:17,886
- He says I'm like a kid sister.
- Here come the judge!

309
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:22,171
But sometimes when he looks at me,
I feel like he sees me as I am.

310
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:25,369
As a woman.

311
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:31,050
Crap! Look at this! Now I'm burdened with
a husband and several tiny pink children,

312
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:34,205
and more cash than I can reasonably manage.

313
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:37,205
That means you're winning.

314
00:22:37,293 --> 00:22:39,602
- Really?
- Yes. Cash equals good.

315
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:45,082
I'm so pleased. Can I trade in
the children for more cash?

316
00:22:58,013 --> 00:23:01,449
"Slayer, come out and die."

317
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,922
I'm waiting for you, Buffy.

318
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:15,042
I know you're in there.

319
00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:21,289
What do you mean, she's not in there?
She has to be. I'm calling her out!

320
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:25,173
Then I bet she'll be real sorry
she missed your call.

321
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:28,245
You and your buddies'll
have to be killed by Buffy later.

322
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,291
They're not my buddies. They're my minions.

323
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:34,487
- They're... what, now?
- Minions.

324
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:38,851
You know, lackeys? They work for me.

325
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:44,724
What's so funny?

326
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:49,409
Nothing. What could be funny? Just "Look
out! It's the terrifying Harmony gang."

327
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:51,404
Stop laughing!

328
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:59,083
I just can't picture anyone
pathetic enough to be following...

329
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:01,971
Is that Brad Konig?

330
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:06,126
Who'd have thought when you beat up kids in
gym class, you'd end up Harmony's lapdog?

331
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:08,807
Screw you, Harris.

332
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:11,965
You should know all about
being somebody's lapdog.

333
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:14,283
I hear you were a good puppy for Dracula.

334
00:24:14,373 --> 00:24:17,968
- You heard wrong.
- Don't feel bad.

335
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:23,446
I hear that mind-control thing he does
works really well on weak fraidy-cat losers.

336
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:25,967
- You didn't stand a chance.
- Shut up!

337
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:28,044
Dawn, I'm handling this.

338
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,844
- Shut up, Harmony.
- Make me.

339
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:35,531
I don't feel like another
hair-pulling contest with you.

340
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:38,173
You're the hair-puller, you big girl!

341
00:24:38,253 --> 00:24:40,687
Come inside and say that.
Xander'll kick your...

342
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:42,684
Dawn, no!

343
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:01,491
The invitation was for one.

344
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:04,964
Not such a pushover any more, am I?

345
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:09,009
The Slayer's house
should have more weapons.

346
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:12,847
I've been working out,
learning some new tricks, honing my...

347
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,605
instincts.

348
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:23,047
This isn't over, Xander! I'll be back!

349
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:28,526
And we'll be ready for ya!
Stakes, crosses, the whole enchilada.

350
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:31,809
Buffy is not gonna be happy about this.

351
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:37,364
Harmony.

352
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,688
Harmony has minions?

353
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,492
Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction.

354
00:25:43,573 --> 00:25:46,485
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just...

355
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,326
Harmony has minions.

356
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:51,764
And Ruffles have ridges.

357
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:56,124
Buffy, there's actually
a more serious side to all this.

358
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:59,762
I sure hope so,
cos I'm having trouble breathing.

359
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:03,926
- What is it?
- Well, she did come here to kill you.

360
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:10,083
Buffy, come on. They have killed once that
we know of. She could be a threat to you.

361
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:13,643
Especially now that she can
enter your house any time she wants.

362
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:17,412
What?

363
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:24,933
Yeah, actually, she - Harmony -
kind of happened to sorta get an invite.

364
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:31,492
You guys can't invite her in.
Only someone who lives here can...

365
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:37,450
Where is she?

366
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:41,208
In her room. Look, I think
she's still pretty freaked out.

367
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:43,648
- Dawn!
- It was an accident. She didn't mean it.

368
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:46,042
Well, thatjust makes it OK then, doesn't it?

369
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:48,886
No, but believe me,
nobody feels worse than her right now.

370
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:54,687
What a total disaster. My first plan.
I so wanted it to go well.

371
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:59,005
Plus, I didn't even get to kill stupid
Xander Harris. That was so embarrassing.

372
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:01,812
- We'll go back later.
- No. It's no good.

373
00:27:01,893 --> 00:27:05,283
Buffy's gonna expect us now.
The whole surprise is blown.

374
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,841
- Who are you growling at?
- Not me, my stomach.

375
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:11,130
- If I don't eat somebody, I'll get dizzy.
- Let's go to the lair.

376
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,807
- That census taker may not be empty yet.
- Not me.

377
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:16,487
This night is young and I want some action.

378
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:23,522
Happy to oblige.
I thought it was gonna be a slow night.

379
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:26,566
Step on up, kiddies. Thrashings for all.

380
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:29,403
Stop!

381
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:33,682
Well... Hello, Harm.

382
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,050
Spikey.

383
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,488
I mean, Spike.

384
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,882
Long time. You look good.

385
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:45,083
- I feel good.
- I remember.

386
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:49,491
- How have you been?
- Not bad.

387
00:27:50,413 --> 00:27:52,973
Just got a brand-new telly in my crypt, so...

388
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:57,046
- Why are you talking to him?
- It's OK. We used to go steady.

389
00:27:58,173 --> 00:28:02,928
- Spike, Mort. Mort, this is...
- I know who he is. He kills our kind.

390
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:05,163
Oh, yeah. What's up with that?

391
00:28:06,093 --> 00:28:08,971
Bloke's gotta have a hobby, don't he?
Piss off, Mort.

392
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:13,331
Mort, just give us a couple of minutes, OK?

393
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:19,845
He's really testy. Some of us are
thinking of voting him out of the gang.

394
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:23,367
- Gang?
- Oh, yeah.

395
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,251
I've got my own gang now.

396
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:31,043
- Is that what those circus freaks are?
- Uh-huh. I mean... shut up.

397
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:36,241
- We're gonna kill the Slayer.
- Singing my song now, are you?

398
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,803
You should pay me royalties for that one,
or at least get your own tune.

399
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:44,364
I'm not gonna make the mistakes you did. I've
been doing my homework, reading books.

400
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:46,962
What, Evil for Dummies?

401
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:53,050
Look at you, all puffed up and mighty,
thinking you're the new Big Bad.

402
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:54,851
It's...

403
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,765
Well, let's face it, it's adorable.

404
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:02,402
You just can't stand the fact
that I'm my own person now.

405
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:07,123
There comes a time in a woman's life when
she realises she needs to take the next step.

406
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:12,048
I've taken it.
I've found the real me and I like her.

407
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:16,531
Hope you'll be very happy together.

408
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:20,324
In the meantime, save slayer-slaying
for the professionals.

409
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:24,088
You'll see. Buffy'll be dead by sunrise.

410
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:26,084
I've got a plan.

411
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:30,689
Let me guess. Snatch one of her friends,
use 'em as bait, lead her into a trap.

412
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:32,650
That sort of thing?

413
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:35,725
No. Much, much better one.

414
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:39,288
I'm not gonna tell you!

415
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,091
Thought as much.

416
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:45,371
Best of luck. Let me know how this
archvillain thing works out for you.

417
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:48,126
I'll do that. And after Buffy is gone,

418
00:29:48,213 --> 00:29:52,764
I'm gonna kill everybody in this town
that was ever mean to me. Spike!

419
00:29:57,893 --> 00:29:59,884
Guys! New plan.

420
00:30:03,213 --> 00:30:05,932
A lot of weapons for somebody
you weren't sweating.

421
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:09,562
That was before Dawn gave Harmony
a pass to kill us all in our sleep.

422
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:13,441
Buff, Willow'll come do a return
engagement of her uninvitation spell.

423
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:17,606
She still has the stuff from last week.
You're back in the Fortress of Solitude.

424
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:20,765
- All better.
- No. Not all better.

425
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:24,368
It's not like Dawn hasn't grown up
in this house knowing all the rules.

426
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:27,490
Especially the biggie! Numero one-o.

427
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:30,929
"Do not invite bloodsucking
dead people into our home."

428
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:35,687
I mean, please. I would never have
Harmony over even when she was alive.

429
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:38,492
People slip, Buffy. Your mom did.

430
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:43,169
She invited in the mas... Dracula in for coffee.

431
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:47,326
Well, that was different. I mean, she...

432
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,207
He would...

433
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:56,845
She was Ionely and she didn't know
he was a vampire. The vampire.

434
00:30:56,933 --> 00:31:01,211
Dawn knew exactly what Harmony was
when she rolled out the welcome mat for her.

435
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:05,047
- She's just a kid.
- Will everybody please stop saying that?

436
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:09,445
I was just a kid when I met my first vampire,
but I still managed to remember the rules.

437
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,444
You had to. It was yourjob.

438
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:17,005
No. No, it was common sense. But nobody
expects even that much from Dawn, do they?

439
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:20,927
No. She has to be protected
and coddled from the big bad world.

440
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:26,531
We are doing nothing but turning her into
a little idiot who is going to get us all killed.

441
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:37,048
She just has to be more careful.

442
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:41,285
Now, I can't be there
to protect her 24 hours a day.

443
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:43,364
I just can't.

444
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,964
Hey! Don't!

445
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:54,325
Dawn!

446
00:31:58,973 --> 00:32:01,203
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone.

447
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:03,568
I will after you come back inside the house.

448
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:07,043
- Let go of me!
- No, it's not safe out here.

449
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,643
You got that right.

450
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:27,084
Anya!

451
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,323
Vampires took...

452
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,325
This head wound looks bad.
We better get her to a hospital.

453
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:42,052
- They took her...
- Easy. Sh, sh.

454
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,846
Dawn.

455
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:47,288
Dawn? What about Dawn?

456
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:49,841
She ran out. They took her.

457
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:52,923
Vampires.

458
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,607
Oh, God. Oh, God.

459
00:32:56,573 --> 00:32:58,529
Take care of Anya.

460
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:00,569
Buffy!

461
00:33:00,653 --> 00:33:04,362
All right. Once again, nice work, minionators.

462
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:06,842
I'm really, really proud of you guys.

463
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:12,409
Ah, Mort. I trust you made
our guest comfortable?

464
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,649
You told me to chain her to a wall.

465
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:20,682
Yeah, I know. I'm being,
you know, sarcastic or whatever.

466
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:26,766
Anyway, I'm feeling really good about
this new plan, people. I think it's a winner.

467
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:30,766
- When do we eat the girl?
- We don't. Not yet.

468
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:34,368
- Why not?
- Because that's not the plan.

469
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,885
Do I have to go over the plan again?

470
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:42,090
We use the sister as bait.
We send Buffy a note...

471
00:33:42,173 --> 00:33:44,164
More notes?

472
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:49,086
We send Buffy a note, telling her
that if she wants to see her sister again,

473
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:52,051
she has to come alone to a place we choose.

474
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:55,205
She comes, we jump her, we kill her.

475
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:58,808
So it doesn't matter if we're actually
holding the Slayer's sister.

476
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:02,488
Just as long as she thinks we are,
she'll walk into the trap.

477
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:04,288
I guess.

478
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,648
So we can eat the girl now.

479
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:09,964
- We're not eating the girl.
- Why not?

480
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:12,931
Because that's not the plan.

481
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,286
Bollocks. Gonna have to pinch
one of those satellite dishes.

482
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:31,686
Well, speaking of dishes,
to what do I owe this unpleasant sur...

483
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:33,331
Bloody hell!

484
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:36,052
I don't have time for banter.
Where's Harmony's lair?

485
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:39,284
Haven't seen her in months.
How should I know?

486
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:43,286
- Where is she?
- At least lay off the nose.

487
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:47,366
OK, OK! Used to have a cave
in the north woods.

488
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,650
About 40 metres past
the overpass construction site.

489
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:54,568
I was telling you the truth!

490
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:56,530
I know.

491
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:04,648
They don't respect me. They pretend they do,
but deep down they think I'm nothing.

492
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:07,884
I mean, I'm the one
who put this group together. Me!

493
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:11,010
But they treat me like I don't even matter.

494
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:14,722
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

495
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,087
A little.

496
00:35:16,173 --> 00:35:19,085
They have no idea
how much pressure I'm under.

497
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:22,961
I have to make all the hard decisions.
And it's hard!

498
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:29,012
Excuse me. I didn't hear anybody knock.

499
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:33,447
We've been talking it over
and we decided we don't like this plan.

500
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:36,001
Except for Brad. He abstained.

501
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,766
Oh, really? You have a plan you like better?

502
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,966
We're gonna feed on the girl and kill you.
Maybe not in that order.

503
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:47,811
I don't think I like your attitude, Mort.

504
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:51,564
Kill him for me.

505
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:58,002
All right. You're all on my list.

506
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:05,283
This isn't fair.
OK, so things haven't been perfect.

507
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:09,127
I just need a little more time
to grow into my leadership role.

508
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:11,204
Time's up.

509
00:36:16,413 --> 00:36:19,610
Touch me and my sister's gonna kill you.

510
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:35,522
Can't say she didn't warn him.

511
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:39,731
- And you didn't like the plan.
- Dawn, close your eyes.

512
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:42,486
So, Slayer, at last we meet.

513
00:36:42,853 --> 00:36:45,208
We've met, Harmony, you halfwit.

514
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:50,164
I'm the halfwit? Excuse me,
but look who's fallen into my...

515
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:00,246
trap.

516
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:04,485
Harmony, when you tried to be
head cheerleader, you were bad.

517
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:07,849
When you tried to chair
the homecoming committee, you were bad.

518
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:11,005
But when you try to be bad, you suck.

519
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:14,045
Buffy, watch out!

520
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:20,125
Good shot, Mort! I think you got her on the...

521
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:27,607
You are going to be
in so much trouble when we get home.

522
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:30,846
Yeah, well, I'm telling Mom
you slayed in front of me.

523
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:34,409
Fine. I'll tell her you ran
out of the house in the middle of the night,

524
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:38,771
that you got Anya hurt,
invited a vampire in, got kidnapped...

525
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:53,085
Sorry it ran so late. Everything go OK?

526
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:57,407
Yeah. Yeah, you know.

527
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:00,371
I got the vamps and we watched some TV.

528
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:04,651
Well, I know at least one of us
who's supposed to be in bed by now.

529
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:09,924
Good night.

530
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:14,813
- So how was the exhibit?
- It was fantastic.

531
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:18,932
Buffy probably would've gotten
in way more trouble than me anyway.

532
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:22,403
But I guess it was pretty OK of her
not to say anything to Mom.

533
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:27,362
Anya's gonna be OK and Xander wasn't
mad at me. So stuff. mostly worked out.

534
00:39:27,453 --> 00:39:30,809
- Giles, are you sure about this?
- Why wouldn't I be?

535
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:36,650
Most magic-shop owners in Sunnydale have
the life expectancy of a Spinal Tap drummer.

536
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:39,964
- And have you ever run a store before?
- I was a librarian for years.

537
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:43,443
This is the same, except people
pay for the things they never return.

538
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:46,650
It'll give me focus,
help increase my resources.

539
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:50,203
And it'll prevent you lot from
trampling all over my flat at all hours.

540
00:39:50,293 --> 00:39:52,807
There may even be space
for you to train in the back.

541
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:57,171
Boy, you've really thought this through.
How bored were you last year?

542
00:39:57,253 --> 00:40:00,484
I watched Passions with Spike.
Let us never speak of it.

543
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:10,290
Don't break anything.

544
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:16,133
Just don't touch anything.

545
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:20,411
Not that Buffy's really changed at all.
Like she ever would.

546
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:26,607
What you're doing right now, not moving?
Good. Keep doing that.

547
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,371
She still thinks I'm Little Miss Nobody,

548
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:35,047
just her dumb little sister.

549
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,731
Boy, is she in for a surprise!

550
00:41:00,093 --> 00:41:03,290
