1
00:00:00,802 --> 00:00:03,605
In every generation, there is a Chosen One.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:09,423
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness.

3
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,554
She is the Slayer.

4
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:18,813
Is she dying?

5
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,222
I think she's singing.

6
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,850
To a telephone, in Hindi.

7
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:26,027
Now, that's entertainment.

8
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:28,230
Why is she singing?

9
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:31,149
She's sad because
her lover gave her 12 gold coins.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,435
But then the wizard
cut open a bag of salt...

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,798
and now the dancing minions have
nowhere to put their big maypole...

12
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,693
- fish thing.
- Uh-huh.

13
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:42,658
Why is she singing?

14
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,596
Her lover?
I thought that was her chiropractor?

15
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:49,215
Because of that thing he did with her feet?
No, that was personal.

16
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:52,450
And we thought just because we didn't have
any money or any place to go,

17
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:54,645
this'd be a lackluster evening.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,227
I know! We could go to the Bronze, sneak
in our own tea bags and ask for hot water.

19
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:02,141
Hop off the outlaw train, Will,
before you land us all in jail.

20
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:06,005
I, for one, am giddy and up.
There's a kind of hush all over Sunnydale.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,289
No demons or vampires to slay.
I'm here with my friends.

22
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:13,827
So how does
the water buffalo fit in again?

23
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:33,455
Callie! Callie.

24
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,857
Where are you going?

25
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:39,275
The party's just gettin' started.

26
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,195
<b>"Reptile Boy"</b>

27
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:49,146
See? Dr Debbi says
when a man is speaking,

28
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:52,695
you make serious eye contact
and really, really listen.

29
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,792
And you laugh at everything he says.

30
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,788
- You dreamed about Angel again?
- Third night in a row.

31
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:06,378
What did he do in the dream?

32
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,817
- Stuff.
- Oh, stuff.

33
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:10,844
Was it one of those vivid dreams

34
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,657
where you could feel his lips
and smell his hair?

35
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:16,224
It had surround sound!

36
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,839
I'm just thinking about him
so much lately.

37
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,229
You two are so right for each other.

38
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:24,357
- Except for the, uh...
- Vampire thing.

39
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:28,191
That doesn't make him
a bad person... necessarily.

40
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,806
I'm brainsick.
I can't have a relationship with him!

41
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:36,221
Not during the day, but... you could
ask him for coffee some night.

42
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,798
It's the non-relationship drink of choice.

43
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:42,199
It's not a date.
It's a caffeinated beverage.

44
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:46,028
OK, sure, it's hot and bitter,
like a relationship that way, but...

45
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:48,917
- What's like a relationship?
- Nothing I have.

46
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:50,208
- Coffee?
- Huh?

47
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:53,698
There's really no comparison between
college men and high-school boys.

48
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:57,815
- I mean, look at that.
- So, Cor, you're datin' college guys now?

49
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,798
Well, not that it's any of your business,
but I happen to be dating

50
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,520
a Delta Zeta Kappa.

51
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,924
Oh, an extraterrestrial!

52
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:07,714
So that's how you get a date
after you exhausted all the human guys.

53
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:09,871
You'll go to college someday, Xander.

54
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:15,197
I just know your pizza-delivery career
will take you so many exciting places.

55
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:24,459
Oh! I told Giles I'd meet him
in the library ten minutes ago.

56
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:28,657
Aw, he won't be upset. There hasn't been
much paranormal activity lately.

57
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:32,734
Just because the paranormal is more
"normal" and less... "para" of late...

58
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,662
is no excuse for tardiness
or letting your guard down.

59
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,210
- I haven't let my guard down.
- Oh, really?

60
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:40,537
You yawned your way through
weapons training last week, you, you, you,

61
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:42,731
you skipped hand-to-hand entirely...

62
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:46,064
Are you going to be prepared if a demon
springs up behind you and does this?

63
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:51,252
Well, I'm, I'm not a demon.

64
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,830
Which is why you should let go now.

65
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:55,657
Thank you.

66
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,929
When you live on top of
a... a mystical convergence,

67
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,034
it's only a matter of time
before a fresh hell breaks loose.

68
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,205
Now is the time that
you should train more strictly.

69
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,362
You should...
hunt and patrol more keenly.

70
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:11,996
You should hone your skills
day and night.

71
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:14,323
And the little slice of life
that still belongs to me

72
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,969
from, I don't know,
7 to 7.05 in the morning,

73
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:18,966
- Can I do what I want then?
- Buffy, you think I don't know

74
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:22,719
- what it's like to be 16?
- No. I think you don't know

75
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,554
what it's like to be 16,
and a girl, and the Slayer.

76
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:28,131
Fair enough. No, I don't.

77
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,074
Or what it's like
to have to stake vampires

78
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:33,862
while you're having
fuzzy feelings towards one.

79
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:37,442
Taking on the undead doesn't
exactly do wonders for your social life.

80
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:41,361
That's exactly where
being different comes in handy.

81
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:43,830
Right. Who needs a social life
when you've got your very own Hellmouth?

82
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:47,602
Yes! You, you, you have
a duty, a, a purpose.

83
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:50,741
You have a commitment in life. Now,
how many people your age can say that?

84
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:53,134
We talkin' foreign or domestic?

85
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:55,200
How about none?

86
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:58,796
Well, here's a hard fact of life:
we all have to do things we don't like.

87
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:00,790
And you have hand-to-hand this afternoon
and patrol tonight.

88
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:03,724
So I, I suggest you come straight here
at the end of, of period six

89
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,220
and, and get your homework done,
and don't dawdle with your friends.

90
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:11,821
And don't think sitting there pouting
is gonna get to me, because it won't.

91
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:15,879
It's not getting to me.

92
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:19,616
Boy, what a long day.

93
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:23,660
- And you skipped three classes.
- Yeah. And, of course, they flew by.

94
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:25,617
Buffy.

95
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:29,251
Aren't you supposed to be doing
your homework in the library?

96
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:32,144
I'm dawdling... with my friends.

97
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,581
Works for me.

98
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,420
- You OK?
- Jeez.

99
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:46,518
- Cordelia.
- Hi, Richard.

100
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,874
Nice car.

101
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:55,710
So, uh, we're having a little get-together
tomorrow night at the house.

102
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:58,430
And... it's gonna be
a really special evening.

103
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:05,451
- Excuse me?
- Oh. I would... I'd love, love to go.

104
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,452
So, who's your friend?

105
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,162
- Her? Oh, she's not my friend.
- She's amazing.

106
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:15,639
She's more like a sister, really!
We're that close.

107
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:17,753
Why don't you introduce us?

108
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,927
OK.

109
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:24,255
OK, so tonight, channel 59: Indian TV.

110
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,709
Sex, lies, incomprehensible story lines.
I'll bring the betel nuts.

111
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:30,270
Come on. Richard and his
fraternity brother wanna meet you.

112
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:32,682
Well, I don't really wanna meet
any fraternity boys.

113
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:35,957
If there was a God,
don't you think he'd keep it that way?

114
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:38,261
Uh, I-I believe we were dawdling here!

115
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:45,147
- Hi, sweetheart. I'm Richard. And you are?
- So not interested.

116
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:49,421
- Oh! She's such a little comedienne.
- What? She likes to play hard to get?

117
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:53,335
No, Richard. I think
you're playing easy to resist.

118
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:57,245
Feel free to ignore him. I do all the time.

119
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,637
I'm Tom Warner. I'm a senior
at Crestwood College, and I...

120
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,460
And I just feel like a complete dolt
meeting you this way, so...

121
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:10,018
here I stand in all my doltishness.

122
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:13,487
Right! Like she's gonna fall for that.

123
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:16,182
- I'm... Buffy Summers.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

124
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:18,485
- Are you a senior here?
- Junior.

125
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,501
Oh, me too. Except that
I'm a senior and I'm in college.

126
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:27,902
So we have that in common.
And... I major in history.

127
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:30,202
Mm, history stumps me.

128
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,448
I have a hard enough time remembering
what happened last week.

129
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:35,751
No, nothin' happened last week -
don't worry. I was there.

130
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:38,751
She's gonna walk away.

131
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,007
Now.

132
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:43,255
So, uh...

133
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:49,270
My friend invited your friend
to a party we're having this weekend.

134
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,699
You know, actually
he's not even really my friend.

135
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:56,057
I only joined the fraternity because
my father and grandpa were in it before me.

136
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:57,983
You know. It meant a lot to them.

137
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:01,061
OK, boots, start a-walkin'.

138
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:03,999
Oh, I know, I talk too much anyway.
They're really dull parties

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,844
full of really dull people, so...

140
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,786
Would you like to come
and save me from a really dull fate?

141
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:12,617
Oh, I wish I could, but...

142
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:16,280
- I'm sort of involved.
- Oh, sure, of course you are.

143
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:20,269
Well, thanks for letting me ramble.

144
00:10:20,422 --> 00:10:24,022
You know, people underestimate
the value of a good ramble.

145
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:26,662
Buffy!

146
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:32,484
Oh, I gotta go.

147
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:38,624
- It was nice to meet you.
- Oh. Same here.

148
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:53,158
I hate these guys. Whatever
they want just falls into their laps.

149
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:56,686
- Don't you hate these guys?
- Yeah. With their charmed lives

150
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:01,187
and their movie-star good looks
and more money than you can count...

151
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:02,797
I'm hating.

152
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:08,419
I'm going to attack you.

153
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:13,068
Word of warning for your own good:
I won't be pulling any punches.

154
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:14,309
Please don't.

155
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:26,389
Good. So, um, you're on patrol.

156
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:29,094
And, uh, I'll see you in the morning.

157
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,606
There's blood on it.

158
00:12:01,706 --> 00:12:03,922
Hi.

159
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,515
It's nice to... Blood?

160
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:09,364
I can smell it.

161
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:15,003
It's pretty thin.
Probably belonged to a girl.

162
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:17,796
Probably.

163
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:23,138
I-I was... just... thinking,
wouldn't it be...

164
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:27,685
funny some time to see each other
when it wasn't a blood thing?

165
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:30,911
Not funny ha-ha.

166
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:33,281
What are you sayin',
you wanna have a date?

167
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:35,507
- No.
- You don't wanna have a date?

168
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:38,195
Who said date? I-I-I never said date.

169
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,838
Right. You just wanna have
coffee or something.

170
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:43,444
- Coffee?
- I knew this was gonna happen.

171
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:46,126
What? What do you think is happening?

172
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:50,272
- You're 16 years old. I'm 241.
- I've done the math.

173
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,614
You don't know what you're doing,
you don't know what you want...

174
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,946
Oh. No, I, I think I do.
I want out of this conversation.

175
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:02,717
Listen. If we date, you and I both know
one thing's gonna lead to another.

176
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:05,506
One thing already has led to another.

177
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:08,348
You think it's a little late
to be reading me a warning label?

178
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:11,776
I'm just trying to protect you.
This could get out of control.

179
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:14,637
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?

180
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:20,150
This isn't some fairy tale.

181
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:23,704
When I kiss you,
you don't wake up from a deep sleep

182
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:27,317
- and live happily ever after.
- No.

183
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:31,840
When you kiss me, I wanna die.

184
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:50,140
Buffy! Did you lose weight?

185
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:52,347
And your hair...

186
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,698
All right, I respect you too much
to be dishonest.

187
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,596
The hair's a little...

188
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:59,217
Well, that really
isn't the point here, is it?

189
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:02,626
The Zeta Kappas have to have
a certain balance at their party.

190
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:06,230
And Richard explained it all to me,
but I was so busy "really listening"

191
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:08,362
that I didn't hear much.

192
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:13,720
Anyway, the deal is they need you to go.
And if you don't go, I can't.

193
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:16,282
And I'm talking about
Richard Anderson, OK?

194
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:20,470
as in Anderson Farms,
Anderson Aeronautics...

195
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:23,136
and Anderson Cosmetics.

196
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:28,126
Well, you see why I have to go?

197
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:31,402
Buffy, these men are rich,
and I am not being shallow.

198
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,359
Think of the poor people
I could help with all my money.

199
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:36,594
- I'll go.
- You'll go?

200
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:40,018
Great! I'll drive.
Oh, Buffy, it's like we're sisters!

201
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:43,708
With really different hair.

202
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:49,022
- I pledge my life and my death.
- I pledge my life and my death.

203
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:52,802
To the Delta Zeta Kappas
and to Machida whom we serve.

204
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:55,739
To the Delta Zeta Kappas
and to Machida whom we serve.

205
00:14:56,031 --> 00:15:00,816
On my oath, before my assembled brethren.

206
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:03,813
On my oath, before my assembled brethren.

207
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:08,028
I promise to keep our secret
from this day until my death.

208
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:12,398
I promise to keep our secret
from this day until my death.

209
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:18,453
In blood I was baptized,
in blood I shall reign, in his name.

210
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:22,258
In blood I was baptized,
and in blood I shall reign,

211
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:24,184
in his name.

212
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:26,327
You're now one of us.

213
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:28,271
- In his name!
- In his name!

214
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:32,271
- Brewski time!
- Party!

215
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:42,863
So, what's a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

216
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:46,341
- Please, let me go.
- Let you go?

217
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:48,765
OK, let me think. Mm, no!

218
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,578
God, I love high-school girls.

219
00:16:05,475 --> 00:16:10,480
You're going to the fraternity party?
What made you change your mind?

220
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:13,399
- Angel.
- He's going with you?

221
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:15,898
She's got a date with Angel!
Isn't that exciting?

222
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,471
- I'm elated.
- I, I'm not going with Angel.

223
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:20,490
I'm going with...

224
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:24,227
- Ye gods! Cordelia.
- Cordelia?!

225
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:28,362
Did I sound a little jealous just then?
'Cause I'm not really... Cordelia?

226
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:31,061
Cordelia's much better for you than Angel.

227
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:34,818
- What happened with Angel?
- Nothing. As usual.

228
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,282
- A whole lot of nothing with Angel.
- Bummer.

229
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:41,761
I don't understand.
I mean, he likes you. More than likes.

230
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:45,800
- Angel barely says two words to me.
- Don't you hate that?

231
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:48,415
When he does,
he treats me like I'm a child.

232
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,994
That bastard!

233
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,826
You know, at least
Tom can carry on a conversation.

234
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:57,408
- Yeah! Tom? Who's Tom?
- The frat guy.

235
00:16:57,443 --> 00:17:01,138
Oh, Buffy, I don't think so.
Frying pan, fire?

236
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:03,216
You know what I'm sayin'?

237
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:19,960
Will you be ready
if a vampire's behind you?

238
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:27,366
Didn't see you three... creeping about.

239
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:32,116
Um, how did it go last night?

240
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:35,837
I found this.

241
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:40,976
E-N-T

242
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:44,478
- I've seen something like that before.
- It's broken in two.

243
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,944
I don't know what the rest of the letters
might have spelled.

244
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:50,569
- And there's blood on it.
- Oh. I didn't see any.

245
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:55,089
- Angel showed up. He could smell it.
- The blood?

246
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,122
There's a guy you wanna party with.

247
00:17:58,213 --> 00:18:02,310
- Blood.
- In Sunnydale. What a surprise.

248
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:06,446
OK, here's what we're gonna do. She should
probably make the rounds again tonight.

249
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,406
And we should try to figure out
who that bracelet belongs to.

250
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:11,551
Yes, good idea, yes.
She'll patrol, and, and we'll reconvene...

251
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:15,005
Uh, hello? "She" is standing right here!

252
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,207
- And she's not available.
- Why not?

253
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:20,735
- Buffy, this is a little more important...
- I've got a mountain of homework to do,

254
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:26,155
And, um... my mom's not really feeling well
and she could probably use my help.

255
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,619
And, um, to be truthful,
I'm not feeling all that well myself.

256
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:32,197
Oh, w-well, um, sorry, of course.
If-if-if you're not well.

257
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:34,723
Oh, I'll take an early pass
this evening, and, um...

258
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,833
one later on, but
for the bulk of the evening...

259
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:39,530
You should stay home with your mother.

260
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:46,586
- Well, say it.
- I'm not gonna say it.

261
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:48,760
- You lied to Giles.
- 'Cause she will.

262
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,343
Look, I wasn't lying.
I was just protecting him

263
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:54,959
from information that
he wouldn't be able to...

264
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:57,322
- digest properly.
- Like a corn dog.

265
00:18:57,357 --> 00:19:01,075
Like you don't have a sick mother,
but you'd rather go to a frat party...

266
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,211
where there's gonna be drinking
and older guys and probably an orgy.

267
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:08,468
Whoa! Whoa, rewind. Since when
do they have orgies, and why aren't I

268
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:10,336
- on the mailing list?
- There's no orgies!

269
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:13,913
I heard a lot of wild things go on
at frat parties.

270
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:17,042
OK, you know what? Look, seven days a week
I am busy saving the world.

271
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:19,581
Once in a great while
I wanna have some fun.

272
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,147
And that's what I'm gonna have. Fun!

273
00:19:22,182 --> 00:19:24,749
This isn't about fun. This is about duty.

274
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:28,343
Your duty to help me achieve
permanent prosperity, OK?

275
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:30,003
Dos and don'ts:

276
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:33,933
don't wear black, silk, chiffon or spandex.
These are my trademarks.

277
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:36,010
And don't do
that weird thing with your hair.

278
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:38,013
- What weird thing with my...
- Don't interrupt.

279
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:42,073
Do be interested if someone should
speak to you. It may or may not happen.

280
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:45,612
But do be polite
and laugh at the appropriate intervals.

281
00:19:47,697 --> 00:19:49,703
Do lie to your mom about
where we're going.

282
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:51,792
It's a fraternity
and there will be drinking.

283
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:54,266
So, Cor, you printing up business cards
with your pager number

284
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:56,491
and hours of operation,
or just going with a halter top tonight?

285
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:59,400
Oh, are we feeling a little envious?

286
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:05,250
You could belong to a fraternity of rich
and powerful men... in the Bizarro World.

287
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:09,841
- Do you guys wanna join us?
- Nah. I gotta digest and all.

288
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,157
Make-up, make-up. Well...

289
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:14,746
Give it your all
and keep to the shadows.

290
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:17,006
We're gonna have a blast!

291
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:23,269
I can't believe she lied to Giles.
My world is all askew.

292
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:26,740
Buffy's lying?
Buffy's going to frat parties?

293
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,989
That's not askew, that's cockeyed.

294
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:31,640
Askew means cockeyed.

295
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:33,365
Oh.

296
00:20:33,703 --> 00:20:37,553
Well, there's nothing we can do about it.
We'll help Giles.

297
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:39,724
- I'm goin' to the party.
- What?

298
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,255
I've got to keep an eye on Buffy.
Those frat guys creep me.

299
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:45,046
- You wanna protect her?
- Mm-hm.

300
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:48,491
And prove that you're just as good
as those rich, snotty guys?

301
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:50,302
- Mm-hm.
- And maybe catch an orgy?

302
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,230
If it's on early.

303
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:04,645
Why do they park
so darn close to you?

304
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,860
- Are you ready for this?
- I don't know.

305
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:11,978
- Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
- Me, too. Let's go.

306
00:21:15,393 --> 00:21:17,038
Come on!

307
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:22,247
- Beaucoup babes!
- Ooh, yeah!

308
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:33,901
You know what's so cool
about college? The diversity.

309
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:37,833
You've got all the rich people
and all of the other people.

310
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,394
- Richard!
- Welcome, ladies.

311
00:21:40,518 --> 00:21:41,978
Thank you.

312
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:45,623
- Oh. Is there alcohol in this?
- Just a smidge.

313
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:48,222
Come on, Buffy. It's just a smidge.

314
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:51,154
- I'll just...
- I understand.

315
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:53,882
When I was your age
I wasn't into grown up things either.

316
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,950
Have you seen our multi-media room?

317
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,718
Oh, the one with the cherry walnut paneling

318
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:00,538
and the two forty-eight-inch televisions
on satellite feed?

319
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:02,707
- No. Wanna show me?
- What about...?

320
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,608
Oh, her? She's happiest by herself.

321
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:13,427
<b><i>(#"Wolves" by Clement & Murray)</b></i>

322
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:20,535
<i># Her name's Alexandra,
She walks into the room...</i>

323
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,607
<i># All the guys' eyes are upon her</i>

324
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:28,035

New girl!

00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:37,927
- Easy, man.
- Dance!

336
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:38,928
<i># So bend and I'll break you</i>

337
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:44,407
- Easy, man.
- Come on, sweetheart. Yeah!

338
00:23:44,442 --> 00:23:46,603
- Could I have this dance?
- Come on!

00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:57,656
- Thanks for...
- No.

341
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:01,003
We're not all a bunch of drunken louts.

342
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:04,042
Some of us are sober louts!

343
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:07,407
I'm really glad that you decided to come.

344
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,402
And... you're not.

345
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,797
No. It's...

346
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:16,365
I shouldn't be here.

347
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,593
Because you're seeing someone.

348
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:20,095
No.

349
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:23,263
You're not seeing someone?

350
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:26,005
Someone's not seeing me.

351
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,828
So... why shouldn't you be here?

352
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:33,976
Because I have obligations.
People that...

353
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:38,732
I'm responsible for...
or to... or with...

354
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:41,234
It's complicated.

355
00:24:41,324 --> 00:24:44,961
You're big on responsibility. I like that.

356
00:24:44,996 --> 00:24:47,580
But there's such a thing
as being too mature.

357
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:52,131
You should relax...
and enjoy yourself once in a while.

358
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:55,714
You think I'm too mature?

359
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:58,883
I talk too much.
Have you picked up on that yet?

360
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:02,389
Anyway, the, uh, Hulk is gone, so...

361
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:05,198
you don't have to dance with me.

362
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:07,642
He might come back.

363
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:13,252
<i># She hates you,
but then she makes a mistake</i>

364
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:16,776
<i># Confused and a lot to take...</i>

365
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,654
Godzilla's attacking downtown Tokyo!

366
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,702
Who's this dork?

367
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:28,455
Never seen him before in my life.

368
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:31,437
We got us a crasher.

369
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:36,051
So, have either of you seen
a pair of girls here?

370
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:38,820
One's about... so high?

371
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:41,676
- Hey, guys.
- New pledge.

372
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,845
- New pledge.
- New pledge!

373
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:46,890
New pledge! New pledge!

374
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:18,920
You OK?

375
00:26:19,547 --> 00:26:22,114
Yeah. I was just thinking.

376
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:26,939
To my Argentinian junk bonds
that just matured into double digits.

377
00:26:28,306 --> 00:26:31,928
To maturity.

378
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:36,546
What the hell. I'm tired of being mature.

379
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:48,326
- Bent.
- Sent.

380
00:26:48,535 --> 00:26:50,120
Rent.

381
00:26:50,412 --> 00:26:53,131
Uh, Lent. Dent.

382
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,852
Went. Kent.

383
00:26:56,887 --> 00:27:00,567
- Kent! That's it!
- Her boyfriend's name was Kent?

384
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:03,550
No. Kent Preparatory School.
Just outside of town.

385
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:05,927
That's where I've seen these bracelets.

386
00:27:06,052 --> 00:27:08,606
- What are you doing?
- Pulling up their school newsletter...

387
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:12,937
for the past few months
to see if there's anything about...

388
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:15,170
A missing girl.

389
00:27:28,575 --> 00:27:32,453
Come on, dance, pretty boy! Keep it movin'.

390
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:37,334
Come on. Shake it! Don't break it!
Wrap it up and I'll take it!

391
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,462
OK, big fun, guys. Who's next?

392
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:43,715
You are, dollface.
Keep on dancing! All right!

393
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:49,573
Keep it up, yeah! Come on, keep it goin'!

394
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:02,421
Tom?

395
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:33,618
Ooh, sorry.

396
00:28:38,195 --> 00:28:40,063
OK.

397
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:42,357
Nice bed.

398
00:28:42,774 --> 00:28:45,443
Just need to stop spinning for...

399
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:14,181
Get away from her!

400
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,947
- I wasn't doing anything.
- I saw what you were doing.

401
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:20,897
- I was just having a little fun.
- She's not here for your fun, you pervert.

402
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:24,980
She's here for the pleasure
of the one we serve.

403
00:29:25,942 --> 00:29:28,006
In his name.

404
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:31,174
And that goes for the other one, too.

405
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,169
Callie Megan Anderson.

406
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:46,588
Missing for over a week.

407
00:29:46,623 --> 00:29:50,822
No one's seen her.
No one knows what happened to her.

408
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:55,263
This being Sunnydale and all,
I guess we can rule out something good.

409
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:58,766
- I'm calling Buffy.
- No!

410
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:02,881
- Why not?
- Because Buffy... and her mother...

411
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:05,376
Are sick. You're quite right.
There's no point in disturbing them

412
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:07,744
until we know more.

413
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:12,568
You mean like...
if there are others?

414
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:17,494
Brittany Oswald, junior at St Michael's,
disappeared a year ago.

415
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:20,932
So did Kelley Percell, sophomore at Grant.

416
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:23,500
- A year?
- Almost to the day.

417
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:27,253
An anniversary or perhaps some other event
significant to the killer.

418
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:30,011
Killer? Now there's a killer?
We don't know that there's a...

419
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:32,884
No, but this being Sunnydale and all...

420
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:34,915
Gulp.

421
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,815
We need to know
where Buffy found that bracelet.

422
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:39,609
We can begin our search there.

423
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:44,049
Good idea! Call Angel.
He was there when Buffy found it.

424
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,954
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

425
00:30:55,207 --> 00:30:58,535
- Party's over, jerkwater.
- Wait. A friend of mine was here.

426
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,829
You know, in that light...

427
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:03,547
with that wig on an' all...

428
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:06,293
you're still butt ugly!

429
00:31:36,072 --> 00:31:39,445
Buffy, where are we?

430
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:42,954
In the basement, as far as I can tell.

431
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:45,393
What's happening?
What did they do to us?

432
00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:47,334
They drugged us.

433
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:50,462
Why? What are they gonna do to us?

434
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:53,690
- I don't know.
- I wanna go home.

435
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:56,799
No one's going home.

436
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:00,078
Ever.

437
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:05,245
Look, one of them's...
different than the others.

438
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:08,063
Nicer.

439
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:10,273
Tom.

440
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:17,117
He's the one to watch out for.

441
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:26,483
- She's last.
- Last? For what?

442
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:29,227
Who's first?

443
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,792
Answer me!

444
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,765
Who's first?

445
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:39,092
Three stones.

446
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,137
Three of us.

447
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:43,440
Buffy...

448
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:47,086
Stay calm. We'll get out of this.

449
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:52,166
Why did I ever let you
talk me into coming here?!

450
00:33:03,868 --> 00:33:07,622
She found the bracelet in the cemetery,
near the south wall.

451
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:10,191
South wall.

452
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:12,694
What are you doing?

453
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:18,085
Oh, sorry. The reflection thing
that you don't have.

454
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,949
Angel, how do you shave?

455
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:25,042
South wall,
that's near the college. And...

456
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:27,152
the fraternity house!

457
00:33:27,187 --> 00:33:29,953
- A fraternity?
- Could they be taking these girls?

458
00:33:30,145 --> 00:33:32,022
Let's get out there.

459
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:34,032
Buffy...

460
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:37,327
We don't know that it's concrete.
Let's not disturb her until...

461
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:39,695
...is there! With Cordelia!

462
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:42,067
They went to a party
at the Zeta Kappa House.

463
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:43,908
- She lied to me?
- Well...

464
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:47,979
- Did... she have a date?
- Well...

465
00:33:48,323 --> 00:33:51,366
Well, why do you think
she went to that party?!

466
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,615
Because you gave her the brush-off!

467
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,717
And you never let her do anything
except work and patrol, and...

468
00:33:57,752 --> 00:34:01,100
I know she's the Chosen One,
but you're killing her with pressure.

469
00:34:01,135 --> 00:34:04,072
I mean, she's 16 going on 40!

470
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:06,550
And you! I mean,
you're gonna live for ever.

471
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:09,711
You don't have time
for a cup of coffee?!

472
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,479
OK.

473
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:16,664
I don't feel better now,
and we've gotta help Buffy.

474
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:25,461
One day I'll have money, prestige, power.

475
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,307
And on that day, they'll still have more.

476
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:36,836
- Machida.
- In his name.

477
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:40,256
We who serve you...

478
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:43,940
we who receive all that you bestow...

479
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:47,070
call upon you in this holy hour.

480
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:49,178
This holy hour.

481
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,355
We have no wealth...

482
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,551
no possession, except that
what you give us.

483
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:58,101
- Except what you give us.
- We have no power...

484
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:00,635
no place in the world...

485
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,619
- except that what you give us.
- Except that what you give us.

486
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:06,945
What are they,
some kind of cult or something?

487
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:09,494
Yeah. Psycho-cult.

488
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:12,998
- You've gotta do something.
- It's been a year since our last offering.

489
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:16,118
A year in which our bounty overflowed.

490
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:19,913
We come before you
with fresh offerings.

491
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,882
Offerings? He's talking about us?

492
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:26,979
Do you see anyone else
chained up in here?

493
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:32,017
Accept our offering, dark lord,

494
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:34,288
and bless us with your power...

495
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:38,341
- Machida!
- Machida!

496
00:35:39,524 --> 00:35:41,702
- What's down there?
- Come forth

497
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:47,657
and let your terrible countenance look upon
your servants and their humble offering.

498
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:50,076
We call you, Machida.

499
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:54,205
In his name, Machida!

500
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,818
There's something down there
and he's gonna throw us down there with it!

501
00:35:58,853 --> 00:36:02,572
- I don't think so.
- No? Well, that's good. That's...

502
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:04,591
I don't think we go to it.

503
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:07,962
I think it comes to us.

504
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,188
Oh, my God!

505
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:26,946
Come on, Buffy!

506
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:29,449
Oh, come on!

507
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:35,260
For he shall rise from the depths
and we shall tremble before him.

508
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:39,335
He who is the source
of all we inherit and all we possess.

509
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,361
- Machida.
- Machida.

510
00:36:41,396 --> 00:36:46,366
And if he is pleased with our offerings,
then our fortunes shall increase.

511
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:49,499
Machida, let our fortunes increase.

512
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:52,132
And on the tenth day of the tenth month,

513
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:57,310
he shall be enhungered
and we shall feed him.

514
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:02,399
Feed him?! Oh, no!

515
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:06,820
Looks like everyone's gone.

516
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,451
- Hey.
- Hey!

517
00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:16,121
What are you guys doing here?

518
00:37:16,496 --> 00:37:20,775
A bunch of girls are missing.
The Zeta Kappas may be involved. And Buffy.

519
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,378
Are you wearing make-up?

520
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:27,573
No. I think Buffy's still inside
somewhere with Cordelia.

521
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:30,158
Their car's still here.

522
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:32,762
- Why are you wearing that?
- I found it in their trash.

523
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:34,597
I saw them through the window.
They were wearing robes.

524
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:37,042
They went down to the basement.
I was gonna sneak in.

525
00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:38,930
They may be involved
in some kind of ritual.

526
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:43,853
- With the missing girls.
- With Buffy!

527
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:47,543
OK, that is the guy you wanna party with.

528
00:37:52,157 --> 00:37:55,554
- Hey, Reptile Boy!
- No woman speaks to him.

529
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,875
You don't want her. Look at her.
She's all skin and bones.

530
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,817
- Half an hour later you'll be hungry.
- I told you to shut up!

531
00:38:04,044 --> 00:38:06,421
You speak again,
and I'll cut your throat.

532
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:18,308
Got locked out dumping the trash.

533
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:21,102
Let me in. I don't wanna miss the, uh...

534
00:38:21,186 --> 00:38:24,887
- Come on.
- You know what. Where are they?

535
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:39,161
Something's going on upstairs. Go! Go!

536
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:48,380
Feed, dark lord.

537
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,546
That's for the wig! That's for the bra!

538
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:20,396
Some guy's attacking Buffy with a sword!
Also, there's a really big snake!

539
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:23,626
That's for the make-up!

540
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,160
And that's for the last
sixteen and a half years!

541
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:28,852
Guys! Buffy! Snake! Basement now!

542
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:38,026
You bitch!
I'll serve you to him in pieces.

543
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:40,682
Tom, you talk too much.

544
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,565
Help! Help!

545
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:54,487
Let her go, Wormy!

546
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:09,919
You did it.

547
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:12,057
You saved us.

548
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:16,231
I've never been so happy
to see anyone in my whole...

549
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:18,553
You guys, I just...

550
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:21,194
hate you guys.

551
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:24,509
The weirdest things
always happen when you're around.

552
00:40:24,544 --> 00:40:29,474
And you!
You're goin' to jail for 15,000 years.

553
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:43,703
I told one lie. I had one drink.

554
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:48,829
Yes. And you were very nearly
devoured by a giant demon snake.

555
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:52,462
The words "let that be a lesson"
are a tad redundant at this juncture.

556
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:55,774
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

557
00:40:56,841 --> 00:40:58,969
I...

558
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:04,049
I drive you too hard
because I know what you have to face.

559
00:41:04,084 --> 00:41:08,364
From now on,
no more pushing, no more prodding.

560
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,712
Just, um...

561
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:14,612
an inordinate amount of nudging.

562
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,601
Come on, come on, hurry!

563
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:25,769
There you go.

564
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,619
Thank you, Jonathan.

565
00:41:32,654 --> 00:41:34,212
Did we forget something?

566
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:35,672
Um...

567
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,475
Cinnamon, chocolate, half-caf, non-fat.

568
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:42,470
Extra foam!

569
00:41:46,891 --> 00:41:51,279
Young men are the only way to go.

570
00:41:53,148 --> 00:41:58,460
Says here that they've all been
sentenced to consecutive life sentences.

571
00:41:58,495 --> 00:42:01,299
"Investigators found the bones
of missing girls in a huge cavern

572
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,035
beneath the frat house.
And older bones dating back 50 years."

573
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,108
"A surprising number of corporations

574
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,414
whose chairmen and founders
are former Delta Zeta Kappas

575
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:12,887
are suffering from
falling profits, IRS raids..."

576
00:42:12,922 --> 00:42:16,560
Oh, "and suicides in the boardroom."
Starve a snake, lose a fortune.

577
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:19,424
Boy, I guess the rich
really are different, huh?

578
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:21,401
Have you heard from Angel?

579
00:42:21,436 --> 00:42:27,593
When he got so mad about you being
in danger, and changed into a... grrr...

580
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,060
it was the most amazing thing I ever saw.

581
00:42:30,095 --> 00:42:33,388
- I mean, how many guys can...
- Angel, Angel, Angel.

582
00:42:33,423 --> 00:42:36,277
Does every conversation we have
have to come around to that freak?

583
00:42:36,312 --> 00:42:39,402
- Hey, man, how you doin'?
- Buffy.

584
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,946
- Angel.
- Xander.

585
00:42:42,046 --> 00:42:44,829
I hear this place, uh, serves coffee.

586
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:47,567
I thought maybe you and I
should get some...

587
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:49,516
Sometime.

588
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:53,208
If you want.

589
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:55,085
Yeah.

590
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,556
Sometime.

591
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:01,341
I'll let you know.

592
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:07,676
<i># If she bends, then she breaks</i>

593
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:14,024
<i># She loves you,
but then she takes it away...</i>
