1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,750
- Previously:
- I'm using you.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,710
- This is you telling me...
- It's over.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,030
- Where have you guys been?
- Watching Buffy on the remote surveillance.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,590
- I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
- She was seeing someone else.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,870
Xander's gone? Xander's missing?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,910
- Is she here?
- She left a couple of days ago.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,590
She was... kinda broken.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,750
I love her and, God, I miss her so much.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,390
No!

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,470
How could you do this?

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,030
Buffy, stop! No!

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,470
- I'm so sorry.
- We're OK. It's all OK.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,990
Aha!

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,430
- They're getting to the gate!
- Yeah, I see it, I see it!

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,110
We're gonna lose'em.

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,350
We need that disc.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,070
Wait.

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,190
- How ya doin'?
- Oh, fine.

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,150
You know, same old, same old.

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,870
Yeah. I could take care of this guy
if you want.

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,590
Whatever. Your call.

23
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,110
I mean, sure, he don't look like much,
but I'd wager he could give you a bit o' nasty.

24
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,110
Save you the staking.
All you gotta do is...

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,430
I am not telling my friends about us.

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,350
Right, I'll just be droppin' him
down to you, then.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,790
You wanna tell'em so badly? Go ahead.

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,550
You know why? I tried to kill
my friends, my sister last week,

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,510
and guess how much they hate me.

30
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,980
Zero. Zero much.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,460
So I'm thinkin', sleeping with you...

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,700
they'll deal.

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,990
In that case, why won't
you sleep with me again?

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,870
Huh?

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,070
Because I don't love you.

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,870
Like hell.

37
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,950

38
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,790
Hey!

39
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,350
Hey. Look at you.
All comin' out of class and everything.

40
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,630
I do that sometimes.
Usually at the end part of the class.

41
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,230
Right.

42
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,750
So how's your...
after the whole basement deal?

43
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,110
It's between a hitch and a kink
with a side of a twinge. It's OK.

44
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,430
And Buffy's OK too?
Enjoying the refreshing sanity and so forth?

45
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,670
Ha, yeah! Refreshing sa...

46
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,790
That's funny.

47
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,510
She's OK. A little... freaked.

48
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,270
- I'm glad she didn't hurt you.
- You, too.

49
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,950
So, this is becoming kind of a regular thing,
you and me after class.

50
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,030
Uh... I didn't...

51
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,470
Only this time you stuck around.

52
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,950
Uh... Um... Various sounds of hesitation...

53
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,470
She was just a friend.

54
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,940
Friends are nice!

55
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,550
You rushed off before I could,
you know, explain.

56
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,260
Well, officially, I have to say
I have no idea what you're talking about.

57
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,350
Unofficially?

58
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,750
We should have some coffee sometime.

59
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,950
Maybe some day this week after class?

60
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,790
- I'm free tomorrow.
- You could bring your friend.

61
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,670
I wasn't gonna...
I mean, if you have a friend...

62
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,350
No! I'm... I'm friendless.

63
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,670
Yeah, yeah, no friends.
I mean, I have friends.

64
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,270
Right, many dear friends, yeah.

65
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,670
- Coffee.
- With us.

66
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,140
Who are... just friends.

67
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,070
OK, how about this store?

68
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,340
Ah! Three pairs of earrings,
a coin purse and a toothbrush.

69
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,230
You stole a toothbrush?

70
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,390
- A mother-of-pearl handle. Very fancy.
- Yeah, but you stole a toothbrush.

71
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,990
As far as rebellious teenagers go,
you're square.

72
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,270
Dental hygiene is important.

73
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,150
Guess this was kind of
a lame sisters' day out, huh?

74
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,750
I make up for trying to kill you
by taking you to places you can't go in.

75
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,790
No, it's my bad.
I'm the one that got caught takin' stuff.

76
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,430
The pet store. You didn't
take anything from there, did ya?

77
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,310
A pocketful of goldfish. It didn't work out.

78
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,070
No!

79
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,590
OK, good. We can go look at all the puppies.

80
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,390
Oh... But it's so awful!

81
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,670
There's puppy mills, and keeping them in
cages, and people poking at'em all day.

82
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,300
Yeah, but puppies - cute!
Come on, you used to love the pet store.

83
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,940
Yes, when I was in my fives and sixes.

84
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,070
Come on, we'll go look.

85
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,740
Besides, I don't think there's another store
here where I can... show my face.

86
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,990
It'll pass. You've returned all the stuff
you still had, and we're paying for the rest.

87
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,070
- I'm paying for the rest.
- We'll figure it out.

88
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,910
Get back! You don't wanna
make me rush this.

89
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,710
I'm not impressed, Padawan.
When do we hit pay dirt?

90
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,270
If something goes wrong, it's gonna surge.
We'll be deader than an ex-girlfriend.

91
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,660
- What did you say?
- Just let me work!

92
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,790
All right. You do what you need to do.

93
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,750
You get us the goods, and then watch out!

94
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,310
It'll be like... the whole world
just spread open and gave it up for you, man.

95
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,750
And then we're done, right?
We each take our share and we call it a day.

96
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,630
You're that ready to get rid of us? Huh?

97
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,590
Don't worry. We pull this off, you can
go buy any tropical island you want.

98
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,190
Cheer up, Short Round. You're about
to get us everything we ever wanted.

99
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,070
- He's almost done.
- I sorta feel... kinda sorry for him.

100
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,750
- That's a weakness.
- OK.

101
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,100
Hm... Look at him.

102
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,470
He's got that same look he had that time
I highlighted in his Babylon 5 novels.

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,750
Right before he told his mom on me!
Warren, I don't think we can trust him.

104
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,110
We don't have to. Not for that much longer.

105
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,190
Is it gonna be that soon?

106
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,630
The milk... in the fridge.
How long till it expires?

107
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,910
Well, we got it on Friday,
and there wasn't a full two weeks on it,

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,190
but we did get it in the fridge quick.

109
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,910
Unless I'm thinking about the 2% milk...

110
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,380
Forget it.

111
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,940
The thing. It's gonna be soon.

112
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,270
Oh. Wow.

113
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,270
Oh, my God.

114
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,910
- How are you?
- Ducky. You?

115
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,550
An...

116
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,350
Please...

117
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,110
Let me... explain.

118
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,350
I know there's nothing that I can say or do
to make up for what I did.

119
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,420
I can't.

120
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,870
Sometimes when I wake up in the morning
I'm, like, "Oh, God! Is this my life?"

121
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,510
- "Was that me?"
- Me, too.

122
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,750
But you gotta believe me, please.

123
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,670
I want to make up for it.
I wanna take away the hurt.

124
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,990
I love you so much.

125
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,950
I may have practised that
a couple times in front of the mirror.

126
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,350
I just... I don't understand what happened.

127
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,950
I do. I'm an idiot.

128
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,790
All I had to do was say something earlier.

129
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,270
I could have spared you
from that... that nightmare.

130
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,830
Said something about what?

131
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,630
No, no! I mean... you know,
if I were, like, more self-aware.

132
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,590
Because... with the whole idiot thing.

133
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,750
If you had been more self-aware,
you would have what?

134
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,750
- Been able to stop the wedding?
- No, it's not like that. That's not what...

135
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,070
OK, see, I didn't practise this part.

136
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,540
Do you still want to get married?

137
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,070
Oh.

138
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,910
An, it's a very complicated question.

139
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,710
No, actually, it's really not.
It's kind of an either-or deal.

140
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,310
Do you want to get married?

141
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,630
Someday, yes, very much.

142
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,710
When we're ready.

143
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,110
I don't want you to take this
as a bad thing. It's good.

144
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,470
I love you.

145
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,910
I love you so much.
I'm just trying to be honest with you.

146
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,740
Yes. Honesty now.

147
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,950
Congratulations, Xander,
on being honest now.

148
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,750
I wonder what the medal will say.

149
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,670
- OK, clearly I'm not handling this well.
- Well, duh!

150
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,190
All I want is for us to be together.

151
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,670
I love you. I wish we could just
go back to the way things were before.

152
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,510
And I wish you were never born!

153
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,550
I know this is all coming out wrong.

154
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,950
I wish you felt the pain of
a thousand searing pokers

155
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,150
boiling your heart in its own juices!

156
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,060
I know, honey. I totally deserve that.

157
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,030
I... I wish you had tentacles
where your beady eyes should be!

158
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,110
I wish your intestines were tied in knots
and ripped apart inside your lousy gut!

159
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,580
- They are.
- Really?

160
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,430
- Right now? Does it hurt?
- God, yes.

161
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,820
It hurts so bad it's killin' me.

162
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,270
Anya, I love you. I wanna make this work.

163
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,190
Those are... metaphor intestines!
You're not in any real pain!

164
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,430
- What's wrong with me?
- No, honey, it's not you. It's me...

165
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,710
Oh!

166
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,900
An!

167
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,590
An! Wait, please!

168
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,830
An!

169
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,190
So there was no child support in, like,
11 years. Not a single cheque.

170
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,950
So now, every time he touches a paper
that isn't a cheque for the child, paper cuts.

171
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,110
You know how I hate to toot my own horn,

172
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,990
but now his hands are just covered
in all these tiny little bandages. Like a quilt.

173
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,310
- You know, made of bandages.
- Hm?

174
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,910
OK. Do they not teach
listening skills in human world?

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,030
Sorry. I know. I'm just distracted.

176
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,510
About Xander? Don't worry,
you'll figure out a way to...

177
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,070
That's just it. I've tried everything,
every curse I knew. Nothing's worked.

178
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,230
- Wait. Did you try to curse him yourself?
- I am the wronged party. Of course...

179
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,630
You can't exact justice against someone
on behalf of yourself, silly!

180
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,270
How long you been away?

181
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,550
I haven't been scorned by a man
in, like, a thousand years.

182
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,340
I never had to make a wish for myself.
There has to be some way around that.

183
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,150
Well...

184
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,670
You could try getting someone
to make the wish for you... I suppose.

185
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,300
Uh... Did we open a chain? Are we
the International House or something?

186
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,350
Nope. It felt like a breakfast kind of morning.

187
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,030
- What kind of syrup on your pancakes?
- Syrups have kinds?

188
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,470
Oh! I was thinking, after the mall yesterday,
maybe we shouldn't go out tonight.

189
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,150
Maybe we could stay in and - ow! -
you know, get a pizza or rent a movie?

190
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,780
Also, I didn't know if you had plans,
but I thought maybe we could...

191
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,310
Hey, Buffy? I'm gonna be OK
with the basement thing. Really.

192
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,430
- You weren't you.
- This isn't guilt.

193
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,310
- I want us to spend time.
- OK. Good. I love spending time...

194
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,550
- But I'm cramping your teenage style.
- No.

195
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,590
Yes, I am. I'm the embarrassing mom
who tries too hard. When did this happen?

196
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,300
No, you're not. It's not that. It's just...

197
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,390
What if, instead of you hanging out with me,
maybe I could hang out with you?

198
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,030
Why don't I come patrolling with you?

199
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,990
Oh. And then we can invite over some
strangers and ask them to feed you candy.

200
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,150
Well, you guys went out patrolling
every night at my age.

201
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,510
True... but technically you're one-and-a-half.

202
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,710
See, I thought a little levity might...
but OK. Also no.

203
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,910
I just... I just think I could help.

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,630
I'm sure you could. But it's a little
more dangerous than I had in mind.

205
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,150
But...

206
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,110
Dawn, I work very hard
to keep you away from that stuff.

207
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,150
I don't want you around
dangerous things that can kill you.

208
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,750
Which would be a reasonable argument

209
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,110
if my sister was chosen
to protect the world from tax audits.

210
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,870
But, see, my sister is you, and... dangerous
things that want to kill me seem to find me.

211
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,470
But you don't need to go looking for them.

212
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,550
Eat up. You're gonna be late for school.

213
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,190
OK, wait.

214
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,470
It was under her wig?

215
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,070
Well, it just came out from inside her head.

216
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,950
Oh, that's disgusting! What did it look like?

217
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,030
Well, let's put it this way.
If I wasn't gay before...

218
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,150
- God, and this was after the invisible ray?
- Yeah.

219
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,710
- I'm gone for a couple of months...
- Did I tell you about the demon eggs?

220
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,950
See, now I know you're just
trying to make me jealous.

221
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,150
- What, no rollicking adventures in the dorm?
- It's not the same.

222
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,470
It's not like living with family,
or sharing a room with someone you...

223
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,390
Are friends with?

224
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,140
Hi.

225
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,020
- Oh, my God! You're back.
- We've been so worried.

226
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,190
Yeah, sorry. I...

227
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,270
I needed to, you know...

228
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,310
I couldn't stay here.
Not after... everything that happened.

229
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,960
No, no, no. We totally understand.

230
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,230
But you're back now, right?

231
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,940
It's complicated.
You know, there's a lot to deal with.

232
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,310
Well, if there's anything we can do...

233
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,910
Actually... there's an eensy something
I could use a little help with.

234
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,110
You're lesbians, so the hating of men will
come in handy. Let's talk about Xander.

235
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,710
- He feels awful.
- You think it's anywhere close to what I feel?

236
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,470
- No, but...
- What if it were you, Dawn?

237
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,590
What if all you dreamed about
was that magical day

238
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,110
when the person you loved would promise
to cherish your heart for the rest of his life,

239
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,150
but instead he shatters it
into a million jagged pieces?

240
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,470
Well, it's not really so much
about hating the men.

241
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,910
We're more centred around
the... girl-on-girl action.

242
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,190
And men really like to watch that kind
of stuff, don't they? Men like Xander.

243
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,430
- I don't think he could feel any worse.
- Let's test that theory.

244
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,510
Anya, Xander's my friend.
I know what he did was wrong.

245
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,910
- If it happened to me, I'd...
- Wish his penis would explode?

246
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,750
- I never use that word any more.
- Coagulate?

247
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,670
W-i-s-h.

248
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,910
- Oh, "wish". As in "l wish Xander..."
- Right! That word.

249
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,630
There are vengeance demons
that are still active, remember?

250
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,350
- Any "l wish" can end in horrible grossness.
- Give me a for-instance.

251
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,870
I don't think I should.

252
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,710
Did I mention the "left at the altar" thing?
Didn't leave that out, did l?

253
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,630
No.

254
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,510
Look, I know what he did was wrong.
God, if it happened to me, l...

255
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,590
It must have been torture.

256
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,950
OK! Let's talk about torture!

257
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,870
So, tell me more about wishing
Xander's brains and guts would go blooey.

258
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,310
- I didn't say that.
- You did.

259
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,430
- I didn't.
- I heard you.

260
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,630
- I swear I didn't say that.
- Say what?

261
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,430
Um... I just saw you were back and wanted
to talk to you about working off my debt.

262
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,630
You know, my whole sticky-fingers,
grabby-hands thing?

263
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,870
Oh, right, the mad thieving!
Good, yes, there's much to do.

264
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,150
I'm gonna put you to work, missy!

265
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,030
Back to Xander's brains and guts...

266
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,060
Squish, squish, squish! Guys have been
running roughshod over you for years.

267
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,270
Torturing that little ticker. Aren't you
sick of it? Don't you wish guys...

268
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,430
Whoa. Guys? There have only been
four... three. Three. Three guys.

269
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,470
That's barely plural.

270
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,630
Didn't each of them rip your heart out?

271
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,030
Don't men like that - to pick an example,
Xander - deserve to be punished?

272
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,710
Well, Xander is a guy, so... it's kinda not
the surprise that he likes to watch... girls.

273
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,030
- Why are we talking about this?
- We're comforting me!

274
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,470
Well, I guess it's... natural
for guys to be interested in...

275
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,870
God! What kind of lesbians are you?
If you love men so much, go love men!

276
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,510
- Anya, I know you're hurting, but...
- What?

277
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,430
Xander doesn't deserve to suffer
cos he's your friend and I'm not?

278
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,030
No. That's not what I'm saying at all.

279
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,870
- What he did was wrong. He knows that.
- It's just it hurts.

280
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,590
He hurt me so much.

281
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,110
He really did. Look, I wish that...

282
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,660
Anya?

283
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,270
Congratulations. They all still love you.
Even after what you did to me.

284
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,870
- Anya, wait...
- OK. Not crazy about that idea.

285
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,380
- I have to go after her.
- Or, in the land of the sane,

286
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,040
you could give her some space,
let her cool down.

287
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,830
That's not Proactive Guy.

288
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,700
That's Sit Around and Watch
the Rest of your Life Turn to Crap Guy.

289
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,550
True, but at least Crap Guy
gets to keep all of his appendages.

290
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,430
And I'm supposed to what? Walk away?

291
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,710
Shouldn't be too hard.
It's what I'm good at, right?

292
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,550
OK. That's why a heart-to-heart is probably
not your best course of action right now.

293
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,550
You're both angry and upset and...

294
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,670
What the hell is that creepy little thing
doing in my yard?

295
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,300
Did Willow put that there?
I'd have crawled out of the grave sooner...

296
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,150
- Buffy.
- Oh, my God.

297
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,230
Someone's been keepin' an eye
on all your ins and outs.

298
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,510
Who?

299
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,030
Well, now, let's see.
Who's obsessed with Buffy?

300
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,990
Who likes to hang out in her yard
and keep an eye on her?

301
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,670
Who's in love with you and not getting any?

302
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,000
- What's this?
- It's a camera.

303
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,590
Yeah, I got that part. Why am I holdin' it?

304
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,110
Someone was using it
to spy on me, on my house.

305
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,990
- Xander thinks it's you.
- Oh, the great Xander thinks so.

306
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,070
Shudder, gasp! It must be true!

307
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,430
- Spike...
- That ponce has always had it for me.

308
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,390
Every chance he gets, he sticks it...

309
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,750
You believe him, don't you?
You think I was spying on you.

310
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,110
- You think I could do that?
- You don't lie, cheat, steal or manipulate...

311
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,270
I don't hurt you.

312
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,590
I know.

313
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,060
No, you don't.

314
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,510
I've tried to make it clear to you,
but you won't see it.

315
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,390
Something happened to me.

316
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,310
The way I feel. About you.

317
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,310
It's different.

318
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,990
And no matter how hard you try
to convince yourself it isn't, it's real.

319
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,270
I think it is...

320
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,070
for you.

321
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,910
I know that's not what you wanna hear.

322
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,990
I'm sorry. I really am.

323
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,950
But, Spike, you have to move on.

324
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,910
- You have to get over...
- Get out.

325
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,390
No! They're all... "Poor Xander. It took
so much out of him, all that running away."

326
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,110
- I just don't understand these people.
- Did you really think they would help you?

327
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,460
But...

328
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,710
Do you want retribution, Anyanka?

329
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,310
- I want Xander good and cursed.
- Then you know what you have to do.

330
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,990
Get a wish from someone
who doesn't freaking love him.

331
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,790
But my social circle is a little limited here.

332
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,230
Am I supposed to just
stumble upon someone

333
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,830
who doesn't give a fig's ass
if Xander gets hurt?

334
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,750
Hey. I need a thing.

335
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,950
- So, what's your pleasure?
- Fresh out of pleasure.

336
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,390
That's why I'm here. I need something.
A numbing spell, maybe.

337
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,510
Uh-huh. Hang on.

338
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,750
Oh, my God. Spike hates Xander.

339
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,190
Maybe I could get him to wish...

340
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,430
Dammit! If only he were a woman.

341
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,230
Got it! If I can somehow get someone
to wish that Spike were a woman,

342
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,830
then I could go to him... Well, he'd be
a her by then. I could go to her...

343
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,910
Anyanka, there's an easier way.

344
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,110
I know you have this female-power thing,
and I think that's cute.

345
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,550
But I've been telling you for decades - men
need a little vengeance now and then, too.

346
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,700
Oh.

347
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,710
Maybe this is a good chance to try that out.

348
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,830
Good luck with that. Ta-ta!

349
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,630
Sorry to bust up the little girls' night out.

350
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,750
That's OK. I'm ready to do some business.

351
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,030
Right then. Got something
that'll dull the ache a bit?

352
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,540
Actually, yes.

353
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,150
Giles left a couple of supplies here
that I think just might help.

354
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,020
Eases the hurt, makes the sun
shine a little brighter,

355
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,830
even makes boring people
seem more interesting.

356
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,980
Ah!

357
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,670
Here.

358
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,190
Can you see who's getting the camera signal?

359
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,430
Should have something once I get
tapped into the fibre optic network.

360
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,510
We're gonna use the feedback relay
to get their signal routed into our system.

361
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,950
OK, if it's not Spike -
and I'm not saying I believe him -

362
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,150
but if it's not Spike, I think
we already know who's behind this.

363
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,270
Makes sense.

364
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,350
I want... to find... these guys.

365
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,870
Uncover.

366
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,870
There. That's it. That's where we have to go.

367
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,740
Well, now that we've found out where to go...

368
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,750
Agh!

369
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,060
So then this girl says "Real for you."

370
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,790
Right. But getting back to Xander...

371
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,870
Xander. Let's not waste
any more breath on that wanker.

372
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,910
But he made a fool of me. And nobody
seems to care enough to do anything!

373
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,950
I care. What he done to you?

374
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,190
I'd never stoop that low,
and I'm an "evil, soulless thing".

375
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,150
- According to some people.
- Shouldn't he pay?

376
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,110
Don't you wish he had to pay
in some horrible way?

377
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,190
Absolutely.

378
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,750
Take him on myself,
if it wasn't for my little handicap.

379
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,910
Right.

380
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,630
So, hypothetically,
what do you wish you could do to him?

381
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,350
You name it, pet. You're the wronged party.

382
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,230
Something... gruesome, how about?

383
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,870
- Hey! That's my blanket!
- That makes sense. It was your fire.

384
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,470
Hey, hey. I think I've got something.

385
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,670
Thing about it is, none of this was my idea.
I didn't ask to be human.

386
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,030
Right! And I didn't ask
for this bloody chip in my head.

387
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,470
To tell you the truth...
all I wanted was to use him and lose him.

388
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,990
I hadn't had a good tumble
in a thousand years.

389
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,640
Me, too. The using part.

390
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,510
I just wanted to know
what I was missing, move on.

391
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,950
Yeah. And he was all bumpy...
in the right places,

392
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,150
and nice to me.

393
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,710
She was so raw.

394
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,910
I never felt anything like it.

395
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,990
Next thing you know,
I'm changing to please him.

396
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,870
- I care if he cares!
- Right.

397
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,990
And I'm off my guard. Happy!

398
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,950
I'm singing in the shower
and doing my sexy dance!

399
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,030
Exactly.

400
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,600
I have no dance.

401
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,510
Talk to me, Will.

402
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,310
The technology's pretty sophisticated.
Lots of booby traps and firewall stuff.

403
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,070
- But can you get us a location?
- Well, hey, I'm still me. Just one...

404
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,110
- Whoa.
- What?

405
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,630
There are other cameras.

406
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,470
- Screw'em!
- To the rafters!

407
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,630
I did everything for that man.
Was it ever enough?

408
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,830
Never!

409
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,630
I was always going above and beyond.
I saved the Scoobies how many times?

410
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,030
- And I can't stand the lot of you.
- Me either! I hate us!

411
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,350
Everybody's so nice.
Nobody says what's on their mind.

412
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,350
You do. That's why you're the only one
of them I wouldn't bite if I had the chance.

413
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,350
- Really?
- Absolutely.

414
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,510
I have nothing but respect
for a woman who's forthright.

415
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,190
Drusilla was always straightforward.

416
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,070
Didn't have a buggerin' clue
about what was going on,

417
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,110
but she was straight about it.
That was a virtue.

418
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,510
Xander didn't think so. He thought I was rude.

419
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,950
That's because he's one of them.
Uptight. Repressed.

420
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,380
- You think?
- Please.

421
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,830
It's no wonder they couldn't
deal with the likes of you and me, love.

422
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,990
We should have been dead
hundreds of years ago,

423
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,830
and we're the only ones who are really alive.

424
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,030
Oh, my God. The Doublemeat Palace.

425
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,950
The Bronze.

426
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,550
My classes on campus.

427
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,350
Xander's site.

428
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,870
What?

429
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,670
They've been spying on all these places?

430
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,510
I can tell there are more feeds. I'm just
having a harder time pinpointing them.

431
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,590
Here, let me...

432
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,950
Here.

433
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,790
Ladies last.

434
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,190
Thank you.

435
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,870
Take it quick or my chivalry'll run out.

436
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,510
No.

437
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,630
Thank you.

438
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,550
This is... the first time since...

439
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,350
It just feels good to be
with someone who understands.

440
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,950
Intimately.

441
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,390
This whole time, I've been coming on
all... hell-bent and mad.

442
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,510
- Wanting his head, you know...
- Yeah.

443
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,790
When really l... can't sleep at night,

444
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,070
thinking that...
it has to be my fault somehow.

445
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,790
Shh...

446
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,070
What if he's just pretending?

447
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,750
What if he never wanted me...
the way I wanted him?

448
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,790
- Ohh, I'm sorry.
- Now, now.

449
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,230
He would have to be
more than just the git he is, Anya.

450
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,470
He'd have to be deaf, dumb and blind
not to want a woman like you.

451
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,550
Then why?

452
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,140
The two of them... they're weak, is all.

453
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,590
But... I tell you what, though.

454
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,070
They'll miss the water
now that the well's gone dry.

455
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,910
- Too hot to handle.
- Mm...

456
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,190
Too hot.

457
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,190
Um...

458
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,790
Just one question.

459
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,030
Hm?

460
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,680
Can I see your sexy dance?

461
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,470
I'll show you mine.

462
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,590
Wait, wait.

463
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,150
- What are we doing?
- Moving on.

464
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,510
I think there are a couple more
transmitters on the network.

465
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,470
I just...

466
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,750
I've almost got a picture on'em.

467
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,790
You know I'm only doing this because I'm
lonely and drunk and you... smell really good.

468
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,070
See? Forthright.

469
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,510

470
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,270
- Ah!
- They've tapped into our feed!

471
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,790
I think I've got the Magic Box.

472
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,470
Whoa!

473
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,710
Shut it down! Shut it all down!

474
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,030
- I can't find...
- Here, dorkface.

475
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,110
- I'll get it myself!
- Guys, we have to... Oh, holy crap.

476
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,870
- Oh, my God.
- What is that? Porn?

477
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,310
- Oh, my God.
- Is that the cam in the Magic Box?

478
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,710
Oh, my God.

479
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,910
What are they...? Ohh.

480
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,430
- Is that...?
- Spike.

481
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,710
He is so cool.

482
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,390
And... I mean, the girl's hot too.

483
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,990
Dude.

484
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,310
Wait, Xander, no.

485
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,390
Oh, God.

486
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,230

487
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,630
Hey, guys. What's up?

488
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,390

489
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,710
I...

490
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,870
What is she...?

491
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,910
Buffy?

492
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,710
That's enough.

493
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,070
Here, let me just...

494
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,550
We aren't even really sure what we're
seeing here. There could be something...

495
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,060
- There. Got it.

496
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,030
Xander?

497
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,580
So... this is it?

498
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,150
This is the stuff
you've been protecting me from?

499
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,720
You and Spike?

500
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,180
And a lot of monsters.

501
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,190
Uh-huh.

502
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,110
But it's over. Spike.

503
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,750
- I wish you'd told me.
- I kinda didn't wanna admit it to myself.

504
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,390
I get that.

505
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,830
I know it must hurt

506
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,910
to feel like you have to hide,
to keep secrets from everybody.

507
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,790
Buffy, Xander's gone. He took your axe.

508
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,430
Get up! Get up!

509
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,360
You're just gonna sit there? Do nothin'?

510
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,270
- That the kinda man you are?
- I'm not gonna fight you. Chip.

511
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,430
Too bad.

512
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,230
Xander, no! Stop it! Stop it!

513
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,670
Stop it!

514
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,830
- Xander, l...
- Don't even try to deny it.

515
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,950
Cos we saw it all.
The whole beautiful show.

516
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,390
How?

517
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,470
It was just... It was just a thing. I...

518
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,470
I felt bad, and he was just there.

519
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,230
Didn't take long, did it?

520
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,830
Oh, OK! You had to do it,
because he was there.

521
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,910
Like Mount Everest.

522
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,230
- Like I used to be.
- And then you weren't.

523
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,430
You left me, Xander, at the altar.
I don't owe you anything!

524
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,300
So you go out and bang the first body
you can find? Dead or alive?

525
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,150
Where do you get off, judging me?

526
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,350
When this is your solution to our problems.

527
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,310
I hurt you, and you hit me back. Very mature.

528
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,310
No, the mature solution is for you to spend
your whole life telling stupid jokes,

529
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,190
so that no one will notice that
you are just a scared, insecure little boy!

530
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,310
I'm not joking now.

531
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,510
You let that evil, soulless thing touch you.

532
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,590
You wanted me to feel somethin'?

533
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,350
Congratulations. It worked.

534
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,070
I look at you

535
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,150
and I feel sick,

536
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,900
cos you had sex with that.

537
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,340
- It's good enough for Buffy.
- Shut up and leave her out of...

538
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,790
Buffy?

539
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,670
- Xander...
- I don't want to know this.

540
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,860
I don't want to know any of this.

541
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,710
Bloody Xander, buggered up everything.

542
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,470
- You know, I wish...
- Don't.

543
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,630

544
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,540
Things fall apart.
They fall apart so hard.

545
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,590
Tara?

546
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,270
You can't ever...
put'em back the way they were.

547
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,030
- Are you OK?
- I'm sorry. It's just...

548
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,310
You know, it takes time.

549
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,950
You can't just... have coffee and expect...

550
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,590
I know.

551
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,710
There's just so much to work through.

552
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,390
Trust has to be built again, on both sides.

553
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,030
You have to learn if...
if we're even the same people we were,

554
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,710
if you can fit in each other's lives.

555
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,470
It's a long... important process.

556
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,510
Can we just skip it?

557
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,190
Can you just be kissing me now?

558
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,300

559
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,710

560
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,550

561
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,470

562
