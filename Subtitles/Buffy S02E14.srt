1
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:12,118
I'm not happy, pet.

2
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:14,570
Angel and the Slayer are still alive.

3
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:18,366
They know where we are, they know
about the Judge. We should be vacating.

4
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:21,882
Nonsense. They'll not disturb us here.

5
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,064
My Angel's too smart
to face the Judge again.

6
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,172
What's Big Blue up to anyway?
He just sits there.

7
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:32,590
I am preparing.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,744
Yeah.

9
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:41,072
It's interesting to me that preparing
looks a bit like sitting on your ass.

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,997
- When do we destroy the world already?
- My strength grows.

11
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:48,823
And with every life I take,
it will increase further.

12
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:51,384
So let's take some. I'm bored.

13
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:53,895
Dru?

14
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:00,808
- Angel!
- Dru? What is it?

15
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:03,745
Dru!

16
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:10,118
Darling, do you see something?

17
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:36,997
Angel?

18
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:43,262
Buffy!

19
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,275
Oh, no.

20
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:03,941
Hey.

21
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:07,701
You OK?

22
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,581
You want me to call 911?

23
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:15,131
No.

24
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:17,368
The pain is gone.

25
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,008
- You sure?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:30,366
I feel just fine.

27
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,995
Morning!

28
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,696
- Morning.
- So, did you have fun last night?

29
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,957
- Fun?
- At Willow's.

30
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:58,846
Yeah! Yeah. Fun at Willow's.
You know, she's a... fun machine.

31
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,187
- You hungry?
- No.

32
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:03,812
No, I, I'm just gonna go take a shower.

33
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:06,306
Uh, well, if you hurry,
I'll run you to school.

34
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,295
Thanks.

35
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,776
Is something wrong?

36
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,079
No! What would be wrong?

37
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:17,354
I don't know. You just look...

38
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,058
The bus depot was a... total washout.

39
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:34,407
And may I say,
what a lovely place to spend the night.

40
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,637
What a vibrant cross section of Americana.

41
00:04:36,672 --> 00:04:39,146
No vampires transporting boxes?

42
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:43,341
No, but a 400lb wino
offered to wash my hair.

43
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:46,729
What's up? Where's Buffy?

44
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,307
She never checked in.

45
00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:52,416
If the bus depot's as empty
as the... docks and the airport...

46
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,913
Do you think this Judge guy's
already been assembled?

47
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:57,628
- Yes.
- And Buffy could be...

48
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,016
We gotta find him.
We gotta go to that place, that, uh...

49
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,861
that factory. That's where they're
holed up, right? Let's go.

50
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:06,930
And do what? Besides be afraid and die.

51
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:08,578
Well, nobody's asking you to go, Cordelia.

52
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,863
If the vampires need grooming tips,
we'll give you a call.

53
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:15,466
Cordelia has a point.
If Buffy and Angel were, were...

54
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,895
harmed, then
we don't stand a fair much better.

55
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,202
Yeah? Well, those of us who were born with
feelings are gonna do something about this.

56
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,698
- Xander!
- No, Xander's right!

57
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:26,145
My God! You people are all... Well...

58
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:28,594
I'm upset and I can't think of
a mean word right now,

59
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,834
but that's what you are,
and we're goin' in the factory.

60
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:33,386
- Yeah!
- Buffy!

61
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:35,157
We were just going to rescue you.

62
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:38,130
- Well, some of us were.
- Well, I would have.

63
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,793
- Where's Angel?
- He didn't check in with you guys?

64
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:43,868
- No.
- What happened?

65
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:48,955
- The Judge, is he...?
- No assembly required. He's active.

66
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,740
- Damn it.
- Nearly killed us.

67
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:54,627
- Angel got us out.
- Why didn't you call? We, we thought...

68
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:57,200
Well, we, we had to hide.

69
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:01,090
We got stuck in the sewer tunnels and,

70
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:03,699
with the hiding, we just split up.

71
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:06,733
- No one's heard from him?
- I'm sure he'll come by.

72
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,931
- Yeah. I'm, I'm sure you're right.
- Buffy.

73
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,617
- The Judge, we, we must stop him.
- I know.

74
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:15,459
- What can you tell us?
- Not much. I, um...

75
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:18,856
I... kicked him.
That was just like a sudden fever.

76
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:21,896
- If he'd got his hands on me...
- In time, he won't need to.

77
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:26,062
The stronger he gets, he'll be able to...
reduce us to charcoal with a look.

78
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:29,031
Also, not the prettiest man in town.

79
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:32,184
I'd better continue researching,
must look for a weak spot.

80
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:34,970
The rest of you should
get to your classes.

81
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,594
- Yeah, I'd better go, too.
- Buffy, wait up!

82
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:40,345
I'll, uh, go on the Net
and search for anything on the Judge.

83
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,089
- Thank you.
- After classes I'll come back

84
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:44,488
- and help you research.
- Yeah. You might find something useful

85
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:48,227
if it's in "I Can Read Book".

86
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,727
You don't think Angel would have gone
after the Judge himself, do you?

87
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:59,571
No. He'd know better than that.

88
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,542
Maybe he just needed...

89
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:04,839
I don't know. I just wish he'd contact me.

90
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:07,403
I need to talk to him.

91
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:22,744
Are we feeling better, then?

92
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:27,345
I'm naming all the stars.

93
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,627
You can't see the stars, love.

94
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:33,962
That's the ceiling. Also, it's day.

95
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:36,662
I can see them.

96
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:40,264
But I've named them all the same name.

97
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:44,577
And there's terrible confusion.

98
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:47,033
Did you see any further?

99
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:50,011
- Do you know what happens to Angel?
- Well...

100
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:53,962
He moves to New York
and tries to fulfill that Broadway dream.

101
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:56,269
It's tough slaying, but one day

102
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,323
he's working in the chorus
when the big star twists her ankle.

103
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,394
You don't give up, do you?

104
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:04,495
As long as
there's injustice in the world.

105
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,845
As long as scum like you is walking...

106
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,915
well, rolling... the streets,
I'll be around.

107
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,861
Look over your shoulder.
I'll be there.

108
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,900
Uh, yeah.

109
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:23,338
Angel, um... look over your shoulder.

110
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:28,091
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Well, you know,

111
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,023
it kinda itches a little.

112
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:34,193
- Don't just stand there. Burn him!
- Gee! Maybe he's broken.

113
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:36,063
What the hell is going on?

114
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:39,256
This one cannot be burned.

115
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,100
- He's clean.
- Clean?

116
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:46,712
- You mean he's...
- There's no humanity in him.

117
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:50,042
I couldn't have said it better myself.

118
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:53,422
- Angel.
- Yeah, baby.

119
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,713
I'm back.

120
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:01,741
- Is it really true?
- It's really true.

121
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:04,432
You've come home.

122
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:08,411
No more of this
"I've got a soul" crap?

123
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,097
What can I say, hm?

124
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:14,867
I was goin' through a phase.

125
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:18,516
This is great! This is so great.

126
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:21,668
Everything in my head is singing.

127
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:24,247
We're family again.

128
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:27,032
We'll feed...

129
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,252
and we'll play.

130
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:33,417
I've gotta tell you.
It made me sick to my stomach

131
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:35,942
seeing you being the Slayer's lap dog.

132
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:45,736
- How did this happen?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

133
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:49,201
Who cares?
What matters is now he's back!

134
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:54,234
Now it's four against one,
which are the kind of odds I like to play.

135
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:59,026
We're going to destroy the world.
Want to come?

136
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:01,603
Yeah, destroying the world.

137
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:04,335
Great. I'm really
more interested in the Slayer.

138
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,981
Well, she's in the world,
so that should work out.

139
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:10,836
- Give me tonight.
- What do you mean?

140
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,906
Lay low for a night.

141
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:15,129
I guarantee, by the time you go public,

142
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,718
she won't be anything
resembling a threat.

143
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:21,384
You've really got a yen
to hurt this girl, haven't you?

144
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,771
She made me feel like a human being.

145
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:28,288
That's not the kinda thing
you just forgive.

146
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:32,741
OK. No. No, we didn't but I'm sure he'll...

147
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:37,501
Well, Buffy, he probably has some plan
and he's trying to protect you.

148
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:42,504
Well, I don't know what.
I'm not in on the plan. It's his plan.

149
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:45,289
No! Don't even say that!

150
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:48,777
- Angel is not dead.
- Say hi for me.

151
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:52,785
Yeah, of course we'll be here. OK. Bye.

152
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,075
- "Say hi for me"?
- What's the word?

153
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,643
She's checked every place
she could think of.

154
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:01,427
She even beat up Willy the Snitch
a couple of times.

155
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:05,275
- Angel's vanished.
- But he does do that on occasion, no?

156
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,026
Oh, yeah.
But she's extra-wigged this time.

157
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,293
I guess 'cause of her dreams.

158
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:13,500
God, what if
something really happened to him?

159
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,221
- Is she gonna join us here?
- Yeah, she's just stopping at home first.

160
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:20,406
Nada!

161
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:27,611
Did you find anything?

162
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,757
This book mentions the Judge,
but nothing useful.

163
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:34,069
"Big, scary,
no weapon forged can stop him."

164
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:37,522
"Took an army to take him down."
Blah blah blah.

165
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:39,724
We need some insight. A weak spot.

166
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,309
Well, we're not gonna find it here.

167
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:48,089
Sorry I snapped at you before.

168
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,514
Well, I'm reeling
from that new experience.

169
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,883
I was crazed. I wasn't thinking.

170
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:56,872
I know. You were too busy rushing off
to die for your beloved Buffy.

171
00:11:56,907 --> 00:12:00,459
- You'd never die for me.
- No, I might die from you.

172
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:03,184
- Does that get me any points?
- No!

173
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:06,873
- Come on, can't we just kiss and make up?
- I don't wanna make up.

174
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:11,018
But I'm OK with the other part.

175
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:26,266
Willow! We were just... Willow! Willow!

176
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:33,174
- Willow, come on!
- I knew it! I knew it!

177
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:36,248
Well, not 'knew it' in the sense of
having the slightest idea,

178
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:38,400
but I knew there was something
I didn't know!

179
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:41,398
You two were fighting way too much!
It's not natural!

180
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,092
- I know it's weird.
- Weird?

181
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,645
It's against all laws of God and man!

182
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,103
It's Cordelia! Remember?

183
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:51,640
The "We Hate Cordelia Club",
of which you are the treasurer?

184
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:54,826
- Look, I was gonna tell you.
- Gee, what stopped you? Could it be shame?

185
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:56,547
- All right. Let's overreact! Shall we?
- But I'm...

186
00:12:56,582 --> 00:13:00,992
Willow! We were just kissing.
It doesn't mean that much.

187
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:03,778
No.

188
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:07,526
It just means that you'd rather be
with someone you hate...

189
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:10,262
than be with me.

190
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:56,528
- Angel!
- Hey.

191
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:01,753
Oh, my God! I was so worried!

192
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:03,808
I didn't mean to frighten you.

193
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,264
- Where did you go?
- Been around.

194
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:09,694
Oh, my God.

195
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:13,203
I was freaking out.
You just disappeared!

196
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,811
What? I took off.

197
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:22,200
But you didn't say anything.
You just left.

198
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:26,261
Yeah. Like I really wanted
to stick around after that.

199
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:30,235
- What?
- You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo.

200
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:33,502
Although I guess
you proved that last night.

201
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:35,980
What are you saying?

202
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:38,219
Let's not make an issue out of it, OK?

203
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:41,715
In fact,
let's not talk about it at all.

204
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,291
- It happened.
- I, I don't understand.

205
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:52,130
Was it m-me? Was I not good?

206
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:56,874
You were great. Really.
I thought you were a pro.

207
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,433
How can you say this to me?

208
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,530
Lighten up. It was a good time.

209
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:03,608
It doesn't mean
we have to make a big deal.

210
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:06,324
- It is a big deal!
- It's what?

211
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:08,629
Bells ringing? Fireworks?

212
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:11,736
A dulcet choir of pretty little birdies?

213
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:14,853
Come on, Buffy.

214
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:17,559
It's not like I've never been there before.

215
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:21,588
Don't touch me.

216
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,640
I should have known
you wouldn't be able to handle it.

217
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,067
Angel!

218
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:34,450
I love you.

219
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:37,247
Love you, too.

220
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,189
I'll call you.

221
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:52,695
You know what it is,
this thing - vengeance?

222
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,754
Uncle, I have served you.
I have been faithful. I need to know.

223
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,676
To the modern man,
vengeance is a word, an idea.

224
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:05,027
Payback. One thing for another.
Like commerce.

225
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:07,106
Not with us.

226
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:09,413
Vengeance is a living thing.

227
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:11,427
It passes through generations.

228
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:13,799
It commands. It kills.

229
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,483
You told me to watch Angel.

230
00:16:15,484 --> 00:16:18,185
You told me to keep him
from the Slayer. I tried.

231
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,487
But there are other factors.

232
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:23,968
There are terrible things happening here
that we cannot control!

233
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:27,927
We control nothing.
We are not wizards, Jana.

234
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:30,518
We merely play our part.

235
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:33,290
Angel could be of help to us.

236
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,393
He may be the only chance
we have to stop the Judge.

237
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,189
It is too late for that.

238
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:42,471
- Why?
- The curse.

239
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:44,850
Angel was meant to suffer.

240
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:47,239
Not to live as human.

241
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:51,071
One moment of true happiness,
of contentment,

242
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:56,936
one moment where the soul that we
restored no longer plagues his thoughts,

243
00:16:56,971 --> 00:17:00,219
and that soul is taken from him.

244
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:02,423
Then, if somehow, if...

245
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,962
If it's happened...

246
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:10,153
- then Angelus is back.
- I hoped to stop it.

247
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:14,397
But I realize now
it was arranged to be so.

248
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:18,055
- Buffy loves him.
- And now she will have to kill him.

249
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:21,642
Unless he kills her first!
Uncle, this is insanity!

250
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,216
People are going to die!

251
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,685
Yes. It is not justice we serve.

252
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:31,029
It is vengeance.

253
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:37,377
You're a fool. We're all fools.

254
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,867
Will!

255
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,496
Hey.

256
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:57,427
- Where'd you go?
- Home.

257
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,751
I'm glad you came back.
We can't do this without you.

258
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:02,635
Let's get this straight.

259
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,964
I don't understand it.
I don't wanna understand it.

260
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:11,698
You have gross emotional problems...
and things are not OK between us.

261
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:16,742
But... what's happening right now
is more important than that.

262
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,834
OK.

263
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:25,903
What about the Judge?
Where do we stand?

264
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,435
On a pile of really boring books
that say the same thing.

265
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,732
- Let me guess. "No weapon forged..."
- "It took an army..."

266
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:36,691
Yeah, where's an army
when you need one?

267
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:41,082
- What?
- Whoa. Whoa! I...

268
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:43,519
I think I'm havin' a thought.

269
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:45,883
Yeah, yeah, that's a thought.

270
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:48,960
Now I'm having a plan.

271
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,045
- Now I'm havin' a wiggins.
- What's going on?

272
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,262
- Let's get to the library.
- Willow!

273
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,731
- Xander.
- Angel.

274
00:18:57,766 --> 00:19:00,396
Thank God you're OK.
Did you see Buffy?

275
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:03,749
Yeah. What's up with the lights?

276
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:05,985
I don't know. Listen,
I think I have an idea.

277
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:09,008
Forget about that now.
I got somethin' to show you.

278
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:12,049
- Show us?
- Yeah. Xander, go get the others.

279
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,597
OK.

280
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,941
And, Willow, come here.

281
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:22,475
- What is it, Angel?
- It's amazing.

282
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:32,921
- Willow, get away from him!
- What?

283
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:35,802
- Walk to me.
- What are you talking about? It's Ang...

284
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:41,536
- Don't do that!
- Oh, I think I do that.

285
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:45,122
- Angel!
- He's not Angel any more.

286
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,960
- Are you?
- Wrong.

287
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:50,903
I am Angel... at last.

288
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:54,254
- Oh, my God.
- I got a message for Buffy.

289
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:56,733
Why don't you give it to me yourself?

290
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:59,668
Oh, it's not really
the kind of message you tell.

291
00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:03,481
It sort of involves finding
the bodies of all your friends.

292
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:07,360
- This can't be you.
- We already covered that subject.

293
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:10,945
Angel, there must be some part of you,
inside, that still remembers who you are.

294
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,769
Dream on, schoolgirl.
Your boyfriend is dead.

295
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,707
You're all gonna join him.

296
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:19,489
Leave Willow alone and deal with me.

297
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:22,719
But she's so cute and helpless.

298
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,975
Really a turn-on.

299
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,871
Things are about to get very interesting.

300
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:46,674
Buffy, are you OK?

301
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:50,834
Buffy?

302
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:04,229
And we're absolutely certain
that Angel has reverted to his former self?

303
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,961
Yeah, uh, we're all certain.
Anyone not feeling certain here?

304
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,743
Giles, you wouldn't've believed him.

305
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:11,995
He was so...

306
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,716
He came here to kill us.

307
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:16,993
- What are we gonna do?
- Leaning towards blind panic myself.

308
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:20,447
- Rupert, don't talk like that. The kids...
- I'm sorry.

309
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,056
It's just that things are bad enough
with the Judge here.

310
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:28,254
Angel crossing over to the other side...
I-I-I wasn't prepared for that.

311
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,693
None of us were.

312
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,341
Are you OK?

313
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:44,390
Is there anything I can do?

314
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:46,851
I should have known.

315
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,094
I saw him at the house.
He was different.

316
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:52,335
The things he said...

317
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:56,505
- What things?
- It's private.

318
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,464
But you didn't know he had turned bad?

319
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,729
How did you?

320
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,736
- What?
- Well, you knew.

321
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:06,994
You told me to get away from him.

322
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:09,057
Well, I saw his face.

323
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:11,964
If only we knew how it happened.

324
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:16,331
- What do you mean?
- Well, something set it off. Some, some,

325
00:22:16,332 --> 00:22:19,675
uh, event must have
triggered his transformation.

326
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,466
Well, if anyone would know, Buffy,
it-it should be you.

327
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:24,571
- I don't.
- Well, did anything happen last night?

328
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:26,696
- That, that might...
- Giles, please! I can't...

329
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:28,974
Buffy! I'm sorry,
but we can't afford to...

330
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:31,996
- Buffy!
- Giles, shut up.

331
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,075
This is great.
There's an unkillable demon in town,

332
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:43,124
Angel's joined his team,
the Slayer's a basket case -

333
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,438
- I'd say we've hit bottom.
- I have a plan.

334
00:22:45,473 --> 00:22:48,643
- Oh, no! Here's a lower place.
- I don't know what's up with Angel,

335
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:51,331
but I think I may have a way
to deal with this Judge guy.

336
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:54,589
- What do we do?
- I think, um...

337
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:58,468
I think I may need Cordelia for this one.

338
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:04,028
- And we may need wheels.
- Well, my car is...

339
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:06,757
- It might have to be bigger.
- No problem. I'll get Oz.

340
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:08,976
He has a van.

341
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:12,831
Good. OK.

342
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:14,517
Care to let me in
on the plan I'm a part of?

343
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,643
- No.
- Why not?

344
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:18,582
Because if I tell you,
then you won't do it.

345
00:23:18,617 --> 00:23:22,840
Just meet me at Willow's house in half
an hour and wear something trashy...er.

346
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:27,472
I'm not sure what we should do about Buffy.

347
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:31,053
Well, assuming they don't attack tonight
I think we should just let her be.

348
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,110
- I agree.
- I-I-I can imagine

349
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,008
what she's going through.

350
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:38,367
No... I don't think you can.

351
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:43,354
You should've seen her face.
It was priceless!

352
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,473
- I'll never forget it.
- So you didn't kill her, then?

353
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,280
Course not.

354
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:53,882
Now, I know you haven't been
in the game for a while, mate...

355
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,705
but we still do kill people.

356
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,123
It's sort of our raison d'etre,
you know?

357
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:02,504
You don't wanna kill her, do you?

358
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,368
You want to hurt her...

359
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,893
just like you hurt me.

360
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:13,540
- Nobody knows me like you do, Dru.
- She'd better not get in our way.

361
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,699
- Don't worry about it.
- I do.

362
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:18,757
Spike... my boy!

363
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,545
You really don't get it, do you?

364
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,069
You tried to kill her, but you couldn't.

365
00:24:26,104 --> 00:24:28,960
Look at you, you're a wreck!

366
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:33,044
She's stronger than any Slayer
you've ever faced.

367
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,717
Force won't get it done.

368
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:38,550
You gotta work from the inside.

369
00:24:38,784 --> 00:24:41,308
To kill this girl...

370
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:43,944
you have to love her.

371
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:37,456
I love you.

372
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,424
You have to know what to see.

373
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:19,957
Buffy?

374
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,770
- Buffy!
- What do you know?!

375
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,332
- Should I get the principal?
- No, I-I-I'll deal with this.

376
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:27,337
Y-y-you're, you're all dismissed!

377
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:29,518
Did you do it? Did you change him?

378
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:31,993
- For God's sake, calm down.
- Did you know this was gonna happen?

379
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:37,180
- You can't go around accusing everybody...
- I didn't know... exactly.

380
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:41,026
I was told...

381
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,461
Oh, God.

382
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:47,735
I was sent here to watch you.

383
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:49,593
They told me
to keep you and Angel apart.

384
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,940
- They never told me what would happen.
- Jenny...

385
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:54,405
I'm sorry, Rupert.

386
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:57,288
Angel was supposed to pay
for what he did to my people.

387
00:27:57,323 --> 00:28:00,611
And me? What was I supposed
to be paying for?

388
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:02,516
I didn't know
what would happen until after.

389
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:05,126
I swear I would have told you.

390
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:08,388
So it was me. I did it.

391
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:10,823
I think so.

392
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:13,085
- I mean, if you...
- I don't understand.

393
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,905
The curse.

394
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,061
If Angel achieved true happiness,
even just a moment of...

395
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:22,128
he would lose his soul.

396
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:26,566
B-b-but h-h-how do you know
you were responsible f-for...

397
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:29,726
Oh.

398
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:38,459
- If there's anything that...
- Curse him again.

399
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:42,640
No, I can't. Those magics
are long lost, even to my people.

400
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:44,764
You did it once.
It might not be too late to save him.

401
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,342
It can't be done.

402
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,389
I can't help you.

403
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:52,729
Then take me to someone who can.

404
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,488
I knew she would bring you.

405
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:58,371
I suppose you want answers.

406
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:01,335
Not really.

407
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:05,958
But thanks for the offer.

408
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,933
Right face, hu! Double-time, hu!

409
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:13,471
Left! Left! Left!

410
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:16,212
Left! Left! Left! Left...

411
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:33,086
Wait here. When you, guys,
see that window open,

412
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:35,678
get out the ladder, come up.
We'll pass you the package, OK?

413
00:29:35,713 --> 00:29:38,994
- OK.
- Be careful.

414
00:29:53,464 --> 00:29:56,855
The security here really is a joke.
I should, uh, report it.

415
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:01,217
- Who am I supposed to be again?
- You're supposed to be a girl.

416
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,666
Think you can handle it?

417
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:19,496
Halt! Identify yourself
right the hell now!

418
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:24,468
Uh... Private Harris with the, uh... 33rd.

419
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:26,874
33rd are on maneuvers.

420
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:31,110
Right. Uh... I'm on leave... from them.

421
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:34,237
You always spend your leave
snoopin' round the armory, pal?

422
00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:36,288
- And who is she?
- Hi.

423
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:37,927
I'm not a soldier.

424
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,947
Right?

425
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,271
Look, I... I just wanna give her the tour.
You know what I'm sayin'.

426
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:47,281
- The tour.
- Well, you know the ladies.

427
00:30:47,282 --> 00:30:50,185
They like to see the big guns.
Gets them all hot and bothered.

428
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,422
Can you cut me some slack?
Give me a blind eye?

429
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:54,734
- And why should I?
- Well, if you do,

430
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,915
I won't tell Colonel Newsome
that your boots ain't regulation,

431
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,563
your post wasn't covered
and you hold your gun like a sissy girl.

432
00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:06,773
- You got 20 minutes, Nimrod.
- I just need five.

433
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:10,212
Uh... forget I said that last part.

434
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,708
OK. What was that? And who are you?

435
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:25,281
Remember Halloween?
I got turned into a soldier?

436
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,125
- Yeah.
- Well, I still remember all of it.

437
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,825
I know procedure, ordnance,
access codes, everything.

438
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,503
I know the whole layout for this base

439
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:35,803
and I'm pretty sure
I can put together an M-16 in 57 seconds.

440
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:37,902
Well, I'm sort of impressed.

441
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:40,264
But let's just find the thing
and get out of here.

442
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,126
OK.

443
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:48,267
So does looking at guns really make
girls wanna have sex? That's scary.

444
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:51,076
Yeah, I guess.

445
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:54,700
Well, does looking at guns
make you wanna have sex?

446
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:58,699
I'm 17. Looking at linoleum
makes me wanna have sex.

447
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:03,849
I wish they'd hurry.

448
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,780
So, do you guys steal weapons
from the army a lot?

449
00:32:09,113 --> 00:32:12,818
Well, we don't have cable,
so we have to make our own fun.

450
00:32:12,872 --> 00:32:14,711
I get you.

451
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:19,832
Do you wanna make out with me?

452
00:32:20,392 --> 00:32:24,626
- What?
- Forget it. I'm sorry.

453
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,750
Well, do you?

454
00:32:31,998 --> 00:32:34,291
Sometimes when I'm sittin' in class...

455
00:32:34,504 --> 00:32:38,466
You know, not thinkin' about class,
'cause that would never happen...

456
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:40,596
I think about kissin' you...

457
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:44,319
and it's like everything stops.
It's like, it's like freeze-frame

458
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,439
Willow kissage.

459
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:51,506
Oh, I'm not gonna kiss you.

460
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:54,263
What? But... freeze-frame.

461
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,997
Well, to the casual observer,

462
00:32:57,032 --> 00:32:59,976
it would appear that you're trying
to make your friend Xander jealous

463
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,885
or... even the score, or something.

464
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,221
And that's on the empty side.

465
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:10,913
See, in my fantasy,
when I'm kissin' you...

466
00:33:11,474 --> 00:33:14,213
you're kissin' me.

467
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,738
It's OK.

468
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:19,860
I can wait.

469
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,012
We're up.

470
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:33,897
Oh, my God.

471
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,002
He's doing this deliberately, Buffy.

472
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:47,115
He's trying to make it harder for you.

473
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:51,578
He's only making it easier.
I know what I have to do.

474
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,249
What?

475
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,815
Kill him.

476
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:08,942
- I am ready.
- About time.

477
00:34:15,077 --> 00:34:18,643
- Have fun.
- Too bad you can't come with, huh?

478
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:20,909
Be thinkin' of you.

479
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:23,586
I won't be in this chair forever.

480
00:34:27,074 --> 00:34:31,369
- What happens if your girlfriend shows up?
- I'm gonna give her a kiss.

481
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,801
Don't you look spiffy!

482
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:36,054
Spiffy?

483
00:34:40,937 --> 00:34:43,345
Happy birthday, Buffy.
I hope you like the color.

484
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:46,281
Giles, we go to the factory first,
but they might not be there.

485
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:48,503
If they're on the offensive,
we need to figure out where they'd go.

486
00:34:48,538 --> 00:34:50,461
Agreed.

487
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,536
This is good.

488
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,228
Do you, uh...

489
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,463
Is there something I can do?

490
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:01,640
Get out.

491
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:05,976
I just wanna help.

492
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,206
She said, 'Get out.'

493
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:18,663
- Do you want me to show you how to use it?
- Yes, I do.

494
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,307
I knew it.

495
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:28,770
We haven't a bead on...
where they would go.

496
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:31,598
I don't know. Uh...

497
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:35,511
Somewhere crowded, I guess.
The Judge needs bodies, right?

498
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:37,734
- The Bronze?
- It's closed tonight.

499
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,384
There's not a lot of choices in Sunnydale.
It's not like people are gonna line up

500
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:43,335
- to get massacred.
- Uh, guys?

501
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:47,899
If I were gonna line up,
I know where I'd go.

502
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,286
Lock the exits, boys.

503
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,947
It's all yours.

504
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:40,238
Everybody keep back.
Damage control only.

505
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,659
Take out any lesser vamps if you can.
I'll handle Smurf.

506
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,562
Oh, goody.

507
00:37:02,393 --> 00:37:04,231
Who dares?

508
00:37:09,286 --> 00:37:12,775
- Think I got his attention.
- You're a fool.

509
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,950
No weapon forged can stop me.

510
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:18,502
That was then.

511
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:21,078
This is now.

512
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:39,154
What's that do?

513
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:04,094
- Best present ever.
- I knew you'd like it.

514
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:06,913
- Do you think he's dead?
- We can't be sure.

515
00:38:06,935 --> 00:38:09,256
Pick up the pieces
and keep them separate.

516
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,568
Pieces? We get the pieces.

517
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:14,050
Our job sucks!

518
00:38:40,103 --> 00:38:44,210
You know what the worst part was, huh?
Pretending that I loved you.

519
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:49,231
If I'd known how easily you'd give it up,
I wouldn't have even bothered.

520
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:52,009
It doesn't work any more. You're not Angel.

521
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:54,942
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
It doesn't matter.

522
00:38:54,977 --> 00:38:59,761
The important thing is
you made me the man I am today.

523
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:17,811
Uh... arm!

524
00:39:28,153 --> 00:39:31,110
Not quittin' on me already, are ya?

525
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:33,893
Come on, Buffy.

526
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:36,623
You know you want it, huh?

527
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,251
You can't do it. You can't kill me.

528
00:40:17,856 --> 00:40:20,512
Give me time.

529
00:40:45,134 --> 00:40:48,438
It's not over. I suppose you know that.

530
00:40:50,774 --> 00:40:54,163
He'll come after you... particularly.

531
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:56,676
His profile, uh, well, he...

532
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,187
He's likely to strike out at
the things that made him the most human.

533
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:05,233
- You must be so disappointed in me.
- No.

534
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:07,632
No. No, I'm not.

535
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:10,022
This is all my fault.

536
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,628
I don't believe it is.

537
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:16,892
Do you want me to wag my finger at you
and tell you that you acted rashly?

538
00:41:16,927 --> 00:41:19,659
You did, and, and I can.

539
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:22,632
I know that you loved him.

540
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:28,386
And he... has proven
more than once that he loved you.

541
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:31,462
You couldn't have known
what would happen.

542
00:41:32,883 --> 00:41:35,427
The coming months a-are gonna,
are gonna be hard...

543
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:38,939
I, I suspect, on all of us, but...

544
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:44,745
If it's guilt you're looking for,
Buffy, I'm not your man.

545
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:49,255
All you will get from me is...
is my support...

546
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:53,059
and my respect.

547
00:41:57,195 --> 00:42:01,074
<i># Good night, my love</i>

548
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:06,592
<i># My moment with you now is ending...</i>

549
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:11,557
<i># It was all heavenly holding you...</i>

550
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:14,235
Did I miss anything?

551
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:18,319
Oh, just some singing
and some running round.

552
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,988
Oh. I'm sorry I didn't have time
to make you a real cake.

553
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:24,893
No. This is good.

554
00:42:24,928 --> 00:42:28,067
But we're still
going shopping on Saturday.

555
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:31,159
So what did you do for your birthday?

556
00:42:31,194 --> 00:42:33,940
Did you have fun?

557
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,976
I got older.

558
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:41,256
You look the same to me.

559
00:42:51,211 --> 00:42:53,892
Happy birthday.

560
00:42:54,244 --> 00:42:57,167
I don't have to sing, do I?

561
00:42:58,103 --> 00:42:59,954
No.

562
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:03,553
Well, go on. Make a wish.

563
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:12,025
I'll just let it burn.

564
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:19,935
<i># Good night, my love</i>

565
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,634
<i># Good night, my love</i>

566
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:30,164
<i># Remember that you're mine</i>

567
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:36,086
<i># Sweetheart</i>
