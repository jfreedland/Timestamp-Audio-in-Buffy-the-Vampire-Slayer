1
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:05,447
Parker Abrams. I'm at Kresky Hall.

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,808
Buffy Summers, Stevenson.

3
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:11,044
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,806
- What are you doing?
- Making a choice.

5
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:21,566
- Parker, did I do something wrong?
- Didn't you have fun?

6
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:24,850
- Is that all it was?
- What else was it supposed to be?

7
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:29,688
He's manipulative and shallow.
And why doesn't he want me?

8
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:33,448
I think you're missing something
about the whole poop-head principle.

9
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:36,002
Anya. Hi again.

10
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:40,885
So, college not so scary after all?

11
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:45,730
It's turning out to be a lot like high school,
which I can handle.

12
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:58,686
I don't know. I was going for ferocious-scary,
but it's coming out more dryly sardonic.

13
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:01,651
It does appear to be mocking you
with its eyeholes.

14
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:05,123
Yet its nosehole seems sad
and full of self-Ioathing.

15
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:07,844
What do you think, Buff?

16
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:12,083
I was just thinking about
the life of a pumpkin.

17
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:16,007
Grow up in the sun,
happily entwined with others,

18
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:21,929
and then someone comes along,
cuts you open and rips your guts out.

19
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:26,166
OK. And on that happy note,

20
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:31,090
got a treat for tomorrow night's
second annual Halloween screening.

21
00:01:31,173 --> 00:01:36,964
People, prepare to have your spines tingled
and your gooses bumped by the terrifying...

22
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:38,406
Fantasia.

23
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:39,847
Fantasia?

24
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:42,568
Maybe it's the horrific things we've seen,

25
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:46,248
but hippos wearing tutus don't
unnerve me the way they used to.

26
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,652
Phantasm.

27
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,008
It was supposed to be Phantasm.

28
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:51,890
Stupid video store.

29
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:55,125
I thought we were doing the Alpha-Delt thing.

30
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,443
- What thing?
- The scary house?

31
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:00,447
- Sounds kinda lame.
- But it borders on fun.

32
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:04,731
You go through the scary-house maze
to get to the party, which is worth getting to.

33
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:08,010
- Those guys go all out.
- As witnessed last Friday.

34
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:09,685
There's a party?

35
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:11,604
We didn't tell you?

36
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:16,242
No, that's cool.
You guys got your little college thing.

37
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:17,766
I'm fine.

38
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:21,402
I mean, I got better things to do
than tag along to some fraternity.

39
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,290
- You can come.
- OK.

40
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:26,206
Only because I lied about
having better things to do.

41
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:28,682
Blast will be had by all.

42
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:32,688
- I'm gonna get going.
- Now? The night's still...

43
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,563
OK, it's a little mature, but still...

44
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,725
I'm sleepy. You guys have fun.

45
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:41,725
- You want me to come with?
- No, I'm fine.

46
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,404
Sad Buffy.

47
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,493
She didn't even touch her pumpkin.

48
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:53,404
It's a freak with no face.

49
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:56,132
She's suffering post-Parker depression.

50
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:58,124
Bailing on the Buff.

51
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:01,091
Does anyone else wanna smack that guy?

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,074

53
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:23,364
Jeez, that hurt.

54
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,406
What the hell's wrong with you, lady?

55
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,364
That's what I'd like to know.

56
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:30,841
I've got the basics down:
levitation, charms, glamours.

57
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:34,130
I just feel like I've plateaued, Wicca-wise.

58
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:35,771
What's the next level?

59
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:40,483
Transmutation. Conjuring.
Bringing forth something from nothing.

60
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:44,885
It gets you pretty close to
the primal forces. A little scary.

61
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:47,965
Well, no one's pushing.
If it's too much, don't do it.

62
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:51,363
Don't do it?
What kind of encouragement is that?

63
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:55,446
This is an encouragement talk?
I thought it was "share my pain".

64
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:57,725
I don't know.

65
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:01,283
Then again, what is college for
if not experimenting?

66
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:05,651
You know? Maybe I can handle it.
I'll know when I've reached my limit.

67
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,122
- Wine coolers?
- Magic.

68
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:12,092
- Didn't encourage her, did you?
- Where's Supportive Boyfriend Guy?

69
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:13,845
Picking up your dry cleaning.

70
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:16,970
He told me to tell you
he's afraid you're gonna get hurt.

71
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,532
OK, Brutus.

72
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,611
Brutus.

73
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,810
Caesar? Betrayal? Trusted friend?

74
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:26,167
Backstabby?

75
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:31,088
I'm with you on the reference,
but I won't lie about the fact that I'm worried.

76
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:34,483
I know what it's like to have power
you can't control.

77
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:40,205
And every time I start to wolf out
I touch something deep, dark.

78
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:42,682
It's not fun.

79
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:48,291
Butjust know that, whatever you decide,
I'll back your play.

80
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,208
See? Concerned Boy. Sweet Boy.

81
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:56,172
I know. I kinda like him worrying, anyway.

82
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,369
You know,

83
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:06,809
I forgot to... be hungry.

84
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,250
Wait, Buffy.

85
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,686
Buffy.

86
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,448
Don't letjerky Parker chase you away.

87
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,205
He didn't.

88
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,887
I just don't wanna deal with this right now.

89
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:24,087
Taking a holiday from dealing. Happily
vacationing in the land of Not Coping.

90
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:28,725
You'll feel better at the party tonight.
Maybe you'll even meet someone.

91
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:33,125
I don't wanna meet someone.
I've reached my quota on someones.

92
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:35,488
I'm gonna have to patrol anyway.

93
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:37,689
Tonight? But it's Halloween.

94
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:42,403
I'll double-check with Giles, but I'm sure
he'll think I should be on slayer duty.

95
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:44,085
He doesn't care about Halloween.

96
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,728
Happy Hal...

97
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:48,243
Hello, Buffy.

98
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,928
Oh, my God.

99
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,331
- It's a sombrero.
- And it's on your head.

100
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,489
It seemed festive. Come in.

101
00:06:57,853 --> 00:06:59,571
Candy?

102
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:03,649
What's going on here?

103
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,769
You hate Halloween.

104
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:08,128
I've never said any such thing.

105
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:10,408
As my watcher's duties took precedence,

106
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:14,850
I simply hadn't taken time
to embrace its inherent charms.

107
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,924
Until now. Look.

108
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,610
It's alive.

109
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:23,688
See how he... shakes.

110
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:27,368
- Is there something you wanted?
- I was thinking I'd patrol tonight.

111
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:30,331
Possibly the cemetery.
Or if you had a better...

112
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,168
- Could you please take that off?
- Yes. Of course.

113
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:38,768
I see. Is there some specific danger
you were sensing?

114
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:43,165
No. But we were caught off-guard when
Ethan turned everyone into their costumes.

115
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,369
What happened then was anomalous.

116
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:49,128
Creatures of the night shy away from
Halloween. They find it too crass.

117
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:51,204
Hard to believe.

118
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:53,843
Well... I promise you...

119
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:57,323
Little likelihood of any
supernatural activity tonight.

120
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,489
Sure you don't want one?

121
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:17,764
I come bearing spiders.

122
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,526
Sound system's not gonna cut it.
Nothin' but lame.

123
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:24,412
You want me to call Oz?
He could probably hook us up.

124
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:25,846
Do it.

125
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:30,211
If we're not scaring the young women,
they will not fall into our arms.

126
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,931
We'll have womanless arms.

127
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:37,412
Halloween's not about thrills, chills and
funny costumes. It's about getting laid.

128
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:40,167
Is there a holiday that's
not about getting laid?

129
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,005
Arbor Day.

130
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:44,084
- Call Oz, dude.
- Done.

131
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:48,883
And you wanted a symbol to paint upstairs.
Something mystical.

132
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,043
Check this out.

133
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,204
Anya, you really have to get
this knocking thing down.

134
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:07,843
- How did you...?
- Your uncle Rory let me in.

135
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:12,484
- Does he always smell like peppermint?
- The man likes his schnapps.

136
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:15,883
- What are you doing here?
- You haven't called.

137
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,770
Not once.

138
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:20,811
- You said you were over me.
- And you just accepted that?

139
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,566
I said what I thought you wanted to hear.

140
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:28,488
Well, I tend to hear the actual words
people say and accept them at face value.

141
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,962
- That's stupid.
- I accept that.

142
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:37,326
I can't say seeing you falls
into the realm of a bad thing.

143
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,124
Really?

144
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:46,925
I thought maybe we could go out
tonight, for our anniversary.

145
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:48,002
Anniversary?

146
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,846
It's been exactly one week
since we copulated.

147
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,127
Did you forget?

148
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:57,207
No. Of course not. It's just I already
have plans with Buffy, Willow and Oz.

149
00:09:57,293 --> 00:10:00,205
- It's Halloween, you know.
- I don't understand.

150
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:02,363
Every October 31st, we mortals dress up...

151
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:05,843
No, no, I understand that inane ritual.
It's those people.

152
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,970
You associate with them,
though you share little in common.

153
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:10,566
What are you talkin' about?

154
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:13,213
I mean, they go to college. You don't.

155
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:16,087
They no longer live at home. You do.

156
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:18,289
Well, those things...

157
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:24,247
The bonds of true friendships transcend...
Could we change the subject?

158
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,166
OK. Don't get upset with me. I just wondered.

159
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,169
If you want, you can come
with me tonight to this party.

160
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,084
You mean like a date?

161
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:37,164
Is that what this is?

162
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,443
Are we dating?

163
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:46,172
There are definitely date-like
qualities at work here.

164
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:49,203
- You'll need a costume.
- A costume?

165
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:52,012
Dress up. You know, something scary.

166
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:54,163
Scary? Scary how?

167
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:58,730
Anya, you, ex-demon,
terrorised mankind for centuries.

168
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:01,805
I'm sure you'll come up with something.

169
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,604
Excuse me, Professor Walsh.

170
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:10,812
I came to get today's assignments.

171
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:14,772
I couldn't make it to class,
for personal reasons.

172
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:19,881
Right. I count four limbs,
a head, no visible scarring,

173
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:23,363
so I assume your personal issue
wasn't life-threatening,

174
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:25,489
and am therefore uninterested.

175
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:30,567
You got problems, solve 'em on your own
time. Miss another class and you're out.

176
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,084
She means it, you know.

177
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:39,321
Yeah. I got the impression
she wasn't saying it to make me laugh.

178
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:44,487
Your work's taken a downturn lately. I can't
remember the last time I saw your hand up.

179
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,370
Does stretching count?

180
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:50,332
Look, things get pretty intense
freshman year, as I dimly recall.

181
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:52,085
Too much fun or not enough?

182
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,569
Both, actually.

183
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,086
You gotta keep your priorities.
Professor Walsh is worth your time.

184
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:02,403
Thanks. I'll get this done tonight.

185
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:03,767
Tonight.

186
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:06,526
It's Halloween.
You're not gonna dress up and party?

187
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,604
I have a lot of work to do.

188
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:11,443
It's not really my business,

189
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:15,321
but you seem like a person who makes
things really hard on themselves.

190
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:19,691
Halloween isn't a night for responsibility.
It's when the ghosts and goblins come out.

191
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,570
That's actually a misnomer.

192
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,771
I didn't mean real ones.

193
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,642
But there is good scary fun
on campus tonight.

194
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:33,090
- What are you doing?
- I am gonna sit here and grade papers.

195
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:34,401
Scary.

196
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:35,642
Very.

197
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,042
Well, thanks for the pep talk, coach.

198
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,772
Don't make fun.
I worked hard to get this pompous.

199
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,332
No, I mean it.

200
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:46,129
You're welcome.

201
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:02,808
OK, watch your step, boys.
Paint's still wet in a few spots.

202
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:05,453
Thanks for the loan, man.
Our sound system sucks.

203
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,285
Mi Casio es su Casio.

204
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:12,921
Well, that's an interesting little design.
What does it mean?

205
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:14,207
No clue.

206
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,727
I got it out of this book...

207
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,405
Grapes!

208
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:23,210
Wow, peeled. You guys know
how to spoil your guests.

209
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:24,772
Eyeballs, man.

210
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:28,926
Blindfold chicks, put their hands in
the bowl, then tell them it's eyeballs.

211
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:30,731
They love that.

212
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:35,364
And I was wasting time buying them flowers
and complimenting them on their shoes.

213
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:39,765
So, you go through the whole house of
horrors downstairs and it ends up here.

214
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,206
Sweet.

215
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:43,249
You fratly guys have a nice setup.

216
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,325
Mighty Alpha Delts.
You should think about pledging.

217
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,768
Xander's a civilian.

218
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:52,084
A townie? I didn't know. You look so normal.

219
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:56,690
- Sure we should let him come to the party?
- Standing right here.

220
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:00,362
Cranking!

221
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:06,805
- Sensing a disturbance in the Force, master?
- Left speaker's crackling.

222
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,327
And stabbing it is the proper solution?

223
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,291
I'm just gonna trim the wire.
It might be a short.

224
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:14,402
Oz?

225
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:16,971
Cut myself.

226
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:18,566
It's OK.

227
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,452
Playing with knives? Fun. Yes. But not safe.

228
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:25,128
And when you bleed to death
I got dibs on your equipment.

229
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:42,652
- Thanks again for doing this.
- I'm just glad I could find it.

230
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,883
There. Try it now.

231
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:48,283
I let down the hem and loosened it
a little around the hood.

232
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:50,364
That feels better.

233
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:56,442
Oh, no. Someone's getting Nostalgic Face.

234
00:14:56,533 --> 00:15:00,446
I'm sorry. I'm thinking about
that little girl who wore that.

235
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:03,162
What is it? Five? Six years ago?

236
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:07,008
When Little Red Riding Hood
was the cutting edge in costumes.

237
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:09,926
Your father loved to take you out.

238
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:13,801
He was such a pain. 12 years old
and no trick-or-treating by myself?

239
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:18,091
- He just wanted to keep you safe.
- He wanted the candy. I was just the beard.

240
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:21,609
That's not true, actually.
The candy was for me.

241
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:24,727
Your father loved spending time with you.

242
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:27,884
Not enough, I guess.

243
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,122
Buffy.

244
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,967
Thatjust paved right over Memory Lane.

245
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:37,647
You know the divorce
had nothing to do with you.

246
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:40,244
I don't know.

247
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,806
I'm starting to feel like there's a pattern here.

248
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:47,329
Open your heart to someone
and he bails on you.

249
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,489
Maybe it's easier to just not let anyone in.

250
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,442
I thought it might be easier.

251
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:58,531
You must've noticed
I'm not the social butterfly

252
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:01,081
that I was when I was with your dad.

253
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:05,610
I don't think I made a single new friend
the year we moved to Sunnydale.

254
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:07,641
Why not?

255
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:10,884
Fear.

256
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:14,924
I didn't believe I could trust anyone again.

257
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:19,803
It's taken time and a lot of effort,
but I've got a nice circle of friends now.

258
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,692
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm still a little gun-shy.

259
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:29,369
It certainly didn't help that my last boyfriend
turned out to be a homicidal robot.

260
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:33,845
I will always be here for you.

261
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,927
And you've got Mr Giles and your friends.

262
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:42,329
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.

263
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,001
No, I'll just meet you at your place.

264
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:04,130
Buffy said she was coming,
but I haven't seen her.

265
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:08,206
We have to make sure she has fun.
We have to force fun upon her.

266
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:12,329
And if Parker shows up,
we'll just axe-murder him.

267
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:14,244
That's Halloweeny.

268
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,925
OK. See you in a bit.

269
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:25,490
You gonna stop by the room?

270
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:28,724
I'm late for battle or I would.
I love your outfit, though.

271
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,929
- There is nothing going on here.
- I saw you flirting with her.

272
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:39,807
Do we have to do this every time?
I love you. You know that.

273
00:17:47,973 --> 00:17:50,533
OK, Rach, what's in the next one?

274
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:53,525
- You guys are sick.
- Here, give me your hand.

275
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:56,008
This is gross.

276
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,812
Eyeballs, Rachel. They're eyeballs.

277
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:11,490
Hey, Red.

278
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,689
What you got in the basket, little girl?

279
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,172
Weapons.

280
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,810
Just in case.

281
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:23,405
- Like the tux, Xander.
- Bond. James Bond.

282
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,961
In case we get turned
into our costumes again,

283
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:28,362
I'm going for Cool Secret-Agent Guy.

284
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:32,162
I hate to break it to you, but you'll
probably end up Cool Headwaiter Guy.

285
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:35,370
As long as I'm cool
and wield some kind of power.

286
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,330
Will. Medieval Will.

287
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:40,325
Hail, ye old varletty, thou.

288
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:44,008
I'm Joan of Arc.
I figured we had a lot in common,

289
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:46,846
seeing as how I was almost
burned at the stake.

290
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:50,164
And plus she had that close
relationship with God.

291
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:52,923
And you are?

292
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:59,051
Of course. I wish I'd thought of that
before I put down my deposit.

293
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,371
I could've been God.

294
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:03,045
Blasphemer.

295
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,725
Nice costumes. Very stealthy.

296
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,089
What are they supposed to be?

297
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:19,050
NATO?

298
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:25,208
I invited Anya to join us, but she's having
some trouble finding a scary costume,

299
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:27,523
so she's just gonna meet us there.

300
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:31,208
Perfect. Everybody's got a date
but third-wheel Buffy.

301
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:35,684
- You're not a third wheel.
- Technically speaking, you're a fifth wheel.

302
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:39,008
We're gonna have the best time.

303
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,403
Let the horrors begin.

304
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,691
God help me.

305
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:31,602
Release me.

306
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,930
The joint's notjumpin'. Where is everybody?

307
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:48,884
Follow the signs.

308
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:56,253
Terrifying. If I were Abbott and Costello,
this would be fairly traumatic.

309
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:05,486
Cobweb.

310
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:08,133
OK, that part was realistic.

311
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:12,968
Frat boys aren't too obsessive with their
cleaning. It might not be decoration per se.

312
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,882
I wasn't scared. I was in the spirit.

313
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:23,921
And we'll back you up on that.
Even if they question us separately.

314
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:28,726
Get it off.

315
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:33,329
- It's gone.
- OK, that is not sanitary.

316
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:37,005
Let's get to the party part of the party.

317
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:38,412
Yeah.

318
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:41,053
- Are you sure it's off me?
- Yeah.

319
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:49,691
I thought this led to...

320
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:51,570
What is it?

321
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:54,045
Blood.

322
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,762
Real blood.

323
00:21:55,893 --> 00:22:00,091
OK, actual creeps have been given.
Bravo, frat boys.

324
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:04,962
Do you hear something?
Like a squeaking noise?

325
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:07,762
It's these rented shoes. Patent leather.

326
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:09,605
No, no, no. Wait.

327
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:13,288
It's something else. I hear it, too.
It's something like...

328
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:34,286
- Oz, don't. It might be...
- Rubber. It's made of rubber.

329
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,403
What the hell is going on here?

330
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:41,327
Look, maybe it's nothing.
Maybe it's just a neat trick.

331
00:22:41,853 --> 00:22:44,162
Something done with wires or...

332
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:47,370
Release me!

333
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,683
Or it might be something else.

334
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:07,964
Where's the door?

335
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:18,245
Hello.

336
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,693
Help me! Help me, please!

337
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:45,526
Xander.

338
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:51,124
Where's the stairs?

339
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:53,045
Where's the door?

340
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:57,331
This is the way we came in, right?
We just went in a circle.

341
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:59,092
Thank the Lord.

342
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,288
You're welcome.

343
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:02,762
I have a neat idea. Let's get out of here.

344
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:06,926
- You were so anxious for me to come.
- We don't know what we're dealing with.

345
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,846
OK, my turn. Does anyone hear that?

346
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:14,566
Well, as soon as we start dealing with it...
Do you hear something?

347
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,611
Like I said, it sounds like a hissing.

348
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:20,763
It's like a "ssss" noise.

349
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:25,282
I thought the word "hissing"
kind of covered that nicely.

350
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:35,405
I'm sorry. I didn't know. Sorry.

351
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:38,246
- Chaz?
- Didn't know.

352
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,891
What's happening?

353
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:41,372
It...

354
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:44,883
- What is it?
- It's alive.

355
00:25:04,693 --> 00:25:06,684
What's alive?

356
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:11,851
- He's in shock.
- Chaz, what happened here?

357
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:24,685
- I think the cape took most of it.
- It could need stitches.

358
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,445
At least get a bandage.

359
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:37,523
Cowering in a closet
seems like a reasonable plan.

360
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:41,564
What closet?

361
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,211
I'm gonna go upstairs and
see if there are people up there.

362
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:48,727
If you guys find a way
out of the house, use it.

363
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,249
You're telling us to run away
and leave you behind?

364
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:57,165
We need help. We need the only person
that can make sense of what's happening.

365
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:06,165
Just a minute.

366
00:26:06,253 --> 00:26:07,845
Coming.

367
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:10,768
Happy Ha...

368
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:13,970
Xander's in trouble.
You've gotta do something now.

369
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:16,169
Are you listening? Xander's trapped.

370
00:26:16,253 --> 00:26:20,724
- Where's Buffy and the others?
- Trapped, but we've gotta save Xander.

371
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,407
Slow down. I need you to be more specific.

372
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:26,407
We were supposed to meet at this house.

373
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:29,132
I got there and there was no door
where a door should be.

374
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:32,285
I see a girl standing in a window,
and then "poof!" She's gone.

375
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:36,252
- She vanished from the window?
- No, the window vanished from the house.

376
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:40,804
Matter-and-reality distortion.
Like a summoning spell's temporal flux.

377
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,326
What?

378
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:46,324
Never mind.
I just need to get some supplies together.

379
00:26:50,013 --> 00:26:54,006
I wouldn't worry about Xander.
At least he's amongst friends.

380
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:56,323
- I'm telling you...
- You're telling me?

381
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:59,803
- I can't do my job if I'm worrying about you.
- It's not your decision.

382
00:26:59,893 --> 00:27:02,248
- Gotta disagree with you there.
- Of course you do.

383
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,005
Let's all take a breath. Buffy...

384
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:06,766
Being the Slayer doesn't make you the boss.

385
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:08,605
You're as lost as the rest of us.

386
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,490
What are we talking about?

387
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:16,091
It's a simple incantation. A guiding spell for
travellers when they get lost or disoriented.

388
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:17,322
How's it work?

389
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:21,008
It conjures an emissary from the beyond
that lights the way.

390
00:27:21,213 --> 00:27:23,773
Conjuring. Will, let's be realistic here.

391
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:26,606
Your basic spells are usually only fifty-fifty.

392
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:28,812
Yeah?

393
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:31,282
Well, so's your face.

394
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:34,652
What?

395
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,732
What does that mean?

396
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:38,531
I'm not your sidekick.

397
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,092
Will, hang on.

398
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:45,283
Well, that was a bunch of laughs.

399
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:51,607
Look, Buffy, we're all tired and a little edgy.
Maybe Willow's overreacting.

400
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:54,730
Part of it's because you've been
Pushing Away Girl lately.

401
00:27:54,813 --> 00:27:58,328
But now's not the time
to let that stuff tear us apart.

402
00:27:58,413 --> 00:28:01,962
What I'm saying is, I'm right with ya.
Right by your side.

403
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:04,009
Xander?

404
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:07,802
Funny how you still haven't lost
your sense of inappropriate humour.

405
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:09,849
Xander, where did you go?

406
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:12,686
Buffy, knock it off.
The skit's over. I'm right here.

407
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:14,411
This is so typical of him.

408
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:15,882
Typical?

409
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,208
Xander?

410
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,012
Buffy!

411
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:31,172
Buff?

412
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,652
She thinks I'm not ready
to be a full-blown witch.

413
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:51,691
I can handle the dark forces
as good as anyone else.

414
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:56,130
It's not that hard. It's just a guiding spell,
and I'm careful an' all.

415
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:59,242
This floor used to have windows.

416
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,847
Look. We found the stairs.

417
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:06,733
Buffy didn't find stairs. No, sir.

418
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:10,326
I don't think you guys are thinking clearly.

419
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:19,768
We just need to get up to the goat room and...

420
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:23,448
- Willow, something's happening.
- Something good?

421
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:28,643
Oh, no. Not good.

422
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,246
I'm changing.

423
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:34,166
But you can't. There's no moon tonight.

424
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:35,886
I have to get away.

425
00:29:36,493 --> 00:29:40,964
No. We need to find something to restrain
you, like a rope or chains or something.

426
00:29:41,053 --> 00:29:43,044
There's no time.

427
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:46,206
I can do the guiding spell.
I know I can make it work.

428
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:47,772
- Will, please.
- No!

429
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,366
No!

430
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,532
Oz!

431
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:56,324
Oz, don't leave me.

432
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:10,126
There I am. I didn't go anywhere.

433
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:14,047
Great. Now I just got to live with the fact
that no one else can see me.

434
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:16,328
I can see you.

435
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:24,405
You're not gonna change.
You're not gonna change...

436
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:58,123
OK. OK.

437
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:01,489
Aradia, Goddess of the Lost,

438
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:05,043
the path is murky, the woods are dense.

439
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:07,488
Darkness pervades.

440
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:10,133
I beseech thee, bring the light.

441
00:31:14,253 --> 00:31:16,050
I did it.

442
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:18,124
I did you. Hi.

443
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:23,085
Right. You're waiting for instructions.

444
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,164
Lead me to Oz.

445
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:31,092
Wait. I should try to find the people
trapped upstairs first.

446
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:34,971
But we still have to find a way
out of the house.

447
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:37,009
OK, here's what we should do.

448
00:31:38,493 --> 00:31:40,484
What's going on? Stop.

449
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,564
Stop it.

450
00:31:45,373 --> 00:31:46,647
Get off.

451
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:51,569
Oz! Help!

452
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:02,882
Help! Help me! Oz!

453
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:06,044
Someone help!

454
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:16,244
Willow.

455
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,204
Basement.

456
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:48,247
I must be in the basement?

457
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:51,244
All alone.

458
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:53,684
Who said that?

459
00:32:57,253 --> 00:32:59,244
They all ran away from you.

460
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:02,484
They always will.

461
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:05,122
Open your heart to someone and...

462
00:33:08,373 --> 00:33:11,888
Don't fret, little girl. You're not alone.

463
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,250
Any more.

464
00:33:40,253 --> 00:33:41,845
Well?

465
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:46,002
We're gonna have to create a door.

466
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,124
Create a door? You can do that?

467
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:52,123
I can.

468
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:08,249
No matter how hard you fight,
you just end up in the same place.

469
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:20,683
I don't see why you bother.

470
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:38,565
I'm upstairs.

471
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,924
The goat room.

472
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,402
Oz?

473
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,848
Get 'em off me! Get 'em off!

474
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:13,805
Willow.

475
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:16,407
- What's wrong?
- Couldn't get 'em off...

476
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:17,721
It's OK.

477
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:21,730
We're OK.

478
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:24,088
We're not OK. We need to get out of here.

479
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:27,324
I'd offer my opinion,
but you jerks aren't gonna hear it.

480
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:30,849
Not that Didn't Go To College Boy
has anything important to say.

481
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:33,925
I might as well hang out with
Bleeding Dummy Head...

482
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:35,526
What is wrong with you?

483
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:39,003
You heard that? You can see me?

484
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:43,528
Good. Oh, God, good!

485
00:35:43,733 --> 00:35:47,442
The house separated us.
Like it wanted to scare us.

486
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:49,251
But we got away.

487
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,801
No. We were brought here.

488
00:35:53,093 --> 00:35:56,165
We all got so scared that we ended up here.

489
00:35:57,973 --> 00:35:59,964
Why?

490
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,688
I saw them painting that.

491
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:08,686
They were copying out of...

492
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,089
that.

493
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:15,529
- I think it's Gaelic.
- Can you translate?

494
00:36:15,613 --> 00:36:18,605
Release me.

495
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:24,361
- Will, give me something.
- OK.

496
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:26,648
The icon's called the Mark of Gachnar.

497
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:31,005
I think this is a summoning spell
for something called...

498
00:36:31,173 --> 00:36:32,083
Gachnar?

499
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:36,928
Well, yes. Somehow the beginning
of the spell must've been triggered.

500
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:40,808
Gachnar's trying to manifest itself
to come into being.

501
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:43,407
- How?
- It feeds on fear.

502
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:48,088
Our fears are manifesting. We're feeding it.
We need to stop.

503
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,085
If we close our eyes and say it's a dream,

504
00:36:51,173 --> 00:36:54,245
it'll stab us to death. These things are real.

505
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:58,121
OK, so our fears are feeding it.
If we get everyone out of here...

506
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,162
Good plan. Let's go.

507
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:13,045
Giles? Everyone, it's Giles.

508
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,169
With a chain saw.

509
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:18,768
- Glad you could make it.
- The wall's closed up behind us.

510
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:23,684
Gachnar. Of course.

511
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:28,364
Its presence infects the reality of the house,
but it's not achieved full manifestation.

512
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:30,603
We cannot allow this to come into being.

513
00:37:30,693 --> 00:37:32,649
But if it does, I can fight it, right?

514
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:33,882
Buffy...

515
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:38,485
- This is Gachnar.
- I don't wanna fight that.

516
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:41,533
- So we break the spell.
- Let's do it fast.

517
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:43,126
I have it.

518
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:46,728
"The summoning spell for Gachnar
can be shut down in one of two ways."

519
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:49,043
"Destroying the Mark of Gachnar...

520
00:37:56,853 --> 00:38:01,324
is not one of them, and will immediately
bring forth the fear demon itself."

521
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:07,132
Look.

522
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:41,004
This is Gachnar?

523
00:38:41,093 --> 00:38:44,085
Big overture. Little show.

524
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:48,890
I am the Dark Lord of Nightmares.

525
00:38:49,213 --> 00:38:51,443
The bringer of terror.

526
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:54,889
Tremble before me.

527
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:57,692
Fear me.

528
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:00,842
He's so cute.

529
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:04,001
Who's a little fear demon? Come on.

530
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,129
Don't taunt the fear demon.

531
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,444
- Why, can he hurt me?
- No, it's just tacky.

532
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:14,526
Be that as it may, Buffy,
when it comes to slaying...

533
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:18,606
- Size doesn't matter?
- They're all going to abandon you, you know.

534
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,611
Yeah, yeah.

535
00:39:24,213 --> 00:39:26,169
Some quality treats here, Giles.

536
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:27,652
Please, finish them.

537
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:32,124
This is much better. There is no problem
that cannot be solved by chocolate.

538
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:35,011
- I think I'm gonna barf.
- Except that.

539
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:42,325
What?

540
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:45,689
That's your scary costume?

541
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:48,410
Bunnies frighten me.

542
00:39:48,493 --> 00:39:52,008
- Bloody hell. The inscription.
- What's the matter?

543
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:58,009
I should've translated the Gaelic inscription
under the illustration of Gachnar.

544
00:39:58,693 --> 00:40:01,651
- What's it say?
- "Actual size."
