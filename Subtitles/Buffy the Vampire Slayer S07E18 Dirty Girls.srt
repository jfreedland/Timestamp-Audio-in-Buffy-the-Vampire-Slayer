00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:05,867
l'm Faith.

3
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:08,750
<i>(Giles) We have a rogue slayer.</i>
<i>l can't think of anything more dangerous.</i>

4
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:09,981
Faith, no!

5
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:11,630
- You killed a man.
- l don't care.

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:12,781
She's unstable, Buffy.

8
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:24,907
l'm not a demon, little girl.
l am something that you can't even conceive.

9
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,267
The First Evil.

10
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:28,751
lt's not a happy scenario,

11
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:31,585
but we're dealing with the Big Bad
that can be any dead person.

12
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:34,266
You know the rules.
l can't take corporeal form.

13
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:38,429
<i>- They're all slayers?</i>
<i>- (Giles) Potential slayers.</i>

14
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:42,107
<i>There were many more like them all over</i>
<i>the world, but now there's just a handful.</i>

15
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:43,181
That's what it wants.

16
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:48,141
<i>(Giles) To erase all the slayers-in-training</i>
<i>and their watchers, along with their methods.</i>

17
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:50,587
And then Faith, and then me.

18
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:54,543
lt's the end. No more slayer.

19
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:57,749
Spike has a soul now. That's what's
gonna stop him from hurting people.

20
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:01,586
- Buffy...
- He can be a good man, Giles. l feel it.

21
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:04,903
Willow, call for you from LA.
Somebody named Fred.

22
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:07,267
l'm gonna have to take off for a while.

23
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:08,626
We're on the verge of war.

24
00:01:08,712 --> 00:01:12,068
You need to make difficult decisions
regardless of cost.

25
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:13,551
You're stalling me.

26
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:17,307
l've been searching for you
for a very, very long time.

27
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:19,428
Ever since you killed my mother.

28
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:23,543
You try anything again, he'll kill you.

29
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:28,791
More importantly, l'll let him.

30
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:33,469
l think you've taught me
everything l need to know.

31
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:47,941
Stop! Stop! Stop, please!

32
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,390
Get me out of here!

33
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:52,667
ls someone hurt? What is it?

34
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,302
Drive!

35
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:01,503
Well, that was...

36
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,383
Are you all right?

37
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,622
Thank you. Thank God you were there.

38
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,180
Well, let's not give him credit for everything.

39
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:14,264
l'm funning you.
l don't believe it was a coincidence.

40
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:18,311
l also don't believe young girls should be
in the woods at night. Should be in bed.

41
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:21,862
- Wish l was.
- l expect you do at that.

42
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:26,787
Look, l don't mean to pry,
but those boys... they looked like...

43
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:32,708
You didn't happen to fall in
with devil worshippers, did you?

44
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,305
No, l'm sorry.

45
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:39,466
You look like you've been
travellin' a while. l didn't think that...

46
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:45,071
ls there someplace you'd like me
to drop you? You heading someplace?

47
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:47,746
- Sunnydale.
- l'm going there myself.

48
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:50,426
l ain't never been,
but we can find a police station...

49
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,390
l just need to get to Robello Drive.

50
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,385
But thanks, Father...

51
00:02:57,472 --> 00:03:00,191
Call me Caleb. Never was nobody's daddy.

52
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,710
l'm Shannon.

53
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:07,946
Well, Shannon, you feel like telling me
why those freaky joes were after you?

54
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:10,148
l'm not sure.

55
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:15,545
Do you ever think that maybe they were
chasin' you because you're a whore?

56
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:18,192
- What?
- l know what you're thinkin'.

57
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:22,823
Crazy preacher man spouting off at
the mouth about the Whore of Babylon.

58
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,551
That ain't me. l'm not here to lecture you.

59
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:29,545
What's the point?
My words would just curdle in your ears.

60
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,702
Wouldn't take in a thing.

61
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:36,704
Head filled with so much filth that...
ain't no room for words of truth.

62
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:40,466
You know what you are, Shannon?

63
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:43,509
- Dirty.
- l'm not!

64
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:46,789
Now, now, now. There's no blame here.

65
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:49,864
You were born dirty. Born without a soul.

66
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:56,029
Born with that gapin' maw that wants
to open up, suck out a man's marrow.

67
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:59,104
Makes me puke to think too hard on it.

68
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:03,990
Yeah, that there door's problematical.

69
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:08,702
l couldn't recommend steppin' out at this
speed. You're like as much to tumble some.

70
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:12,307
Of course, there's my boys back there.
They hate to miss a mark.

71
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:13,381
<i>Your</i> boys?

72
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:17,260
They ain't exactly my blue-eyed boys,
but they're hard workers.

73
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:20,708
And they don't truck with Satan.
That was just me having fun.

74
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,783
Satan is a little man.

75
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:30,026
l don't like back-seat drivers.

76
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:37,463
Please... don't hurt me.

77
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:40,589
ls this the part
where you offer to do anything?

78
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:45,302
Because l tried to make it clear to you,
you got nothin' l want to explore.

79
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:47,781
- Argh!
- Oh, yeah! That's it.

80
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,227
That's a cleansin' fire. Hallelujah!

81
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:58,421
lf l'm not mistaken,
there's a car a little ways behind us.

82
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:01,822
l do believe there's some folk in it
goin' the same place you are.

83
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:05,541
l want you to deliver a message for me,
but it's not for them.

84
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:10,786
lt's for the other one. The one and only,
the original, accept-no-substitutes Slayer.

85
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:16,307
- Would you tell her somethin' for me?
- Yes.

86
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:19,623
Thank you, Shannon.

87
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:28,662
<i>(whispers)</i>

88
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:35,187
Now, let's see what we can't do
about that door.

89
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,628
Are you OK?

90
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:49,306
Can you hear me? Can you talk?

91
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:56,107
This girl's bleeding badly.
We have to get her to the hospital.

92
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:58,990
Yep. Guess l'm back in Sunnydale.

93
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:02,830
l know it's hard.

94
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:06,427
l haven't been able to sleep
the last few nights.

95
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:10,710
Listen. lt's gonna be OK.
Buffy knows what she's doing.

96
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:14,387
She won't send you into battle
until she's sure you're ready for action.

97
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:19,341
That's just it, though.
How will l know l'm ready... for action?

98
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:26,022
- You have to trust us.
- l'm so scared, Xander. And l'm so young.

99
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,946
Believe it or not, l was younger
than you when l started all this.

100
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,104
There's just so much l haven't done,
so much l need to do.

101
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:36,901
lt's like... l never had
a real boyfriend, you know?

102
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:40,143
Yeah?

103
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:44,107
l never been with a man.

104
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:50,511
l could die tomorrow,
and l never been with a man.

105
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:52,866
Well...

106
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:55,830
l've never been with a man before either.

107
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:57,186
Colleen.

108
00:07:57,272 --> 00:08:00,947
l've never been with her
in front of a man before.

109
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:05,025
l've never been with her
in front of a man either.

110
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:06,948
Um...

111
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,988
Xander...

112
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,870
- We can't.
- We're so scared.

113
00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:14,830
- The others might hear us.
- No, they won't.

114
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,868
They're OK.

115
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:31,865
<i>(Rona)</i> Xander! Xander!

116
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:33,783
- Wha...?
- Goddamn it!

117
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:36,750
What's going on? l was sleeping.

118
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:41,189
Dominique has a stomach flu,
and the toilet bowl is backed up.

119
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:44,742
l'll be right out. Got a... a leg cramp.

120
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:52,861
<i>(Faith)</i> You sure she's one of us?

121
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:57,150
She don't look like much now.
Not a potential slayer, l mean.

122
00:08:57,232 --> 00:09:02,260
Don't know. Seems to fit, though. We'll know
more when she regains consciousness.

123
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:06,106
lf she regains consciousness.
Girl's been gutted like a catfish.

124
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:07,944
Yeah.

125
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:14,550
Something's killing girls all over the world,
trying to end the slayer line.

126
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:17,829
Thing like that, figure l might get a heads-up.

127
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:18,901
Faith...

128
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:22,587
Guess it doesn't matter
as long as you got the true Slayer intact.

129
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:25,630
You were in prison.
We figured you were safe there.

130
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:27,907
Yeah, that's prison. Safe as a kitten.

131
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:32,349
Sorry. l... don't know much
about the big house. Was it...

132
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,705
l mean, did something happen in there?

133
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,511
Someone came at me
with a nasty-looking knife.

134
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:40,867
Didn't really know why until now.

135
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:44,865
- Faith, we didn't...
- Forget it. lt's cool. l get by.

136
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:48,186
What are we gonna do about her?

137
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:51,389
l guess we should find Buffy,
tell her what's going on.

138
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:54,987
l tried calling home.
Dawn says she's out patrolling.

139
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:57,586
Let's look for her.
Cemetery's more fun anyway.

140
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:00,232
Somebody should wait here
in case she wakes up.

141
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:03,190
- Fine. Sit tight. l'll be back.
- Wait.

142
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:07,991
Maybe you meeting Buffy alone
isn't the best idea.

143
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:11,382
You told her the sitch, right?
She knows l'm coming.

144
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:13,622
Probably been up all night hangin' streamers.

145
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:18,740
Yeah, but it's not like
you're study buddies, exactly.

146
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:22,711
Maybe it'd be better if l...
eased her into the whole thing.

147
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:27,741
l can't stay here, Willow. Spent way
too much time in hospitals. We don't click.

148
00:10:27,832 --> 00:10:30,665
Don't worry.
l'm sure we'll get along just fine.

149
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:44,669
<i>(growling)</i>

150
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:57,789
What you want to do to her, vamp?
Something like this?

151
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,668
Nice punch you got there. Let me guess.

152
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:09,061
Leather pants, nice right cross,

153
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:12,781
doe eyes, holier-than-thou glower.
You must be Faith.

154
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,308
- Oh, goody. l'm famous.
- Told you were coming.

155
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:20,988
- Bit of a misunderstanding here. l'm...
- Spike. We've met before.

156
00:11:21,072 --> 00:11:23,063
We have? l don't think we...

157
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:25,825
Bloody hell. What are you doing?
l'm on your side.

158
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:28,585
Yeah? Maybe you haven't heard.
l've reformed.

159
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:32,229
So have l. l reformed way before you did.

160
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:36,510
Stop... hitting... me!

161
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,389
We're on the same side.

162
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:41,782
- Please! You think l'm stupid?
- Well, yeah.

163
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:44,340
You were attacking that girl.

164
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,505
Sorry, Faith. l didn't realise that was you.

165
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:54,541
lt's all right, B.
Luckily you still punch like you used to.

166
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,783
- You OK?
- Yeah. Terrific.

167
00:11:57,872 --> 00:11:59,908
You're protecting vampires?

168
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:02,790
Are you the bad slayer now?
Am l the good slayer now?

169
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:05,386
He's with me. He has a soul.

170
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:06,951
- He's like Angel?
- No.

171
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,068
- Sort of.
- l'm nothing like Angel.

172
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:12,747
He fights on my side.
Which is more than l can say for some of us.

173
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:17,269
lf he's so good, what's he doing
chasing down defenceless...

174
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:21,265
- That's one of the bad guys.
- You should make 'em wear signs.

175
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:29,866
May l?

176
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,749
Thanks.

177
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:37,949
Angel's dull as a table lamp,
and we have different colouring.

178
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:41,308
OK, catching up. Anything else l gotta know?

179
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:45,022
Nice to have you back.

180
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:50,103
Whoa. Memory lane. Same old house.

181
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:55,505
All the furniture's been destroyed and
replaced since you left, so... new house.

182
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,583
Buffy?

183
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:01,062
We have a new house guest.

184
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:05,625
Hey. Got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?

185
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:08,428
Hello, Faith.

186
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:13,347
- l guess "wanted" wasn't really accurate.
- <i>(Dawn)</i> Does she have to stay here?

187
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:16,310
There's hotels for
tried-to-kill-your-sister types.

188
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:19,145
Check it out. Brat's all woman-sized.

189
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:22,702
l need to get to the hospital.
A girl was attacked on her way into town.

190
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,431
- She might...
- We know. Willow's been calling.

191
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,504
She's still there.
She's gonna call if the girl wakes up.

192
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:30,389
Fine.

193
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,701
Well, Faith, we'd better...

194
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:41,421
see if we can find someplace
to squeeze you in for the night.

195
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:51,543
Not all that tension was about you.

196
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:55,181
Giles was part of a plan to kill me...
for Buffy's own good.

197
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:59,708
Well, that makes me feel better about me,

198
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:01,987
worse about Giles,

199
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:04,870
kinda shaky about you.

200
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:09,903
Drink of this,

201
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:12,907
for it is my blood.

202
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:20,700
You know, l always loved
the story of the Last Supper.

203
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:24,990
The body and blood of Christ
becomin' rich, red wine.

204
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:28,950
l recall, as a boy, though,
l couldn't help but think

205
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:32,866
"What would happen if you were at
the Last Supper, and you ordered the white?"

206
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:35,944
A nice oaky Chardonnay or White Zin.

207
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:40,547
Would he make that
out of his lymph or somehow?

208
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:43,230
Never did bring it up.

209
00:14:43,312 --> 00:14:48,784
Suppose there was a reason
why l never spent too long in one parish.

210
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:52,466
Just lookin' for answers.

211
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:56,943
Just lookin' for the Lord
in the wrong damn places.

212
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:00,825
Then you showed me the light.

213
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:04,467
Do you think l'm God?

214
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:10,785
l certainly do not.
l am beyond concepts like that.

215
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:13,067
But you still wear the outfit.

216
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:15,382
Man can't turn his back
on what he come from.

217
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:18,066
Besides, black is slimmin'.
Everyone knows that.

218
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,347
How do you like what l'm wearing?

219
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:25,228
Just another dirty girl.
And since you only dress up in dead folk,

220
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:29,305
l'm guessin' one who's already
been paid her wage.

221
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:32,506
Look hard.

222
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:34,583
What do you see?

223
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,907
Strength.

224
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:44,543
And... the loneliness
that comes with real strength.

225
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:48,022
Nothing about my pert and bouncy hairdo?

226
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:54,707
- You're her.
- The Slayer.

227
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:59,023
At long last.

228
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,903
All this time.

229
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,583
All the work l've done for you.

230
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:12,506
Blowin' up the Council,
organisin' the Ray Charles brigade,

231
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:15,060
and... stickin' all them splits.

232
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:19,349
- You never showed me.
- Well, you've earned it.

233
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:23,989
And you'll be meeting her soon. Am l right?

234
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:26,506
Oh, yeah. She'll get the message.

235
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:31,541
- And what makes you so sure she'll come?
- Curiosity. Woman's first sin.

236
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:35,910
l offer her an apple.
What can she do but take it?

237
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:41,507
l'll see you soon.

238
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:50,905
<i>(Andrew) Faith. Her name alone invokes awe.</i>

239
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:56,430
<i>Faith. A set of principles or beliefs upon</i>
<i>which you are willing to devote your life.</i>

240
00:16:56,512 --> 00:17:01,381
<i>The dark slayer. A lethal combination</i>
<i>of beauty, power, and death.</i>

241
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:05,871
<i>For years and years -</i>
<i>or, to be more accurate, months -</i>

242
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:09,991
<i>Faith fought on the side of good,</i>
<i>terrorising the evil community.</i>

243
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:15,704
<i>But like so many tragic heroes, Faith</i>
<i>was seduced by the lure of the dark side.</i>

244
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:20,627
<i>She wrapped evil around her</i>
<i>like a large, evil Mexican serape.</i>

245
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:23,431
<i>She became a cold-blooded killer.</i>

246
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:28,784
<i>Nobody was immune to her trail</i>
<i>of destruction. Not friends, not family,</i>

247
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:32,228
<i>not even the most pacifist</i>
<i>and logical of races.</i>

248
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:47,148
What the hell are you talking about?
l thought Faith killed a volcanologist.

249
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,029
<i>(Andrew chuckles)</i>

250
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:53,665
Silly, silly... Amanda.

251
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:58,631
Why would Faith
kill a person who studies Vulcans?

252
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:04,151
He studied volcanoes. He was a professor.

253
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,987
Ah... yes.

254
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:09,266
Well, regardless...

255
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:13,231
l thought you weren't supposed to be
doing this any more, making up stories.

256
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:15,906
l'm not. This is true.

257
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:20,270
Except for that... possible...
word misunderstanding.

258
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:25,310
There are things you need to know about.

259
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:30,905
Faith... has a history not to be taken lightly.

260
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,352
She's a killer. Never forget that.

261
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:40,666
You must stay on guard around Faith
at all times. Your lives may depend on it.

262
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:49,623
<i>(bell rings)</i>

263
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:58,750
- You look better.
- No, l don't.

264
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:02,950
- No, you don't.
- l'll be OK.

265
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:07,946
Unless, of course,
you start beating up on me now.

266
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:10,303
l won't.

267
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:14,385
Well, l thought about it.
l made some doodles.

268
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:17,305
As far as l'm concerned,
we're on even ground.

269
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:23,263
l meant what l said.
l don't have time for your vendetta.

270
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:27,425
But l need you in this fight.
l want you on my side.

271
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:30,424
Thanks. That means a lot.

272
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:34,787
- So we're good?
- Absolutely.

273
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,103
- You're fired.
- What?

274
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:40,547
Effective immediately.

275
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:42,782
You're firing me?

276
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:45,705
l just refrained from kicking your ass.

277
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,465
Buffy, there's nothing here for you.

278
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:52,704
People are leaving town,
half the kids don't even show up any more.

279
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,465
You've got much worse things to deal with.

280
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:57,827
- Look at the big picture.
- Right.

281
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:03,463
The big picture. The one with the big war
and all the dead little girls.

282
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:06,703
Not dead. Not dead,
not if you get them ready.

283
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:13,822
l don't wanna lead them into war.
lt can't be the right thing.

284
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:16,708
Most wars aren't, you know.

285
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:19,909
Some of these girls
haven't even been tested in battle.

286
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:23,951
Then, l guess, maybe you should test them.

287
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:29,064
Couldn't l come to work part-time?
l could make fliers for encounter groups.

288
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:31,712
And you're fired again.

289
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:36,824
Remember, Buffy,
the mission's what matters.

290
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:42,183
<i>(girls giggling)</i>

291
00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:58,867
You craving a moment alone in the dank,
or can l bum one?

292
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:07,866
Well, l guess you can smoke all you want.
The big C not really an issue.

293
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:11,228
Teeth get yellow... after an eternity.

294
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:14,107
- Gotta watch that.
- Huh.

295
00:21:19,672 --> 00:21:24,223
- Right. lt's not what it looks like.
- Hey, to each his own, man.

296
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:28,703
One guy l ran with, he liked me to dress
up like a schoolgirl and take this bullwhip...

297
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,987
l got dangerous... for a while.

298
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:36,030
- This before the soul or after?
- After, but l got over it.

299
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:39,502
ln case you're feeling all dust-happy
after your incarceration.

300
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:42,982
Not if you're all repenty.
Takes the fun out of it.

301
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:48,747
<i>(clattering from upstairs)</i>

302
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:53,189
No more Starbucks for the wannabes, man.
They've been spazzing for hours.

303
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:58,585
- Yeah. Does get a bit much up there.
- They're good girls. Just green is all.

304
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:03,029
- So why aren't you up there... imparting?
- That's Buffy's thing.

305
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:06,741
Anyway, l just spent a good stretch
locked away with a mess of females.

306
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:09,266
- Kinda had my fill.
- Hm.

307
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:12,344
But you waited until Angel
needed your help to bust out.

308
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:17,108
Three squares, nice weight room, movie
every third Sunday. Could've been worse.

309
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:20,946
- What movie?
- Last one was <i>Glitter.</i>

310
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:23,182
l guess it couldn't have been worse.

311
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:27,470
You had the power to walk away any time.
Nothing to stop you.

312
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:30,020
l stopped me.

313
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:32,751
l got dangerous for a while.

314
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,821
You over it?

315
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:41,302
More or less. l pull for the good guys now.

316
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:45,183
- What's the less?
- The usual stuff.

317
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:47,069
Such as?

318
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:51,065
l was thinking about looking up
the guy with the bullwhip.

319
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,382
Long incarceration.

320
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:58,707
You could do better.
Schoolgirl thing's old hat.

321
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:03,070
lt's all old hat, man.
Every guy's got some whack fantasy.

322
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:06,110
Scratch the surface
of any granola-type dude -

323
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:08,342
naughty nurses and horny cheerleaders.

324
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:11,310
- l figure, if you can't beat 'em...
- Join 'em.

325
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:15,067
- Just don't forget who's on top.
- That, l suspect, would be you.

326
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:17,222
You got that right.

327
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:24,220
l've met you before, you know.

328
00:23:25,152 --> 00:23:27,461
Yeah, you made
a great impression on my chin.

329
00:23:27,552 --> 00:23:29,907
Not in the graveyard. Before that.

330
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:33,701
- l was kinda wearing a different body.
- Pity.

331
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,181
You seemed OK with it.

332
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:40,866
The body swap... with Buffy.

333
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:46,821
- She fill you in on that whole deal?
- She told me it went down.

334
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:49,062
Failed to mention who was driving her skin.

335
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:50,983
l may have said a few things.

336
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:53,632
You could ride me at a gallop
till my knees buckled,

337
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:57,421
squeeze me till l pop like warm champagne.

338
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:59,707
lt's not the kind of thing a man forgets.

339
00:24:00,112 --> 00:24:04,663
Should've known it wasn't Blondie.
She'd never throw down like that.

340
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,265
Oh, you have been away.

341
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:09,981
Don't tell me little Miss Tightly-Wound's
been getting her naughty on?

342
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:12,984
- Not of late.
- Wow.

343
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,666
Everybody's just full of surprises.

344
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:19,430
Hey, B.

345
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:25,190
Well, it's nice to see you two
getting along so well.

346
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:28,582
Yeah. You just know all the cool vampires.

347
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,821
Yeah.

348
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:34,508
- Aren't you usually at work about now?
- l decided to cut back on my hours.

349
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:39,388
- <i>(Dawn)</i> Buffy? ls that you?
- Down here.

350
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:43,742
Figured l'd better focus on
what's going on around here.

351
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:49,065
Buffy, Willow just called from the hospital.
The girl's awake.

352
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:53,905
He was a minister, or something.

353
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:57,585
At least, he dressed like one.

354
00:24:58,712 --> 00:25:02,705
l thought he was trying to save me... at first.

355
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:07,104
He picked you up on the side of the road?

356
00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:12,983
Bringers were chasing me.
He said they were his boys.

357
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,861
Right before he burned me.

358
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:31,940
He wanted to tell you something.

359
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:35,544
Before he... cut me...

360
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:40,229
he told me to give the Slayer a message.

361
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:45,660
- What is it?
- He said...

362
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,626
"l have something of yours."

363
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:57,709
We've got a new player in town.
Dresses like a preacher.

364
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:01,705
Calls himself Caleb.
Looks like he's working for the First.

365
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,822
He's taunting us, calling us out.

366
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,346
Says he's got something of mine.

367
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:11,822
Could be another girl.
Could be something else.

368
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:14,904
Don't know. Don't care.

369
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:18,462
l'm tired of talking. l'm tired of training.

370
00:26:18,552 --> 00:26:21,510
He's got something of mine? Fine.

371
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:25,983
l'm getting it back,
and you guys are coming with me.

372
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:42,744
You're searching for somethin', girl.
What would that be now?

373
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:46,662
Oh... You, l was looking for you.

374
00:26:46,752 --> 00:26:48,549
That right?

375
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:52,102
l heard you speakin' tonight. Preachin'.

376
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:54,308
l felt your words go straight to me.

377
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:58,670
Well, the truth is like a sword,
isn't it, girl? Cuts deep.

378
00:26:58,752 --> 00:26:59,867
Yeah.

379
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,227
The words l use got a power to 'em.

380
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:06,271
Power, now. They're notjust words.
They're truth.

381
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:09,790
- They brought me here.
- They called you.

382
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:13,750
Know why? Because you're human.

383
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:17,592
You got your urges.

384
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:20,744
A woman's got hers. A man's got his.

385
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:25,702
Our whole race can be so damnably weak.

386
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:29,580
That's why we seek the strength, the power.

387
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:35,270
lt's not wrong to be drawn
to the power, is it, preacher?

388
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:38,503
Oh, no, child. lt's not wrong.

389
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,390
<i>(girl gasps)</i>

390
00:27:45,752 --> 00:27:47,344
Just human.

391
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:56,944
Most people don't like visits
from their dead, you know.

392
00:27:57,032 --> 00:27:59,910
Heathens. No appreciation for life's pleasures.

393
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:03,905
- Do it again.
- l take requests.

394
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:07,985
- One of those potentials you killed, perhaps?
- No. Save them for later.

395
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:10,905
l'm in more of an old
memory lane kinda mood.

396
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:17,110
Back before l met you, there was a choirgirl
in Knoxville l gave singing lessons to.

397
00:28:17,192 --> 00:28:20,867
She even screamed on key. Show me her.

398
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:25,625
All these girls. They followed you willingly.

399
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:28,784
- You tricked them.
- l only told them the truth.

400
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:32,911
As for following, well...
that seems to be what they do best.

401
00:28:33,232 --> 00:28:36,190
We need to arm the girls.
l wanna be ready when we find him.

402
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:39,389
- We don't know where we're going.
- We're gonna do some recon.

403
00:28:39,472 --> 00:28:41,622
- You up for it?
- Point me where you want me.

404
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:47,469
You're certain about this? You don't know
what this man has of yours, if anything.

405
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:50,020
lt could be a girl,
a potential trying to get to us.

406
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:52,068
Could be a stapler.

407
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:54,382
- l'm going in anyway.
- With the girls?

408
00:28:54,472 --> 00:28:58,306
Most of whom have yet to be in the field,
let alone a life-or-death situation.

409
00:28:58,392 --> 00:29:02,908
lt's time we test them. l'll take the ones that
have been here longest. The rest can stay.

410
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,984
Could be that's what he wants.
The old bait-and-switch.

411
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:09,587
He lures us away
and then kills the girls we leave behind.

412
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:13,627
l know. That's why l need you
to stay here with them.

413
00:29:14,192 --> 00:29:18,743
You're my most powerful weapon, Will.
You can keep them safe if anything happens.

414
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:22,268
An unknown man breezes into town,
says he has something of yours.

415
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:24,468
Buffy, this has "trap" written all over it.

416
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:28,067
He won't be expecting a full attack.
That's why we have to move.

417
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:30,188
We know nothing about this man.

418
00:29:30,272 --> 00:29:33,389
We cannot go into battle unprepared.
We need more time.

419
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:38,262
Giles, we don't have time.
And you're not going into battle.

420
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:40,912
l need you to stay behind with the others.

421
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,222
Help the girls who still need a teacher.

422
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,700
No eyes, but look at him go.
He got sonar or somethin'?

423
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:56,467
Or something, l guess.
Pretty good when they attack.

424
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:58,702
They just roam free around town?

425
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:04,071
Normally they show up out of nowhere,
and either stab or get stabbed, then run off.

426
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:08,828
- Looks like this guy wants to be found.
- Lends weight to the "it's a trap" theory.

427
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:11,426
l am through waiting for people to attack us.

428
00:30:11,512 --> 00:30:14,584
l'm with you. Drop me in
the hornet's nest, what the hell?

429
00:30:19,112 --> 00:30:24,550
You got a rough sitch here, trying to turn
a bunch of little girls into an army.

430
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:28,420
They're potential slayers, just like we were.

431
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:33,427
- Right. Maybe they'll do as good as us.
- They're getting better.

432
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:35,980
l'll work with them.
Some of 'em seem real eager.

433
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:39,781
Fashion disasters, yeah,
but they're ready to fight.

434
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,660
- Why did you come back?
- Willow said you needed me.

435
00:30:43,752 --> 00:30:46,630
Didn't give it a lot of thought. Do you...

436
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:52,150
- Am l getting you want me to be not here?
- No, that's not what l meant.

437
00:30:53,592 --> 00:30:58,029
<i>(sighs)</i> l'm... glad that you're here. lt's good.

438
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:01,710
- Thank you.
- No problem.

439
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,864
You know me. All about the good deeds.

440
00:31:06,592 --> 00:31:09,186
Willow said you helped out Angel.

441
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:11,467
Yeah. He says "Hi."

442
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:14,821
- Really?
- Sure.

443
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:19,185
- How is he?
- Better.

444
00:31:19,272 --> 00:31:21,627
l had to do this magical mind-walk with him.

445
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:24,749
- You were in Angel's mind?
- Buffy...

446
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:30,228
- What is this place?
- Look, there's more of 'em.

447
00:31:31,752 --> 00:31:36,462
- l think we just found our hornet's nest.
- Let's get the cavalry.

448
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:40,262
Now remember, we're looking for
killing blows only, people.

449
00:31:40,352 --> 00:31:46,700
So, chest and throat if it's a vampire.
Stomach, chest and face if it's a bringer.

450
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:49,226
- What if it's something else?
- Could happen.

451
00:31:49,312 --> 00:31:52,907
Something otherworldly.
Here's a handy rule:

452
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:56,826
don't go for the tentacles just because
they wave 'em about for attention.

453
00:31:56,912 --> 00:32:02,305
Go for the centre. Brain, heart, eyes.
Everything's got eyes.

454
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:05,429
- <i>(Dawn)</i> Except the Bringers.
- Except the Bringers.

455
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:09,027
l don't want there to be tentacles.
l'm not good with squishy.

456
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:12,309
l don't care if it's Godzilla.
l wanna get in this thing.

457
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:16,021
Godzilla's mostly Tokyo-based,
so he's probably a no-show.

458
00:32:16,112 --> 00:32:20,424
Besides, if Matthew Broderick
can kill Godzilla, how tough is he?

459
00:32:20,512 --> 00:32:24,300
- Xander!
- Matthew Broderick did not kill Godzilla.

460
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:27,543
He killed a big, dumb lizard
that was <i>not</i> the real Godzilla.

461
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:30,704
You people are even crazier than her.

462
00:32:31,592 --> 00:32:33,742
- Than who?
- Buffy, man.

463
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:36,501
l mean, taking us right into the bad guy's lair.

464
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:39,868
That's where, generally speaking,
you'd go to find the bad guy.

465
00:32:39,952 --> 00:32:43,865
- l don't think you came here to fight plaque.
- No, l came here for protection.

466
00:32:43,952 --> 00:32:47,501
- Well, you signed on to fight with...
- Look, l know...

467
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:50,902
This plan is trouble.
Buffy doesn't care if she puts us in danger.

468
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:54,746
Let me tell you something about Buffy.
You should all listen to this.

469
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:56,788
We kinda were.

470
00:32:56,872 --> 00:33:01,548
l've been through more battles with Buffy
than you all can ever imagine.

471
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:04,704
She's stopped everything
that's ever come up against her.

472
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:08,671
She's laid down her life, literally,
to protect the people around her.

473
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:11,949
This girl has died two times,
and she's still standing.

474
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:15,786
You're scared? That's smart.
You got questions? You should.

475
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:21,663
But you doubt her motives, you think Buffy's
all about the kill? Then take the bus to battle.

476
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:24,744
l've seen her heart,
and this time not literally.

477
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:29,462
l'm telling you right now, she cares more
about your lives than you will ever know.

478
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:32,589
You gotta trust her.

479
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,663
She's earned it.

480
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:41,109
Damn! l never knew you were that cool.

481
00:33:41,192 --> 00:33:44,423
- Well, you always were a little slow.
- l get that now.

482
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:47,151
All right. Saddle up.

483
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:06,868
OK. Set up a perimeter, guard the door.
l don't want anything getting in behind us.

484
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:10,262
My team goes in first, we check it out.
You guys are our safety net.

485
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:13,981
lf it's a trap, we give the signal,
you guys come in, guns a-blazing.

486
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:17,587
- What's the signal?
- l'm thinkin' lots and lots of yelling.

487
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:18,707
Got it.

488
00:34:19,112 --> 00:34:21,148
Shall we?

489
00:34:39,152 --> 00:34:42,940
- What is this place?
- Looks like an old vineyard.

490
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:46,468
- An evil vineyard, huh?
- Like Falcon Crest.

491
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:50,668
Stay alert, you guys.
The Bringers are here somewhere.

492
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:54,586
- Just need to find out where.
- Shouldn't be too hard.

493
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:40,029
Well, now! You girls are just burnin'
with righteousness, aren't you?

494
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:42,103
But you think you're blazing like suns,

495
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:46,549
when really you're burning like matchsticks
in the face of the darkness.

496
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:47,826
You havin' fun?

497
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,348
l hope my boys haven't worn you out.
l need you fit for when l purify you.

498
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:54,822
Save the sermon, padre.
l heard you have something of mine.

499
00:35:54,912 --> 00:35:57,710
Well, l do now.

500
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:02,229
You liked my message, did you?
l ruined a perfectly good knife on that girl.

501
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:05,987
Got her soiled blood all over the place.
l may need to get a new truck.

502
00:36:06,392 --> 00:36:08,587
So you're the Slayer.

503
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:12,267
The Slayer. The strongest, the fastest,

504
00:36:12,352 --> 00:36:16,903
the most aflame with that
most precious invention of all mankind -

505
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:19,381
the notion of goodness.

506
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:24,429
The Slayer must indeed be powerful.

507
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,701
So, what else you got?

508
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:50,187
<i>(Kennedy)</i> Let's go!

509
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:55,185
Kennedy!

510
00:36:57,992 --> 00:37:01,905
Miss, you have your own problems
you should be worried about.

511
00:37:12,552 --> 00:37:14,747
<i>(Caleb)</i> Oh, good. There's more of you.

512
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:18,021
Buffy!

513
00:37:20,912 --> 00:37:23,984
You're the other one, aren't you?
Your Cain to her Abel.

514
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:26,825
No offence meant to Cain, of course.

515
00:37:33,232 --> 00:37:36,429
- Never was much for the Good Book.
- Oh, it has its moments.

516
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:41,108
Paul had some good stuff,
but overall l find it a tad complicated.

517
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,465
l like to keep things simple.

518
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:47,628
Good folk, bad folk.

519
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:52,507
Clean folk, dirty folk.

520
00:37:55,352 --> 00:37:56,501
No!

521
00:37:57,072 --> 00:37:58,425
Yes.

522
00:37:58,512 --> 00:38:03,586
Xander, get them outta here.
We have to retreat. Do it.

523
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:22,109
What can l say? l work in mysterious ways.

524
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:29,423
Also some fairly straightforward ones.

525
00:38:37,112 --> 00:38:39,387
We are leaving.

526
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:43,150
Are you OK?

527
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:45,223
Let's go. Come on.

528
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:48,223
Let's go! Come on!

529
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:52,665
You're the one who sees
everything, aren't you?

530
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:55,220
Let's see what we can't do about that.

531
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,583
Argh!

532
00:38:59,112 --> 00:39:01,103
Xander!

533
00:39:01,752 --> 00:39:03,344
Come on.

534
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:19,145
<i>(Caleb) Now, it's a simple story.</i>
<i>Stop me if you've heard it.</i>

535
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:23,271
<i>l have found and truly believe</i>
<i>that there is nothing so bad</i>

536
00:39:23,352 --> 00:39:26,424
<i>it cannot be made better with a story.</i>

537
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:33,230
<i>And this one's got a happy endin'.</i>

538
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:39,504
<i>There once was a woman,</i>
<i>and she was foul, like all women,</i>

539
00:39:39,592 --> 00:39:42,504
<i>for Adam's rib was dirty,</i>
<i>just like Adam himseIf,</i>

540
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,867
<i>for what was he but human?</i>

541
00:39:48,872 --> 00:39:53,741
<i>But this woman, she was filled</i>
<i>with darkness, despair...</i>

542
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:58,906
<i>And why? Because she did not know.</i>
<i>She could not see.</i>

543
00:39:58,992 --> 00:40:04,020
She didn't know the good news,
the glory that was comin'.

544
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:05,511
That'd be you.

545
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:11,269
For the kingdom, the power,
and the glory are yours, now and forever.

546
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:14,910
You show up, they'll get in line,

547
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:17,108
<i>cos they followed her.</i>

548
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:22,585
<i>All they have to do is take</i>
<i>one more step, and l'll kill them all.</i>

549
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:26,108
<i>See? l told you it had a happy endin'.</i>
