on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,234
- Why won't you sleep with me again?
- I don't love you.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,279
- Hey. Clothes.
- Better not get used to 'em.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,152
Yes, ma'am.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,554
Say good night, bitch.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,352
Good night, bitch.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,515
- Don't do...
- I'm gonna make you feel it.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,789
Stop!

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,191
Ask me again why I can never love you.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,357
Get nice and comfy, Slayer. I'll be back.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,075
And when I am... things are gonna change.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,911
You think you can do that to me? You think
I'd let you get away with that? Think again.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,150
Tara?

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,191
Tara?! Baby?

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,673
Buffy?

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,233
No!

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,920
She's in the back. This way.

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,388
- She was shot in the chest.
- Accidental?

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,478
No, no, it was a...
He was trying to kill her.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,436
Oh, God! Oh, no! Please!

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,516
Please, come on!

23
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,954
Come on, Tara!

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,640
Please, come on, baby.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,035
By Osiris...

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,630
I command you, bring her back.

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,614
Pulse is 100 and weak. Lung sounds are wet.

28
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:22,239
What does that mean? Is she gonna...?

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,195
You need to stand back, OK? If you want us
to help her out we need some space.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,912
Hear me, keeper of darkness!

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,272
Witch, how dare you
invoke Osiris in this task?

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,834
Please. Please bring her back.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,033
You may not violate the laws
of natural passing.

34
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,151
How? How is this natural?

35
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,637
It is a human death by human means.

36
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,756
You raised one killed by mystical forces.
This is not the same.

37
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,034
She is taken by natural order. It is done.

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,438
- No! There has to be a way!
- It is done!

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,757
No!

40
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,640
Sunnydale Memorial, do you copy? We have
a Caucasian female, 21. GSW to the chest.

41
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,638
Buff, hang on.
We're gonna get you to the hospital.

42
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,196
- Willow. My God, are you OK?
- How did this happen?

43
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,834
- Warren, he had a gun.
- Warren.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,151
It went down too fast. I couldn't stop it.

45
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,350
Hey.

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,708
Will!

47
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,996
Sir, we have to go.
Are you coming with us or not?

48
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,469
Think they'll let my aunt
bring me my Discman?

49
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,720
That's what you're worried about?
In-flight entertainment? We're in jail.

50
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,274
We're in custody.
We haven't been charged yet.

51
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,517
Thank you, Dragnet.
It doesn't matter what they call it.

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,552
They got us, OK? We're goin' down.

53
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,479
That guy's been lookin' at me.

54
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,797
I think he wants to make me his butt monkey.

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,513
Don't flatter yourself.
He's in here for parking tickets.

56
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,632
That doesn't mean anything.
The joint changes you.

57
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,479
I hear they like the small ones
with little hands.

58
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,317
You have got to chill out.
This isn't Oz. It's, like, Mayberry.

59
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,352
Besides, Warren is gonna get us out of here.

60
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,755
I'm sure he'll be bustin' us out any minute.

61
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,632
He will. He's coming up with a plan.

62
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,036
Like WarGames. Remember that decoder
Matthew Broderick used?

63
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,790
Oh, yeah. That was rad. The one he made
from the scissors and the tape recorder.

64
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,876
I miss Ferris Matthew.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,798
Broadway Matthew... I find him cold.

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,558
Really? No, I...

67
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,636
Shut up!

68
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,269
Nobody's coming to get us,
not even your aunt

69
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,631
- who won't return your one phone call.
- She must be out of town.

70
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,675
She doesn't care. And neither does
your partner in crime Warren.

71
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,713
Don't say that. What do you mean,
my partner in crime? We're in this together.

72
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,716
What do you mean, what do I mean? You two
were totally gonna leave me holding the bag.

73
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,594
- We weren't. I was... going to carry you.
- No.

74
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,232
You two were setting me up, and then
Warren was gonna screw you over too.

75
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,557
- That is so not true.
- Sure.

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,114
He's a nice murderer who keeps his word.

77
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,231
You're wrong.

78
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,400
He's coming for us.

79
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,195
He's out there right now devising a
brilliant way to get us out of here.

80
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,876
Whisky. Straight up. And get a round
for the house. I'm feelin' expansive.

81
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,232
Hey.

82
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,153
- Bet you don't get a lot of humans in...
- I'm watching my programme.

83
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,287
Wouldn't interrupt your me time.

84
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:10,115
Not even to buy the guy who
killed the Slayer a drink.

85
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,236
- What's that?
- I took her out myself.

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,035
I've been heading an organisation -
the Trio - you've heard of us.

87
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,954
No.

88
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,756
Not important. I cut them loose.

89
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,270
I figure now Buffy's out of the picture
some things have got to change.

90
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,994
I need a real gang.
Not a couple of wannabes.

91
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,035
- And you killed the Slayer?
- With these hands.

92
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,515
- What are you, a warlock?
- Funny you mention that.

93
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,269
I've explored all the dark arts -
witchcraft, demonology...

94
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,838
You name it, I tried it against the Slayer.
But you know what I found really works?

95
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,354
Gun.

96
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,556
- You killed the Slayer with a gun?
- In her own back yard.

97
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,615
Don't underestimate science, my friends.
Good old-fashioned metal meets propulsion.

98
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,754
- Oh, man, this is gonna be good.
- The best.

99
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,150
The town is ours!

100
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,829
Ours, maybe. You... are screwed.

101
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,434
Metal meets propulsion, yeah.
But you still better be a good shot.

102
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,793
This isn't the evil laugh of victory, is it?

103
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,356
More like the evil laugh of
"you're a dead man".

104
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,396
OK. What's the joke?

105
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,957
It was just on the news.
A girl was shot.

106
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,798
In her back yard.

107
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,559
She survived. She's in the hospital.

108
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,639
And Slayers heal fast. Real fast.

109
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,355
Yeah. I was gonna eat you myself
during the commercial,

110
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,711
but now I think it'll be more fun
to let the Slayer de-gut you.

111
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,646
Might wanna get a head start, my friend,

112
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,276
cos this girl's gonna be
comin' for you big time.

113
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,154
- Willow.
- Where do you keep the black-arts books?

114
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,840
Something terrible happened,
but you don't have to...

115
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,296
I need power.

116
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,032
Not with those books.
I can't let you. Willow!

117
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,912
Stop.

118
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,395
That's better.

119
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,998
Buffy?

120
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,798
Buffy?

121
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,510
Hey? Hello?

122
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,033
The door was...

123
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,037
Tara?

124
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,473
- All right, who's next?
- I am.

125
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,311
- You're new.
- Yeah.

126
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,117
I come bearing dead presidents, so you
think we can just skip the small talk?

127
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,950
- How'd you find me?
- I talked to a guy.

128
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,390
One of your regulars.
Offered to show me the way for 20 bucks.

129
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,910
Most of my customers
will bring you here for five.

130
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,794
Great. I'll file that away.
Look, I'm in a bit of a situation here.

131
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,072
I tried to do us all a favour
and eliminate the Slayer, but I...

132
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,430
I... I guess it didn't take.

133
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,078
Killin' a slayer.
That's big business for a kid.

134
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,236
I'm not a kid.

135
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,554
OK.

136
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,559
I had my own guys. The Trio.
Yeah, you've heard of us.

137
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,240
Right. What were you? A band or something?

138
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,845
I thought word travelled in the underworld.

139
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:53,074
We were evil. Robots were my thing.

140
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,876
- You didn't hear about the freeze ray?
- Sorry.

141
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,119
Why aren't your guys helping you?

142
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,437
I thought this was a
cash-for-a-service gig,

143
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,917
not an interview process. I need protection.
I've got the Slayer after me.

144
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,398
The Slayer is the least of your problems.

145
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,897
Oh, you right.
Let's talk about my skin troubles.

146
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,674
You know, I'd say,
on the scale of problems, that she ranks.

147
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,553
If I were you, I'd worry about the witch.

148
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,396
- Witch? Which witch?
- Willow.

149
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,397
The Slayer's pal.

150
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,832
She's the new power, man.
Anybody with intuition can feel it.

151
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,430
She's gonna blow this town apart.

152
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,711
Startin'... with you.

153
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,070
Me? What did I do to her?

154
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,154
Oh, OK, OK. I...

155
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,999
- I shot her friend.
- I feel death.

156
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,588
But the Slayer is alive, and she heals.

157
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,009
Yeah, she might, but somebody
is stone cold. And that...

158
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:53,990
is why the witch wants your head.

159
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,398
She can sense your essence right now, man.

160
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:01,556
It's just a matter of
time before she finds you.

161
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,993
Take it. There's that, and I can get more.
Just give me something.

162
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,597
- Hide or fight?
- Both. All of it.

163
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,231
I have a few tricks up my sleeve,
but it's not enough.

164
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,999
I need a cover and lots of fire power.

165
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,158
I can't guarantee anything. Not this time.

166
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,957
The girl is runnin' on pure fury.

167
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,868
I've never felt anything like it.

168
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,551
Thank you for the tip, Nostradamus.
Just load me up, OK?

169
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,121
Gotta stop that bleeding
by the left ventricle.

170
00:13:58,156 --> 00:13:59,552
BP is down to 80 palp.

171
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,080
Got more bleeding.

172
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,756
What's happening?

173
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,193
Leave.

174
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,471
- Willow.
- Now.

175
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,075
Will, what are you doin'? She's gonna die.

176
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,395
No, she isn't.

177
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,035
It's so small.

178
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,832
- What happened?
- Buffy!

179
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,239
- Oh, my God, are you OK?
- Sure. How'd I get here?

180
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,675
You gotta stop doin' this.
This dying thing's funny once, maybe twice.

181
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,512
- Willow?
- Buffy. Hey.

182
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,839
- What's wrong?
- I'll explain.

183
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,475
- But we've gotta go.
- Why?

184
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,319
It's time to find Warren.

185
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,970
This'll get me all the way to the border?

186
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:59,792
You'll have to change bus.
It's all in the folder.

187
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,111
- Faster.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

188
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,028
- Faster!
- Cut that out. If you wanted to drive...

189
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,754
- Stop. I don't like this.
- We're close. I can feel him.

190
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,839
We'll catch him and he'll go to jail.
I'm finding getting shot very motivating.

191
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,873
- But you're using magic.
- If I wasn't, you'd be dead.

192
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,675
Maybe. But this isn't right.
OK? This isn't how I want it.

193
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,509
- Sometimes you don't have a choice.
- Buffy gets the tiebreaker on this.

194
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,110
- She was on the ouchy end of the bullet.
- Will, you do have a choice.

195
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,232
- This isn't good for you.
- You decided to stop for a reason.

196
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,230
You promised us. Can I ask what's with the
makeover of the damned? I mean, the hair...

197
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,351
- Turn right. Go!
- Where?

198
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,198
Over there! Now!

199
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,558
- Will...
- Turn.

200
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,432
Fine. Puppet master wants to drive?
Go right ahead!

201
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,677
- Willow, wait!
- Stay back!

202
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,551
Get out.

203
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,314
Please. I'll do anything.

204
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,078
It's a robot.

205
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,749
I could feel his essence.

206
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,359
- He tricked me. We'll find him another way.
- And then what?

207
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,869
- Then we'll kill him.
- You need to calm down.

208
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,719
- Calm down?
- Look, you're angry.

209
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,195
There's no excuse for what he did, but...

210
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,392
He shot Tara.

211
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,431
When he shot you, he hit her too.

212
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,198
Upstairs, in my room.

213
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,154
- Guess the last shot was the charm.
- She's dead?

214
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,238
She's dead. Now he's dead too.

215
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,316
Oh, my God.

216
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,838
Tara.

217
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,191
- Christ. How come you didn't say anything?
- I'm busy.

218
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,550
Willow, please, just stop.

219
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,556
We love you. And Tara.
But we don't kill humans. It's not the way.

220
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,033
How can you say that? Tara is dead.

221
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,038
I know. I know.

222
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,470
And I can't understand... anything.

223
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,991
Not what happened,
and not what you must be going through.

224
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,079
Willow, if you do this
you let Warren destroy you too.

225
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,832
You said it yourself, Will. The magic's
too strong. There's no coming back from it.

226
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,030
- I'm not coming back.
- Will, please!

227
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,118
- We'll get through this together.
- We won't. Not your way.

228
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,915
- Please, just...
- No. No more talking. It's done.

229
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,638
Willow?

230
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,998
Dawn?

231
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,635
Maybe she went to the hospital to find you.

232
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,719
I left there hours ago.
She would've been back by now.

233
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,878
Dawn?

234
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,756
Oh, God.

235
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,477
I didn't wanna leave her alone.

236
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,160
Dawn? Sweetheart.

237
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,955
Come on.
Honey, we need to get outta here, OK?

238
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,709
Dawn, sweetheart? Be strong for me, OK?

239
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,310
Dawn, we need to go downstairs.

240
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,600
I don't understand.

241
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,956
I don't understand either.

242
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,435
If you can just sign this?

243
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,518
Sure.

244
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,559
Call this number tomorrow.
We'll have more information.

245
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,114
OK, thanks.

246
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,915
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

247
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,511
- So that's it.
- Have the police gone too?

248
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,239
Coming back tomorrow
with more of their pretty yellow tape.

249
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,274
We need to find Willow.

250
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,437
Yeah, she's off the wagon big time.

251
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,515
- Warren's a dead man if she finds him.
- Good.

252
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,473
Dawn, don't say that.

253
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,319
Why not?

254
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,159
I'd do it myself if I could.

255
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,748
Because you don't really feel that way.

256
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,237
Yes, I do. And you should too.

257
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,672
He killed Tara and he nearly killed you.

258
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,950
He needs to pay.

259
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,038
- Out of the mouths of babes.
- Xander!

260
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,679
I'm just sayin', he's just as bad
as any vampire you sent to Dustville.

261
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,719
Being a Slayer
doesn't give me a licence to kill.

262
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,355
- Warren's human.
- So?

263
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,678
So the human world has its own rules
for dealing with people like him.

264
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,394
And we all know how well those rules work.

265
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,193
Sometimes they do.

266
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,869
Sometimes they don't.

267
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,151
We can't control the universe.

268
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,230
If we were supposed to, then the magic
wouldn't change Willow the way it does.

269
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,439
And... we'd be able to bring Tara back.

270
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,949
And Mom.

271
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,428
There are limits to what we can do.
There should be.

272
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,718
Willow doesn't wanna believe that.

273
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,918
And now she's messing with forces
that wanna hurt her. All of us.

274
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,190
I just...

275
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,235
I've had blood on my hands all day.

276
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,874
Blood from people I love.

277
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,434
I know.

278
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,915
And now it has to stop.

279
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,436
Warren's going to get what
he deserves. I promise.

280
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,437
But I will not let Willow destroy herself.

281
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,756
OK, where do we go? She could be anywhere.

282
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,032
I don't know. Maybe the Magic Box.
There's some kind of locating spell.

283
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,119
- I could... go myself.
- No, no, I'm cool. I'll go.

284
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,038
- Dawn can't stay here by herself.
- Let me go with you. I want to.

285
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,993
No, honey. It's too dangerous.

286
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,271
But... it's Willow. She needs us.

287
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,715
She does. And you'll help her. Lots.

288
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,759
OK? But first we have to
get her home in one piece.

289
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,758
- But...
- Dawn, I'm serious.

290
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,995
You've been through enough
for more than one... ever.

291
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,671
You should be someplace
where you feel safe.

292
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,156
Fine. I want to go to Spike's.

293
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,309
- All right.
- What?

294
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,197
Is not al right. Are you kidding?

295
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:27,955
- After what Spike did to...
- Xander!

296
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,634
I'll get the coats.

297
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,918
- You're leaving her with Mr Attempted Rape?
- He won't hurt Dawn. He physically can't.

298
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,473
Besides, he wouldn't.

299
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,752
After the other night, I'd say all bets
are off for what he's capable of.

300
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,432
Dawn feels safe with him. We don't have
a choice. Right now, he's all we've got.

301
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,512
Blood of the slain, hear me.

302
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,313
Guide me to Tara's killer.

303
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,596
- John, forget this foolishness.
- Stop right where you are.

304
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,030
John! John!

305
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,994
- Spike.
- Sufferin' cats!

306
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,470
Where did you come from?

307
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:48,829
Oh, Clem, sorry. I didn't
mean to startle you.

308
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,316
It's OK. You just snuck up on me is all.

309
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,672
- I made you spill your snacks.
- Don't worry about it.

310
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,519
Like I need any more of this. Oh, hi!

311
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,675
Hi.

312
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,712
Can I get you something?
Some Country Time?

313
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,391
- We're looking for Spike, actually.
- He didn't tell you?

314
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,557
- Tell me what?
- He left. Town.

315
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,074
Oh.

316
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,112
- He just took off?
- That's why I'm stayin' here for him.

317
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,358
A sweet pad like this goes empty
for a few days, he'll lose it for sure.

318
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,471
Plus I... don't have a TV.

319
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,836
I'm surprised he didn't tell you.
He kinda left in a hurry, I guess.

320
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,112
Sure I can't get you somethin'?
I've got Bugles and liverwurst.

321
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,950
We're fine, thank you. Um...

322
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,548
But... you could do us a favour.

323
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,990
Do you think Dawn could hang out here
with you for a while?

324
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,716
I have some stuff that I need to do,
and... I really don't want her to be alone.

325
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,198
- I still don't see why I just...
- Dawn, we've been through this.

326
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,311
- What do you think?
- No problem.

327
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,871
I'd love the company.
Do you like Parcheesi?

328
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,712
- Sure.
- Or we could rent videos.

329
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,435
- I'm dying to see The Wedding Planner.
- Either way, I'm good.

330
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,834
Oh, here.

331
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,390
- You can have the comfy chair.
- I'll be back as soon as I can.

332
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,875
- I promise.
- OK.

333
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,072
Thank you.

334
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,350
- Did he say when he'd be back?
- Spike?

335
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,677
No. Only that he could be gone a while.

336
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,958
I'm not asking for permission, mate.

337
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,312
You seek me, vampire?

338
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,954
You do the finger paintings? Nice work.

339
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,753
Answer me.

340
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,313
Yeah, I seek you.

341
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,159
Something about a woman.

342
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,117
The Slayer.

343
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,949
Bitch thinks she's better than me.

344
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,153
Ever since I got this bleedin' chip
in my head, things ain't been right.

345
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,396
Everything's gone to hell.

346
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,116
And you want to return to your former self?

347
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,957
Yeah.

348
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,438
- What?
- Look what she's reduced you to.

349
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,915
It's this bloody chip.

350
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,039
You were a legendary dark warrior
and you let yourself be castrated.

351
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:33,232
And you have the audacity
to crawl in here and demand restoration?

352
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,278
- I'm still a warrior.
- You're a pathetic excuse for a demon.

353
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,038
Yeah?

354
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,392
I'll show you pathetic.
Give me your best shot.

355
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,560
You'd never endure the trials
required to grant your request.

356
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,199
Do your worst.

357
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,518
But when I win...
I want what I came here for.

358
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,996
Bitch is gonna see a change.

359
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,672
Are you feeling any change? Can you talk?

360
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,234
It's wearing off.

361
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,430
Willow put the whammy on me

362
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:25,510
and then went straight to
the dark-arts books and sucked them dry.

363
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,315
- Look, Anya, something terrible happened.
- I know.

364
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,317
Tara.

365
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,911
Willow's out for blood big time.
We need to find her before she finds Warren.

366
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,679
Is there something you can do?
A locator spell?

367
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,191
I don't need a spell. I can feel her.

368
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,236
- You can...
- Feel her.

369
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,794
Her thirst for vengeance, it's overwhelming.

370
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,395
Is that, like, left over from your
vengeance-demon days? You just sense her?

371
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,954
No. Not left over.

372
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,677
- Oh.
- Yeah.

373
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,397
- When?
- When do you think?

374
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,878
- Is everyone OK? Did Willow...?
- Got her power boost and took off.

375
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,037
Anya's... Anya was saying
she knows where Willow is.

376
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,720
- A spell?
- Not exactly.

377
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,354
Seems Anya got her vengeance on again.

378
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,315
So Willow's all wrathy.

379
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,671
Why don't you go to her?
Isn't that your gig?

380
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,115
Normally I'd have to.
But she doesn't want me.

381
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,550
- She wants to do it herself.
- Yeah.

382
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,158
Look, Anya, we don't have much time.
Which side of this are you on?

383
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,315
If you know where she is, you can help us.

384
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,431
I'll help. But I'm helping Willow.

385
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,835
She's close to him. He's in the woods.

386
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,996
Run all night, Warren. I'll still find...

387
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,231
Axe not gonna cut it.

388
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,591
Freeze.

389
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,352
That's cute. That's a cute trick.

390
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,635
It was an accident, you know.

391
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,278
Oh. You mean, instead of killing
my best friend, you killed my girlfriend.

392
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,552
- It wasn't personal, that's all.
- Well, this is.

393
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,473
Capture!

394
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,497
Cute tricks.

395
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,435
You are really askin' for it, you know that?

396
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,956
I'm asking for it?

397
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,597
I'm gonna walk away from this.
And when I do,

398
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,316
you're gonna beg to join your girlfriend.

399
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,716
- She wasn't your first.
- First who?

400
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,660
Tara. She wasn't the first girl you killed.

401
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:53,937
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Reveal!

402
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,513
I should've strangled you in your sleep.

403
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,668
Back when we shared a bed.
I should've done the world a favour.

404
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,552
- It's a trick.
- Why, Warren?

405
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,390
- You could've just let me go.
- Make it shut up. Make it go away.

406
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,957
- It didn't have to be like that.
- I'm not kidding!

407
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,958
How could you say you loved me
and do that to me?

408
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,548
Because you deserved it, bitch!

409
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,355
- Because you liked it.
- Oh, shut up.

410
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,439
You never felt you had the power with her.
Not until you killed her.

411
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,872
- Women! You're like the rest. Mind games.
- You get off on it.

412
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,673
That's why you had a mad-on for the Slayer.

413
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,392
She was your big O, wasn't she, Warren?

414
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,671
Are you done yet? Or can we talk
some more about our feelings?

415
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,518
- What's happening? What do you feel?
- She's stronger now. Close.

416
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,760
- What about Warren? Has she...?
- He's still alive. She's not done.

417
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,198
Help! Let me go.

418
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,834
Somebody! Help!

419
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,872
What's the matter?
I thought you wanted to talk.

420
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,432
No.

421
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,515
OK.

422
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
I'll talk.

423
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,073
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

424
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,350
Hey, I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry.

425
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,955
Wanna know what a bullet
feels like, Warren? A real one.

426
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,909
- It's not like in the comics.
- No. No.

427
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,388
I think you need to... feel it.

428
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,830
Oh, God! Stop it.

429
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,639
It's not gonna make a neat little hole.

430
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:43,238
First, it'll obliterate
your internal organs.

431
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,737
Your lung will collapse. It's like drowning.

432
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:47,189
Please, no.

433
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,318
When it finally hits your spine,
it'll blow your central nervous system.

434
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,078
- Please, stop!
- I'm talking.

435
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,833
The pain'll be unbearable,
but you won't be able to move.

436
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,873
A bullet usually travels
faster than this, of course.

437
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,878
But the dying?

438
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,072
It'll seem like it takes for ever.

439
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,555
Something, isn't it?

440
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,148
One tiny piece of metal...

441
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,272
destroys everything.

442
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,037
It ripped her insides out.

443
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,390
Took her light away.

444
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,636
From me.

445
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,797
From the world.

446
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,469
Now the one person
who should be here is gone.

447
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,433
And a waste like you gets to live.

448
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,551
A tiny piece of metal.

449
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,234
Can you feel it now?

450
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,076
Over there.

451
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,757
I said... can you feel it?

452
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,797
Please! God!

453
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,075
I did wrong. I see that now.
I need... jail. I need...

454
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,320
But you... you don't want this.
You're not a bad person. Not like me.

455
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,715
Willow!

456
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,799
When you get caught, you'll lose them too.
Your friends.

457
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,710
You don't want that.
I know you're in pain, but...

458
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,551
Bored now.

459
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,150
Oh, my God.

460
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,317
What did you do?

461
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,477
Willow, what did you do?

462
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,875
One down.

463
