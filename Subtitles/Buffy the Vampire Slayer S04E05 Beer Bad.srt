1
00:00:02,853 --> 00:00:05,321
Parker Abrams. I'm at Kresky Hall.

2
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:07,404
Buffy Summers, Stevenson.

3
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:10,007
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

4
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:14,043
- What are you doing?
- Making a choice.

5
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:17,728
- Parker, did I do something wrong?
- Didn't you have fun?

6
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:20,691
- Is that all it was?
- Well, what else was it supposed to be?

7
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:25,130
He's manipulative and shallow.
And why doesn't he want me?

8
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:27,250
Say "hi" to Non-College Guy.

9
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:31,167
Not that I mind, but don't non-college guys
usually populate the non-campus?

10
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:34,131
Townie, huh? You look so normal.

12
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,447
- Buffy?
- Parker?

13
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:59,681
Stay down.

14
00:01:06,053 --> 00:01:08,044
Buffy.

15
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:40,412
Buffy. I don't know what to say.

16
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:45,291
After how I've treated you,
now I owe you my life.

17
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:51,964
- It's nothing.
- It's everything. You're everything.

18
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:55,648
And I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get you to forgive me.

19
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:59,447
Do you think one day you might?

20
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:02,164
No.

21
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:14,772
These are the things we want. Simple things.

22
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:17,811
Comfort, sex, shelter, food.

23
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:20,772
We always want them
and we want them all the time.

24
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:23,492
The id doesn't learn, it doesn't grow up.

25
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:25,928
It has the ego telling it what it can't have

26
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:29,244
and it has the superego
telling it what it shouldn't want.

27
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:34,361
But the id works solely
out of the pleasure principle. It wants.

28
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,729
Whatever social skills we have,
however much we've evolved,

29
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:40,964
- the pleasure principle works in all of us.
- Really?

30
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:45,885
So, how does this conflict
with the ego manifest itself in the psyche?

31
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:48,009
What do we do when
we can't have what we want?

32
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:04,287
Buffy, I don't know what to say.

33
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:08,330
After how I've treated you,
and now I owe you my life.

34
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,728
Can you ever forgive me?

35
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,521
Rough day?

36
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:18,332
Come on, Buff, be a Ionely drunk.

37
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,652
- Rough day?
- Stop flicking at me.

38
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:28,161
Work with me here. I'm finally
an essential part of your collegey life.

39
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:30,483
No more looking down on the townie.

40
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:35,647
I'm the new bartender over at the pub.
Got my lighter, my rag, my empathy face.

41
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:40,084
- Aren't you too young to be a bartender?
- Au contraire, mon frère.

42
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:44,451
- "Mon frère" means "brother".
- Mon girl frère. Behold.

43
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:49,322
I don't believe
this is entirely on the up and up.

44
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:52,211
- What gives it away?
- Looking at it.

45
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:56,571
Well, no one's gonna see it anyway.
Now I'm the bartender. I kick people out.

46
00:04:56,813 --> 00:05:00,249
You know there's more to it
than wiping and kicking?

47
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:02,605
Mixing drinks, for instance?

48
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:06,811
I've seen Cocktail.
I can do the hippy hippy shake.

49
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:10,442
Even if I had a pretend cigarette,
I couldn't tell you my pretend problems.

50
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,808
Real ones have clogged up my head space.

51
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:15,683
Then unload 'em right here, baby.

52
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:19,168
Rough day? You wanna talk about it?

53
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:23,652
- Shutting up now.
- I'm pregnant by my stepbrother,

54
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:27,851
who'd rather be with my best friend,
and he's left me with no place to live,

55
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:31,721
no food - except for this bottle
of Wild Turkey which I drank all up.

56
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:36,764
That was me being tanked
and friendless for ya.

57
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:39,765
- Gets my Oscar nod.
- You know what? It's class time.

58
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:44,242
- Are you gonna come by tonight, to the pub?
- Oz. Bronze. Date.

59
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:49,723
You know, maybe...
maybe he's just having trouble dealing.

60
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:53,806
I mean, don't guys sometimes
keep the girls they really, really like

61
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:58,648
inside these deep little brain-fantasy
bubbles where everything's perfect?

62
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,567
- I mean, they do that, right?
- How's the fugue state coming along?

63
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,850
- Parker.
- Maybe I'm in his bubble,

64
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:09,846
and pretty soon, he'll realise
that he wants more than just Bubble Buffy

65
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:13,972
and he'll pop me out
and we'll go to dinner and...

66
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,806
It could happen, right?

67
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:20,772
Buffy, that is my best friend,
you need to think about not-Parker.

68
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:27,292
He's no good. There are men, better men,
wherein the mind is stronger than the penis.

69
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:30,248
Nothing can defeat the penis.

70
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:33,768
Too loud and very unseemly.

71
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:39,528
I mean, I'm sorry to be so coarse,
but I feel strongly about stinky Parker man.

72
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:42,044
He can be really sweet.

73
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:45,967
I think that he has intimacy problems
because of the death of his father.

74
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:49,284
Not interested. You got troubles,
tell 'em to the bartender.

75
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:51,728
The bartender's always ready to listen.

76
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:55,802
- What? What?
- For the last time, a pitcher of beer.

77
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:59,044
OK. And you had a rum and Coke,
and you had a Poker's Light.

78
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:02,648
And a vodka on the rocks.
And a water. Is that right?

79
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,724
- Do I have to write it down?
- A cold ale.

80
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:07,452
- A glass of iced water.
- A lager, a white wine

81
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,364
- and a daiquiri.
- A simple request.

82
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:12,013
Iced water. Do you want that on the rocks?

83
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:42,247
- Oh, Riley. So sorry.
- It's OK. You know, most people go around.

84
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,087
I'm not saying you can't tunnel through me,
but the other way is quicker.

85
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:49,210
In my defence, you do take up a lot of space.

86
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:51,284
I do. I'm ungainly.

87
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:54,883
You looking for someone?

88
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,887
I just saw Parker over there.

89
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:04,493
Right. Parker and his latest conquest. That
boy should have his attention span checked.

90
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:06,962
He's kind of a girl chaser, huh?

91
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,044
Sets 'em up and knocks 'em down.

92
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:14,002
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but my father
says if you wanna be a gentleman, you...

93
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,732
don't even care what my father says.

94
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:20,089
I'm sorry. What?

95
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:26,009
Forget about it. You know, I've got some
people waiting. I'll see you in class, right?

96
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:45,607
- Rough day?
- No, it's been super.

97
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:49,841
We accepted Melody's pledge and
made her a sister of Beta Delta Gamma.

98
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:53,164
And our pins arrived today.
I designed it myself.

99
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,967
You are so sharp.

100
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:59,284
Hey, Paula. You keeping
this fine bartender from his duty?

101
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,729
- A man's gotta make a living.
- It's all right.

102
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:05,566
So the guys and l, we're celebrating...

103
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:09,441
I said it's all right. I'm due for a break.

104
00:09:10,813 --> 00:09:14,010
So what were you discussing?
Maybe we can all join.

105
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,086
- Be nice.
- What?

106
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,763
- Forget it.
- No, no. I rudely interrupted.

107
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:23,323
It sounds like the two of you were having
quite the meeting of minds.

108
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:29,010
Debating the geopolitical ramifications
of bioengineering? You have a take on that?

109
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,564
I've got beer. You want some beer?

110
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:36,404
Yeah. A pitcher of Black Frost.

111
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:41,082
I think we have a perfect venue here
for conducting a little sociometry.

112
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:44,529
A bipolar continuum
of attraction and rejection.

113
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:50,961
Now, given your socioeconomic statuses,
I foresee a B rejects A dyad.

114
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,453
I'm sorry, let me clarify.

115
00:09:55,533 --> 00:10:00,732
You see, we are the future of this country
and you keep the bowl of peanuts full.

116
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:06,410
We are what these girls want.
And four glasses.

117
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:11,443
How's about I see some ID?
You're not getting a drop until...

118
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,728
Just give him a beer.

119
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,843
Thanks.

120
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:30,448
Buffy?

121
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:34,213
Rough day?

122
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:36,329
Wanna tell me about it?

123
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:43,808
It's just Parker's problem with intimacy
turns out to be that he can't get enough of it.

124
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:47,766
And I knew it. I knew what he was.

125
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:54,447
If he were tied and gagged and left in a cave
that vampires happen to frequent,

126
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,843
it wouldn't really be like I killed him, really.

127
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,003
- Buffy.
- I'm a slut.

128
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,811
- No.
- Idiot.

129
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:04,453
No. You gotta stop being so hard on...

130
00:11:05,973 --> 00:11:08,407
Sorry. So sorry.

131
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,928
I'm better. This has helped.

132
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,129
Do not go anywhere.

133
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:29,562
I am so sorry. I just...
I seem to be bumping into people today.

134
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:31,723
I can't imagine anybody minding.

135
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:35,447
You're not thinking of leaving, are you?

136
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:40,288
We have a very strict policy against you
leaving. At least until you've had a drink.

137
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:45,811
Yeah. What my friend's just saying is,
you shouldn't be sad and alone right now.

138
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:50,409
I mean, you're a very beautiful girl
who should be covered with men.

139
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,563
And could we be those men?

140
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:56,083
It's on us.

141
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,568
Hey. You got a table.

142
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:27,609
- I had to kill a man.
- Well, it's a really good table.

143
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:32,728
I copied out my notes for psych
since you were so elsewhere this morning.

144
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:37,091
- Thanks.
- It's really pretty simple stuff. You know...

145
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:41,170
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

146
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,483
I feel...

147
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:45,928
It's nothing.

148
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,763
We could go back to your place.
I could make you soup.

149
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:25,851
No. That's OK, I'm fine. Thanks.

150
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,368
Do you know her?

151
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:43,573
Veruca? No. I know their drummer.
He's cool. I've never heard them play.

152
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,482
Chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

153
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:18,006
What modern-day pundits fail to realise

154
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:23,042
is all the socioeconomic and psychological
problems inherent in modern society

155
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:28,082
can be solved by the judicious
application of way too much beer.

156
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:30,926
Black Frost is the only beer.

157
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,208
My mother always said beer is evil.

158
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:36,332
Evil, good. These are moral absolutes

159
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:40,804
that predate the fermentation
of malt and fine hops.

160
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,963
See...

161
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:45,886
- Wait, where was I?
- I'm really not sure.

162
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,203
- Well, Thomas Aquinas...
- No.

163
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:52,684
- There will be no Thomas Aquinas here.
- Keep your theology of Providence, fat boy.

164
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:55,241
- I was just drawing a parallel...
- Beer.

165
00:14:55,333 --> 00:15:00,282
Had morality developed under the influence
of beer, there would be no good or evil.

166
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:04,082
There would be "kinda nice"
and "pretty cool".

167
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:06,969
Everything would be different.

168
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:11,285
- You guys love to hear yourselves speak.
- We're losing her, guys.

169
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:13,682
- Be interesting.
- Tell us about yourself.

170
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:19,166
- Yeah. What do you like?
- Well, I don't hate this, for a start.

171
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,724
Yep.

172
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:25,722
"My name's Veruca. I'm in a band."

173
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:28,686
"I'm Oz. I'm in a band, too."

174
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:30,764
"And this is Willow."

175
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:33,413
"How fun. A groupie."

176
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:35,844
Groupie.

177
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:41,485
Buff, have you heard of this Veruca chick?
Dresses like Faith, voice like an albatross.

178
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:46,806
TV is a good thing. Bright colours. Music.

179
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:50,651
Tiny little people.

180
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:54,447
What have you done with Buffy?

181
00:15:55,973 --> 00:16:01,525
I'm suffering the afterness
of a bad night of badness.

182
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,443
You didn't? Not with Parker again?

183
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:08,925
No, with four really smart guys.

184
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:11,004
Four?

185
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,848
Buffy, are you OK?

186
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,493
I mean, do you wanna talk about it?

187
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:22,446
I went to see Xander.

188
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,649
Then I saw Parker.

189
00:16:25,773 --> 00:16:28,241
Then came beer.

190
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,769
And then group sex?

191
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:33,044
Gutterface. No.

192
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:36,091
Just lots and lots of beer.

193
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:40,209
It's nice. Foamy.

194
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:42,363
Comforting.

195
00:16:42,453 --> 00:16:44,523
It's beer.

196
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:49,368
Drowning your troubles
over Parker. Mind-Frying Man.

197
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:55,491
He deserves a torturous
and slow death by spider bites.

198
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:59,646
Well, for today we'll just have
to throw spitballs at his neck in class.

199
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:02,124
OK.

200
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:11,366
But getting dressed would be fun, too.

201
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:20,364
Next class, we'll move on
to personality types and disorders.

202
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:23,729
For those of you who have
done the reading, you already know...

203
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:26,168
- Yes?
- She read the reading.

204
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:31,252
Well then, she'll have
some time on her hands.

205
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,848
As I was saying, we won't
be able to cover it all in class.

206
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:39,445
But that doesn't mean it isn't worth
knowing, or that it won't be on the midterm.

207
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,445
Now, if I've been unclear
in any way, speak now.

208
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:46,403
- Buffy.
- Now, before you go

209
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:49,405
- get the worksheet from the TA.
- Buffy, are you OK?

210
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:53,805
- Based on that, choose three essay titles...
- Sure. Why wouldn't I be?

211
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,202
It's good. Mm, good. Enough.

212
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:39,443
No. More is good.

213
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:42,605
Yeah. Foamy.

214
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:46,606
You should come to our class
on big thinking. It's good.

215
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,486
Yeah.

216
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:55,290
Boy, I'm having the worst day.

217
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,682
You got a light?

218
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:04,005
- I like girls.
- You stupid.

219
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:07,364
- No, you stupid.
- No, you stupid.

220
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,722
Smelly head.

221
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:27,688
Willow. Hey.

222
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:33,762
- I tried calling.
- Yeah, I've been at the library.

223
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:36,413
- How are you feeling?
- What do you mean?

224
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:39,883
- Well, you weren't in class. Again.
- Band was practising.

225
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,726
- Hey, Shy's playing again tonight.
- Shy?

226
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,522
Yeah, Veruca's band.
And they asked me to sit in with them.

227
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:51,125
- It would be kinda cool if you were there.
- Two Veruca shows in two nights?

228
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:54,250
Are you sure you wanna share your groupie?

229
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,325
I think I'm just gonna study,
cos of the fun.

230
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:02,602
Yeah, I guess I could see how
it'd be dull for ya.

231
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,888
See ya.

232
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,924
Yeah.

233
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,442
You stupid.

234
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,093
No, you stupid.

235
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:23,164
No, you.

236
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:32,084
You.

237
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:49,244
It sings.

238
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:53,530
- Like it.
- It's time to go home, Buffy.

239
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:57,451
Want more singing. Want more beer.

240
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,524
No, I've cut you off.

241
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,484
Did it hurt?

242
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:04,564
Out you go.

243
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:08,571
Want beer. Like beer. Beer good.

244
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:12,532
Beer bad. Bad, bad beer.

245
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:17,607
What the hell am I saying?
Buffy, go home and go to bed.

246
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:21,727
- Say "bye".
- Bye.

247
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,524
Bye.

248
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,684
Where girl go?

249
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,724
Hey.

250
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,528
- Did you want something?
- Yes.

251
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:11,085
I want to give you a piece of my mind.
I'm tired of you men and your man-ness.

252
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:17,769
Buffy's really hurting right now.
In fact, she's in need of a big mental tidy.

253
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,963
Parker, how could you do this to her?

254
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:27,567
- I don't get what you mean. What did I do?
- She shared something intimate with you.

255
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:32,602
And you act like it's nothing more
than a bag of some kind of sack food.

256
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:40,009
Willow, I'm not sure I need to explain my
actions here, but if that's what you want...

257
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:44,006
Yes, followed by an admission
of undeniable guilt. But go on.

258
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:52,972
Some relationships centre
on a deep emotional tie.

259
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:55,726
Or a Ioyal friendship. Or something.

260
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:59,442
But most are just two people
passing through life,

261
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:02,889
enriching or aggravating
each other's lives briefly.

262
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,889
Go on.

263
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:11,052
Just for one night,
can't two people who feel an attraction

264
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:14,205
come together
and create something wonderful?

265
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,682
Then go back to their lives,
better for it,

266
00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:21,369
but never overanalysing it
or wanting it to be more than it was?

267
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:26,447
I have. She should too.

268
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:37,768
People like Buffy, and me, assume that
intimacy means friendship and respect.

269
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:42,486
People shouldn't have to ask first: "Are you
gonna be eyeing other prospects tomorrow?"

270
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:45,724
People shouldn't have
to preface casual sex with:

271
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:50,132
"Just so you know,
I'll never grow any older with you."

272
00:23:53,053 --> 00:23:55,248
It takes the fire out of it.

273
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,244
Maybe.

274
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:08,845
Willow, I don't regret what happened.
Or what we did.

275
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:15,331
But I am sorry that Buffy's hurting, and if I
misled her, I'm sorry for that. I didn't mean to.

276
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:21,522
I'm impressed that
you care so much about her.

277
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,811
You're a good friend.

278
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:38,886
All right, time to pay up and go home, guys.

279
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:59,442
Let's see, I'll take this one and this one.

280
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:03,801
And, you know, I've always had
a problem calculating the tip.

281
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:07,522
You guys being so dapper of brain,
maybe you can help me out.

282
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:14,246
OK, great. See, if your bill comes to $38

283
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:19,691
and generally people tip what,
approximately 30°% ?

284
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,764
That makes your tip what?

285
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:30,121
You are so smart.

286
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:32,644
This is so the right amount.

287
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:36,925
Somebody didn't have their fibre today.

288
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:42,123
Are you all right in there?

289
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:46,689
Buddy?

290
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:03,482
- Oh, God.
- Let's get outta here.

291
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:37,852
Easy. We're cool.

292
00:26:42,573 --> 00:26:44,529
Help. Oh, God.

293
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:52,882
Fire bad.

294
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:54,691
Fire... fire pretty.

295
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:57,003
Fire angry.

296
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:05,812
Jack? Jack?

297
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:08,612
We got a problem. The guys, they...

298
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:13,411
They're... Some of your patrons
are turning into cavemen.

299
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:16,291
They had it coming.

300
00:27:58,373 --> 00:28:01,843
I've been taking abuse
from snot-nosed kids for 20 years.

301
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:06,882
They're always in here with their snotty
attitudes, drinking their fruity microbrews,

302
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:09,965
spouting some philosophy
like it means a damn thing.

303
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:12,772
- Thinking they're different than us.
- They are now.

304
00:28:12,853 --> 00:28:16,607
They ain't. That's the great thing about beer.
It makes all men the same.

305
00:28:16,693 --> 00:28:19,765
Why are we talking about beer?
The guys are...

306
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:23,532
The beer.

307
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:26,571
Neat, huh? My brother-in-law's a warlock.
He showed me how.

308
00:28:26,653 --> 00:28:30,282
No. No neat. I served them that beer.

309
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:32,364
I served Buffy that beer.

310
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:37,606
How much beer does a person need to
consume before they start questing for fire?

311
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:39,729
Relax. It'll wear off in a day or so.

312
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:42,043
In a day or so someone can get killed.

313
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,203
You're a bad, bad man.

314
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:19,284
I didn't see him. Is he OK?

315
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:50,206
- I cut her off. She didn't drink as much.
- I can't believe you served Buffy that beer.

316
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,602
- I didn't know it was evil.
- You knew it was beer.

317
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:56,368
Excuse me, Mr "I spent the '60s in
an electric Kool-Aid funky Satan groove".

318
00:29:56,453 --> 00:29:58,444
Early '70s, and you should know better.

319
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:03,049
I'm not the dad of her. Buffy's a grown-up.
She's intelligent enough to...

320
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:19,769
Parker bad.

321
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:25,002
I don't mean this in a bragging way,
but I do get to know a lot of women.

322
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:29,012
Well, getting to know people is good.

323
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:35,251
But I haven't found "the one" yet.

324
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:40,043
I've yet to find a girl that
I can just, you know, sit with,

325
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:44,172
feeling totally at ease,
spewing whatever's on my mind.

326
00:30:44,253 --> 00:30:46,767
Or even sit with comfortably in silence.

327
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:52,047
Willow, can I tell you
something kind of private?

328
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:57,485
OK. I mean, I feel you've
shown me a perspective

329
00:30:57,573 --> 00:31:02,488
I hadn't really thought much about before.

330
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:04,882
What is it you wanted to tell me?

331
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,564
Just... that...

332
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:13,526
I've enjoyed talking with you -
here, tonight.

333
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:18,044
Me, too. I mean, with you.

334
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:23,692
You know,
I'm wondering something. About you.

335
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,803
What?

336
00:31:26,893 --> 00:31:29,123
Just how gullible do you think I am?

337
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:33,248
I mean, with your gentle eyes
and your shy smile

338
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:36,405
and your ability to talk openly only to me?

339
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:40,442
- You're unbelievable.
- What?

340
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:45,812
This isn't sharing. This isn't connecting.
It's the pleasure principle.

341
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:48,282
That's right, I got your number, Id Boy.

342
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:52,208
All you're thinking about is how
long before you can jump on my bones.

343
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:56,206
- Look, if you think that I'm...
- I mean, you men. It's all about the sex.

344
00:31:56,293 --> 00:32:01,162
You find a woman, drag her to your den, do
whatever's necessary as long as you get sex.

345
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,086
Men haven't changed since the dawn of time.

346
00:32:08,613 --> 00:32:10,683
See?

347
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:22,602
Fascinating, really.

348
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,608
Want people.

349
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:41,684
Where people go?

350
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:44,082
The TV is off.

351
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:48,522
Want. Want people.

352
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:53,687
She doesn't appear to be in any immediate
danger. Maybe you should stay with her.

353
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,601
Boy smell nice.

354
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:00,968
Or perhaps she should be left alone.

355
00:33:01,053 --> 00:33:04,728
Yeah, I think we need to track down
the fun boys somewhat pronto.

356
00:33:04,813 --> 00:33:08,522
- Jack said the effects of the beer wear off.
- Beer?

357
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:12,049
- Buffy want beer.
- No. You can't have beer.

358
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:21,530
Want beer.

359
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:24,002
Giles, don't make Cave Slayer unhappy.

360
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:29,404
- Buffy strong.
- Yes, Buffy strong.

361
00:33:29,493 --> 00:33:32,405
- Buffy get beer.
- Buffy get...

362
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:37,685
- Giles.
- I'm fine. Just get her.

363
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,724
Which way?

364
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,566
Check down there. Find her
before someone gets hurt.

365
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:05,084
Woman.

366
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:08,284
Man.

367
00:34:10,853 --> 00:34:12,844
Woman.

368
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:51,964
Buffy.

369
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:02,682
Can't find the beer. Good.

370
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:07,483
Freshman girl not able to hold the beer.
Shouldn't have it. Get into trouble.

371
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:10,931
We're good.

372
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:14,926
Remember the boy? Boy smell nice, yeah?

373
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:17,481
Is there any part of Buffy still in there?

374
00:35:24,693 --> 00:35:26,684
Oh, no.

375
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:30,001
Fire bad.

376
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:11,092
Buffy?

377
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:20,046
Where the hell's Giles?

378
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:26,732
Blonde. About this tall.
She walks with a sort of a sideways limp.

379
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:33,129
Bad. Bad.

380
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:20,884
Buffy?

381
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:27,564
Stay.

382
00:38:30,973 --> 00:38:33,726
- Are you all right?
- Buffy's still in there.

383
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,882
Oh, God.

384
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:55,566
Oh, God.

385
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:58,292
Help me. I can't breathe.

386
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,522
Buffy. What do we do? Oh, God.

387
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:30,168
Did you guys have enough fun for one night?

388
00:39:30,253 --> 00:39:32,721
Yes. Please...

389
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:34,371
Buffy tired.

390
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:38,332
And was there a lesson in all this, huh?
What did we learn about beer?

391
00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:41,485
- Foamy.
- Good. Just as long as that's clear.

392
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:46,006
Anyways, I think the boys in the car
are contained for the time being.

393
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:51,611
It'll give 'em time to ponder the geopolitical
ramifications of being mean to me.

394
00:39:57,653 --> 00:40:01,328
- Whose van is that?
- I don't know. It wasn't locked.

395
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:11,650
Buffy.

396
00:40:13,373 --> 00:40:16,251
Buffy, I don't know how to say this.

397
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:24,129
I'm sorry for how I treated you before.
It was wrong of me and I'm sorry.

398
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:28,083
You were great tonight, really.

399
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:34,526
I may not deserve this,
but do you think you could forgive me?

400
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:07,286
