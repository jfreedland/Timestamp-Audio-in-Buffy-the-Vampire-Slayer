1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,046
In every generation,
there is a Chosen One,

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:10,051
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness,

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,221
She is the Slayer,

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,731
<i># Gilded ghetto</i>

5
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,110
<i># Hollywood stained below</i>

6
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,834
All I'm saying is, it's a stupid idea
to have a victory party at the beach.

7
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,937
It's officially nippy. So say my nips.

8
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,817
I think it's festive.
A party with nature.

9
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:42,642
Well, it's the team's choice.
It was their victory.

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,578
Team? Swim team.

11
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,265
Hardly what I call a team.
The Yankees,

12
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,602
Abbott and Costello. The A.
Now those were teams.

13
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,048
- Jealous?
- No! Yes, but "no" more than "yes".

14
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,920
I mean, look at that! Dodd McAlvy, last
month he's the freak with Jicama breath

15
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:04,662
who waxes his back. He wins a few meets
and suddenly inherits the cool gene?

16
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:08,312
Well, all I know is, my cheerleading squad
wasted a lot of pep on losers.

17
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,907
It's about time
our school excelled at something.

18
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,369
You're forgetting our high mortality rate.

19
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:15,697
- We're number one! Huh?
- Yeah!

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,075
- One!
- One!

21
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:32,276
Beautiful!

22
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:40,086
Isn't it?

23
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:44,385
- Yeah. It's just so...
- Eternal.

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,954
A true mother, giving birth to new life
and devouring old.

25
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:55,048
Always adaptable and nurturing, yet...

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,659
constant... and merciless.

27
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:01,429
Boy! I was just gonna go with big and wet.

28
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,387
Me and some of the other guys
on the team,

29
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:05,115
we come out here once a week
to train in it.

30
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,319
See, we swim against the current.

31
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,809
Funny. That's how I feel most of the time.

32
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,451
So, Cameron Walker,
you just won the state semifinals.

33
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,353
What are you going to do next?

34
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:22,283
I'm going to hang out with Buffy Summers.
Get to know her.

35
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:26,319
- Hey, pause that tape for a second.
- Hey, no pressure.

36
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:29,659
I just like being around you. That's all.

37
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,084
- Somebody help me!
- Yeah!

38
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:40,482
Come on, Jonny, you gotta
hold your breath longer than that

39
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:42,102
if you ever wanna make the team!

40
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164
Hey, somebody time him!

41
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,758
Hey!

42
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:52,182
Nice tat. What,
they ran out of Tweety Bird?

43
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,375
- Hey, what's your problem?
- Had it coming to you, bro.

44
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,528
Chill, dude. A bunch of us are gonna take
a little night dip down on the beach.

45
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,204
- You in?
- Whatever.

46
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,178
- Hey, let's, let's get you a towel.
- No!

47
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:07,565
Why didn't you mind your own business?
I can handle this without your help.

48
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,973
See? It's fun to hang out with me.

49
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:15,635
Man, I can't believe Buffy.

50
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:19,092
Man, that girl gives me the creeps.

51
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:45,982
Oh, dude! What is that foulness?

52
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,481
Hey, Dodd!

53
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,326
Dude!

54
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:25,300
<b>"Go Fish"</b>

55
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:32,376
OK! Good pie charts, everyone.

56
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,684
Good.

57
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:37,957
- All good.
- Thanks!

58
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,116
Nice.

59
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:44,747
Good.

60
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,461
Gage. Your pie chart is...

61
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:51,187
looking a lot like solitaire.

62
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:55,271
- With naked ladies on the cards?
- What's your point?

63
00:05:55,903 --> 00:05:58,322
No point.

64
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,185
Nice work in yesterday's meet, son.
Now, let's go for it!

65
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:11,251
- Uh, hi there, sir.
- Rosenberg.

66
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:14,547
- How's the class? Everything in order?
- Well, actually...

67
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:17,007
Great. I've been talking to the board.

68
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:20,503
We've been having trouble finding
a competent teacher this late in the term.

69
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,627
Do you think you can continue
subbing through finals?

70
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:26,485
Oh! Sure! I like teaching.

71
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:30,038
Isn't that nice?
You're a team player and I like that.

72
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:34,953
A team player wants everyone on the team
to succeed, wants everyone to pass.

73
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:37,354
Well, yeah. Sure.

74
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:41,584
I understand there's a problem
with Gage Petronzi.

75
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:45,008
Oh, good. Then you know. Well, yeah.

76
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:50,579
Besides the behavior problem, he won't
do homework and his test scores are...

77
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:52,740
Well, actually he
doesn't have any test scores,

78
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:54,741
because he never shows up when we...

79
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:57,036
I'm not interested in any of that.

80
00:06:57,064 --> 00:06:59,473
I'm interested in why,
when this school is on the brink

81
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,883
of winning its first state championship
in fifteen years,

82
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:04,957
you slap a crucial member of that team
with a failing mark

83
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:07,074
that would force his removal.

84
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:12,388
- Is that how you show your school spirit?
- Yes. Well, I mean... no.

85
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:16,849
- I'm just trying to grade fairly.
- Gage is a champion.

86
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:19,452
He's under more pressure
than the other students.

87
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:23,257
And I think
we need to cut him some slack.

88
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:28,344
You're asking me to change his grade?

89
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,917
I never said any such thing.

90
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:38,315
All I'm suggesting is...
that you recheck your figures.

91
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:42,965
And I think we'll find a grade more
fitting to an athlete of Gage's stature.

92
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,417
Perhaps something in a D?

93
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:53,710
Just like that?
He actually told you to alter his grade?

94
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:56,275
Exactly. Except for actually telling me to.

95
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,147
But he made it perfectly clear
of what he wasn't telling me.

96
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,531
That is wrong. A big fat spankin' wrong.

97
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,582
It's a slap in the face to
everyone of us who studied hard

98
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,783
and worked long hours to earn our D's.

99
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:11,323
Xander, I know you take pride
in being the voice of the common wuss,

100
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:14,445
but the truth is, certain people
are entitled to special privileges.

101
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,547
They're called winners.
That's the way the world works.

102
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,922
And what about that nutty
"all men are created equal" thing?

103
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,079
Propaganda spouted out
by the ugly and less deserving.

104
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:23,786
I think that was Lincoln.

105
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:28,135
- Disgusting mole and stupid hat.
- Actually, it was Jefferson.

106
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,475
- Kept slaves. Remember?
- You know what really grates my cheese?

107
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,149
That Buffy's not here to share
my moral outrage about swim-team perks.

108
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:38,931
She's too busy being one of them.

109
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:41,361
I don't know, a dolphin.
A dolphin in the ocean.

110
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,910
Because, you know, when
I'm in the vastness of the ocean,

111
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:49,211
it's... it's like I'm never alone.

112
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:51,911
You ever hear of a woman
named Gertrude Ederle?

113
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:57,211
No. No, I can't say that I have, Cam.

114
00:08:57,274 --> 00:09:00,321
First woman to swim
the English Channel. Same thing.

115
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:04,697
I mean, she would talk to it. I mean, she'd
carry on entire conversations with it.

116
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,445
Sometimes I do that.
I mean, once I was...

117
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,846
You know what, Cam? Thanks.

118
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:13,315
I'd... forgotten how nice it is
to just talk,

119
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,941
or, in my case, listen,
without any romantic pressure.

120
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:21,517
Hey, I'm not about pressure.
I just want you to be comfortable.

121
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:26,309
I'm comfy! I'm so comfy,
I'm nodding off, actually, which is why...

122
00:09:26,344 --> 00:09:28,586
Are you wearing a bra?

123
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,621
What?

124
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:35,490
Come on. I mean, tell me you haven't been
thinking about this ever since last night.

125
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:38,674
What I'm thinking about is that
I should probably get out of this car...

126
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,365
Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.

127
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,151
Oh, it's not me I'm worried about.

128
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,718
You like it rough!

129
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:52,322
Ow! Oh!

130
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:57,786
Oh, you broke my nose! Ah!

131
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,819
I wasn't the attacker, Principal Snyder.
I was the attacked.

132
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,948
That's not how it looked
from where I was standing.

133
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,600
I don't know what happened.
I mean, first, she leads me on,

134
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:16,069
then she goes schizo on me.

135
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,824
Lead you on? When did I lead you on?

136
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:21,958
Oh, come on. I mean,
look at the way she dresses.

137
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,533
- Coach.
- How we doing, Cameron?

138
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:26,818
Coach Marin, how bad does it look?

139
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,940
Well, luckily, it's not broken, but sure
as hell it's gonna sting for a few days.

140
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:33,694
I mean our chances of winning
the state championship.

141
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:35,238
- Oh.
- Can we still do it?

142
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:41,039
I'm gonna need Cameron back at 110%.
He's my best swimmer now, with Dodd...

143
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:44,685
- What happened to Dodd?
- That's... none of your concern.

144
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,598
You'd better hope that boy's nose heals
before the meet this Friday.

145
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:49,961
Walker, I want you to
hit the steam room, uh,

146
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:52,890
as soon as you're done here
and try to keep those sinuses clear.

147
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,745
- Take care of my boy, Ruthie.
- I always do.

148
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:59,184
And you, try to dress
more appropriately from now on.

149
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:02,541
This isn't a dance club.

150
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,167
So I'm treated like the baddie

151
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,943
just because he has
a sprained wrist and a bloody nose.

152
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,326
And... I don't have a scratch on me,
which, granted,

153
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:17,588
hurts my case a little on the surface,
but, meanwhile,

154
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:20,170
he gets away with it because he's on
the "aren't we the most" swim team

155
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,213
who, by the way, if no one's noticed,
have been acting like real jerks lately...

156
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,072
So, anything new with you guys?

157
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,257
Thank you for taking an interest.

158
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:37,790
Apparently, some remains were found
on the beach this morning.

159
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,469
Some human remains.

160
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,317
- Dodd McAlvy's remains.
- Vampire?

161
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:45,646
No. No, he was eviscerated.
Nothing left but skin and cartilage.

162
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:48,651
In other words,
this was no boating accident.

163
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:51,624
So, something ripped him open
and ate out his insides?

164
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:54,178
Like an Oreo cookie.

165
00:11:55,282 --> 00:12:00,922
Well, except for, you know,
without the chocolaty cookie goodness.

166
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:04,745
Yeah, um, Principal Snyder
has asked the faculty

167
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,782
to keep the news quiet for now, um,

168
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:11,222
- so as not to unduly upset students.
- For "students", read "swim team".

169
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:15,943
- So, we're looking for a beastie.
- That, uh, eats humans whole.

170
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:19,091
- Except for the skin.
- This doesn't make any sense.

171
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:24,000
- Yeah, the skin's the best part.
- Any demons with high cholesterol?

172
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:27,939
You're gonna think about that later,
mister, and you're gonna laugh.

173
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:19,402
OK, son. I think you've had enough.

174
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:22,766
Time to hit the shower.

175
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:30,980
Too much research. Need beverage.

176
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,898
Hey! Watch it!

177
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:38,257
Oh, forgive me, your swim teamliness.

178
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:42,760
- Loser!
- Liking the nose, Cam.

179
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:45,867
- Good look for you.
- Meaning what?

180
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:51,627
Meaning Buffy must not be
on your list of privileges after all.

181
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,887
Man, I love it
when you guys mess with her.

182
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:57,451
You're lucky I'm hungry.

183
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:59,980
Oh, the cafeteria's closed.

184
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,469
Not to me.

185
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:22,265
God! What is that?

186
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:27,891
Grape. Orange.

187
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:30,464
Orange. Grape.

188
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:01,002
Oh, my God!

189
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:04,331
Oh, God!

190
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:17,913
No, no, no! The mouth's a lot bigger!

191
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,869
And downward. Like this!

192
00:15:20,944 --> 00:15:23,611
With more teeth!

193
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:25,306
I'm doing the best I can.

194
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,966
Is that what you saw, Xander?

195
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,450
Yeah! I think so.

196
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:39,008
- Pretty much.
- Are you sure?

197
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,215
Well, it was dark and the thing
went through the window so quick.

198
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,336
And I was, uh, a little shocked
when I saw it, and...

199
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:48,135
Go ahead. Say it.
You ran like a woman.

200
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:50,966
Hey, if you saw this thing,
you'd run like a woman, too!

201
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,821
Buffy was right.
According to the statistics,

202
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:56,649
Dodd and Cameron
were the best swimmers on the team.

203
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:59,657
First and second, actually.
Which means if my theory's correct,

204
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,864
Gage Petronzi, the third
best swimmer on the team,

205
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,929
would be the next item on the menu.

206
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:09,361
God! This is so sad. We're never
gonna win the state championship!

207
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:11,969
I think I have lost
all will to cheerlead.

208
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:14,799
Raise your hand if you feel her pain.

209
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,348
If you're saying
these killings aren't random,

210
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,320
it would suggest
someone's out for revenge.

211
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:21,282
And raise the possibility that
someone brought forth this sea monster

212
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:23,159
from whence it came
to exact that revenge.

213
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,877
From whence it came?

214
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:28,532
I'm spending way too much time
around you.

215
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,934
Who would hate the swim team
that much, though?

216
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:33,613
Besides me, I mean.

217
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:36,538
- Willow?
- Jonathan!

218
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:39,618
He was bullied by Dodd
the other day on the beach, remember?

219
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:42,259
He did say he could
take care of things himself.

220
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,889
It's a good call.
You should question him.

221
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:48,474
Really? Me?
I'll crack him like an egg.

222
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,016
Meanwhile, I think swimmer number three
might benefit from your...

223
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,108
watchful eye and protection -
discreetly, of course.

224
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:59,281
- I'm on it.
- What about me? What can I do?

225
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:02,819
Well, you could go out to the parking lot
and practice running like a man.

226
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,718
So, Jonathan.

227
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:33,494
You tried out for the swim team twice
and never made it?

228
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:36,954
I'm asthmatic. I couldn't keep up.

229
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,138
- You resented it, didn't you?
- Maybe.

230
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:43,934
You hated being pushed around
by Dodd and the others.

231
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:48,684
- So?
- So, you wanted revenge, didn't you?

232
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,754
Didn't you?

233
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:55,394
Yeah! OK? I did!

234
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,974
So... you delved into
the black arts...

235
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:06,037
and conjured up a hell beast from the
ocean's depths to wreak your vengeance.

236
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:10,955
- Didn't you?
- What? No!

237
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,045
I snuck in yesterday and...

238
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:16,695
peed in the pool.

239
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,238
Oh.

240
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,325
Eww!

241
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,898
This is such a blow.

242
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,588
Sooner or later, the rest
of my boys are gonna find out.

243
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,210
How can I ask them to swim?

244
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:32,067
It's a terrible, terrible tragedy.
We all feel your pain, Coach.

245
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:37,458
I don't know two finer boys
than Cameron and... that other one.

246
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:42,272
But I know they'd want their friends
to go on and win that state championship.

247
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:44,723
It's time to think about the team.

248
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,888
Hell, I don't have
a complete team as it is.

249
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:49,848
If we don't find someone
by this afternoon's tryouts,

250
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,889
we won't be eligible to compete.

251
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,832
You'll find someone. All he has to do

252
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:56,464
is wear a bathing suit, right?

253
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,842
<i><b>(# "If You'd Listen" by Nero's Rome)</b></i>

254
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:05,941
<i># If you'd listen,</i>

255
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:09,801
<i># We wouldn't have to go through this</i>

256
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,246
<i># If you'd just let me finish</i>

257
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:18,428
<i># Stop cuttin' and jumpin' ahead</i>

258
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:23,029
<i># Yeah, if you'd just
shut your pretty mouth</i>

259
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:27,248
<i># You'd save yourself some tears</i>

260
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:38,625
<i># If you came back from the bathroom</i>

261
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,875
<i># With somethin' on your shoe...</i>

262
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:46,003
This "me and my shadow" act?

263
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:49,430
It's getting old.
What do you want from me?

264
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:52,323
Well, um...

265
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,064
It's a little embarrassing.
You see...

266
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:57,639
- I'm a swim groupie.
- Uh-huh!

267
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:59,369
Oh... yeah!

268
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:01,498
You know,
there's just something about the...

269
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:04,081
smell of chlorine on a guy. Oh, baby!

270
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,121
OK! OK! OK!

271
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:09,443
Obviously, my... sex appeal
is on the fritz today,

272
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:11,890
so I'll just give it to you straight.

273
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:15,001
There's something lurking out there,
and it's making fillets of the populace,

274
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:16,859
and I think you might be next.

275
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:19,351
Uh-huh. And you think that because...?

276
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,482
Well, it's already attacked.
It's already killed some people.

277
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,931
You're one twisted sister,
you know that?

278
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:30,381
Cam told me about your games.

279
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,930
Go find someone else to harass.

280
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:38,817
What a psycho bitch! Man!

281
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:41,769
Gotta be talking about Buffy.

282
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:46,504
- How'd you know?
- Uh, she and I...

283
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:49,670
had this thing once.
Biggest mistake of my life.

284
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:53,932
- Yeah, my condolences, dude.
- She's a real head-tripper.

285
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,900
Tell me about it. Girl acts
like she's God's gift or something.

286
00:20:56,935 --> 00:20:59,004
- Who is she? The Chosen One?
- Exactly.

287
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,568
You know, what she really needs
is for someone

288
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,802
to really knock her down
off her notches.

289
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:07,977
- Yeah, that'd be sweet. Anyone in mind?
- You're in luck, my friend.

290
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:11,964
- Just so happens, I'm recruiting.
- No!

291
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:15,840
Ah! Somebody! Help!

292
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:19,430
Ah! Help! Ah! Ah!

293
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:21,103
Get him off me! Help!

294
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,484
Ah!

295
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:35,806
Why, Miss Summers! You're beautiful!

296
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:55,475
Was that the thing that killed Cameron?

297
00:21:55,507 --> 00:21:58,180
No. That was something else.

298
00:21:58,205 --> 00:22:00,289
S-something else?!

299
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:06,285
Yeah. Unfortunately, we have
a lot of something elses in this town.

300
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,834
Good night.

301
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,622
Hey!

302
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:16,390
Walk me home?

303
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:23,696
Swimmers! Take position!

304
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:35,276
Keep the stroking up.
Alright. Keep it going,

305
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:37,227
keep it going all the way to the end.

306
00:22:37,262 --> 00:22:39,177
All the way to the end. Breathe deep.

307
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,645
Gage! You with us or not?
Come on, let's go!

308
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,828
So he spit it out?

309
00:22:48,863 --> 00:22:51,290
- I thought Angel liked blood.
- He used to.

310
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:53,169
Maybe his eyes
were too big for his stomach.

311
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,503
Or maybe there was something
in Gage's blood Angel didn't like.

312
00:22:56,528 --> 00:22:59,104
Say, for example, steroids.

313
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:01,770
That would explain
all their behavioral changes.

314
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,389
And their winning streak.

315
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,188
So maybe whatever's in their blood

316
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:07,683
is what's attracting
this creature to them.

317
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,766
Any luck researching our fish monster?

318
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,502
Zippo. We couldn't find any sea demon

319
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:14,169
that matched the description
that Xander gave us.

320
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:16,801
Not that Chicken Little's
much of a witness, but...

321
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:20,508
Oh!

322
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,796
Oh! Oh, my!

323
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:25,669
Now that, girls, is my kind of...

324
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,851
Xander?

325
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,018
Xander?!

326
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:37,230
What the hell are you doing here?

327
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:42,458
- I'm undercover.
- You're not under much.

328
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:45,849
Get out of here, before someone sees you
impersonating a member of the swim team!

329
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,019
I don't do impersonations.
I tried out for the team last night.

330
00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:49,581
- I made it.
- Really?

331
00:23:49,582 --> 00:23:52,368
Yeah. I figured I can keep an eye
on Gage and the others when Buffy can't.

332
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,680
When you're nude?
I meant to say changing.

333
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:58,778
Harris! You can flirt on your own time.

334
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,591
Okey-dokey, coachie!

335
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,623
I'm dating a swimmer
from the Sunnydale swim team!

336
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:16,857
You can die happy.

337
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,347
What about Jonathan? Is he involved?

338
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:24,837
Oh, no. He just... sort of...
peed in the pool.

339
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:26,552
Oh.

340
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,817
Oh!

341
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:38,179
Don't you, guys,
get claustrophobic in here?

342
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:39,846
I mean, what's the deal?

343
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:43,679
You perspire a lot. You can't breathe.

344
00:24:44,158 --> 00:24:46,897
Or read. I mean, I guess you could,

345
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:49,463
but the pages would probably
get all wet.

346
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,636
You gotta love this undercover deal.

347
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:09,144
20 minutes in a hot room
with a bunch of sweaty guys...

348
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,707
- Where's Gage?
- I don't know. He was right behind me,

349
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:14,235
putting his sneakers on.
But it's not the Velcro kind,

350
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,388
so give him a couple of extra minutes.

351
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:18,474
Tag. You're it.

352
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:03,108
Oh, my God!

353
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:11,282
Help! Help me! Help me!

354
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:13,713
Ah! Help me!

355
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,116
Gage?

356
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:28,145
I don't think that this
is going to need stitches,

357
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,384
but you might wanna have
your family physician take a look at it.

358
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,621
- How are you?
- I'm definitely feeling the burn.

359
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:40,992
Well, the, uh, good news is that

360
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,493
it would appear that
none of your team actually died.

361
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,432
But the bad news is...
they're monsters.

362
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:49,691
- How could this happen?
- Are you saying you don't know?

363
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:52,818
Well, you work so hard,
you start to win suddenly.

364
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:55,026
You think it's just you.

365
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:58,177
You're inspiring the boys
to greatness.

366
00:27:58,212 --> 00:28:01,317
But in the back of your mind...
you start to wonder.

367
00:28:01,352 --> 00:28:04,814
You never asked any of the boys
if they were taking anything?

368
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,140
Maybe I was afraid to.

369
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:15,608
- There.
- Dodd McAlvy: torn tendon.

370
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:19,266
Gage Petronzi: fractured wrist,
depression, headaches.

371
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:20,890
It's all there
in the school medical records.

372
00:28:20,891 --> 00:28:23,575
All symptomatic of steroid abuse.

373
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,611
But is steroid abuse usually
linked with, 'hey, I'm a fish'?

374
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:29,128
There must be something else
in the mix.

375
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:32,696
But the point is, these boys
were obviously drugged.

376
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:34,781
Nurse Greenliegh
treated every one of them.

377
00:28:34,806 --> 00:28:36,306
She must have known.

378
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:40,580
If steroids are that dangerous,
why would they do that to themselves?

379
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:42,144
They needed to win.

380
00:28:42,145 --> 00:28:45,821
Winning equals trophies,
which equals prestige for the school.

381
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,171
You see how they're treated.
It's been like that forever.

382
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:51,462
Sure. The discus throwers got the best
seats at all the crucifixions.

383
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:54,736
Meanwhile, I'm breaking my nails
every day battling the forces of evil,

384
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:56,974
and my French teacher
can't even remember my name.

385
00:28:56,975 --> 00:28:59,113
So, what's the drill?
Get Nurse Greenliegh?

386
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:00,846
Let's throw the book at her!

387
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:03,673
She probably went home for the day.
I think it can wait.

388
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,362
Xander, why don't you see if you can
find out what these boys are taking,

389
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:08,645
or at least how they're taking it?

390
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,557
- Powders, pills, syringe?
- I'm "looking around guy".

391
00:29:11,592 --> 00:29:14,434
- What about you?
- Giles loaded up the tranquillizer gun.

392
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:16,890
We're going fishing.

393
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,803
I feel good!

394
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,583
Lovin' the swimmin'.

395
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:36,806
Had some carrot juice this morning.
A little wheat germ mixed in with it.

396
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:39,884
Woke me right up.
Nothing like it, huh?

397
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:43,538
Breakfast of state champions. You betcha.

398
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:48,597
OK. So, when do we get our next dose?

399
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,548
- What do you mean?
- Who's carrying?

400
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:55,361
I need a little something
to improve my performance.

401
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,828
Give me an edge. Rrr!

402
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,945
The steroids. Where are they?

403
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:09,307
- You're soakin' in it, bud.
- Huh?

404
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:16,151
Aromatherapy. It's in the steam.

405
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:20,946
This has got to stop, Carl.
Those poor children!

406
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:23,707
What, are you a quitter? We have
no room for quitters on this team.

407
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:25,566
Do you even understand
what's happening?

408
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:28,234
- Listen to yourself.
- I'm very close to perfecting this.

409
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:30,199
We just need to adjust the mix.

410
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:35,503
Carl. You can't be thinking
of continuing to expose these boys.

411
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:39,579
They're gonna be the best.
I don't accept anything less.

412
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:41,590
They're gonna be monsters.

413
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:46,060
Carl, please. Don't make it any worse.
You've already lost three.

414
00:31:46,111 --> 00:31:48,708
Lost? Why, they're not lost.

415
00:31:55,495 --> 00:31:59,802
- Carl! What are you doing?!
- I'm just looking after my boys.

416
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,724
They may be out of the game right now,
but they're still a team.

417
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:09,120
And a team's gotta eat.

418
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:15,904
- Carl!
- You quitter.

419
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:52,854
They're absorbing the steroid mixture
through the steam.

420
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:56,265
Not they. We!

421
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:58,070
Me!

422
00:32:58,637 --> 00:33:01,074
We need to find an antidote,
don't you think?

423
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,832
The clock is ticking, people!

424
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:05,035
I wouldn't break out
the tartar sauce just yet.

425
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:08,230
It's not like you were exposed
more than once.

426
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:13,293
- Twice?
- Three times a fish guy.

427
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:14,932
- Oh.
- Whoa.

428
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:18,450
- What am I gonna do?
- You, you, you!

429
00:33:18,485 --> 00:33:21,912
What about me? It's one thing
to be dating the lame unpopular guy,

430
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:25,052
but it's another to be dating
the creature from the Blue Lagoon.

431
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:28,158
Black Lagoon. The creature from
the Blue Lagoon was Brooke Shields.

432
00:33:28,193 --> 00:33:31,000
And thank you so much
for your support!

433
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:35,650
I think we'd better find the rest
of the swim team and lock them up

434
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:38,075
before they get in touch
with their inner halibut.

435
00:33:38,114 --> 00:33:40,482
Yes. Yes, good. Uh...

436
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:44,105
We also need to know exactly
what's in this, this steroid gas,

437
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,704
so that the hospital's toxicology lab
can develop an antidote.

438
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,699
Well, I'll talk to Nurse Greenliegh.

439
00:33:49,724 --> 00:33:52,174
You're really getting into
this interrogation thing.

440
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:55,683
The trick is not to leave any marks.

441
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:59,702
On that note, I think I'm gonna go
have a little talk with our coach.

442
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:05,660
Somehow, I doubt all he's been
giving these boys is inspiration.

443
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:09,286
You got some imagination, missy.

444
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:11,324
Oh, well right now,
I'm imagining you in jail.

445
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:14,685
You're wearing a big, orange suit, and,
oh, look, the guards are beating you up.

446
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,454
- You don't have any proof.
- Tell me what's in the steam.

447
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:26,473
After the fall of the Soviet Union,

448
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:28,958
documents came into light

449
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,472
detailing experiments with fish DNA
on their Olympic swimmers.

450
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:35,720
Tarpon... mako shark...

451
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:38,993
- But they couldn't crack it.
- And you did...

452
00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:40,642
Sort of.

453
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:42,855
Why?

454
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,755
What kind of question is that?

455
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,703
For the win!

456
00:34:47,803 --> 00:34:50,524
To make my team the best they could be!

457
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,614
Do you understand we have a shot
at the state championship?

458
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:57,074
Do you understand that I don't care?
It's over!

459
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,699
There's not gonna be any swim team.

460
00:34:58,794 --> 00:35:01,368
Boy, when they were
handing out school spirit,

461
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:03,393
you didn't even stand in line,
did you?

462
00:35:03,486 --> 00:35:07,410
No. I was in the line
for shred of sanity.

463
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:13,213
Which you obviously skipped.

464
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:15,049
Get in the hole!

465
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:18,545
In! Now!

466
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:25,603
- This isn't over.
- In!

467
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:34,079
You think I don't care about my boys.

468
00:35:34,104 --> 00:35:36,967
But I do. They count on me.

469
00:35:45,183 --> 00:35:47,690
So, what, you're just
gonna feed me to 'em?

470
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:50,091
Oh, they've already had their dinner.

471
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:53,058
But boys have other needs.

472
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:58,356
No one. Willow and Giles
must've rounded up the swim team.

473
00:35:58,368 --> 00:36:01,330
- Does my neck look scaly to you?
- Well, of course it looks scaly,

474
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:03,317
the way you've been rubbing it dry
like an idiot!

475
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:05,431
I need to look in a mirror. Wait here.

476
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:08,168
But feel free to come in
if you hear me scream.

477
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:24,182
Any gills yet?

478
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:28,338
Xander, what are you doing? Xander?

479
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:31,369
Oh, my God! Xander!

480
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,959
It's me - Cordelia.

481
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:37,660
I know you can't answer me, but...

482
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:40,334
God, this is all my fault.

483
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:43,254
You joined the swim team
to impress me.

484
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,126
You were so courageous.

485
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:49,332
And you looked really hot
in those Speedos.

486
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:51,831
And I want you to know that...

487
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:55,009
I still care about you,
no matter what you look like.

488
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:58,713
And... and we can still date!

489
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:01,132
Or, or not. I mean...

490
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:04,915
I understand
if you wanna see other fish.

491
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:09,100
I'll do everything I can
to make your quality of life better.

492
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:12,081
Whether that means
little bath toys or whatever.

493
00:37:12,116 --> 00:37:15,441
Uh, Cordy? That's not me.

494
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:19,303
Oh, my God!

495
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:21,665
In you go.

496
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:26,007
Stay calm, chaps.

497
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:29,908
Either we'll find
an effective antidote, or, or, uh...

498
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:34,109
Just stay calm.

499
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:36,584
Everyone's accounted for except Sean.

500
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:38,865
I think we can safely say
we found Sean.

501
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,179
He was in the pool skinless-dipping.

502
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:46,033
- Where's Buffy?
- She hasn't come back yet.

503
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:58,407
Great. This is just
what my reputation needs:

504
00:37:58,432 --> 00:38:02,233
that I did it
with the entire swim team.

505
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:28,679
- What's up, Coach?
- Oh, Harris. Uh...

506
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:31,373
- How you feeling?
- A little dry.

507
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:34,043
Nothing a lemon butter sauce
won't cure.

508
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:38,947
Where's Buffy?

509
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:24,156
Buffy, hurry! Your hand!

510
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:30,657
Hold on!

511
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:41,588
- Pull!
- Hold on!

512
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:02,155
- Thanks.
- Just doing my part for our team.

513
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:12,099
Don't let go! Don't let go of me!
Hold me!

514
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:14,364
Hold me! Ah!

515
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:22,081
Grab my hand!

516
00:40:22,144 --> 00:40:26,431
Boys... Boys, uh, now... Now, boys...

517
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:29,284
No. I... No, boys!

518
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:40,709
Those boys really love their coach.

519
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:45,518
Let's see. I gotta take
a make-up chem test at three.

520
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:49,184
And then I'm meeting some of the guys
for plasma transfusions at five.

521
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,376
It's turned into quite the busy afternoon.

522
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:53,388
The fun never stops with you,
does it?

523
00:40:53,466 --> 00:40:56,635
Giles seems pretty confident
that the treatments are gonna work.

524
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:58,594
Well, turning into
a creepy-crawly wasn't on

525
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:01,787
my top ten list of things to do
before I turn 20.

526
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:05,231
I want you to know that
you've really proven yourself to me.

527
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,856
And you don't have to join the
new team next year if you don't want.

528
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:11,591
I'd be just as happy
if you played football.

529
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:18,366
The... people from Animal Control
have just left.

530
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:22,059
Our creatures have
apparently made a, a dash for it. Um...

531
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:23,606
So to speak.

532
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:25,673
Does that mean
we're gonna have to hunt them again?

533
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:29,469
No, I don't think so. I don't think
we'll be seeing them any more.

534
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:32,781
- Where do you think they'll go?
- Home.
