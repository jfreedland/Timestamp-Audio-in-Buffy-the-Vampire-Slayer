1
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:31,044
<b>"Halloween"</b>

2
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:33,890
<i><b>(# "Shy" by Epperley)</b></i>

3
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:38,751
<i># I don't say much but I,
but I... (love to sing)</i>

4
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:42,948
I know. Is the Bronze
so not happening, or what?

5
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:45,877
- Oh... Hi.
- Hi.

6
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:47,976
- I'm waitin' for Buffy.
- Great.

7
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:50,539
I'm supposed to be meeting Devon,
but he's nowhere to be seen.

8
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:53,739
It's like he thinks being in a band
gives him an obligation to flake.

9
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:57,218
Well, his loss is your incredible gain.

10
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:09,420
So I told Devon:
"You call that leather interior?

11
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:12,498
My Barbie Dream Car had nicer seats!"

12
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:16,605
<i># (I have) no skin left on my,
on my (fingertips)</i>

13
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:19,280
Buffy?

14
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,974
Buffy!

15
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,438
- Hi. I'm...
- Late.

16
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,941
Rough day at the office.

17
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,507
So I see.

18
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:34,574
Hey. It's a look. A... seasonal look.

19
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,940
Buffy, I love the hair.

20
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,690
It just screams "street urchin".

21
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:45,504
Know what? I need to go...
put a bag over my head.

22
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,411
Don't listen to her, please.
You look fine.

23
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,831
You're sweet. A terrible liar...

24
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,866
But sweet.

25
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,721
- I thought we had...
- A date. So did I.

26
00:03:57,756 --> 00:04:01,307
But who am I kidding?
Dates are things normal girls have.

27
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:05,043
Girls who have time to
think about nail polish and facials.

28
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,964
You know what I think about?
Ambush tactics. Beheading.

29
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:13,556
Not exactly the stuff dreams are made of.

30
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,860
Cappuccino?

31
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,934
- Hey!
- You're volunteering.

32
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,936
But I have to get to class.

33
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:36,468
Snyder must be in charge of the volunteer
safety program for Halloween.

34
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:40,135
Note his interesting take
on the "volunteer" concept.

35
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:42,015
What's the deal?

36
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,726
A bunch of little kids need people
to take them trick-or-treatin'.

37
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:48,359
Sign up and get your own pack
of sugar-hyped little runts for the night.

38
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:50,640
Yikes! I'll stick to vampires.

39
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,822
Miss Summers. Just the
juvenile delinquent I've been looking for.

40
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:58,416
- Principal Snyder.
- Halloween must be a big night for you.

41
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,831
Tossing eggs, keying cars,
bobbing for apples.

42
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,542
One pathetic cry for help after another.

43
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:07,330
Well, not this year, missy.

44
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,775
Gosh, I'd love to sign up, but...

45
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,419
I've recently developed
carpal tunnel syndrome

46
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,033
and can tragically no longer
hold a flashlight.

47
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:21,588
The program starts at four,
the children have to be back at six.

48
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:34,368
I can't believe this. We have to
get dressed up and the whole deal?

49
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:39,572
- Snyder said costumes were mandatory.
- Great. I was gonna stay in and veg.

50
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,075
The one night a year
things are supposed to be quiet for me.

51
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:46,829
Halloween quiet? I figured it would be
a big old vamp scare-a-palooza.

52
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:52,727
Not according to Giles. He swears tomorrow
night is dead for the undead. They stay in.

53
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:55,064
Those wacky vampires.
That's why I love 'em.

54
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:57,924
They just keep you guessin'.

55
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,611
- Harris.
- Hey, Larry.

56
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,916
You're lookin' Cro-Mag as usual.

57
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:17,143
- What can I do you for?
- You and Buffy.

58
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,568
You're just friends, right?

59
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:21,473
I like to think of it
less as a friendship

60
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:23,694
and more as a solid foundation
for future bliss.

61
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:27,164
- So she's not your girlfriend?
- Alas, no.

62
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,506
D'you think she'd go out with me?

63
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:34,230
Well, Larry, that's a tough question
to... No. Not a chance.

64
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:37,594
Why not?
I heard some guy say she was fast.

65
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:41,780
- I hope you mean like the wind.
- You know what I mean.

66
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,859
Hey, that's my friend
you're talkin' about.

67
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,855
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do about it?

68
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,392
I'm gonna do what any man
would do about it.

69
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:52,477
Somethin' damn manly.

70
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,568
Get gone.

71
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,424
- Ooh! Diet.
- Do you know what you just did?

72
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,984
- Saved a dollar?
- Larry was about to pummel me.

73
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:09,672
- Oh, that? Forget about it.
- Oh, I'll forget about it.

74
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:13,352
In maybe 15, 20 years, when my rep
for being a sissy man finally fades.

75
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:15,309
- Xander, don't you think you're...
- A black eye heals, Buffy,

76
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,467
but cowardice has an unlimited shelf life.

77
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,739
Oh. Thanks.
Thanks a lot for your help.

78
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:26,713
Ohhh! I think I just
violated the guy code, big time.

79
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:29,960
Poor Xander. Boys are so fragile.

80
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,972
Speaking of,
how was your date last night?

81
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:36,420
Misfire. I was late
due to unscheduled slayage.

82
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,375
- Showed up looking trashed.
- Was he mad?

83
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,785
Actually, he was pretty unmad.
Which probably had something to do

84
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,516
with the fact that
Cordelia was drooling in his cappuccino.

85
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:49,060
Oh, Buffy.
Angel would never fall for her act.

86
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,736
You mean that 'actually showing up,
wearing a stunning outfit,

87
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,748
- embracing personal hygiene' act?
- You know what I mean.

88
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:57,955
- She's not his type.
- Are you sure?

89
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,233
I mean, I don't know what his type is.

90
00:08:01,268 --> 00:08:03,443
I've known him less than a year,
and if you haven't noticed,

91
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:06,647
- he's not exactly one to overshare.
- True.

92
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:09,269
It's too bad we can't sneak a look
at the Watcher Diaries

93
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:13,079
and read up on Angel. I'm sure
it's full of fun facts to know and tell.

94
00:08:13,114 --> 00:08:17,739
Yeah... It's too bad.
That stuff is private.

95
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:22,815
Also, Giles keeps them in his office.
In his personal files.

96
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,424
Most importantly, it would be wrong.

97
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,847
- Buffy. Excellent.
- Nothing. Hi!

98
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:55,860
Yes, I just wanted to
talk to you about tomorrow night.

99
00:08:55,895 --> 00:09:01,213
As it should be calm, I thought we might
work on some new battle techniques.

100
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:04,745
You're beginning to scare me, Giles.
You need to have some fun.

101
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,243
You know, there's
this place you can go, right,

102
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,037
and you sit in the dark, and
there are these moving pictures, right,

103
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:16,148
and the pictures tell a story.

104
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:18,104
Yes, yes, ha-ha. Very droll.

105
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,765
I'll have you know that I have very,
uh, many relaxing hobbies.

106
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,855
Such as?

107
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,131
Well, um... I enjoy cross-referencing.

108
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,630
Do you stuff your own shirts,
or do you send them out?

109
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,865
So, how come Halloween
is such a big yawner?

110
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,628
Do the demons just hate
how commercial it's become?

111
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,916
Um... It's interesting...

112
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:41,794
Not, I suspect, to you.
What is it you're after?

113
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:45,507
Of course, it's of interest to me! I'm
the Slayer. I need to know these things.

114
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:49,758
You can't keep me in the dark any longer.
Look at me when I talk to you!

115
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:53,897
- I don't really have time for these games.
- Miss Calendar said you were a babe.

116
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:57,793
- She said what?
- She said that you were a...

117
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:01,450
hunk of burning... something or other.

118
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:03,350
So, what do you think of that?

119
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:05,841
Um... I... I don't, um...

120
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:08,744
- A burning hunk of what?
- Look,

121
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:11,637
You know how disgusting it is for me
to even contemplate

122
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:15,082
you grown-ups having smoochies,
but... I think you should go for it.

123
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:18,978
- Buffy, I appreciate your interest, but...
- But I've overstepped my bounds.

124
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:22,895
It's none of my business, you know?
What was I thinking? My God!

125
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,195
Shame. Shame. I gotta go.

126
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:31,907
Babe?

127
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:36,792
I can live with it.

128
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:39,930
- Man, look at her.
- Who is she?

129
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:43,826
It doesn't say, but the entry's dated 1775.

130
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:47,588
Angel was 18. And still human.

131
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,485
So that's the kind of girl
he hung around?

132
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:53,047
She's... pretty... coiffed.

133
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:55,666
She looks like a noblewoman or something.

134
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:59,618
Which means being beautiful
was sort of her job.

135
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:02,364
Then clearly this girl was a workaholic.

136
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,667
Willow, I'll never be like this.

137
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:07,402
Come on! She's not that pretty.

138
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:10,737
I mean, look at her.
She's got a funny... uh, waist.

139
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:15,116
- Look how tiny that is.
- Thank you. Now I feel better.

140
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:17,432
No. She's like a freak.

141
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:20,490
A circus freak. Yuck!

142
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:25,486
It must have been wonderful
to put on some fantabulous gown and...

143
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:28,934
go to a ball like a princess,
and have horses and servants,

144
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,503
- and yet more gowns.
- Yeah...

145
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:36,671
Still, I think I prefer being able to vote.
Or I will when I can.

146
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:42,132
So, Buffy, you ran off last night
and left poor little Angel

147
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:46,299
all by his lonesome. But I did
everything I could to comfort him.

148
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:49,303
- I'll bet.
- So, what's the story, anyway?

149
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:53,337
- I mean, I never see him around.
- Not during the day, anyway.

150
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:56,230
Oh, please! Don't tell me
he still lives at home.

151
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:59,025
Like he has to wait for his dad to get back
before he can take the car?

152
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,664
Cordelia, I think his parents have
been dead for a couple of hundred years.

153
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,499
Oh, good. I mean...

154
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:11,575
- What?
- Angel's a vampire. I... thought you knew.

155
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:15,312
Oh. He's a vampire,

156
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:20,173
Of course. But the cuddly kind.
Like a Care Bear with fangs?

157
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:24,461
- It's true.
- You know what I think?

158
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:27,915
I just think you're trying to scare me off
'cause you're afraid of the competition.

159
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,723
Look, Buffy, you may be hot stuff
when it comes to demonology or whatever.

160
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:36,319
But when it comes to dating,
I'm the Slayer.

161
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:52,672
- What'd you get?
- A time-honored classic.

162
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,145
OK, Willow. Can I give you
a little friendly advice?

163
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:59,474
- It's not spooky enough?
- It's just...

164
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:02,182
You're never gonna get noticed
if you keep hiding.

165
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:05,619
- You're missing the point of Halloween.
- Free candy?

166
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,638
It's "come as you aren't" night.

167
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:12,461
The perfect chance for a girl to get
sexy and wild with no repercussions.

168
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:16,252
Oh, I don't get wild.
Wild on me equals "spaz".

169
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:19,869
Don't underestimate yourself.
You got it in you.

170
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:23,791
Hey, Xander. What'd you get?

171
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,326
That's not a costume.

172
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:30,168
I got fatigues
from an army surplus at home.

173
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:33,259
Call me a two-dollar costume king, baby.

174
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:37,942
Hey, look, Xander. I'm...
really sorry about this morning.

175
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:40,743
Do you mind, Buffy?
I'm tryin' to repress.

176
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,193
OK. Then I promise from now on
I'll let you get pummeled.

177
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:51,791
Thank you. OK. You know,
actually, I think I could have...

178
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:55,911
Hello. That was our touching
reconciliation moment there.

179
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,564
I'm sorry. It's just...

180
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:05,570
- Look at this.
- It's amazing.

181
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:08,810
Too bulky.
I prefer my women in spandex.

182
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:12,182
Please. Let me.

183
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:16,340
- Oh. It's...
- Magnificent. Yes, I know.

184
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:19,378
There.

185
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,787
My! Meet the hidden princess.

186
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,601
I think we've found a match, don't you?

187
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,267
Oh, uh... I'm sorry.
There's no way I could ever afford this.

188
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:36,087
Oh, nonsense. I feel quite moved
to make you a deal you can't refuse.

189
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,078
Here it comes.

190
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:52,091
Rewind that. Let's see that again.

191
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,458
She's tricky.

192
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,192
Baby likes to play.

193
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:02,234
You see that, where
she stakes him with that thing?

194
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,768
That's what you call resourceful.

195
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:08,286
Rewind it again.

196
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,522
Miss Edith needs her tea.

197
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:14,674
Come here, poodle.

198
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:21,648
Do you love my insides?
The parts you can't see?

199
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:24,875
Eyeballs to entrails, my sweet.

200
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,219
That's why I've got to study this slayer.
Once I know her, I can kill her.

201
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:33,246
And once I kill her, you can have
your run of Sunnyhell and get strong again.

202
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:36,566
Don't worry. Everything's switching.

203
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:39,045
Outside to inside.

204
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:43,317
It makes her weak.

205
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:46,095
Really? Did my pet have a vision?

206
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,371
Do you know what I miss?

207
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:53,371
- Leeches.
- Come on. Talk to Daddy.

208
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,489
This thing... that makes the Slayer weak.

209
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:59,499
- When is it?
- Tomorrow.

210
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,765
Tomorrow's Halloween.
Nothing happens on Halloween.

211
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,949
Someone's come to change it all.

212
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,842
Someone new.

213
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:33,737
The world that denies thee, thou inhabit.

214
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:39,269
The peace that ignores thee, thou corrupt.

215
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:44,057
Chaos!

216
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:47,490
I remain, as ever,

217
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,009
thy faithful,

218
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,886
degenerate

219
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:53,042
 son!

220
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:13,180
- Where are you meeting Angel?
- Here.

221
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:15,930
After trick-or-treating.
Mom's gonna be out.

222
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:19,122
- Does he know about your costume?
- Nope.

223
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,349
Call it a blast from his past.

224
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:24,577
I'll show him I can coif
with the best of 'em.

225
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:27,705
OK, Willow. Come out.
You can't hide in there all night.

226
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,554
- OK. But promise you won't laugh?
- I promise.

227
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:42,170
Wow. You're a dish. I mean, really.

228
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,984
- But... this just isn't me.
- And that's the point.

229
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,397
Look, Halloween is the night that
not you is you, but not you.

230
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:53,941
You know?

231
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:55,958
Oh! That's Xander.

232
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,162
- Are you ready?
- Yeah... OK.

233
00:17:59,197 --> 00:18:00,904
Cool.

234
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:04,925
I can't wait for the boys
to go non-verbal when they see you.

235
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,912
Private Harris reporting for...

236
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:20,924
Buffy! Lady of Buffdom,
Duchess of Buffonia, I am in awe.

237
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,683
I completely renounce spandex.

238
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:26,514
Thank you, kind sir.

239
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:29,008
But wait till you see...

240
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,411
- Hi.
- ...Casper.

241
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,784
Hey, Will! That's...
a... fine "Boo!" you got there.

242
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:42,389
<i>Go ahead! We'll meet you inside!</i>

243
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,042
This is your group, Summers.

244
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:57,880
No need to speak to them.
The last thing they need is your influence.

245
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:02,236
Just bring them back in one piece
and I won't expel you.

246
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:07,921
- Hi.
- Ah, ah!

247
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:18,808
Where's your bodyguard, Harris?
Curling her hair?

248
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:30,655
Oz! Oz.

249
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:32,937
Hey, Cordelia.

250
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,917
- Jeez, you're like a great big cat.
- That's my costume.

251
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,690
- Are you, guys, playing tonight?
- Yeah. The Shelter Club.

252
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:41,089
Is Mr. "I'm-the-lead-singer-I'm-so-great-

253
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,892
I-don't-have-to-show-up-for-my-date-
or-even-call" gonna be there?

254
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:45,964
Yeah. You know,
he's just goin' by "Devon" now.

255
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:49,475
Well, you can tell him that I don't care,
and that I didn't even mention it,

256
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,476
and that... I didn't even see you,
so that's just fine.

257
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:58,190
- So what do I tell him?
- Nothing. Jeez! Get with the program.

258
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:03,127
Why can't I meet a nice girl like that?

259
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:05,547
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

260
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:07,343
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

261
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:08,936
Sorry.

262
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:12,787
OK. On sleazing extra candy.

263
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:17,101
Tears are key. Tears will normally
get you the double-bagger.

264
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:20,378
You can also try the old
"You missed me" routine, but it's risky.

265
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:22,881
Only go there for chocolate. Understood?

266
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,799
OK, troops.

267
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:28,102
Let's move out.

268
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:40,205
What did Mrs. Davis give you?

269
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,583
She must be stopped.
Let's hit one more house.

270
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:49,483
We still have a few minutes before
I need to get you back.

271
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:55,891
Janus, evoco vester animum,

272
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:59,212
Exaudi meam causam,

273
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,449
Carpe noctem pro consilium vestrem,

274
00:21:03,484 --> 00:21:07,233
Vene, appare, et nobis monstra

275
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:10,570
quod est infinita potestas.

276
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:12,597
Come on, guys.

277
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:25,568
Trick or treat.

278
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:29,369
Oh, my goodness! Aren't you adorable!

279
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:36,738
Persona intra corpem et sanguem
commutandum est,

280
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,633
Vestra sancta praesentia
concrescit visceram!

281
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:47,163
Janus! Sume noctem!

282
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,786
Oh, dear! Am I all out?

283
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:04,566
Showtime!

284
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:07,360
I could have sworn I had more candy.

285
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,113
I'm sorry, Mr. Monster. Maybe I...

286
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:17,203
No! Let her go! Stop!

287
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,706
What are you doing?

288
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,834
Stop! Hey!

289
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,658
Oh, my God!

290
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:38,725
I can't breathe.

291
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,127
Oh, my God!

292
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:09,419
I'm a real ghost!

293
00:23:11,378 --> 00:23:13,682
Xander?

294
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:19,525
Xander! It's me - Willow!

295
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,101
- I don't know any Willow.
- Xander, quit messing around.

296
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:25,080
- This is no time for jokes.
- What the hell's goin' on here?

297
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:28,418
- You don't know me?
- Lady, I suggest you find cover.

298
00:23:28,453 --> 00:23:31,380
No, wait! Oh.

299
00:23:32,862 --> 00:23:35,947
- What are you?
- Xander, listen to me.

300
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,170
I'm on your side, I swear.
Something crazy is happening.

301
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:44,779
I was dressed as a ghost for Halloween,
and now I am a ghost.

302
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:50,055
And you were supposed to be a soldier,
and now I guess you're a real soldier.

303
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,081
You expect me to believe that?

304
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:58,313
No! No guns!
That's still a little kid in there!

305
00:23:58,348 --> 00:24:01,778
- Step out of the way!
- No guns! That's an order!

306
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:05,705
We just need to find... Buffy!

307
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,398
Buffy! Are you OK?

308
00:24:12,902 --> 00:24:16,305
- This could be a situation.
- Buffy, what do we do?

309
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,620
Buffy, are you all right?

310
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:35,133
- What?
- Are you hurt?

311
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:38,177
- Buffy, are you hurt?
- Buffy?

312
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:41,499
- She's not Buffy.
- Who's Buffy?

313
00:24:41,534 --> 00:24:43,323
Oh, this is fun.

314
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:45,685
What year is this?

315
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:49,895
1775, I... believe.

316
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:53,276
I-I don't understand. Who are you?

317
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:57,947
- We're friends.
- Friends of whom?

318
00:24:57,982 --> 00:25:02,227
Y-Your dress... Everything is strange.
How did I come to be here?

319
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:05,492
Breathe, OK? Breathe.
You're gonna faint again.

320
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:07,957
How are we supposed to get through this
without the Slayer?

321
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:10,648
What's a Slayer?

322
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,957
I suggest we get inside
before we come across...

323
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:20,683
A demon! A demon! A demon!

324
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:24,864
- It's not a demon. It's a car.
- What does it want?

325
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,703
- Is this woman insane?
- She's never seen a car.

326
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:30,452
- She's never seen a car?
- She's from the past.

327
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,608
- And you're a ghost?
- Yes. Now let's get inside.

328
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:36,879
I just want you to know
that I'm takin' a lot on faith here.

329
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:39,281
- Where do we go?
- Where's the closest...

330
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:41,908
We can go to a friend's.

331
00:25:45,495 --> 00:25:48,115
- All clear.
- Hello?

332
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:51,177
Mrs. Summers?

333
00:25:51,212 --> 00:25:53,578
Good. She's gone.

334
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:56,763
- Where are we?
- Your place. Now we just need to...

335
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:03,922
- Don't open it!
- It could be a civilian.

336
00:26:03,957 --> 00:26:06,424
Or a mini-demon!

337
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:22,967
This... This could be me.

338
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:26,786
It is you. Buffy,
can't you remember at all?

339
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:31,591
No! I... I don't understand any of this.

340
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:36,374
This is some other girl. I would never
wear this, that low apparel, and...

341
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:40,150
I don't like this place, I don't like you,
and I just want to go home!

342
00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:42,977
You are home.

343
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:46,806
She couldn't have dressed up like Xena?

344
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,979
- Not a civilian!
- Affirmative!

345
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:56,232
Hey! What did we say?

346
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:03,231
- Big noise scare monster, remember?
- Got it.

347
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,960
Dammit!

348
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:14,999
Surely he'll not desert us?

349
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,320
Whatever.

350
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:21,549
No!

351
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,900
Somebody help me!

352
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:30,257
- Xander! Help me!
- Come inside.

353
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:38,066
- Cordelia!
- Willow, what's going on?

354
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:41,063
OK, your name is Cordelia,
you're not a cat, you're in high school,

355
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:43,513
and we're your friends. Well, sort of.

356
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:45,721
That's nice, Willow.
And you went mental when?

357
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:48,290
- You know us?
- Yeah. Lucky me.

358
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:51,233
- What's with the name game?
- A lot's going on.

359
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:54,274
No kidding! I was attacked
by Jo-Jo the Dog-faced Boy.

360
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:56,329
Look at my costume! Do you really think

361
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,285
that Partytown's gonna give me
my deposit back? Not on the likely.

362
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,074
- Here.
- Thanks.

363
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:06,586
OK. You guys stay here
while I get some help.

364
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:09,389
If something tries to get in,
just fight it off.

365
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:13,070
It's not our place to fight.
Surely some men will protect us?

366
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:16,337
- What's that riff?
- It's like amnesia, OK?

367
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:21,043
They don't know who they are.
Just... sit tight.

368
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:23,558
Who died and made her the boss?

369
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:34,998
Well...

370
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:39,350
This is just... neat.

371
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:45,475
You! Check upstairs.
Make sure everything's locked up.

372
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,969
Surely there's somewhere we can go?
A safe haven?

373
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,013
The lady said to stay put.

374
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:54,134
You would take orders from a woman?
Are you feeble in some way?

375
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:57,896
Ma'am, in the army we have a saying:
"Sit down and shut the..."

376
00:28:58,095 --> 00:29:01,005
Whoa!

377
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:05,777
She must be right.
We must have some kind of amnesia.

378
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:09,874
I don't know what that is, but I'm certain
I don't have it. I bathe quite often.

379
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:12,368
How do you explain this?

380
00:29:12,577 --> 00:29:18,217
I don't! I was brought up a proper lady.
I wasn't meant to understand things.

381
00:29:18,252 --> 00:29:21,705
I'm just meant to look pretty
and then someone nice will marry me.

382
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,966
- Possibly a baron.
- This ain't no tea party, princess.

383
00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:26,989
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to fight.

384
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,098
Fight these low creatures?
I'd sooner die.

385
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:33,767
- Then you'll die.
- Oh, good. You guys are all right.

386
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:36,553
It's total chaos out there.

387
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:38,355
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

388
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,871
Hi.

389
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:04,546
- OK. Somebody wanna fill me in?
- Do you live here?

390
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:07,340
No. You know that. Buffy...

391
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:11,386
I'm lost here. You...
What's up with your hair?

392
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:13,975
They don't know who they are.
Everyone's turned into a monster.

393
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:17,316
It's a whole big thing.
How are you?

394
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:21,921
Do you mind?

395
00:30:21,956 --> 00:30:23,868
You take the princess
and secure the kitchen.

396
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:26,083
Catwoman, you're with me.

397
00:30:26,336 --> 00:30:28,722
But I don't wanna go with you!
I-I like the man with the musket!

398
00:30:28,723 --> 00:30:31,662
- Come on.
- Do you have a musket?

399
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:39,038
I didn't leave that open.

400
00:30:58,374 --> 00:31:00,451
- Stake!
- A what?

401
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:02,917
Get me a stake!

402
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,097
Hurry up!

403
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:16,326
Buffy, no!

404
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:23,499
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Plus I can't turn the page.

405
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:25,944
Well, all right,
l-let's, let's, let's review.

406
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:29,632
So everybody became whatever
they were masquerading as.

407
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:34,240
Right. Xander was a soldier,
and Buffy was an 18th-century girl.

408
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:38,048
- And your... your costume?
- I'm a ghost.

409
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,567
Yes. But, um...

410
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:43,443
The ghost of what, exactly?

411
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:47,638
Well, this is nothing.
You should see what Cordelia was wearing.

412
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:52,002
A unitard with cat things,
like ears and stuff.

413
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:55,798
Good heavens.
Sh-she became an actual feline?

414
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:59,460
No. She was the same old Cordelia.

415
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:02,343
Just in a cat costume.

416
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,455
She didn't change?

417
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:07,852
No. Hold on.

418
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:11,591
Party Town. She told us
she got her outfit from Party Town.

419
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:15,303
And everybody who changed,
they acquired their costumes where?

420
00:32:15,338 --> 00:32:18,491
We all got ours at a new place. Ethan's.

421
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:27,603
- Sure she came this way?
- No.

422
00:32:27,604 --> 00:32:29,664
- She'll be OK.
- Buffy would be OK.

423
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:32,536
Whoever she is now,
she's helpless. Come on!

424
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:36,115
Do you hear that, my friends?

425
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,340
Somewhere out here is
the tenderest meat you've ever tasted.

426
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,403
And all we have to do is find her first.

427
00:33:04,976 --> 00:33:07,367
Pretty, pretty!

428
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:28,909
Hello?

429
00:33:29,284 --> 00:33:31,494
Anyone home?

430
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:36,760
Giles?

431
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:49,944
Janus. A Roman mythical god.

432
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:52,245
What does this mean?

433
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:55,174
Primarily, the division of self.

434
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:58,623
Male and female... light and dark.

435
00:33:58,658 --> 00:34:03,568
Chunky and creamy. Oh, no.
Sorry. That's peanut butter.

436
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:06,154
- Willow, get out of here now.
- But...

437
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:08,056
Now!

438
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:11,769
Hello, Ethan.

439
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:15,331
Hello, Ripper.

440
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:47,821
Buffy, are you OK?

441
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:51,745
What's your deal? Take a pill!

442
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:58,048
He's... He's a vampire.

443
00:34:59,148 --> 00:35:03,024
She's got this thing where
she thinks... Oh, forget it.

444
00:35:03,128 --> 00:35:07,890
It's OK. Angel is a good vampire.
He would never hurt you.

445
00:35:12,502 --> 00:35:16,054
- Really?
- Absolutely. He's our friend.

446
00:35:23,348 --> 00:35:27,262
It's strange, but... beating up that pirate
gave me a weird sense of closure.

447
00:35:27,297 --> 00:35:28,866
- Guys!
- Willow!

448
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:32,309
- Guys, you gotta get inside.
- We need a triage.

449
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,709
This way. Find an open warehouse.

450
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:38,110
Ladies! We're on the move.

451
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:53,858
What, no hug?

452
00:35:56,356 --> 00:36:00,009
Aren't you pleased
to see your old mate, Rupert?

453
00:36:00,044 --> 00:36:03,701
I'm just surprised I...
didn't guess it was you.

454
00:36:03,863 --> 00:36:07,617
This Halloween stunt stinks of Ethan Rayne.

455
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:09,969
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

456
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,421
Don't wish to blow my own trumpet,
but it's genius.

457
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:16,311
The very embodiment of
"Be careful what you wish for."

458
00:36:16,346 --> 00:36:20,841
It's sick, brutal
and it harms the innocent.

459
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:23,683
Oh, and we all know that
you are the champion of innocence...

460
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:27,040
and all things pure and good, Rupert.

461
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:31,526
It's quite a little act
you've got going here, old man.

462
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:34,219
It's no act. It's who I am.

463
00:36:34,254 --> 00:36:37,281
Who you are? The Watcher?

464
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:42,352
Sniveling, tweed-clad guardian
of the Slayer and her kin? I think not.

465
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:47,055
I know who you are, Rupert,
and I know what you're capable of.

466
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:51,616
But they don't, do they?

467
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:55,711
They have no idea where you come from.

468
00:36:56,016 --> 00:37:00,276
Break the spell, Ethan.
Then leave this place and never come back.

469
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:04,249
Why should I? What's in the bargain for me?

470
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:07,407
- You get to live.
- Oh, Rupert, you're scaring me.

471
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:15,377
Over here.

472
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:21,141
Check if there're any other ways in!

473
00:37:23,643 --> 00:37:25,478
Just stay here.

474
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:37,140
Oh, faboo. More clinging.

475
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:45,724
Go!

476
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:04,903
- And you said the Ripper was long gone.
- Tell me how to stop the spell.

477
00:38:04,938 --> 00:38:06,803
Say "pretty please".

478
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:14,311
Look at you. You're shaking.

479
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,075
Terrified. Alone.

480
00:38:20,575 --> 00:38:23,533
Lost little lamb.

481
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,212
- I love it.
- Buffy!

482
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:44,685
Tell me how to stop the spell.

483
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,642
Janus... Break its statue.

484
00:38:56,486 --> 00:38:59,072
Now that guy you can shoot.

485
00:39:03,368 --> 00:39:07,480
- What the...
- I'm scared. I want my mommy!

486
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,779
Hi, honey. I'm home.

487
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:26,687
You know what? It's good to be me.

488
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,979
- Hey, Buff. Welcome back.
- Yeah...

489
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:55,932
- You too.
- You guys remember what happened?

490
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:59,949
It was way creepy. It was like
I was there, but I couldn't get out.

491
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:03,110
Yeah, I know the feeling.
This outfit's totally skintight.

492
00:40:03,145 --> 00:40:05,690
You OK?

493
00:40:06,556 --> 00:40:09,003
Yeah.

494
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:15,273
Hello. It felt like I was talking.
My lips were moving, and...

495
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:18,987
Give it up, Cordy.
You're never gonna get between those two.

496
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:22,017
Believe me, I know.

497
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,325
Well, I guess you'd better
get them back to their parents.

498
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,013
Yeah. Everybody seems to...

499
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,783
Where's Willow?

500
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:58,207
<i><b>(# "How She Died" by Treble Charger)</b></i>

501
00:41:04,114 --> 00:41:06,032
<i># You got the best of me</i>

502
00:41:06,616 --> 00:41:08,451
<i># It didn't take so long</i>

503
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:10,745
<i># The things you put me through...</i>

504
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:14,878
- Who is that girl?
<i># Seemed to be so wrong</i>

505
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:16,900
<i># You took your (pride)...</i>

506
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:21,682
Ta-dah! Just little old 20th-century me.

507
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:24,329
Are you sure you're OK?

508
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:26,445
I'll live.

509
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:34,363
I don't get it, Buffy. Why'd you think
I'd like you better dressed that way?

510
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:39,896
I just... I wanted
to be a real girl for once.

511
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,153
The kind of fancy girl
you liked when you were my age.

512
00:41:43,188 --> 00:41:45,923
- Oh.
- Oh, what?

513
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:50,660
I hated the girls back then.
Especially the noblewomen.

514
00:41:51,286 --> 00:41:54,408
- You did?
- They were just incredibly dull.

515
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:57,116
Simpering morons, the lot of them.

516
00:41:57,151 --> 00:42:01,033
I always wished
I could meet someone... exciting.

517
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:06,063
- Interesting.
- Really?

518
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:10,287
- Interesting... how?
- You know how.

519
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,989
Still, I had a really hard day,

520
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,246
and you should probably tell me.

521
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:18,521
You're right. I should.

522
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:20,649
Definitely.
