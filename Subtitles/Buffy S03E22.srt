[Glass Crunching]

3
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,047
- There's nobody here, sir.
- No.

4
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:03,443
No, she'd take
the fight outside.

5
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:08,150
My Faith doesn't like
to be cooped up.

6
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:10,985
We have to find them.

7
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:13,325
Put everyone on it.
Do it now.

8
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:15,592
- But, sir, the ascension...
- Find them!

9
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,601
Faith's a good girl.

10
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:26,167
She can take anything
they'll throw at her.

11
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:28,234
She's gonna be all right.

12
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:32,181
She'll be all right.

13
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:34,774
She'll be all right.

14
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,235
- Any word from Buffy?
- Not yet.

15
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:38,008
Here's your coffee.
Brewed from the finest
Colombian lighter fluid.

16
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:40,846
Thank you.

17
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,178
Horrible.

18
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:46,280
Aren't you supposed to be
drinking tea, anyway?

19
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:48,018
Tea is soothing.
I wish to be tense.

20
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,753
Okay, but you're destroying...

21
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:52,091
a perfectly good
cultural stereotype here.

22
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:54,027
Look through the, um...

23
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:56,430
Kippler volumes.

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,695
Uh, any reference
to the demon Olvikan...

25
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,363
um, powers,
weaknesses, hat size.

26
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:04,100
- There's got to be something.
- Still battin' zero?

27
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:06,938
But I mean, uh, in Cricket.

28
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:12,013
- Cordy, what's up?
- I demand an explanation.

29
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:14,949
- For what?
- Wesley.

30
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,579
Uh... inbreeding?

31
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,123
So very funny. Any minute,
I'm sure to laugh.

32
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,149
I just got off the phone
with him. He could hardly
speak, he was so upset.

33
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:26,594
He said that there was
something about a fight...

34
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,655
and he's leaving the country.

35
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:30,393
Shall I assay remorse?

36
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:33,231
Just tell me
what's going on.

37
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:37,770
Buffy's quit the Council.

38
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,969
She'll not be working
with Wesley from now on.

39
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:45,106
- But he's her watcher.
- Buffy no longer
needs a watcher.

40
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,912
Well, does he have
to leave the country?

41
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:51,421
I mean, you got fired,
and you still hang around
like a big loser.

42
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:53,752
Why can't he?

43
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:57,385
Cordelia! We're trying
to stop a massacre here.

44
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:00,430
Want to give us a hand?

45
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:03,690
Sure.

46
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:08,962
That's just such
a Buffy thing to do.

47
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:13,367
She's always
thinking of herself.

48
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:26,853
You're awake.

49
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:29,825
You... You've been
watching over me?

50
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:38,591
[Kissing]

51
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,297
Well, we've been taking turns.

52
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:46,173
I thought... I thought
I'd never see you again.

53
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:51,810
I can't leave you.

54
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:55,443
I... I... I was wrong.

55
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,350
I need you.

56
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,548
Oh.

57
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:01,557
You mean you need Buffy.

58
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:09,765
- Willow?
- Yes. Right. Willow.

59
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,064
- Where is she?
- She'll be back soon.

60
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,079
Any change?

61
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:32,213
He's delirious.

62
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:35,281
- He thought I was Buffy.
- You, too, huh?

63
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,089
I hope she gets here soon.

64
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,653
She'd better, if...

65
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,722
Yeah.

66
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:45,635
I feel so...

67
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:50,367
- I feel so guilty.
- Guilty?

68
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,604
Well, things are so terrible...

69
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:55,838
and everything's coming apart...

70
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:58,507
and I'm just...

71
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:01,915
In some ways, it's
the best night of my life.

72
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:08,719
- The best?
- The best.

73
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:24,988
I just checked on him
just now. We're watching.

74
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:30,654
Did you find Faith?

75
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:35,756
You didn't...
She's not here?

76
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:39,370
How is he?

77
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:41,633
He comes in and out.

78
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:48,111
I think the pain
is less... now.

79
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:52,744
Would you guys...

80
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:55,446
I'd like to be alone with him.

81
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:57,580
Of course.

82
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:04,194
We'll try to find
another cure.

83
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:06,254
Thanks.

84
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,244
Buffy...

85
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:26,250
it's you?

86
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:29,310
It's me.

87
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:35,050
I didn't want to go
without seeing you.

88
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:40,865
- Angel, I can cure you.
- It's okay.

89
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:47,032
- I'm ready.
- Angel, listen to me. Sit up.

90
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,377
You're gonna live.
You have to live.

91
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:00,476
- What do I...
- Drink.

92
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:12,387
Drink me.

93
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:17,299
- No.
- It's the only way.

94
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:19,599
Get away.

95
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:22,971
- It'll save you.
- It'll kill you.

96
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,842
Maybe not, not if you
don't take it all.

97
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:28,846
You can't ask me to do this.

98
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:32,680
I won't let you die.
I can't.

99
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:35,879
Angel, the blood of a slayer
is the only cure.

100
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:37,889
Faith.

101
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:40,050
I tried.

102
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,059
I killed her.

103
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:44,118
Then it's over.

104
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:54,667
It is never over!

105
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,300
I won't let you die. Drink.

106
00:08:57,376 --> 00:09:00,004
Please.

107
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,923
Buffy?

108
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:30,929
Buffy.

109
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:41,078
I need some help!
She's lost a lot of blood!

110
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,080
- What happened?
- She needs blood!

111
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:45,082
Try to stay calm.
We're gonna take care of her.

112
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,084
Something bit her.
She needs a transfusion now.

113
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:49,086
- You found her?
Was she conscious?
- Yes. Yes.

114
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:51,088
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

115
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:53,090
Okay. I need a type
and a cross-match.

116
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:56,025
Get her on 2 lines of
ringer's lactate and watch
for hypovolemic shock.

117
00:10:56,095 --> 00:10:59,223
- Tell me, what happened?
- Something bit her.
I don't know what.

118
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:01,596
I need a rabies shot treatment.
Any allergies?

119
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,329
No. Just...
Just help her.

120
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,931
You two been doing drugs?

121
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:14,007
You want her to live,
you're gonna have
to be straight with me.

122
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,070
She's clean.

123
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:19,710
All right. Wait outside.
Let us work.

124
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,511
A phone.

125
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:25,648
Right out there.

126
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:40,672
[Man] Bones are set...

127
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:44,766
and the damage to
the kidneys is repairable...

128
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:46,868
but the head trauma, it's...

129
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:51,207
Well, it's simply too severe.

130
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:54,514
You know, it's a wonder she's
alive at all with the blood loss.

131
00:11:57,656 --> 00:11:59,590
I'm sorry, sir.

132
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:01,717
There's almost no chance...

133
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:04,194
that she's ever going
to regain consciousness.

134
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:23,438
It's your day.

135
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:28,446
[Nurse] We have another
young girl, severe blood loss.

136
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,455
Dr. Powell wants you to prep to
assist on an anticubital cutdown.

137
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:33,514
I'll be right there.

138
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,401
Oh, my God! Sir! No!

139
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:21,465
Somebody call security!

140
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:26,177
Don't do that!

141
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:29,339
I will.
I'll do that and worse.

142
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:32,474
Murderous little fiend!
Did you see what
she did to my Faith?

143
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,280
Hadn't made plans
to weep over that one.

144
00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:36,617
Well, I'd get set for
some weeping if I were you.

145
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:40,180
I'd get set
for a world of pain.
Misery loves company...

146
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,194
and I'm looking to
share that with you
and your whore!

147
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:53,137
Heh heh heh heh!

148
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:56,868
Well, heh heh!
Looks like somebody's
been eating his spinach.

149
00:13:56,942 --> 00:14:01,038
[Chuckles]
No, it's okay, folks.
It's all right.

150
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:05,140
The show's not over,
but there will be
a short intermission.

151
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,850
Don't want to miss
the second act.

152
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,946
All kinds of excitement.

153
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,049
I'll be there.

154
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:28,404
- How is she?
- She's fine.

155
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:31,637
- She's asleep.
- Well, you seem all right, too.

156
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,705
- Yeah.
- What happened?

157
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,741
When we left her,
she was fine. Did Faith...

158
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:41,007
Faith's out of the picture.
Buffy put her in a coma.

159
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,211
- And?
- Buffy cured me.

160
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,482
- Made me...
- You fed off her.

161
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,582
- Yes.
- How much?

162
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,926
- She's going to be fine.
- She won't be a vampire?

163
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,057
No. She didn't feed off me.

164
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,500
Well, it's just good to know
that when the chips are down
and things look grim...

165
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,198
you'll feed off the girl who
loves you to save your own ass.

166
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,702
You better go, Angel.
We'll watch over her.

167
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,143
- I don't want to...
- The sun will be up soon.

168
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,957
Gosh, I'm really gonna
miss him when he leaves town.

169
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,087
Let's find out
how Buffy's doing.

170
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,909
[Meows, Purring]

171
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,580
Who's gonna look after him?

172
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,089
It's a she.
And aren't these things...

173
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,127
supposed to take care
of themselves?

174
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,628
A higher power guiding us?

175
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,063
I'm pretty sure
that's not what I meant.

176
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,360
There's something
I'm supposed to be doing.

177
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,430
Oh, yeah. Miles to go.

178
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,372
Little Miss Muffet
counting down from 7-3-0.

179
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,970
Great. Riddles.

180
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,140
Sorry.

181
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,379
It's my head.
A lot of new stuff.

182
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,854
They're never gonna
fix this, are they?

183
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,892
What about you?

184
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,428
Scar tissue.

185
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,623
It fades. It all fades.

186
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,369
You want to know the deal?

187
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:50,235
Human weakness.
It never goes away. Even his.

188
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,302
Is this your mind or mine?

189
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,343
Beats me.

190
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,711
Getting towards that time.

191
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,984
How are you gonna
fit all this stuff?

192
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,255
Not gonna. It's yours.

193
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,853
Oh, I can't use all of this.

194
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,022
Just take what you need.

195
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,296
You ready?

196
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,473
- Buffy!
- Are you okay?

197
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,568
How do you feel?

198
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,910
- Is Angel here?
- He had to go.
It got kind of sunny.

199
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,315
Get him.
Get everyone.

200
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,580
- What exactly is up?
- Buffy, are you sure
you're all right?

201
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,452
I'm ready.

202
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,924
Ready for what?

203
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,219
War.

204
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,117
That's the basic plan.

205
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,250
So, am I crazy?

206
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,820
- Well, "crazy"is
such a strong word.
- Let's not rule it out, though.

207
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:30,631
- You don't think it can be done?
- Uh, I didn't say that.
I might, but not yet.

208
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,160
I personally don't think
it's possible to come up
with a crazier plan.

209
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:38,005
We attack the mayor
with hummus.

210
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,603
- I stand corrected.
- Just keeping things
in perspective.

211
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,671
Thank you.

212
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,740
My point, however is,
crazy or not...

213
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,785
it's pretty much
the only plan.

214
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,845
Besides, it's Buffy's,
and she's slay-gal...

215
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,620
you know, little
Miss Likes-To-Fight, so...

216
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,161
I think there was
a "yea" vote buried
in there somewhere.

217
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,790
I'm gonna need every
single one of you on board,
especially you, Xander.

218
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,096
You're sort of
the key figure here.

219
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,500
Key? Me?

220
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,108
Okay, pride, humility...

221
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,611
and here's
the mind-numbing fear...
what do I have to do?

222
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,614
Do you remember any of your
military training from when
you became soldier guy?

223
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,276
Ooh! Rocket launcher?

224
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,410
Rocket launcher
not gonna get it done.

225
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,148
I mean, it took a volcano to kill
one of these things last time.

226
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:29,125
Um, Buffy, uh,
all this is rather dependent...

227
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,630
on your being able
to control the mayor.

228
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:37,533
- Faith told me to play
on his human weakness.
- Faith told you?

229
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,071
Was that before or after
you put her in a coma?

230
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,005
- After.
- Oh.

231
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,873
- His weakness?
- Right.

232
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,037
Which is?

233
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,172
You know, I do
all this planning...

234
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:53,183
I'm in charge here, even though
I'm really not at my best...

235
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:58,018
Well, uh, let's-let's,
um, let's think.

236
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,058
Well, Angel, you hung
with him the most.

237
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,184
Was there something
that he's... afraid of?

238
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,347
Well, he's not crazy
about germs.

239
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,109
Of course. That's it!
We'll attack him with germs!

240
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,778
Great! We'll get him cornered,
and then you can sneeze on him.

241
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,152
No! No, we'll get
a container of Ebola virus...

242
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:17,750
and-and, uh... or it doesn't
even have to be real.

243
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:20,295
We can just get a box
that says "Ebola" on it...

244
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,729
and, um... chase him.

245
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,235
With the box.

246
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:30,636
- I'm starting to lean towards
the hummus offensive.
- He'll never see it coming.

247
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,972
- Faith.
- Faith?

248
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,273
At the hospital, he was
grieving, seriously crazed...

249
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:39,941
and not just in a homicidal,
"I want to be a demon" way.

250
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:42,382
She's his weak link.

251
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:45,819
Faith. I can work that.

252
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,913
You haven't an enormous
amount of time.

253
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:50,391
Hey, it's Mr. States-The-Obvious.

254
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:53,629
The Council
is not welcome here.

255
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:55,687
I have no time for orders.

256
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:58,233
If I need someone
to scream like a woman,
I'll give you a call.

257
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:00,292
I'm not here
for the Council.

258
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,395
Just tell me how I can help.

259
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:09,438
That is so classy.
Isn't he just so classy?

260
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:14,645
It's a start.

261
00:22:14,717 --> 00:22:16,878
So there is something
I can do?

262
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:20,089
Besides scream like a woman.

263
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:23,383
There's plenty.
There's chores for everyone.

264
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:26,053
- Okay, this is how it's...
- It's gonna lay out.

265
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:29,462
The transformation
should begin at exactly 3:28.

266
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:31,466
I'll just be
finishing my speech...

267
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:34,094
You know, it's too bad you fellas
are gonna have to miss that...

268
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,434
'cause I think it speaks
to every one of us.

269
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:38,701
I mean, heck, I've been working
on it for a hundred years.

270
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,073
Better be good.
[Chuckles]

271
00:22:41,144 --> 00:22:43,078
They'll try to run,
of course...

272
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:46,274
and that's when I need
you boys in flanking position.

273
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:49,477
- But, sir, the sun.
- Not a problem.

274
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:52,749
"Darkness will follow.
The day becomes night."

275
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:55,950
- An eclipse.
- Standard procedure
for an ascension.

276
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:58,994
- That puts me
back in the game.
- Yeah, it does.

277
00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:01,997
You and Xander are gonna
have to work together now.
Can you guys handle that?

278
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:05,228
- I'm still key guy, right?
- Right.

279
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,862
Great. Then Angel, in his non-key
guy capacity, can work with me.

280
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:10,872
- What fun.
- Hey, key guy's still talking.

281
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,431
That's good. Start bickering.
That's gonna work great for us.

282
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:15,500
You guys are like
little old ladies.

283
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,739
You'll come up
through the sewers here.

284
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,648
The important thing is
containment. I'll need to feed.

285
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:24,845
It's crucial,
in the first few minutes,
to sustain the change.

286
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:28,755
What does that mean? No snacking.
I see blood on your lips...

287
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,555
it's a visit to the woodshed
for you boys.

288
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,686
Kill. Don't feed.

289
00:23:33,763 --> 00:23:35,697
So how are we
on volcano detail?

290
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:38,427
- I think we can work it out.
- Fun with chemistry.

291
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,765
Xander said he should be
able to get the materials.

292
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,068
- Who's gonna stoke it up?
- You feel up to it?

293
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,108
I suppose it should be I.

294
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,109
Strangely fitting,
in a grotesque fashion.

295
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,111
Okay, guys, start reaching out.

296
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,113
Giles... weapons,
weapons, weapons.

297
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,911
- What about you?
- There's something
I need to get.

298
00:23:54,984 --> 00:23:57,248
Remember... fast and brutal.

299
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,050
It's gonna be a whole
new world come nightfall.

300
00:24:00,123 --> 00:24:02,387
Don't want to weaken now.
And, boys...

301
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,449
let's watch the swearing.

302
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,892
Harmony, listen, I need
to talk to you for a sec.

303
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:13,401
You mean, in front
of other people?

304
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:19,533
- Are they serious?
I'm gonna look stupid in this.
- Percy.

305
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:21,804
Do I look stupid in this?
Be honest.

306
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,869
You look great.
You got a sec?

307
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:40,227
- Cordelia.
- Yes?

308
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:44,460
- You know that
when this is over...
- Yes?

309
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:47,469
Well, should we prevail...

310
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:49,801
I'll be going back to England.

311
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,234
I know.

312
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:01,515
With Buffy no longer
working for the Council...

313
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,849
there's really no place
for me here.

314
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,973
I guess not.

315
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,710
No... reason to stay.

316
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,720
- No.
- No.

317
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:27,122
No cause to hope that...

318
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:34,288
- I might be needed.
- Needed.

319
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,530
- Or wanted.
- Wanted.

320
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,673
- Good luck in England.
- Yes, thank you.

321
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,675
I'll drop you
a line sometime.

322
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,734
- That'd be neat.
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,186
- Okay, put these with the others.
- You got it.

324
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,252
- Don't touch anything.
- What do we do then?

325
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,958
- Nothing.
- Just relax. Have a good time.

326
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,899
Uh... okay.

327
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,960
Okay, it's clear.
Let's move.

328
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,905
I guess that's it.
Won't be long now.

329
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:56,277
- You nervous?
- Only in a terrified way.

330
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,117
- We're gonna make it through this.
- Are you sure?

331
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,452
- I sound pretty sure, don't I?
- Yeah.

332
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,958
Well, then I must be sure.

333
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,894
Is that just a comforting way
of not answering the question?

334
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,575
How long till graduation?

335
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,634
Little while.

336
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,544
- You get what you needed?
- Yeah, I did.

337
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,588
This isn't gonna be enough.

338
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,090
Giles is on it.
How are you?

339
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,161
I heal fast... like you.

340
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,629
- So, are we sure
that everyone's good with...
- I'm not gonna say good-bye.

341
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,714
If we get through this...

342
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,807
I'm just gonna go.

343
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,411
You understand?

344
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,886
There's just too much to...

345
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:00,069
**[Processional Music]

346
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,424
Congratulations
to the class of 1999.

347
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,523
You all proved
more or less adequate.

348
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,591
This is a time
of celebration...

349
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,229
so sit still and be quiet.

350
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,464
Spit out that gum.

351
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:41,410
Please welcome our
distinguished guest speaker...

352
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,107
Richard Wilkins III.

353
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,447
I saw that gesture.
You see me after graduation.

354
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,656
Am I late?
Did we fight?

355
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,123
[Clears Throat]

356
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,399
Well.

357
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,932
What a day this is.
A special day.

358
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:18,287
Today is our centennial...
the 100th anniversary of
the founding of Sunnydale...

359
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,650
and I know what that
means to all you kids.

360
00:30:20,723 --> 00:30:22,657
Not a darn thing.

361
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:26,957
Because today, something
much more important happens.

362
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:30,726
Today, you all graduate
from high school.

363
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,063
Today, all the pain,
all the work...

364
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:35,729
all the excitement
is finally over.

365
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:38,739
Now, what's 100 years of
history compared to that?

366
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:40,832
My God.

367
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,844
He's gonna do
the entire speech.

368
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:46,643
- Man, just ascend already.
- Evil.

369
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:50,310
Maybe you have a place
in Sunnydale's history,
whether you like it or not.

370
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:55,323
It's been a long road getting
here for you, for Sunnydale.

371
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:59,691
There's been achievement,
joy, good times...

372
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,260
and there's been grief.

373
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,494
There's been loss.

374
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:13,001
Some people who should
be here today... aren't.

375
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:18,272
But we are.

376
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:20,338
Journey's end.

377
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:24,682
And what is a journey?
Is it just distance traveled?

378
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:27,153
Time spent? No.

379
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:30,783
It's what happens on the way.
It's the things that shape you.

380
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:35,296
At the end of the journey,
you're not the same.
Today is about change.

381
00:31:35,364 --> 00:31:38,629
Graduation doesn't just mean
your circumstances change.

382
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:40,965
It means you do.
You ascend...

383
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:43,027
to a higher level.

384
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,305
Nothing will ever be the same.

385
00:31:48,377 --> 00:31:50,368
Nothing.

386
00:31:56,952 --> 00:31:59,079
[Groans]

387
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:06,920
And so, as we look back on...

388
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:15,599
On the events that have
brought us to this day...

389
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:19,902
- Come on.
- We...

390
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:23,872
We must all...
[Yells, Groans]

391
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:31,418
It has begun... my destiny.

392
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:35,619
It's a little sooner
than I expected.

393
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:38,956
I had this whole section
on civic pride...

394
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:43,490
but I guess we'll just
skip to the big finish.

395
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:09,213
[Roaring]

396
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:18,096
[Crowd Screaming]

397
00:33:41,523 --> 00:33:43,218
Now!

398
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,068
Flame units!

399
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:02,700
First wave!

400
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:04,678
Fire!

401
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:06,976
Go! Go! Go!

402
00:34:15,124 --> 00:34:18,423
This is... This is
simply unacceptable.

403
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:32,706
- Xander!
- Bowmen!

404
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,845
Fire!

405
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:52,892
- Fall back!
- Fire!

406
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:34,161
This is not orderly.
This is not disciplined.

407
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:36,101
You're on my campus, buddy...

408
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:39,038
and when I say
I want quiet, I mean...

409
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:45,903
Fall back!
Get back!

410
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:47,972
- Go.
- Good luck.

411
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:50,873
Xander, take 'em down.

412
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:53,531
Everyone, hand-to-hand!

413
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,840
Go! Go! Go!
Move! Move!

414
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:08,655
Get the kids!

415
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,391
[Screams]

416
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:26,205
- [Yells]
- Right flank, close that up!

417
00:36:26,275 --> 00:36:28,334
Close!

418
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,174
Jason and Doug, you guys
are the right flank.

419
00:36:42,057 --> 00:36:44,389
Get some help here?

420
00:36:47,096 --> 00:36:49,064
[Buffy] Hey!

421
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,096
You remember this?

422
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:58,469
I took it from Faith.
Stuck it in her gut.

423
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:02,870
Just slid in her
like she was butter.

424
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,944
You want to get it
back from me... Dick?

425
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:51,489
Well, gosh.

426
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:17,475
[Wesley Moaning And Gasping]

427
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:23,624
If... If I could just
get something for the pain.

428
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:26,684
It-It's rather a lot
of pain, actually.

429
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,892
An aspirin? Anyone? Ohh.

430
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,696
Perhaps I could just
be knocked unconscious.

431
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,569
Ohh. Ohh!

432
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:48,213
- Got off pretty cheap, considering.
- Seems like we did.

433
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:59,226
He made it through the fight.

434
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:06,242
Guess maybe he...
he took off after.

435
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:19,783
Good job.

436
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:26,089
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

437
00:39:26,162 --> 00:39:29,723
I should imagine so.
It's quite a couple of days.

438
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:33,166
I haven't processed
everything yet.

439
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:36,899
My brain isn't really
functioning on the higher levels.

440
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:39,908
It's pretty much,
"fire bad, tree pretty."

441
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:41,910
Understandable.

442
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:45,436
Well, when it's working
again, congratulate it
on a good campaign.

443
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:49,848
- You did very well.
- Thank you. I will.

444
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:53,013
I, uh, I ferreted this
out of the wreckage.

445
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:55,216
It may not interest you,
but, uh...

446
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:59,217
I'd say you earned it.

447
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:08,303
There's a certain, um...

448
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:11,738
dramatic irony
attached to all this...

449
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:17,040
synchronicity that borders on
predestination, one might say.

450
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:19,513
Fire bad. Tree pretty.

451
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:21,550
Oh, yes. Sorry.

452
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:23,551
I'll go and attend to Wesley.

453
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:26,247
See if he's still,
um, whimpering.

454
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:45,763
Well, that was
the most fun you can have
without having any fun.

455
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:49,202
What about the part where
we kicked some demon ass?

456
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:51,262
- I didn't hate that.
- Hear, hear.

457
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,975
You guys want to take off?

458
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:59,674
- I think we've pretty much
done everything we can.
- I'm for it.

459
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:01,910
Are you okay?

460
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:08,283
Yeah. I'm okay.

461
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:12,552
- I could use
a little sleep, though.
- Yeah.

462
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:17,565
If someone could just wake me
when it's time to go college,
that'd be great.

463
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:20,625
Guys, take a moment
to deal with this.

464
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:22,967
We survived.

465
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:27,037
It was a hell of a battle.

466
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:29,543
Not the battle.

467
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,044
High school.

468
00:42:36,752 --> 00:42:38,743
We're taking a moment.

469
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:43,214
And we're done.

470
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:50,688
Why do demons
even come here?
