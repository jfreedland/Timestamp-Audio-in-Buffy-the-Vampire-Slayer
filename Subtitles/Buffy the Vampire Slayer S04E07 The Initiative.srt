1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:06,968
Parker's problem with intimacy
turns out to be that he can't get enough of it.

2
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:09,567
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,645
I've forgotten my manners
in all the concussion. I'm Riley.

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,803
I'm a TA. I'll be helping the professor out.

5
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:20,044
I'm Professor Walsh.
"The Evil Bitch Monster of Death."

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,330
Cos the Big Bad is back. And this time...

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,074
Advertise your product or brand here

8
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:38,446
Women. Young, nubile, exciting.

9
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,525
Each one a mystery waiting to be unlocked.

10
00:00:42,413 --> 00:00:47,328
Think any of 'em are gonna show?
Cos the party'd be lame if we lack for hotties.

11
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:50,132
Professor? You with me?

12
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:54,331
No. I'm with this large pile of
ungraded papers, due at three o'clock.

13
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:58,088
How are you gonna learn anything
if you keep doing schoolwork?

14
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:02,610
Check her out. Is she hot or is she hot?

15
00:01:05,253 --> 00:01:07,323
She's Buffy.

16
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:10,405
Buffy? I like that.

17
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:13,644
That girl's so hot, she's buffy.

18
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,726
- It's her name, Forrest.
- You've established first contact?

19
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:22,807
- Excellent! What do you think of her?
- I never really thought about it.

20
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:25,851
A girl that cute in the face
and you form no opinion?

21
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:30,768
No, I mean... She's all right, I guess.
She's just kinda... I don't know.

22
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:33,571
- Peculiar.
- Peculiar?

23
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:35,804
Yeah.

24
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:43,724
Hey, Graham, what do you think of
the blonde chick? Mattressable, n'est-ce pas?

25
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,168
Riley's not down. He doesn't like her.

26
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:51,488
I don't dislike her. She never feels like
she's really there when you talk to her.

27
00:01:51,573 --> 00:01:55,009
- I like girls I can get a grip on.
- I'll bet you do.

28
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:58,608
Not that way. Just a little less
ready for takeoff all the time.

29
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:02,732
- There's definitely something off about her.
- Maybe she's Canadian.

30
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:06,768
Didn't she go with Parker Abrams
for about 30 seconds?

31
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:09,447
Yeah, there's a sign of good taste!

32
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:12,969
OK, but you've got to admit,
she's a major-league hottie.

33
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:17,171
Well, I'm not denying she's easy on the eyes.
I'm just saying...

34
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,322
Would you really wanna go out with her?

35
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:25,565
Hell, yes. I bet a lot of guys
would like to get their hands on her.

36
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:27,644
The Slayer.

37
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,124
Gonna kill you.

38
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:35,084
Not so tough.

39
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:38,404
Kill Slayer.

40
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:20,286
Well, based on Buffy's description,

41
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:24,161
I believe the men that we're after
look something like...

42
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:27,004
like this.

43
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:33,364
The latest in fall fascism. I like it.
A bit full in the hips for my taste.

44
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:38,732
I think we can safely assume they're human.
So, no research needed.

45
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:43,443
No study? Damn! Next thing you'll tell me
is I'll have to eatjelly doughnuts

46
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:48,084
or sleep with a supermodel to get
things done. How much can one man give?

47
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:54,123
Not too much, I'm afraid. Once again I'd say
you and I will not be needed to help Buffy.

48
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,846
- Really?
- Really.

49
00:04:57,573 --> 00:05:00,963
How about this? We whip out
the Ouija board, light a few candles,

50
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:06,770
summon some ancient, unstoppable evil:
mayhem. We show up and kick its ass.

51
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:14,041
- Wee bit unethical.
- Hello, people.

52
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,725
Hey.

53
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:20,164
- It's my late-night storm-trooper pal.
- Just for reference.

54
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,211
- But fairly accurate, you'd say?
- That's your man.

55
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:26,490
Your man, actually.
You are patrolling tonight?

56
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,167
Nope. I am going to a party tonight.

57
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:32,086
Hopefully a "no fighting,
no biting" kinda deal.

58
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:34,528
Somebody's gotta find out
who these people are.

59
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,002
Giles, I live in a dorm now.

60
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:42,727
The girls in my hall wanna party, Willow
needs cheering up, I'm going to take her.

61
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:47,523
- How's Will dealin'...
- With the black hole of despair since Oz left?

62
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,763
She's dealing. I'm helping.

63
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,048
It's hard, ergo party.

64
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,852
You two can take patrol.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

65
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:58,528
I need to go find
something slutty to wear tonight.

66
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,366
Don't drink it. It's drugged.

67
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:41,164
- And who are you, mate?
- I'm a rat.

68
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:46,444
I'm a lab rat, just like the others.
They're gonna kill us, you know.

69
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,886
- How are they gonna do that?
- Well, they starve you.

70
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:56,411
And when you're ready to bite your own arm,
they shoot out one of those packets.

71
00:06:56,493 --> 00:06:59,530
You drink, and the next thing you're gone.

72
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:07,124
- And that's when they do the experiments.
- And "they" are?

73
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:11,001
The government? Nazis?
A major cosmetics company?

74
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:14,802
Who cares? All I know is,
one minute I'm running from the Slayer

75
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,453
and the next thing I'm here.

76
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,091
The Slayer!

77
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,243
I knew it! I knew it!

78
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,006
She took apart my crew
and led me straight to these guys.

79
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:26,084
She set me up, too.

80
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:31,409
I always worried what would happen
when that bitch got funding.

81
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,882
She's wised up a bit. Fine!

82
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,448
I'll take her apart.

83
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,564
I don't care how brilliant she is.

84
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:43,404
Stupid pen!

85
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,366
- My notes!
- Ballpoints can be tricky.

86
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:54,203
That's all for today. Read chapters
eight to eleven for tomorrow.

87
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:55,612
Riley!

88
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:59,329
I notice you left off a name today in roll call.

89
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,881
Osbourne. Daniel Osbourne. Oz.

90
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:05,010
He's not in this class any more.
I hear he dropped out.

91
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:08,972
Well, you heard way wrong, then.
He's not gone.

92
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:13,012
He left temporarily to work out a few things.

93
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:18,121
I know that sounds lame in its vagueness,
but, I assure you, Oz will be back.

94
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:21,282
Not to my class, he won't.

95
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:26,811
An educated guess. You know the rules,
you know I hate exceptions,

96
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:30,442
and yet somehow you feel
your exception is exceptional.

97
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,252
- But...
- It is. To you.

98
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:38,248
But since I'm neither a freshman nor a
narcissist, I have to consider the whole class.

99
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:43,532
If your friend can't respect my schedule,
I think it's best he not come back.

100
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:55,726
You know, for someone who teaches human
behaviour, you might try showing some.

101
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:58,486
It's not my job to coddle my students.

102
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:03,324
You're right. A human being in pain
has nothing to do with yourjob.

103
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:14,811
- I like her.
- Really?

104
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:20,166
You don't think she's a little peculiar?

105
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:26,923
Here we go. Gear for tonight. If commando
squads are out there, fully loaded,

106
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:30,289
these babies might give us
the edge we'll need.

107
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:34,446
It's a very impressive array.
Where did it all come from?

108
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,809
Requisitioned it.
Back when I was Military Guy.

109
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,930
That was two years ago.
You still 100 per cent?

110
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:46,130
Are you kidding?
I put the semper in semper fi.

111
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:50,282
I might not be able to assemble an M-16
blindfolded like I used to

112
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:53,763
or pass weapons drill
for the mobile infantry...

113
00:09:56,013 --> 00:10:01,246
Might as well face it. Right now I don't have
the technical skills to join the Swiss army.

114
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,167
And all those guys ask you to do
is uncork a couple of sassy Cabernets.

115
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:07,813
I'm sure you'll be ready when the time comes.

116
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:12,728
Fear not. Hand-to-hand, I'm still the man.
Whoever these guys trained with,

117
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,328
- I'm sure they're not ready to deal with...
- Xander!

118
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:17,482
Yes, Mom?

119
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:22,363
I made a nice fruit punch for you
and your friend. Would you boys like some?

120
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:27,410
Is it raspberry fruit punch?

121
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,452
So she says "You teach human behaviour.
Maybe you oughta show some."

122
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:35,048
- You're lying. She says it to Walsh?
- Hope to die.

123
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:39,012
- Doesn't lack for guts. Gotta give her that.
- Yeah, but she's nuts.

124
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:42,483
Come on. Like you never wanted
to tell the professor off. Hey, Parker!

125
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:44,291
Forrest. What's up, man?

126
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:47,285
What's the scoop on Buffy Summers?
Is she cool?

127
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:50,922
Buffy? She's all right, I guess. Kinda whiny.

128
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:54,085
- How's that?
- Well, you know, clingy.

129
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:57,324
I mean, we got a little physical, well...

130
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:01,929
Fully physical, and then she's all over me,
you know, like we're betrothed or something.

131
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,969
No, but fun was had, yeah?

132
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,525
Oh, yeah. The word is stamina.

133
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:13,531
Definitely a bunny in the sack,
but later on, well...

134
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:17,128
You know the difference between
a freshman girl and a toilet seat?

135
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:20,091
The toilet seat doesn't
follow you around after you use it.

136
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:25,321
- I can't believe I did that.
- Welcome to the club.

137
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:28,723
Know how much trouble you could get into?
If Parker reported you...

138
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,646
- He won't. He's too embarrassed.
- I hit him.

139
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,043
- What the hell for?
- He was just being so crude.

140
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,852
Please! You've heard me say
much grosser things.

141
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:41,050
Yeah, most of those
are about your own mother.

142
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,124
What is it, then?

143
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:50,889
I just didn't like hearing him talk
about Buffy that way. I think that...

144
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:54,443
Well, I guess I like her.

145
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:57,331
You're kinda like a moron.

146
00:11:57,413 --> 00:12:00,803
So, you knew that I had feelings for her?

147
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:04,090
- Everybody knows, man.
- "She's peculiar"?

148
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,607
Dead giveaway, buddy.

149
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:10,481
- I'm always the last to know.
- So what you gonna do?

150
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,927
Well, I guess I'm gonna go see a girl.

151
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,325
Sorry, can't stay. Got to go see a girl.

152
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,332
- Get the serum!
- Let me out!

153
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,973
- Bit busy right now.
- I know where the exit is.

154
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:08,443
You spring me, you're free.
You don't, you're dead.

155
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:23,047
Hurry! Hurry!

156
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,924
This way!

157
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:45,010
New plan - we split up. You go that way.

158
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,086
Come in.

159
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,043
- Riley. Hi.
- Hi.

160
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:08,681
Gee, I hope I'm not interrupting
anything really depressing.

161
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,524
What's up?

162
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,202
Right to the point. OK.

163
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:23,931
I was thinking of asking out Buffy.

164
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,481
- She's not here.
- I know.

165
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:32,808
See, I don't know that much about Buffy, but
I'm interested in what she likes and, so far,

166
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:36,852
well, the only thing
that I know she likes is you.

167
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:39,564
What do you want me to do?

168
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,805
Just tell me something. Anything.

169
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:47,603
Just give me a clue to...
Here, let me help you with that.

170
00:14:48,893 --> 00:14:51,043
Just something that'll start us talking.

171
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:55,331
I'm thinking that "How about them Broncos?"
won't really cut it.

172
00:14:56,733 --> 00:15:02,171
OK. Say that I help and you start
a conversation. It goes great.

173
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,562
You like Buffy, she likes you.

174
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,248
You spend time together,
feelings grow deeper.

175
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,008
And one day, without even realising it,
you find you're in love.

176
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:18,248
Time stops and it feels like the whole world's
made for you two and you two alone.

177
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,042
Until one of you leaves and rips
the still-beating heart from the other,

178
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:26,126
who's now a broken, hollow
mockery of the human condition.

179
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:30,164
Yep, that's the plan.

180
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:33,202
I figured it was.

181
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:36,812
Look, if you wanna tell me
to go to hell, that's OK.

182
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,646
Maybe this is the last thing
you wanna talk about.

183
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:44,204
I just feel that... well, I've never
courted anyone like Buffy before.

184
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:48,081
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like Buffy before.

185
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:50,562
Why should I trust you?

186
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:55,123
Just sort of hoping
you'd think I have an honest face.

187
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:59,889
I've seen honest faces before.
They usually come attached to liars.

188
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:03,006
All right.

189
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,611
I guess I'm not gonna win here.

190
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:11,083
I appreciate you wanting
to protect your friend.

191
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:14,645
I guess she kinda brings that out in people.

192
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,402
She likes cheese.

193
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:23,165
What?

194
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:29,010
Well, I'm not saying it's the key to her heart,
but Buffy likes cheese.

195
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,248
That's a start.

196
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,042
She has a stuffed piggy named Mr Gordo,

197
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:39,971
Ioves Ice Capades, without the irony,

198
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:43,642
and she's dragging me
to this party tonight at Lowell House.

199
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,850
You're going? That's my house. I live there.

200
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:50,812
Well, it'll give you a chance to interact,
but don't get fresh.

201
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:54,090
Fresh? Don't even know
if we like each other yet.

202
00:16:58,213 --> 00:17:02,001
Does she ever talk about me?
Like, has she ever said any...

203
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:06,449
- Sorry.
- That's discouraging.

204
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:11,532
Still, I feel like I have a fighting chance,
with my new accomplice.

205
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,922
- I'm not your accomplice.
- No, of course not.

206
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:15,366
- I'm not.
- You're not.

207
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:17,284
- We're clear?
- We're clear.

208
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,645
- Spike, is that really you?
- It's me, baby.

209
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,724
Your man is...

210
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,851
- back.
- Bastard!

211
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,403
You dumped me and staked me
and hurt me and left me...

212
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:45,645
I know, sugar, but you're forgetting
one other thing I did.

213
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:48,122
- I missed you.
- Really?

214
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:55,813
Just don't ever do that to me again.

215
00:17:55,893 --> 00:18:00,648
Never, my little foam latte.
Your blondie bear is here to stay.

216
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:05,011
Well, where have you been? No, wait.
Don't tell me. I'm just glad you're back.

217
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:09,848
- And this time it's for good, right?
- For ever and ever, mon petite crème brûlée.

218
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,204
Ooh! Italian!

219
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,802
Yeah. And get used to it.

220
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:20,205
Big Daddy's home. We're gonna go
wherever you want, do whatever you want,

221
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:22,682
kill whoever you want.

222
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:25,768
Starting with the Slayer.

223
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:29,368
And after that it's all you and me,

224
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:33,412
my little mentholated pack of smokes.

225
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:36,405
Spiky, let's leave the Slayer alone.

226
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:40,691
You know she'll only slap you around.
And I can do that.

227
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:44,607
No, see... The head, love.
Watch the head. Watch it!

228
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:49,369
Every man faces this moment. Here. Now.

229
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:53,492
Watching, waiting for
an unseen enemy that has no face.

230
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:58,408
Nerve endings screaming in silence. Never
knowing which thought might be your last.

231
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:01,166
Shut up.

232
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:14,167
Looks cool.

233
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:20,121
- Look, we could go.
- No, no.

234
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,204
We're here for fun.

235
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,131
Look, some of the guys are here already.

236
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:29,410
I'm gonna grab a soda. I'll find you guys.

237
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:32,764
OK.

238
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:46,607
She's wearing the halter top
with sensible shoes.

239
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:49,412
So mostly dancing, light contact.
Don't push your luck.

240
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:52,485
Heavy conversation's out of the question.

241
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:55,849
- So what do I do?
- Ask her to dance.

242
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,924
Right. Dance.

243
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,332
Wait. No.

244
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:04,530
- What's the matter?
- I can't dance.

245
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:09,372
Then talk. Keep eye contact.
Funny is good, but don't be glib.

246
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:13,685
And remember, if you hurt her,
I will beat you to death with a shovel.

247
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:18,208
A vague disclaimer is nobody's friend.
Have fun!

248
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,444
Excuse me.

249
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:35,124
- Hi.
- Hi.

250
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,450
Buffy...

251
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:48,482
You do the reading on chapter nine?

252
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,124
Wow. Some theories, huh?

253
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,167
Cheese?

254
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,482
Fine, let's split up. I don't care.

255
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:24,805
Harmony.

256
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:27,123
- Xander?
- That's close enough.

257
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,008
I'm warning you, I've been highly trained
to put this through your heart.

258
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:34,368
No mercy, no warning.

259
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:36,808
I can kill you where you stand.

260
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:40,083
Bring it on, then.

261
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,324
You sissy kicker!

262
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:07,323
Cut it out!

263
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,688
I'm so gonna bite you!

264
00:22:09,773 --> 00:22:13,686
- OK, stop, stop! We should stop, OK?
- OK, I will if you will.

265
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:15,843
On the count of three.

266
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:19,403
One, two, three!

267
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,324
Right! OK.

268
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:29,244
It's been great catching up.

269
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,484
I'm gonna pick up the tattered shreds
of my dignity and go home.

270
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:35,883
Leaving you with your fire.

271
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:38,851
My fire? Yeah, right!

272
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:41,652
Like I'd listen to the Sex Pistols.

273
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:45,851
This crap belongs to Spike.

274
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,969
Spike?

275
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:52,012
Can you believe him? He comes back
with all these big promises.

276
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:54,163
Not that I believed him, you know.

277
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:58,724
He could have spent one night, but, no,
everything was "Slayer this", "Slayer that".

278
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:02,249
He probably already killed her.
I'm not taking him back,

279
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,325
I just wanna know
why it is that men always...

280
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:08,365
leave.

281
00:23:20,173 --> 00:23:22,971
I can't believe it. I choked.

282
00:23:24,373 --> 00:23:26,682
You really, really did.

283
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:30,129
You don't understand.
I'm good at things. That's what I do.

284
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:33,011
I work hard, apply myself. Get it done.

285
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:35,368
Well, you failed extremely well.

286
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:38,206
That's a great comfort to me.

287
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:43,890
You need to relax. You're not proposing.

288
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:47,211
You're just making contact,
getting a reaction.

289
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,443
Any reaction is OK

290
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:53,845
except projectile vomiting,
but what are the chances of that?

291
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:59,012
Are you OK?

292
00:23:59,093 --> 00:24:01,129
This song.

293
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:06,003
Yeah, it's a tape of some bands
from last year's party. Associations?

294
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:08,731
Big.

295
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:10,845
Bad?

296
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:15,325
AJ.

297
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,011
Thank you.

298
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,288
Now go find Buffy.

299
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:28,772
- There's no hurry. I mean, if you wanna talk.
- No.

300
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:33,165
I want you to find Buffy and tell her that
I went home and not to worry about me.

301
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:36,245
Which at least will give you
something to say.

302
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,731
Thanks.

303
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,804
You'll do fine.

304
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:57,372
Willow said to say that she took off.

305
00:24:57,453 --> 00:25:01,366
She's OK. Kinda blue,
but she said not to worry.

306
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:03,890
Thank you.

307
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:08,369
- You know, I wanted to ask you somethin'.
- Ask away.

308
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:12,881
Buffy! I've been looking
all over for you. We need...

309
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:18,172
We need to talk. Not here.
It's sort of unfinished business.

310
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:20,164
Business? Right.

311
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,323
Excuse us.

312
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:24,165
No problem.

313
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:28,849
Denied.

314
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:33,324
It's not like she blew me off.
She just left with another guy, that's all.

315
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:35,802
We need you downstairs, anyway.

316
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:42,681
I hate to say it, but they're probably
on their way to make crazy, naked sex.

317
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:45,765
- Is that necessary?
- Look, I'm protecting you, buddy.

318
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:48,845
I don't wanna see you
mooning over some freshman.

319
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:52,812
- Retinal scan accepted.
- I like her. I'm on your side here.

320
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:58,650
I know you are, Graham. That's what gives me
the strength to put up with this comedian.

321
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:06,006
Dude, a straight tip: I know about girls.

322
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:08,163
Exactly. Girls, plural.

323
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:10,323
I'm talking about one girl.

324
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:12,165
One girl.

325
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:16,451
Initiative vocal code match complete.
Special Agent Finn, Riley.

326
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:21,844
The problem is, what kind of girl
is gonna go out with a guy

327
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:28,088
who's acting all Joe Regular by day
and then turns all demon-hunter by night?

328
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:31,483
- Maybe a peculiar one.
- Thank you, Graham.

329
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:36,567
Sure, give him the gratitude
when I'm the guy sparing you heartbreak.

330
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:55,444
She's a major babe.
I still say you've got a shot, Rye.

331
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:59,526
You see, Forrest?
You don't have to be so negative all the time.

332
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:01,365
Hold up.

333
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,444
Situation?

334
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:09,728
Gentlemen, suit up. We have a code red.
Hostile 17 has escaped.

335
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:20,447
Here's what we know, and it isn't much.
Hostile 17 broke restraints at exactly 2.47pm.

336
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:23,206
- Big head start.
- Gets bigger when you interrupt me.

337
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:26,012
It was bagged and tagged locally,
so it knows the area.

338
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:28,732
The creature has every advantage right now.

339
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,931
Fail to recapture it and everything
we've worked for - the Initiative - could end.

340
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:36,210
- Nobody's failing on my watch.
- Glad to hear it.

341
00:27:47,413 --> 00:27:51,167
Gentlemen, Agent Finn
is now in charge of this operation.

342
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:55,565
- I'm counting on you, Riley.
- We start with the basic mobilisation pattern.

343
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:59,566
Three teams. Sweep and search,
just like practice. Thorough but fast.

344
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:02,121
C Team, campus perimeter.
Make sure it can't leave.

345
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:05,046
Stake it if you gotta, but only as a last resort.

346
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:08,330
B Team, you're going down.
Tunnels, sewers, cemeteries.

347
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:11,246
Gates and Miller, we take
the heart of campus and work out.

348
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:16,532
All units, maintain radio contact
early and often. Who's got questions?

349
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:19,211
Move!

350
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:42,723
What is wrong with him?
Doesn't Spike get that this is my town?

351
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:46,249
- He's resilient.
- And it's my night off.

352
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,848
He'd pick another night if he knew
you were busy with Teutonic Boy Toy.

353
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:52,652
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothin'.

354
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,483
Riley's a doof. He's not Teutonic.

355
00:28:55,893 --> 00:28:58,566
We have to assume that
Spike's main target is you.

356
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,804
Fine. He's worn out his welcome.
Tonight I kill him.

357
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:04,532
- You have a plan?
- I am the plan.

358
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:08,049
If Spike wants me, I go alone. No arguments.

359
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:12,692
Lead him away from the popular places
and give him what he wants.

360
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:14,764
Wait, wait!

361
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:18,173
- Take this.
- A flare gun?

362
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:21,165
If I find Spike, I'm staking him,
not signalling ships at sea.

363
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:23,642
You get into trouble...

364
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:28,806
- OK. I'll flare.
- And we'll come a-runnin'.

365
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:38,365
- Do you think Spike'll find her?
- I'm sure of it.

366
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:02,763
Hello, gorgeous.

367
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:18,682
- What have we got?
- Civilian, sir.

368
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:28,126
- Damn!
- She's compromising the area.

369
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,881
- At least she's not making crazy, naked sex.
- Told you.

370
00:30:33,693 --> 00:30:35,923
We gotta clear her outta there. Fast.

371
00:30:36,013 --> 00:30:40,768
Maybe not. Just thinking.
If you were Hostile 17,

372
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:44,812
living off the crap we feed 'em,
what would you rather eat than that?

373
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:49,603
- Use the girl I got a crush on as bait?
- I can tag a hostile at 50 yards.

374
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:50,443
Denied.

375
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:53,127
- She'd be safe the entire...
- I said denied, Agent.

376
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:57,126
- Did you just pull rank on me?
- Do you have a problem with that?

377
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:00,527
No, sir.

378
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:03,407
So, how are we gonna get her outta there?

379
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:15,129
Riley! What are you doing here?

380
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:21,412
Well, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
to you after the party. You left so fast.

381
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:24,883
You know, with your friend, who's a boy.

382
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:30,164
Xander? He's not anyone that
I wanna talk about right now.

383
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:36,201
You know, I don't want you taking this
the wrong way. It's just...

384
00:31:36,293 --> 00:31:38,966
I need a little alone time now.

385
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:40,884
Alone.

386
00:31:40,973 --> 00:31:42,804
- Why?
- I need space.

387
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:45,327
- We're outdoors.
- Emotionally.

388
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:47,290
I mean, emotionally.

389
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:51,412
You know, there's plenty of space
back in your room. Why don't I take you?

390
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,530
- You wouldn't believe the weirdos out...
- Whoa! OK.

391
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:57,923
It's a free campus.
Who died and made you John Wayne?

392
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:03,323
- I'm just trying to help.
- You think I need help? Believe me, I don't.

393
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:06,450
If you were a real gentleman,
then you would just leave.

394
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:09,969
You would go far, far away. Now. Shoo!

395
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,283
- Are you drunk?
- Yes. Go and report me.

396
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:16,446
- I'm taking you home.
- Ever think maybe I'm gonna take you home?

397
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:21,052
What? You think that boys can take care
of themselves and girls need help?

398
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:24,409
- Yeah.
- That is so Teutonic.

399
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:27,724
Look, Buffy, as long as
you're out here, I'm staying.

400
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,691
Well, as long as you're out here, I'm staying.

401
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:32,768
- See ya!
- Gotta go.

402
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:38,330
- Tell me we're tracking.
- Honing a signal.

403
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:41,211
- Got it. Heading west.
- That better be the hostile.

404
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:46,970
All units converge, all units converge.
Hard target sighted. Heading: 1-2 alpha niner.

405
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:49,521
Let's bag it before this gets ugly.

406
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:54,888
Come in.

407
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:00,402
Spike!

408
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:05,602
What do you want? A spell? I can do that.

409
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,566
I'll give you a choice.

410
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:23,286
Now, I'm gonna kill you. No choice in that.

411
00:33:23,973 --> 00:33:25,964
But...

412
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,603
I can let you stay dead

413
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:33,130
or bring you back, to be like me.

414
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:35,884
I'll scream.

415
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:37,372
Bonus.

416
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:12,524
I don't understand.

417
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:16,924
This sort of thing's
never happened to me before.

418
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:22,441
- Maybe you were nervous.
- I felt all right when I started.

419
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:26,244
Let's try again.

420
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:39,729
Damn it!

421
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:49,202
Maybe you're trying too hard.

422
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:55,606
- Doesn't this happen to every vampire?
- Not to me it doesn't!

423
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,724
It's me, isn't it?

424
00:35:04,773 --> 00:35:06,764
What are you talking about?

425
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:10,243
Well, you came looking for Buffy,
then settled.

426
00:35:11,973 --> 00:35:14,806
You didn't wanna bite me.
I just happened to be around.

427
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:16,406
Piffle!

428
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:21,328
I know I'm not the kind of girl
vamps like to sink their teeth into.

429
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:27,761
It's always, like, "Ooh, you're like a sister
to me" or "Oh, you're such a good friend."

430
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:29,844
Don't be ridiculous.

431
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:33,128
I'd bite you in a heartbeat.

432
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:38,002
- Really?
- Thought about it.

433
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:41,244
When?

434
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:48,565
Remember last year? You had on that fuzzy
pink number with the lilac underneath?

435
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:56,566
I never would have guessed.
You played the blood lust kinda cool.

436
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:59,725
I hate being obvious. All fangy and grrrr!

437
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:02,168
Takes the mystery out.

438
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:07,725
- But if you could...
- If I could. Yeah.

439
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:13,362
You know, this doesn't
make you any less terrifying.

440
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:15,728
Don't patronise me.

441
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:20,570
Getting a picture. Signature's locked.

442
00:36:20,653 --> 00:36:23,770
- What have we got?
- Humans of the freshman variety.

443
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:25,047
98.6.

444
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,324
98.6.

445
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:31,808
Bingo. Got a cold one.
Thermal output clocking in at exactly

446
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:33,770
- room temperature.
- Vampire.

447
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:38,165
Call in a standard triangle
flanking manoeuvre. We're goin' in.

448
00:36:38,253 --> 00:36:40,608
I need a lockdown on grid six.

449
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:45,048
I'm only 126!

450
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:52,170
You're being too hard on yourself. Why
don't we wait a half an hour and try again?

451
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:55,491
Or...

452
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:05,841
Hey, hey! Watch it!

453
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:34,771
No, hold your fire!

454
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:41,849
It's on me!

455
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:47,448
My head!

456
00:37:53,213 --> 00:37:55,602
Bag and tag it. We're gone.

457
00:37:57,093 --> 00:37:59,163
Sir. Civilian.

458
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:02,322
Could have turned.

459
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,723
- Leave her.
- We can't neglect quarantine.

460
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:23,250
Stop her!

461
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,245
- She's contained.
- Contain this!

462
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,648
Take the mask off.

463
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:37,004
What was that?

464
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,523
Hostile's escaping. Move!

465
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:54,684
We gotta stop him.

466
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:18,284
Abort!

467
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:39,293
I'm sure you'll understand
if I seem far from happy.

468
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:42,683
- If you read my report...
- Hostile 17's found an accomplice

469
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:46,402
who's smart, aggressive
and somehow escapes description.

470
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:49,132
- Whoever he was, the guy was big.
- Strong, too.

471
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:53,491
- Whoever or whatever.
- I'm not interested in guesswork, gentlemen.

472
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:58,727
Call me old-fashioned. I like results.
This report reads like a child's riddle book.

473
00:40:00,013 --> 00:40:04,086
Agent Finn, tell me something good.
My implant?

474
00:40:04,173 --> 00:40:07,609
The implant works.
Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature

475
00:40:07,693 --> 00:40:13,370
without intense neurological pain,
can't feed, can't hardly even hit any more.

476
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,842
- We'll bag it.
- Yes, you will.

477
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:19,964
Dismissed.

478
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:39,290
Hey.

479
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:40,601
Hi.

480
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:43,048
- Listen, sorry about last night.
- No.

481
00:40:43,493 --> 00:40:47,486
No, I was rude. I just felt like being alone.

482
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:51,969
Sometimes it's nice
to be out by yourself at night.

483
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:56,569
I hear that. Gotta be careful, though.
Lot of strange people out there.

484
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:58,450
Oh, yeah.

485
00:40:58,533 --> 00:41:00,603
How's Willow doing?

486
00:41:00,693 --> 00:41:05,483
OK. Course, that stupid fraternity prank
on our dorm didn't help any.

487
00:41:05,573 --> 00:41:08,610
That's right.
I forgot you guys live in Stevenson.

488
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:12,083
- You knew that?
- Well, Willow and I were...

489
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:15,772
I thought she might be able
to help me on a project.

490
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:20,210
- Really? That work out for ya?
- Don't know yet.

491
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:26,251
Last night at the party.
You wanted to tell me something?

492
00:41:28,493 --> 00:41:30,563
Oh, yeah. Very important stuff.

493
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:38,209
I don't remember any of it. But you would
