1
00:00:01,854 --> 00:00:04,649
In every generation there is a Chosen One.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,286
She alone will stand against the vampires,

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:09,994
the demons and the forces of darkness.

4
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:12,469
She is the Slayer.

5
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,062
No! Get off!

6
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:39,938
Hey!

7
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:54,789
Xander!

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,906
Xander, are you OK?

9
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:06,960
Man, something hit me.

10
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,462
- Where's Jesse?
- I don't know. They surrounded us.

11
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:11,640
- That girl grabbed him and took off.
- Which way?

12
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,810
I don't know.

13
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,897
Jesse...

14
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,464
This world is older than any of you know.

15
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:21,843
Contrary to popular mythology,
it did not begin as a paradise.

16
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:27,117
For untold aeons, demons walked the Earth.

17
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:32,146
They made it their home. Their, uh, their Hell.

18
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:35,525
But in time
they lost their purchase on this reality.

19
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:39,863
The way was made for mortal animals.
For-for Man.

20
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:43,492
All that remains of the Old Ones...
are vestiges.

21
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:46,287
Certain magics. Certain creatures.

22
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:49,248
- And vampires.
- OK, this is where I have a problem.

23
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:54,672
See, because we're talking about vampires.
We're having a talk with vampires in it.

24
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:59,123
- Isn't that what we saw last night?
- No, those weren't vampires.

25
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:01,512
Those were... just guys
in thundering need of a facial.

26
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,932
Or maybe they had rabies.
It could have been rabies.

27
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:08,186
And that guy turning to dust?
Just a trick of light.

28
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:11,231
That's what I said the first time
I saw a vampire.

29
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:14,235
Well, after I was done
with the screaming part.

30
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,280
- Oh, I need to sit down.
- You are sitting down.

31
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,325
- Oh! Good for me.
- So, vampires are demons?

32
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,622
The books tell the last demon
to leave this reality fed off a human.

33
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:30,002
Mixed their blood.
He was a human form possessed.

34
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,755
Infected by the demon's soul.

35
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:37,927
He bit another, and another.
And so they walked the Earth, feeding.

36
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:43,434
Killing some, mixing their blood
with others to make more of their kind.

37
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:48,397
Waiting for the animals to die out,
and the Old Ones to return.

38
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,418
Move.

39
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:23,061
Is this for me?

40
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:25,188
An offering, Master.

41
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,733
He's a good one. His blood is pure.

42
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,404
You've tasted it.

43
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:37,911
I'm your... faithful dog.

44
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:40,872
You bring me scraps.

45
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:42,666
I didn't mean...

46
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:48,839
I have waited.
For three score years, I have waited.

47
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:52,093
While you come and go, I am stuck here.

48
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,638
Here in this house of...

49
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:57,224
worship.

50
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:01,478
My ascension is almost at hand.

51
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,107
Pray that when it comes...

52
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:08,528
I'm in a better mood.

53
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,155
Master, forgive me.

54
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:15,369
We had more offerings,
but there was trouble. A girl.

55
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:17,371
And there was a girl.

56
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:20,958
She fought well and she knew of our breed.

57
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:25,463
- It is possible that she may be...
- A slayer.

58
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:27,621
And that would be a what?

59
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:29,922
For as long as there have been vampires,
there's been the Slayer.

60
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:32,131
One girl in all the world. A Chosen one.

61
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,332
He loves doing this part.

62
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,003
All right.

63
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:39,779
The Slayer hunts vampires.
Buffy is a slayer. Don't tell anyone.

64
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:42,085
Well, I think that's
all the vampire information you need.

65
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:44,195
Except for one thing. How you kill them?

66
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,652
You don't. I do.

67
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:48,355
- Well, Jesse's my...
- Jesse's my responsibility.

68
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,447
- I let him get taken.
- That's not true.

69
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:53,259
If you hadn't shown up,
they would have taken us, too.

70
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,394
Does anybody mind if I pass out?

71
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,739
- Breathe.
- Breathe.

72
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:58,048
Breathe.

73
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:01,346
This big guy, Luke, he talked about
an offering to the Master.

74
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,134
Now, I don't know what or who,

75
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,673
but if they weren't just feeding,
then Jesse may still be alive.

76
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,331
I'm gonna find him.

77
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:11,136
This may be the dumb question,
but shouldn't we call the police?

78
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,385
And they'd believe us, of course.

79
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,903
We don't have to say 'vampires'.
We could just say there's a... a bad man.

80
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:22,183
They couldn't handle it even if they did
show up. They'd only come with guns.

81
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:24,216
You have no idea where they took Jesse?

82
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,436
I looked around but soon as
they got clear of the graveyard,

83
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:27,779
they could have just... voom!

84
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:29,576
- They can fly?
- They can drive.

85
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,661
Oh.

86
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:33,121
I don't remember hearing a car.

87
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:35,511
Let's take an
enormous intuitive leap, shall we?

88
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:36,847
And say they went underground.

89
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,088
Vampires really jam on sewer systems.
You can get anywhere in the entire town

90
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:43,966
without catching any rays.
But I didn't see any access around there.

91
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,845
Well, there's an electrical tunnel
that runs under the whole town.

92
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:48,987
If we have a diagnostic
of the tunnel system,

93
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:51,920
it might indicate a meeting place.

94
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,171
I suppose we could go
to the building commission.

95
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:55,916
We so don't have time.

96
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:58,108
Uh, guys?

97
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:00,985
There may be another way.

98
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:07,827
A slayer. Have you any proof?

99
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,123
- Only that she fought me and yet lives.
- Oh, very nearly proof enough.

100
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:15,085
I can't remember
the last time that happened.

101
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,755
1843, Madrid.

102
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:23,052
He caught me sleeping.

103
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:27,557
She mustn't be allowed
to interfere with the Harvest.

104
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,728
- I would never let that happen.
- Don't worry about it.

105
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:35,190
I believe she'll come to us.
We have something she wants.

106
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,901
If she is a slayer,

107
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,155
and this boy lives,

108
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:42,157
she'll try to save him.

109
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,201
I thought you're nothing more
than a meal, boy.

110
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:49,290
Congratulations.
You've just been upgraded,

111
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:51,500
to bait.

112
00:07:58,049 --> 00:07:59,676
There it is.

113
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,472
- That runs under the graveyard.
- I don't see any access.

114
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:07,727
So, all the city plans are just...
open to the public?

115
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:11,272
Um... well, in a way.

116
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:13,733
I sort of stumbled on to them

117
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:18,155
when I accidentally decrypted
the city council's security system.

118
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:21,950
- Someone's been naughty.
- There's nothing here. It's useless!

119
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,578
I think you're being
a bit hard on yourself.

120
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:27,143
You're the one that told me
that I wasn't prepared enough!

121
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:28,794
Understatement!

122
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,832
I thought I was
on top of everything and then

123
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,662
that monster, Luke, came out of nowhere...

124
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:37,802
What?

125
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,310
He didn't come out of nowhere.
He came from behind me.

126
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,197
I was facing the entrance...

127
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:50,033
He came from behind me
and didn't follow me out.

128
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:52,484
The access to the tunnels
is in the mausoleum!

129
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,321
The girl must've doubled back
with Jesse after I got out.

130
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:59,442
- God! I am so mentally challenged!
- So what's the plan? We saddle up, right?

131
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:05,404
There's no we, OK?
I'm the Slayer, and you're not.

132
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,628
- I knew you'd throw that back in my face.
- Xander, this is deeply dangerous.

133
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,424
I'm inadequate. That's fine.

134
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:14,592
I'm less than a man.

135
00:09:14,676 --> 00:09:19,376
Buffy, I'm not anxious to go into
a dark place full of monsters,

136
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:22,759
but I do wanna help. I need to.

137
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:26,436
Well, then help me.
I've been researching this Harvest affair.

138
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:28,941
It seems to be some sort of
preordained massacre.

139
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:32,361
Rivers of blood.
Hell on Earth. Quite charmless.

140
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,496
I'm a bit fuzzy however on the details.

141
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:38,994
It may be that you can wrest some
information from that dread machine.

142
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:46,248
That was a bit... British, wasn't it?

143
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,671
Welcome to the New World.

144
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:53,260
- I want you to go on the Net.
- Oh, sure. I can do that.

145
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:58,767
Then I'm outta here.
If Jesse's alive, I'll bring him back.

146
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,435
Do I have to tell you to be careful?

147
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,224
And where do we think we're going?

148
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,732
We?

149
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:20,999
I. Me.

150
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,977
We're not leaving school grounds, are we?

151
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:29,002
No. No! I'm... just admiring the fence.
You know, this is quality fencework.

152
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:32,512
Because if we were leaving school grounds
on our second day of the new school,

153
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:35,516
after getting kicked out of our old school
for delinquent behavior...

154
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,843
You see where I'm going with this?

155
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,812
Mr Giles.

156
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:42,356
What?

157
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:45,568
He asked me to get a book for him,
from the store.

158
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:49,614
I have a free period. And I'm a big reader -
did it mention that on my transcripts?

159
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,783
- Mr Giles?
- Ask him.

160
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:54,954
Well, maybe that's how
they do things in Britain.

161
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:59,875
They've got that royal family and all kinds
of problems, but here at Sunnydale...

162
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,481
nobody leaves campus
while school's in session.

163
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:06,515
- Are we clear?
- We're... clear.

164
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,802
That's the Buffy Summers
I want in my school.

165
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:13,439
Sensible girl with her feet on the ground.

166
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:25,446
- Murder, death, disaster. What else?
- Paranormal. Unexplained.

167
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,032
- Natural disasters.
- Earthquake, flood...

168
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:29,825
- Rain of toads.
- Right.

169
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:32,560
Rain of Toads! Do you think they'd have
anything like that in the paper?

170
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:35,990
I'll put it on a computer search.
If it's there, it'll turn up.

171
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:38,478
Anything that'll lead us to vampires.

172
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:41,653
And l, in the meantime, will help
by standing around like an idiot.

173
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:44,508
Not like an idiot. Just standing.

174
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:48,220
Buffy doesn't want you getting hurt.
I don't want you getting hurt.

175
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:49,629
This is just too much.

176
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,615
I mean, yesterday my life's like:
"Uh-oh! Pop quiz."

177
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:54,055
Today, it's "rain of toads".

178
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,931
I know. And everyone else thinks
it's just a normal day.

179
00:11:58,014 --> 00:12:00,902
Nobody knows.
It's like we've got this big secret.

180
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,299
We do.

181
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,265
That's what a secret is, when you
know something other guys don't.

182
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,785
Right.

183
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:13,165
- Look, maybe you should get to class.
- You mean we. We should get to class.

184
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:14,416
Yeah.

185
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:20,090
Buffy'll be OK. Whatever's down there,
I think she can handle it.

186
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,885
- Yeah, I do too.
- So do I.

187
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:23,184
I don't suppose you've got a key on you?

188
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:26,355
They really don't like me dropping in.

189
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:31,127
- Why not?
- They really don't like me.

190
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,962
How could that possibly be?

191
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,799
I knew you'd figure out
this entryway sooner or later.

192
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:41,138
Actually, I thought
it was gonna be a little sooner.

193
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:44,349
Sorry you had to wait.

194
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,475
OK. Look,
if you're gonna be popping up

195
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,482
with this Cryptic Wise Man act
on a regular basis

196
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:53,777
- can you at least tell me your name?
- Angel.

197
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,696
Angel. That's a pretty name.

198
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:00,201
Don't... go down there.

199
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,043
Deal with my going.

200
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,166
You shouldn't be putting yourself at risk.
Tonight is the Harvest.

201
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:09,405
Unless you can prevent it,

202
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:12,126
 the Master walks.

203
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:15,335
Well, if this Harvest thing
is such a suckfest,

204
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:17,356
why don't you stop it?

205
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:19,368
'Cause I'm afraid.

206
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:27,106
They'll be expecting you.

207
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:31,402
I've got a friend down there.
Or at least a potential friend.

208
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:35,155
Do you know what it's like
to have a friend?

209
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:40,221
That wasn't supposed to be a stumper.

210
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,460
When you hit the tunnels,
head east towards the school.

211
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:52,027
That's where you're likely to find them.

212
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,803
You gonna wish me luck?

213
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,531
Good luck.

214
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,901
- Xander, what are you doing here?

215
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,064
- Something stupid. I followed you.
- Well, you're...

216
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,762
I couldn't just
sit at home and do nothing.

217
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,907
I understand. Now go away.

218
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,909
- No!
- Xander, you're gonna have to!

219
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,614
Look, Jesse's my bud, OK?

220
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:35,050
If I can help him out,
that's what I gotta do.

221
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,721
Besides, it's this or chem class.

222
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:56,896
OK, so crosses, garlic,
stake through the heart.

223
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,107
- That'll get it done.
- Cool!

224
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,068
Of course, I don't actually have
any of those things.

225
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:04,530
Good thinking.

226
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:06,731
Well, the part of my brain
that would tell me to bring that stuff

227
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:09,503
is still busy telling me
not to come down here.

228
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:11,579
- I have this, though.
- Turn that off!

229
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:13,874
OK, OK!

230
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:16,543
- So, what else?
- What else what?

231
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:18,199
For vampire slayage.

232
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,720
Oh, fire, beheading, sunlight, holy water.

233
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:25,011
- The usual.
- You've done some beheading in your time?

234
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:27,180
Oh, yeah. There was this time

235
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:30,155
I was pinned down  by this guy
that played left tackle for varsity... 

236
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,453
Well, he used to before he was a vampire.

237
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:37,441
Anyway, he had this really thick neck,
and all I had was this little X-Acto knife.

238
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,902
You're not loving this story.

239
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:43,073
No, actually, I find it oddly comforting.

240
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:48,286
"For they will gather and be gathered."

241
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,748
"From the Vessel pours life."

242
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,918
Pours life...

243
00:17:56,754 --> 00:18:01,259
"On the night of the crescent moon,
the first past the solstice, it will come."

244
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:05,639
Of course.

245
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:08,976
That's tonight.

246
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:11,521
No!

247
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:14,607
It's supposed to
find the syntax and match it!

248
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,278
- Or wait...
- Are we going to the Bronze tonight?

249
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:22,199
No. We're going
to the other cool place in Sunnydale.

250
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:26,036
Of course we're going to the Bronze.
Friday night? No cover?

251
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,749
But you should have been there last night,
'cause I ran into Buffy.

252
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,252
And could she be any weirder?

253
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:35,825
She attacked me! Do you believe it?

254
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,900
I think we did this part wrong.

255
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:43,128
Why do we have to devise these programs,
isn't that what nerds are for? 

256
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:45,015
What'd she do?

257
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:50,939
She's doing something else.

258
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:54,691
OK. And then "pattern run", right?

259
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:57,447
Or "go to end". That's it!

260
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,531
Maybe.

261
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:02,326
So anyway, I come out of the bathroom
and she comes running at me,

262
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,544
screaming, with a stick,

263
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:08,720
"I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!" I swear!

264
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,169
- Who?
- Buffy.

265
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:12,547
- The new girl.
- What's her deal?

266
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,633
- She's crazed.
- Did you hear about her old school?

267
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:18,011
Booted.

268
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:21,473
- Well, I exhibit no surprise.
- Why was she kicked out?

269
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:25,352
- Because she's a psycho loony.
- No, she's not.

270
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:27,127
What?

271
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:31,550
She's not a psycho.
You don't even know her.

272
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:36,438
Excuse me?
Who gave you permission to exist?

273
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,804
Do I horn in on your private discussions?

274
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:42,110
No. Why? Because you're boring.

275
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:47,543
OK, I think the program's done.

276
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:52,591
Finally the nightmare ends!
OK, so how do we save it?

277
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:57,387
- Deliver.
- Deliver? Where's that?

278
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,682
Oh!

279
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:14,448
- They're close.
- How can you tell?

280
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:17,202
No more rats.

281
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:25,710
- Jesse!
- Oh, no!

282
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:28,464
Jesse?

283
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:30,800
- Xander!
- Jesse, man. Are you OK?

284
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:36,265
I am not OK on an epic scale.
We gotta get outta here.

285
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:39,435
- It's cool. Buffy's a superhero.
- Hold on.

286
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:44,816
Do you think anyone heard that?

287
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:58,748
They knew you were gonna come.
They said that I was the bait.

288
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:00,916
Oh, great. Now you tell us.

289
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,649
- Oops.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

290
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:10,051
- Do you know another way out?
- I don't know. Maybe. Come on.

291
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:18,186
Wait! Wait! They brought me through here.
There should be a way up. I hope.

292
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,531
- I don't think this is the way out.
- We can't fight our way back through them.

293
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:32,243
- What do we do?
- I've got an idea.

294
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:36,237
You can die.

295
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:42,755
- Jesse, man. I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

296
00:21:42,838 --> 00:21:45,925
I feel good, Xander. I feel strong.

297
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:48,052
I'm connected, man, to everything!

298
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:51,723
- I can hear the worms in the earth.
- That's a plus.

299
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:55,102
I know what the Master wants.
I'll serve his purpose.

300
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:57,729
That means you die.

301
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:00,066
- And I feed.
- Xander, the cross!

302
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:06,280
Jesse, man, we're buds.
Don't you remember?

303
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:10,828
- You're like a shadow to me now.
- Then get outta my face.

304
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,839
Help me!

305
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,353
- We need to get out of here.
- There is no out of here.

306
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,608
Up there!

307
00:22:58,338 --> 00:22:59,840
Go!

308
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,560
Xander, pull.

309
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:03,176
She escaped?

310
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:09,062
She walks free when I should be
drinking her heart's blood right now!

311
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:12,212
- Careless.
- Master, we had her trapped.

312
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:14,714
Oh. Are you going to make excuses?

313
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:19,023
You are all weak.

314
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,990
It has been too long
since you have faced a slayer.

315
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:27,563
It is no matter to me.
She will not stop the Harvest.

316
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:33,610
It just means there'll be someone
worth killing when I reach the surface.

317
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:36,239
- Is Luke ready?
- He waits.

318
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:40,535
It's time. Bring him to me. Uh, Collin.

319
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:42,954
You failed me.

320
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:45,583
Tell me you're sorry.

321
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm sorry.

322
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:53,415
There. That wasn't so bad, was it?
Hold on.

323
00:24:54,718 --> 00:24:57,429
You've got something in your eye.

324
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:05,438
- Buffy?
- It's just me.

325
00:25:05,521 --> 00:25:08,941
- So, there's no word?
- Uh, not as yet, no.

326
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:11,694
Well, I'm sure they're great.

327
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:16,116
- Did you find anything of interest?
- I think maybe.

328
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,026
I surfed through the old newspapers

329
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:21,089
around the time of
that big earthquake back in '37.

330
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:24,334
And for several months before,
there were a rash of murders.

331
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,461
Great!

332
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:29,672
I mean, uh, well, not great in a good way.

333
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:31,091
Uh... go on.

334
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:36,180
Well, they sound like the kind
you were looking for. Throats, blood...

335
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:41,144
It's all coming together.

336
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:43,104
I rather wish it weren't.

337
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,453
My blood is your blood.

338
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:37,748
My soul is your soul.

339
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:41,294
My body is your instrument.

340
00:26:44,464 --> 00:26:47,759
On this most hallowed night,

341
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:51,096
we are as one.

342
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,893
Luke is the Vessel.

343
00:26:55,935 --> 00:27:00,440
Every soul he takes will feed me.

344
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:03,109
And their souls

345
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:05,279
will grant me the strength

346
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:08,574
to free myself.

347
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:12,328
Tonight I shall walk the Earth,

348
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:17,501
and the stars themselves will hide!

349
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:25,635
- Did you find Jesse?
- Yeah.

350
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:28,387
- Was he dead?
- Worse.

351
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:35,229
I'm sorry, Willow, but we were too late.

352
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:39,650
- And they were waiting for us.
- At least you two are OK.

353
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:49,167
I don't like vampires. I'm gonna
take a stand and say they're not good.

354
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:52,915
So, Giles, got anything
that could make this day any worse?

355
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:58,276
How about the end of the world?

356
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,370
Knew I could count on you.

357
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:03,844
This is what we know:

358
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:06,358
Some 60 years ago,

359
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:11,097
a very old, very powerful vampire
came to this shore, not just to feed.

360
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:13,520
He came 'cause
this town's a mystical whoozit.

361
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:14,620
Yes.

362
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:19,528
The Spanish who first settled here
called it "Boca del Infierno".

363
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:22,322
Roughly translated "Hellmouth".

364
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:26,828
It's a sort of, um...
portal between this reality and the next.

365
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:30,290
- This vampire hoped to open it.
- Bring the demons back.

366
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:33,209
- End of the world.
- But he blew it.

367
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:37,673
Or, I mean, there was an earthquake
that swallowed half the town, and him too.

368
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:41,552
You see, opening dimensional portals
is a tricky business.

369
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:45,515
Odds are he got himself stuck,
rather like a cork in a bottle.

370
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,948
And this Harvest thing is to get him out.

371
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:51,139
It comes once in a century, on this night.

372
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:55,359
The Master can draw power
from one of his minions while it feeds.

373
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:59,322
Enough power to break free
and open the portal.

374
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,075
The minion is called the Vessel,

375
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,288
and he bears this symbol.

376
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,797
So, I dust anyone sporting that symbol,
and no Harvest.

377
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:16,163
Simply put, yes.

378
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:18,145
Any idea where this
little get-together is being held?

379
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:20,948
- There are a number of possibilities.
- They're going to the Bronze.

380
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:22,603
Are you sure?

381
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:25,541
Come on. All those tasty
young morsels all over the place?

382
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,744
Anyway, that's where
Jesse's gonna be. Trust me.

383
00:29:27,745 --> 00:29:29,692
Then we should get there.

384
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,026
- The sun will be down before long.
- I gotta make a stop. Won't take long.

385
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:35,612
- What for?
- Supplies.

386
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,255
Buffy?

387
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,715
- Mom!
- You're going out?

388
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:57,427
- I have to.
- I didn't hear you come in last night.

389
00:29:57,511 --> 00:29:59,389
I was really quiet.

390
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:03,643
It's happening again, isn't it?
I got a call from your new principal.

391
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:06,771
- Says you missed some classes today.
- I was running an errand.

392
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:09,953
We haven't finished unpacking,
and I'm getting calls from the principal.

393
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,781
Mom, I promise,
it is not gonna be like before.

394
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:15,418
But I have to go.

395
00:30:15,906 --> 00:30:17,909
- No.
- Mom!

396
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:21,663
The tapes all say
I should get used to saying it. No.

397
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:24,249
This is really, really important!

398
00:30:24,332 --> 00:30:28,337
I know. If you don't go out,
it'll be the end of the world.

399
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:32,133
Everything is life or death
when you're a 16-year-old girl.

400
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:35,303
- I don't have time...
- You have all the time in the world.

401
00:30:35,386 --> 00:30:37,931
You're not going anywhere.

402
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:42,686
Now, if you wanna stay up here and sulk,
I won't hold it against you.

403
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:46,608
But if you wanna come down,
I'll make us some dinner.

404
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,365
Senior boys are the only way to go.
Guys from our grade? Forget about it.

405
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:12,452
They're children, you know?
Like Jesse. Did you see him last night?

406
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:15,164
Following me around
like a little puppy dog.

407
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:19,419
You just wanna put him to sleep.
But senior boys?

408
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:24,257
They have mystery. They have...
What's the word I'm searching for?

409
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,136
Cars.
I just am not the type to settle, you know?

410
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:31,390
It's like when I go shopping.
I have to have the most expensive thing.

411
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:33,642
Not because it's expensive,

412
00:32:33,726 --> 00:32:36,730
- but because it costs more.
- You know...

413
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:40,108
Hello? Miss Motor-Mouth?
Can I get a sentence finished?

414
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,110
Oh, I love this song! Come on!

415
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:40,342
What do you want?

416
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:45,514
Hey! Hello?
Caveman-brain, what are you doing?

417
00:33:45,597 --> 00:33:47,683
Shut up.

418
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:51,521
Well, just one dance.

419
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,472
You need ID. Hey!
Nobody gets inside until I get some sorta...

420
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:28,103
Get inside.

421
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,293
Ladies and gentlemen,

422
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:54,716
there is no cause for alarm.

423
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,013
Actually, there is cause for alarm.

424
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:02,724
It just won't do any good.

425
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,440
I thought there was no band tonight.

426
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,068
This is a glorious night!

427
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,656
It is also the last one
any of you shall ever see.

428
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,953
Bring me the first.

429
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,082
What do you guys want, man, huh?
You want money?

430
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,751
Hey, what's wrong with your faces?

431
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,797
Watch me, people.

432
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:35,845
Fear is like an elixir.

433
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,390
It's almost like blood.

434
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:55,575
Next!

435
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:02,833
- It's locked!
- We're too late!

436
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:05,669
- I didn't know Iwas gonna get grounded!
- Can you break it?

437
00:36:05,752 --> 00:36:09,591
No, not that thing. You guys try the
back entrance and I'll find my own way.

438
00:36:09,674 --> 00:36:13,219
- Right. Come on.
- Uh, wait, guys. Here.

439
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:16,160
You get the exit cleared
and the people out. That's all.

440
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:18,319
Don't go Wild Bunch on me.

441
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:21,664
Uh... see you inside, then.

442
00:36:25,157 --> 00:36:26,087
No joy.

443
00:36:26,122 --> 00:36:29,311
We've got to get in there before
Jesse does something stupider than usual.

444
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,123
You listen to me. Jesse is dead.

445
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:36,537
You have to remember that when you see
him, you're not looking at your friend.

446
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:39,373
You're looking at the thing that killed him.

447
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:49,676
Almost free.

448
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:55,058
Give me more!

449
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:03,484
- This one's mine!
- They're all for the Master.

450
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:08,906
I don't get one?

451
00:37:17,082 --> 00:37:21,211
I can feel the Master's strength growing!

452
00:37:24,215 --> 00:37:26,384
I feel him rising!

453
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:32,057
Every soul brings him closer!
I need another!

454
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,600
The Vessel.

455
00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:39,773
Tonight is his ascension!

456
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:43,778
Tonight will be history at its end!

457
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:47,115
Yours is a glorious sacrifice,

458
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,536
degradation most holy.

459
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:57,167
What? No volunteers?

460
00:37:57,835 --> 00:37:59,921
Here's a pretty one.

461
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:02,299
No!

462
00:38:09,348 --> 00:38:12,101
Oh, I'm sorry!
Were you in the middle of something?

463
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:13,271
You!

464
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:16,148
You didn't think I'd miss this. Did you?

465
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:20,152
- I hoped you'd come.
- Be right down.

466
00:38:35,251 --> 00:38:37,338
OK, Vessel boy.

467
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:42,426
- You want blood?
- I want yours.

468
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:44,595
Only yours.

469
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,432
Works for me.

470
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,052
Hurry!

471
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:33,608
Come on out, let's go!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

472
00:39:33,692 --> 00:39:36,570
Hurry up! Come on, let's go!
Come on! This way!

473
00:39:49,668 --> 00:39:51,753
Heads up.

474
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,806
Hold still!

475
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:05,935
- You're not making this easy.
- Jesse, man. Don't make me do it.

476
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:09,148
Buddy!

477
00:40:09,231 --> 00:40:13,402
I always wanted to kill a slayer.

478
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:19,743
One at a time! Quickly!
We're gonna have to open the front as well.

479
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:25,790
Jesse, I know
there's still a part of you in there.

480
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:30,088
OK. Let's... deal with this.

481
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:32,208
Jesse was an excruciating loser 

482
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,759
who couldn't get a date with anyone
in the sighted community!

483
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:37,763
Look at me. I'm a new man!

484
00:40:37,846 --> 00:40:43,644
Master, taste of this and be free.

485
00:40:48,942 --> 00:40:50,109
How'd it taste?

486
00:40:54,823 --> 00:40:56,742
Get off of him!

487
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:11,049
All right. Put me out of my misery.

488
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:14,887
You don't have the gu...

489
00:41:21,227 --> 00:41:25,065
You forget. Metal can't hurt me.

490
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:27,901
There's something you forgot about, too.

491
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,070
Sunrise.

492
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,878
It's in about nine hours, moron.

493
00:41:58,543 --> 00:42:02,539
No!

494
00:42:03,385 --> 00:42:08,962
No!

495
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:28,135
She did it.

496
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:30,304
I'll be damned.

497
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,274
I take it it's over.

498
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:44,152
Did we win?

499
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:49,825
Well, we averted the apocalypse.
I'd give us points for that.

500
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:52,078
One thing's for sure.

501
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:54,414
Nothing's ever gonna be the same.

502
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:57,459
Wait up!

503
00:42:58,835 --> 00:43:01,964
Well, I heard it was rival gangs, you know.
Fighting for turf.

504
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,759
But all I can tell you is
they were an ugly way of looking.

505
00:43:04,842 --> 00:43:08,680
And Buffy, like, knew them.
Which is just too weird.

506
00:43:08,763 --> 00:43:11,724
I don't even remember much,
but I'm telling you, it was a freak show.

507
00:43:11,808 --> 00:43:13,183
God, I wish I'd been there.

508
00:43:13,184 --> 00:43:15,526
You should have been there.
It was so creepy.

509
00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:20,484
- What exactly were you expecting?
- I don't know. Something.

510
00:43:20,568 --> 00:43:23,166
I mean, the dead rose.
We should at least have an assembly.

511
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:27,617
People have a tendency to rationalize
what they can and forget what they can't.

512
00:43:27,701 --> 00:43:31,414
- Believe me. I've seen it happen.
- Well, I'll never forget it. None of it.

513
00:43:31,497 --> 00:43:34,333
- Good. Next time you'll be prepared.
- Next time?

514
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,085
Next time is why?

515
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:39,745
We prevented the Master from freeing
himself and opening the Mouth of Hell.

516
00:43:39,746 --> 00:43:41,767
That's not to say
he's going to stop trying. 

517
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:44,428
- I'd say the fun is just beginning.
- More vampires?

518
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,394
Not just vampires.

519
00:43:46,395 --> 00:43:49,151
The next threat we face
may be something quite different.

520
00:43:49,186 --> 00:43:50,724
I can hardly wait.

521
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,980
We are at the centre
of a mystical convergence here.

522
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:58,268
We may, in fact, stand between
the Earth and its total destruction.

523
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:02,698
Well, I gotta look on the bright side.
Maybe I can still get kicked out of school.

524
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:05,553
Oh, yeah, that's a plan. 'Cause
lots of schools aren't on Hellmouths.

525
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:08,830
Maybe you could blow something up.
They're really strict about that.

526
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:11,070
I was thinking of a
more subtle approach, you know?

527
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:13,790
Like... excessive not studying.

528
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:16,254
The Earth is doomed!

529
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:22,261
