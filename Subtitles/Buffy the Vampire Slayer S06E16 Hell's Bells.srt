1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,956
Previously:

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,355
If I'd known you were comin',
I'd have baked a cake.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,993
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,873
- Tell me you want me.
- I always want you.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,798
Anya, you wanna marry me?

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,114
Yes.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,117
- We're getting married.
- Congratulations.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,800
Wedding, one week! We have friends, family,

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,388
demons flying in,
a to-do list getting no shorter...

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,317
Can we not do this now?

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,635
I don't think this is gonna work.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,910
Are you saying you're gonna leave me?

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,949
Big wedding coming up.
You and Tara are speaking again.

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,596
- You wanna call her? Invite her over?
- No. Too soon for so bold a manoeuvre.

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,314
- It's over.
- I've memorised this tune, love.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,159
I'm using you, and it's killing me.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,795
I'm sorry, William.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,198
I know there's been a lot of loss.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,039
People have a tendency to go away.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,596
And sometimes I wish
I could just make them stop.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,471
Wish granted.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,270
Buffy, it's hideous.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,551
Oh, my God, Buffy. Look at its arms.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,635
I know.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,435
But it's my duty. I'm Buffy the bridesmaid.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,238
Duty, schmuty. I'm supposed to be best man.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,955
Shouldn't I be all Marlene Dietrich-y
in a dashing tuxedo number?

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,308
No.

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,673
That would be unfair. We must share equally
in the cosmic joke that is bridesmaids-dom.

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,150
Well, maybe if I ask Anya, I can still go
with the traditional blood larva and burlap.

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,078
She was a vengeance demon
for a thousand years.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,556
She would know
all the most flattering larvae.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,869
What was she thinking?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,434
She's probably too stressed to be thinking,

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,870
what with Xander's relatives and her demons.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,389
Oh, my God, last night,
the rehearsal dinner.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,230
It was like a zoo without the table manners.
And I bet it got worse after we left.

38
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,433
I can't believe everyone bought that story
about Anya's people being circus folk.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,314
Did you see the guy with the tentacles?
What's he? Inky the Squid Boy?

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,031
And Xander's family. I haven't seen them
that bad since my Bat Mitzvah.

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,995
- Did you see how much they drank?
- Kinda. Mr Harris threw up in my purse.

42

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,355
You guys look so beautiful!

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,476
This is the happiest day of my whole life!

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,155
You seen my cuff links, Uncle Rory?
Metal deals, hold my sleeves together?

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,955
You don't want those.
What you really want is Velcro.

47
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,073
- Did I ever tell you how that was my idea?
- 'Scuse me. How you doin'?

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,111
Good.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,551
Rory? What you doin' there?

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,878
I'm tryin' to make myself an Irish coffee,
but this stupid thing is on the fritz.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,468
Watch it, it's still plugged in.

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,598
Gotcha.

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,030
Oh, is that broken?
You want me to take a look at that?

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,870
Knock yourself out there, Kevin.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,070
It's Krelvin.

56
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,555
Right. Right. Krelvin.

57
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,678
- Xander, you're not ready yet?
- Look at my hair.

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,315
It doesn't really matter
cos I won't be in any of the pictures.

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,069
- You'll be in the pictures, Mom.
- I think your hair looks lovely.

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,476
How's about some breakfast?

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,798
Well, I guess if I'm a little plump
it doesn't matter cos I won't really be...

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,152
- You'll be in the pictures, Ma!
- That's one of hers, right?

63
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,878
You're one of hers, right?

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,310
- You met Krelvin already, Dad. Last night.
- Yeah. We met.

65
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,477
You said I resembled your mother-in-law.

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,989
- Tony!
- Oh, yeah.

67
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,352
And then you hit me with a cocktail wiener,
and then you insulted my heritage.

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,277
Heritage?

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,597
Bein' circus folks
is suddenly heritage now?

70
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,440
I mean no disrespect, of course.

71
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:18,593
I'm sure you come from a
long, proud line of geeks.

72
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,757
- Kidding. Just kidding.
- Xander? Xander.

73
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,191
You know that guy Kevin?
If he could clear up the skin problem,

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,279
do you think... do you suppose
he'd date a woman with a kid?

75
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,472
I mean, I really can't afford
to be very picky.

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,149
Cousin Carol, your earrings
are my cuff links.

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,478
They are? Oh, my. Oops.

78
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,703
Excellent. Cuff links - check.
We're rollin'.

79
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,470
Nothing on earth can stop this wedding now.

80
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,754
- Is it too small?
- Nah.

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,229
It fit when I picked up the tux.
How can it not fit now?

82
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,873
It'll fit.

83
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,435
Man, what if it doesn't?

84
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,190
What if I can't wear my kummerbund, and
the world can see my pants meet my shirt?

85
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,312
Buffy, that cannot happen.
I must wear das kummerbund!

86
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,034
And so you shall!

87
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,428
- You got it!
- Slayer strength.

88
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,836
I've been meanin' to cut back
on that habit-forming oxygen.

89
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,795
Look at you. You look great,
Mr About To Get Married. Glowing.

90
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
Oh, my God! Maybe you're pregnant!

91
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,597
Maybe. I dunno. Maybe I'm just happy.

92
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,909
Teary.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,791
Good. Good teary.

94
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,435
Happy teary?
Not frustrated-with-bow-tie teary?

95
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,948
Yes. Happy.

96
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,991
Happy for you.

97
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,193
That makes me happy for me.
You and Anya give me hope.

98
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,311
It's like you two are proof

99
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,116
that there's light at the end of
this very long, long, nasty tunnel.

100
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,796
And I cannot tie this tie. Where's your
best man? Isn't she supposed to do this?

101
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,797
She said she had something to do.

102
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,672
- Want me to hold it shut for you?
- OK.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,117
Are you guys even listening?
I need feedback, people.

104
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,358
- Sorry. Please continue with the vows.
- OK.

105
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,994
"I, Anya, promise to...

106
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,875
love you, to cherish you, to honour you,
but not to obey you, of course -

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,915
that's anachronistic and misogynistic and
who do you think you are, a sea captain?"

108
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,032
"However, I do entrust you... "

109
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,156
- What? Is something funny?
- No, nothing, sweetie. Just keep still.

110
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,396
OK. Blah, blah, blah, misogynistic.

111
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,799
Blah, blah... "I do, however,
entrust you with my heart. "

112
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,673
"Take care of my heart, won't you, please?"

113
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,314
"Take care of it because
it's all that I have. "

114
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,989
"And, if you let me,
I'll take care of your heart too. "

115
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,277
"I'll protect it and tend to it,
like a little stray. "

116
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,188
Wait, no. "Like a little
mangy stray that needs a home. "

117
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,470
No, that's not it either.

118
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,393
I think we're all set here.

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,909
Let's take a look at you.

120
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,793
Wow.

121
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,639
You look lovely. Really lovely.

122
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,188
Thanks. It's probably the blush
of imprudent spending.

123
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,869
Do you think Xander will like it?
Oh, I want to see Xander now!

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,391
You can't. It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride in her dress, remember?

125
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,672
Right. I can't keep all these
ridiculous traditions straight.

126
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,954
What if I'm not wearing my dress
when I see him? OK, no sex. Cuddling?

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,231
It's just I'm so excited
and I want to share it with my best friend.

128
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,511
I get to be with my best friend for ever!

129
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,978
Guess who agreed to be my date
for tonight.

130
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,236
I'm really supposed to be working.

131
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,672
- I'm one of the caterers.
- Oh, hush. No woman of mine is gonna work.

132
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,032
All you have to do is sit pretty,
and laugh when I tell a good one.

133
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,277
Tell her what a funny guy I am, Dawnie.

134
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,550
Gotta go. Enjoy the wedding.

135
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,473
- Oh, bad head.
- What?

136
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,087
Well, the lip wasn't split right.

137
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:50,038
You gotta grab the lip between
your thumb and your finger,

138
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,153
and then you have to slice
right through the centre of the meat.

139
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,875
It was my trade. I used to stuff things.

140
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,797
I still do.

141
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,638
But only for fun.

142
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,711
- Hymen's greetings.
- Hy... what?

143
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,355
Hymen, the god of matrimony.
His salutations upon you.

144
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,431
May the love we celebrate today
avoid an almost inevitable decline.

145
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,549
Cool.

146
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,194
I brought a gift. I suppose there's a table.

147
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,797
- Halfrek.
- Please, call me Hallie!

148
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,436
- We're practically family now.
- Neat. I can put this on the table for you.

149
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,120
- Thank you. Careful, it's...
- Fragile?

150
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,958
Squirmy.

151
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,999
So, Dawnie, how's everything?

152
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,238
Going good?
Nothing you wish was different?

153
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,831
For Yekk's sake, take a day off. We're not
here to do vengeance, we're here to mingle.

154
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,909
Oh, look. It's Katrika Whatshername.
What has she done with...?

155
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,198
- Spike!
- I want you to meet my date.

156
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,310
Hi. I'm Dawn.

157
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,192
So, yeah. Anyway, that's my date.
She's with me. My date for the wedding.

158
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,472
Yeah.

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,636
OK. Well, nice meeting you.

160
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,590
So, circus folk. What's that like?

161
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,958
Your friend - the fella with the warts -

162
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,949
went off on his circus "heritage",
like you folks are all in some kind of cult.

163
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,594
Well, there are ancient ways.

164
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,915
Clowning, as an occupation,

165
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,158
grew out of the commedia dell'arte,
and ancient sports, of course.

166
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,499
If you expect Xander to bring up
his kids in some kind of...

167
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:53,833
foreign-speaky
bow-to-the-easty kinda cult...

168
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,191
You think children should be raised
in ignorance of our ways?

169
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,871
No, the Harrises are very broad-minded.
We're Episcopalians.

170
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,469
"Till death do us part. "

171
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,470
That's what cracks me up.
Hit me again, barkeep.

172
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,831
- How do I look?
- Well, let's see.

173
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,838
Found your shoes. Your fly's zipped.

174
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,468
I'd say you look like
you're ready to get married.

175
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,950
You're one of the decent ones, Xander.
I hope I'm as lucky as you guys someday.

176
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,868
You wanna get lucky?
I've still got, what, 15, 20 minutes.

177
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,115
All right. Into the breach with you.

178
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,995
OK, breach me. Now, let's go over the list
one more time. Number one?

179
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,953
- Don't let your dad near the bar.
- Check. Number two?

180
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,638
- Don't let your mom near the bar.
- Check.

181
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,116
- Hey, Buffy. Spike brought a total skank.
- A...?

182
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,676
A Manic Panic freak he's macking with
in the middle of the room.

183
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,678
- I saw him shove his tongue...
- Spike brought a date?

184
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,870
Yeah. Wait till you see her.

185
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,474
Guys, I better go meet and greet.

186
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,229
Just go ahead. I'll be a sec.

187
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,470
Hey, congratulations.

188
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,394
Congratulations, there, son.

189
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,634
- Hello, young man.
- Oh, Xander...

190
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,833
Alexander, do you realise that
the usher sat us in the third row?

191
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,030
- I'm sure it was a mistake.
- I don't think...

192
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,833
- Excuse me.
- Do you know where the photographer is?

193
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,793
- I've got a proposition for him...
- I need to talk to you.

194
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,198
- Xander, one of Anya's presents got loose!
- Got loose?

195
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,551
It's a fully alive squiggly thingy -
and why is Halfrek a bridesmaid?

196
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,389
Please, please,
you have got to listen to me!

197
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,274
You can't get married today.
It's a huge mistake.

198
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,070
Yeah, right. Thanks for the advice,
Uncle... Help me here.

199
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,069
- Uncle? You don't recognise me, do you?
- I'm sorry, I don't...

200
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,159
This sounds crazy, I know,
but you have to believe me.

201
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,676
I'm Xander Harris.

202
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,396
I'm you.

203
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,749
- What do you mean, you're me?
- I'm you.

204
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,553
I'm you from the future.

205
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,854
Oh, from the future!
I thought you were a nutball,

206
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:45,759
- but now that you're from the future...
- Please listen to me.

207
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:48,792
I found my way back to warn you,
to tell you...

208
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,832
- Easy. Everything's gonna be all right.
- Toast!

209
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,286
That's why I told that guy no drinks
before the ceremony.

210
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,592
Toast! A toast to the Harris clan.

211
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,918
- Look, I can prove it to you.
- I know we've had problems...

212
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,595
I thought you might need convincing.

213
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,998
- Anya's crew make mine look good.
- Come on. Follow me.

214
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,998
And to my wife, Jessica.

215
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,270
Where are you, honey?

216
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,156
There she is.

217
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,797
To my wife.

218
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,673
What would I do without you, beautiful?

219
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,230
Well, for starters, I probably
wouldn't need to drink so much, would I?

220
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,872
On the brighter side, marriage has probably
saved me from a nasty dose of the clap.

221
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,877
Here's to ya.

222
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,039
- Does this jerk ever shut up?
- He's startin' to make my suckers twitch.

223
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,712
And a toast to the bride's
dermatologically-challenged family shrub.

224
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,196
- Sit down!
- I paid for all this!

225
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,869
You want me to sit down,
you cough up a couple of grand, Squidly.

226
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,872
What'd you call me,
you drunken piece of sh...?

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,230
- Mazel tov!
- What's this?

228
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,718
You must be so happy for Xander on his very
special, once-in-a-lifetime day, Mr Harris.

229
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,593
Nice chassis. What's under the hood?

230
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,734
You know, I could use
a strong cup of coffee.

231
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:18,430
Let's get you one too. What do you say?

232
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,917
- Did you own a little square pinkish purse?
- I did.

233
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,828
I thought so. What do you say we slip
in the back room and I show you my...

234
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,318
You finish that sentence and I guarantee
you won't have anything to show.

235
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,950
- What is it?
- It's magic.

236
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,311
Very powerful. Look at it.

237
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,356
You'll see what I've seen.

238
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,755
Feel what I've felt.

239
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,636
Get the hell away from me!
Dad, Josh is teasing me.

240
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,752
Sara's a weirdo! Sara's a weirdo!

241
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,438
What?

242
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,994
You goin' out again?

243
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,476
- I'm doing a makeover party.
- I thought you hated those.

244
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,429
Well, one of us has to make some money.

245
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,791
Well, what do you want me to do?
I can't work. My back's shot.

246
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,311
- And whose fault is that?
- Oh, no. Not the Buffy thing again.

247
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,874
You had no business
fighting demons with her.

248
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,072
Buffy needed me. I had to help.

249
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,231
Well, it didn't save her, did it?
All it did was ruin our lives.

250
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,590
I'll be late.

251
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,629
I hope you crash in your stupid pink car!

252
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,518
- What?
- I hate this place.

253
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,757
- You know I don't eat wheat.
- You don't eat anything, freak.

254
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,440
- At least I'm not a mama's boy.
- At least I'm not a freak.

255
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,870
- Dad, make him cut it!
- You should talk to your mother about that.

256
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,793
You've had too much wine.

257
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,435
Have I? I'm just saying
maybe you should talk to your daughter!

258
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,243
I hate you guys! I know
that you're not my real dad,

259
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:35,509
and I hate you. I hate you both.

260
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,949
I wish you'd die!

261
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,793
This sucks.

262
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,110
If you were so unhappy,
why didn't you leave?

263
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,073
I wanted to. I should have!

264
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,510
Yeah. Maybe I would have gotten
some touch in the past 20 years.

265
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,953
- I wasn't the one who stopped touching!
- Oh! Maybe, but you weren't touchin' me!

266
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,789
What did you expect me to do?
You wouldn't come near me after Buffy...

267
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,071
- Don't bring her into this!
- Fine. Forget her.

268
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,273
Maybe you were just born
to be a bitter, angry old man.

269
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,911
- Shut up.
- No! I want my life back!

270
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,514
If I hadn't married you I wouldn't have
had to hate myself for the last 30 years!

271
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,755
Shut up!

272
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,750
- I'm so sorry. I didn't want to show you.
- What happened? What was that?

273
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,714
A glimpse of your future,
harnessed by magic.

274
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,990
Is she OK? What did I do?

275
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,353
Listen. I don't have long here. The spell
that brought me back, it won't last.

276
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,310
But you can change things.

277
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,149
It doesn't have to go like this.

278
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,794
- But you can't marry Anya.
- But...

279
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,879
You'll hurt her less today
than you will later. Believe me.

280
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,909
Sometimes, two people...

281
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,396
all they bring each other is pain.

282
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,434
Hello, Buffy.

283
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,633
Hey.

284
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,714
It's a happy occasion.

285
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,515
You meet my friend?

286
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,279
No. Not yet.

287
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,279
But she seems like a very nice attempt
at making me jealous.

288
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,196
Is it working?

289
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,788
A little.

290
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,593
It doesn't change anything,

291
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,234
but if you're wildly curious...

292
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,156
yeah, it hurts.

293
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,478
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,716
Or... good!

295
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,436
- You want us to go?
- No.

296
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,270
No, you have every right to be here.
I pretty much deserve...

297
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,755
That's not true.

298
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,871
God, this is hard.

299
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,558
Yeah.

300
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,156
I think we'll go.

301
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,510
Go where? Your place?

302
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,396
Yeah, I suppose.

303
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,756
- That was the idea.
- Yeah.

304
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,996
- Evil.
- Of course.

305
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,076
But I won't...

306
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,156
or...

307
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,397
I'll just go. Give my best to whatever...
the happy couple.

308
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,199
I will.

309
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,035
It's nice to watch you be happy.

310
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,876
For them, even.

311
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,551
I don't see it a lot.

312
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,638
You glow.

313
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,313
That's because the dress is radioactive.

314
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,676
- I should...
- Yeah.

315
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,478
But it hurts?

316
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,118
Yeah.

317
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,718
Thanks.

318
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,316
You're welcome.

319
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,590
- Let's go.
- What about the wedding?

320
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,995
Let's just piss off, all right?

321
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,360
I'll say this for the Y-chromosome:

322
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,389
looks good in a tux.

323
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,232
Well, your double Xs
don't look too bad there, either.

324
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,629
You're getting married. My little Xander.

325
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,320
All growed up.

326
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,639
It's a good thing I realised I was gay,
otherwise you, me and formalwear...

327
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,952
- Do you know how much I love you?
- About half as much as I love you.

328
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,755
You ready for the long walk?

329
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,590
Just give me a sec.
I wanna work on my vows.

330
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,633
Take your time. It's not like
we can start the wedding without you.

331
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,995
"I, Anya, promise to cherish you... "

332
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,236
No, not cherish.

333
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,869
"I promise to have sex with you
whenever I want,

334
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,599
and pledge to be your friend,

335
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,154
your wife, and your confidante,

336
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,317
- and your sex poodle... "
- Sex poodle?

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,230
Yeah. Why?

338
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,592
I'm not sure you should say
"sex poodle" in your vows.

339
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,156
The music.
They're playing the music! This is it.

340
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,995
Are you ready to go?

341
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,034
He's gone. Xander disappeared.

342
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,073
What? Xander's gone? What should we do?

343
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,751
I'm gonna go look for him.
I'm gonna find him. And you're gonna stall.

344
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,955
Sorry about that. There's just
gonna be a little bit of a delay.

345
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,116
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing!

346
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,596
Nothing's wrong. It's just the minister.

347
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,198
He had to go and perform
an emergency C-section.

348
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,470
- C-section?
- Yeah!

349
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,309
He's not just a minister,
he's also a doctor.

350
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,150
He's half-minister, half-doctor.
He's a mini-tor.

351
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,791
Not to be confused with a Minotaur,
because he's all man,

352
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,515
this doctor-minister man -
no bull parts whatsoever.

353
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,717
So it should just be a couple of minutes.

354
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,512
OK.

355
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,553
OK.

356
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,476
For the last time.

357
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,474
"I, Anya,

358
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,636
want to marry you, Xander,

359
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,672
because I love you

360
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,075
and I'll always love you. "

361
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,593
"And before I knew you, I was
a completely different person. "

362
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,551
"Not even a person, really. "

363
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,395
"I had seen what love could do to people,

364
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,876
and it was hurt and sadness. "

365
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,956
"Alone was better. "

366
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,311
"And then, suddenly, there was you,

367
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,356
and you knew me. "

368
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,759
"You saw me, and it was this thing. "

369
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,349
"You make me feel safe and warm. "

370
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,114
"So, I get it now. "

371
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,032
"I finally get love, Xander. "

372
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,674
"I really do. "

373
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,277
- I'm bored.
- It's a wedding, honey. We're all bored.

374
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,629
No! No, it's not what you think.

375
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,111
Beautiful.

376
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,832
What's going on?

377
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,395
I mean, I am sorry, but what the hell
was that minister thinking?

378
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,911
- I don't know. He...
- Delivering a baby on my special day.

379
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,198
It's totally rude of him - and the mother.

380
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,716
Why couldn't he have just
told her to hold it?

381
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,234
Give me a double Jack.

382
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,590
This is a disaster.

383
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,154
It's that Anya. I know it.

384
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,879
She made us pay for the whole thing
and now she's gonna louse it up. Women!

385
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,560
I offered to help. She didn't want my help.

386
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,191
This totally isn't happening.
We should've known she'd never...

387
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,709
I am worried about Anya.

388
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,718
Oh, sure. Of course you are.

389
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,637
Oh, Halfrek.

390
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,832
You know I love all my demons equally.

391
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,994
Buffy, you've gotta do something.

392
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,351
So, who here's from out of town?

393
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,876
My family is worse.

394
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,468
No way. Mine is so messed up
you have no idea.

395
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,276
Wait until you see my mom dance at the
reception and then tell me who's messed up.

396
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,393
- I guess they're all messed up.
- Yeah. Everybody's pretty lame.

397
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,229
- First word!
- One word!

398
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,510
Animal?

399
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,356
Bull!

400
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,633
- Anya, wait up!
- This bride waits for no one.

401
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,356
If the minister's not here yet, we just
have to get married without a minister.

402
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,834
Jeez. What is the hold-up?

403
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,716
Can you keep a secret?

404
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,991
Nobody knows this, but the groom,
he took off and no one can find him.

405
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,394
What?

406
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,036
- I'll catch you later, Dawn.
- Xander's gone? Xander's missing?

407
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,954
What do you mean, Xander's missing?

408
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,312
It's a joke. Xander's playing a joke.

409
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,149
It's like one time, at one of Carol's
weddings, I had this ape suit...

410
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,477
Oh, great. Another Harris family joke.

411
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,034
Why don't you have another drink?

412
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,392
Drinking is the only way I can dull the pain

413
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,478
of looking at your ugly face.

414
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,075
Think real hard about this, Harris.

415
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,317
Don't touch me
with those nasty circus things!

416
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,076
That's it!

417
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,069
Thanks.

418
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,156
- You OK?
- Yeah.

419
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,475
Xander? Have you seen Xander?
Has anyone seen Xander?

420
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,149
Well, I saw him go into
the trophy room with that guy!

421
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,714
You. You were talking to Xander right
before he left. What did he say to you?

422
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,197
- What did you say to him?
- Doesn't matter now, does it? It's done.

423
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,118
What's done? Did you...? If you
said something to make him leave...

424
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,837
You'll what? Haven't changed a bit.
Still as vindictive as ever.

425
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,990
Do I know you?

426
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,040
You don't recognise me, Anya?

427
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,993
I'm not the man I used to be. I know.

428
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,836
Guys! Will you break it up?

429
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,592
Xander.

430
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,674
Where is he? You tell me, old man!

431
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,519
- You tell me why he left!
- He left because of you.

432
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,157
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, really?

433
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,716
What about this?

434
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,158
Tell me what you did with Xander.
What are you?

435
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,192
You did this. You brought this on.

436
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,232
I've waited a long time for this, Anyanka.

437
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,157
- Who are you?
- Remember Chicago?

438
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,794
South Side, 1914?

439
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,995
Stewart Burns, philanderer!

440
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,235
You'd think you'd remember.
I remember you. But you ruined my life.

441
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,995
You were a...

442
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,236
- I punished you.
- That's right.

443
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,749
Some hussy I'd been taking around
summons you.

444
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,714
Next thing I know, I look like this
and I'm being tortured in another dimension.

445
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,990
- I forgot.
- Well, I didn't!

446
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,911
Every day I remembered...

447
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,742
and every day I thought how I would
somehow get here,

448
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:46,034
and ruin your life
like you ruined mine.

449
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,958
It didn't take much, either. I scared off
your fiancé with a couple of phoney visions.

450
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,357
Visions of what?

451
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,156
Your future.
Or his nightmare vision of your future.

452
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,037
- That's it? That's all you did?
- Yeah.

453
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,071
It was easy.

454
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,875
Look at that, you're crying. I like that.

455
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,076
- Stop it.
- Cry, Anyanka, cry.

456
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,152
I love to see you cry.
And now I'd love to see you scream.

457
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,436
Come any closer and I'll kill her.

458
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,233
I'm so glad you're here.

459
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,199
It was all lies, what he showed you.

460
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:51,911
It wasn't true, he just
wanted to break us up.

461
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,516
- It doesn't matter now.
- So we'll be OK?

462
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,676
Excuse me.

463
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,436
- It's dead.
- Yup.

464
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,312
Is anyone else waiting for it to go poof?

465
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,193
Maybe we can cover it with flowers.

466
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,714
Look at this damage.
I'm not payin' for this, you freaks!

467
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,229
Stop calling us freaks!

468
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,516
Oh, no! No, not again! No!

469
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,796
Stop it!

470
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,395
Everyone sit down!

471
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,913
This wedding will go on,
so get back in your seats!

472
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,830
You know, it's bad luck
to see me in my dress.

473
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,398
It's OK. It's all over now. He's dead,
and it was just smoke and mirrors.

474
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,036
I know.

475
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,672
So...

476
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,716
- we're ready now. Let's get married.
- I...

477
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,318
I'm not...

478
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,316
I'm not ready.

479
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,076
I can't, An, I'm sorry.

480
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,518
But it wasn't real.
What he showed you, it wasn't real.

481
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,552
I know it wasn't real.

482
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,194
But it could be.

483
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,872
What was it? Was it about me?
Cos he wanted you to hate me, Xander.

484
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,629
It wasn't you.

485
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,990
It wasn't you I was hating.

486
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,837
I had these thoughts and fears before this.

487
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,958
- Maybe we just went too fast.
- Look, everybody has thoughts.

488
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,477
It's natural, it doesn't mean
getting married is wrong.

489
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,832
- I know, I know.
- Look, you're just shaken up, OK?

490
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,191
You just calm down and we'll start over, OK?

491
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,316
We can't start over.

492
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,469
If this is a mistake, it's for ever.
And I don't wanna hurt you.

493
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,675
Not that way.

494
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,316
I'm sorry.

495
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,670
- But...
- I am so sorry.

496
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,274
Should we do something for her?

497
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,315
Anything?

498
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,228
She wants to be alone.
That's what she wants.

499
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,950
Oh, God, it just hurts
my heart to think of her.

500
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,957
I know. The whole thing hurts my heart.

501
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,599
- I thought they were happy.
- They were. I know they were.

502
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,200
They were supposed to be my light at the end
of the tunnel. I guess they were a train.

503
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,436
Why did this happen?

504
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,516
I don't know.

505
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,829
I feel like I should be hating Xander.

506
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,916
But I can't.

507
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,236
I just...

508
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,796
I just hope he's OK.

509
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,956
I wonder where he is.

510
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,394
Not much to explain.

511
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,875
Air conditioner's busted.

512
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,714
That's it. Checkout's at 11.

513
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,036
Are you OK?

514
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,993
I'm tired of crying.

515
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,914
I'm just so tired, D'Hoffryn.

516
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,196
Oh, Anyanka.

517
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,276
I'm sorry.

518
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,711
But you let him domesticate you.

519
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,513
When you were a vengeance demon,
you were powerful.

520
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,110
At the top of your game,
you crushed men like him.

521
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,397
It's time you got back to
what you do best, don't you think?

522
