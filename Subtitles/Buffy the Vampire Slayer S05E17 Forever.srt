1
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:05,401
- What're you doin'?
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:08,724
- Your mother's dead.
- She just wouldn't believe me.

3
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:11,005
Oh, God.

4
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:14,367
- I still don't think she does.
- I'm not real.

5
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:18,890
You're the Key. Go. Before
she finds you. She's here.

7
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:02,443
Buffy, you're here.

8
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:07,005
- You all right?
- Yeah.

9
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:09,847
Did you find something?

10
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,771
This one.

11
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:17,531
It's a fine choice. It speaks of
your deep feeling for the deceased.

12
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:33,688
- You don't like it?
- No, it's not that.

13
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:37,325
It's just, what if Mom...

14
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:42,287
What if she'd like something else better?

15
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:46,045
- Dawn...
- I mean, how do we know for sure?

16
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:50,047
She's the one who has to be in it for ever.

17
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:53,805
Dawn, maybe it wasn't such
a good idea you coming along.

18
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:56,244
It's fine.

19
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,051
It's...

20
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:01,689
I'm serious. You shouldn't
have to deal with this stuff.

21
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:06,165
- If you'd like a few more minutes to decide...
- No. It's done. It's fine.

22
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,406
OK?

23
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,924
OK.

24
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:19,006
..prices in different florist's. And the
funeral home seems to be fairly competitive.

25
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:22,768
- Let's just go with that. It's simpler.
- What colour flowers?

26
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:27,887
- White? They're nice.
- Yeah.

27
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:29,804
What about an announcement?

28
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:33,647
People are gonna expect a wake after
the burial, unless we say something.

29
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:37,806
We could say in the programme
your mother preferred not to have one.

30
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:40,771
- There's no wake?
- Mom didn't like them.

31
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:45,284
She said that potlucks
are depressing enough as it is.

32
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,253
She said that? When?

33
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:51,846
Right before she went in for the operation.

34
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:55,767
We had a talk about
what she wanted, in case...

35
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:59,526
She never said anything to me.

36
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:02,491
I'm sure she just didn't
wanna upset you, Dawnster.

37
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:06,009
You'd better get working on that dinner.
You've barely touched it.

38
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:08,084
You really should eat something.

39
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:11,609
- Why should I? You're not.
- This isn't about...

40
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:17,487
I'm all phoned out.
Will you? Unless it's my dad.

41
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,564
Of course. Hello?

42
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,691
Yes. Yes, they did. Thank you.

43
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:30,525
The funeral is at three tomorrow.
Do you know the Brown Brothers' mortuary?

44
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:34,572
- Can't believe he still hasn't called.
- Your dad's still AWOL, huh?

45
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:39,529
The number he left for us in Spain is no good,
and I've left messages everywhere.

46
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:45,682
How about a line that says "After the burial
there will be no wake"? Or "gathering"?

47
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:51,048
"At the request of Joyce there will be
no gathering"? That sounds lame.

48
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,487
What are we gonna do? After, I mean.

49
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:00,526
Are we just gonna come back here?

50
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:07,252
I don't know. I guess so. How about "At the
request of the family, there will be no wake"?

51
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,052
- Good, yeah.
- I don't wanna be here.

52
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:13,648
Do you put it at the top,
orjust a small line at the bottom?

53
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,042
Can I go to your place tomorrow?

54
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,767
- Tomorrow?
- After everything.

55
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:25,562
Well, maybe you and Buffy should...

56
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:28,208
I don't mind.

57
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:30,932
- Can I?
- Huh?

58
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,524
Can I go to Willow's
tomorrow after the service?

59
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:40,282
If you want to. I guess so.

60
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:45,290
I'll get my sleeping bag out of the attic.

61
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:55,003
- You goin' home?
- I'm gonna stop by my mom's first.

62
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:59,689
- Been doing that a lot lately.
- Yeah. I might stop by your mom's too.

63
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:03,682
Well, I'm not going to my place.
Those people are scary.

64
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:05,644
Speaking of...

65
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,647
You have got to be kidding.

66
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:12,444
- I'm not going in.
- And you're not leaving those.

67
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:15,726
You think you'll score
points with Buffy this way?

68
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:18,407
- This isn't about Buffy.
- Bull.

69
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:21,328
We're all hip to your doomed obsession.

70
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,970
They're for Joyce.

71
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:27,523
- Like you care about her.
- Guys, guys, not here.

72
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:31,606
Care? Joyce was the only one
of the lot of you that I could stand.

73
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:35,567
And the only one with a daughter
you wanted to shag. I'm touched.

74
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:39,692
I liked the lady. Understand, Monkey Boy?

75
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,725
She was decent. She didn't put on airs.

76
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:49,367
She always had a nice cuppa for me.
And she never treated me like a freak.

77
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:54,209
- Her mistake.
- Think what you want.

78
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,004
Unbelievable.

79
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:03,565
The guy thinks he can put on a big show
and con Buffy into being his sex monkey.

80
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:07,407
Xander, he didn't leave a card.

81
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:57,485
We commend to Almighty God
our sister, Joyce Summers...

82
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,207
and we commit her body to the ground.

83
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,244
Earth to earth...

84
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,484
ashes to ashes...

85
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:16,804
and dust to dust.

86
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:25,571
The Lord bless her and keep her.

87
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:31,326
The Lord makes his face to shine
upon her and be gracious to her.

88
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:39,293
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon her and give her peace.

89
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:54,168
Dawn's ready to go. Can we take her with us?

90
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:59,050
Yeah. She should probably get outta here.

91
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:03,291
What about you? We can wait if you want.

92
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:06,882
I'm fine. Thank you.

93
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:41,811
I'm sorry. I couldn't come sooner.

94
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:50,167
Oh, Dawn.

95
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:53,402
I wish I could help more.

96
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:59,451
The only thing is, it'll get better. I promise.

97
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,570
- You don't know that.
- Sure she does.

98
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:06,607
We're witches. We know stuff.

99
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,964
What?

100
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:15,684
Life goes on, and I forget Mom?
Is that what you're saying?

101
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:19,365
Not forget, no. I... You...

102
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:24,971
You make a place for her in your heart.
It's sort of like she becomes a part of you.

103
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:28,521
Does that make sense?

104
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,731
Dawn...

105
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:35,611
We don't have to talk about this now.
You could just go to sleep.

106
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:39,049
No. I don't wanna sleep.

107
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,966
OK. We can just sit, or whatever you want.

108
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,051
Good.

109
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:48,125
Cos I know - what I wanna do now.

110
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:51,726
Great. What are you up for?

111
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:57,687
You guys are witches,
and you do magic and stuff.

112
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:02,926
You want us to teach you
something? Like a glamour?

113
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:05,846
Or I could make a stuffed animal dance.

114
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:08,842
I wanna do a spell.

115
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:11,484
I wanna bring Mom back.

116
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,808
- That was different.
- Yeah.

117
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:32,041
- It was more intense.
- It's because of Joyce.

118
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,522
Right. Huh?

119
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:40,368
Well, she got me thinking -
about how people die all the time,

120
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:42,569
and how they get born too,

121
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:46,362
and how you kind of need one
so you can have the other.

122
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:51,205
When I think about it that way, it
makes death a little less sad and...

123
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:54,322
sex a little more exciting.

124
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:59,805
- Again, I say "huh?"
- I just think I understand sex more now.

125
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:05,723
It's notjust about two bodies
smooshing together. It's about life.

126
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,491
It's about making life.

127
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:13,851
Right, when two people are much older,
and way richer, and far less stupid.

128
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:19,572
Breathe. You're turning colours.

129
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:22,565
I'm not ready to make life
with you, but I could.

130
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:29,167
We could. Life could come out of our love
and our smooshing, and that's beautiful.

131
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:33,769
It all makes me feel like
we're a part of something bigger.

132
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,970
Like I'm more awake somehow. You know?

133
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,724
Yeah, I do.

134
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:52,407
Of course you wanna bring your mother back,
and I wish we could, but it's not possible.

135
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:57,444
Why? You guys do magic
for all kinds of things.

136
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,251
We do, but...

137
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,611
This is different. Magic can't be used
to alter the natural order of things.

138
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:07,049
But all you do is mess with
the natural order of things.

139
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:12,483
- You make things float and disappear.
- But we don't mess with life and death.

140
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,288
Dawn, I know how bad you hurt.

141
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,364
You don't.

142
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:24,085
- They put her in the ground.
- They did, and it's awful and unfair.

143
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:26,923
But this isn't the way.

144
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:32,451
I'm not even sure it's possible, Dawn.
I mean, I've seen things on resurrection, but...

145
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:34,964
There's books and stuff.

146
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:39,805
- I guess the spells backfire.
- That's not the point.

147
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:43,808
That's not the point.
The point is, it's bad, because...

148
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:48,603
Because witches can't be allowed to alter
the fabric of life for selfish reasons.

149
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:51,446
Wiccans took an oath
a long time ago to honour that.

150
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:54,411
So it's possible? To bring someone back?

151
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:59,362
They wouldn't have taken an oath
if they didn't know they could do it.

152
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:02,126
Maybe they could, but we can't.

153
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:05,250
She's right, Dawn. It's too dangerous.

154
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:08,407
You said you wanted to help me.

155
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,324
Dawn...

156
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:30,567
The funeral was...

157
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:33,044
It was brutal.

158
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,767
But it's tomorrow that I'm worried about.

159
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:39,124
What's tomorrow?

160
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:42,567
That's exactly what I don't know.

161
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:46,650
Up until now, I've had a road map.

162
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:50,929
Things to do every minute,
having to do with Mom.

163
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:56,045
Tomorrow the stuff
of everyday living resumes.

164
00:14:57,653 --> 00:15:02,488
And everybody expects me to know
how to do it, because I'm so strong.

165
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:07,132
You just need some time. I'm
sure everybody understands that.

166
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,167
Time's not the issue.

167
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:14,807
I can stick wood in vampires,

168
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:19,451
but Mom was the strong one in real life.

169
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,965
She always knew how to make
things better, just what to say.

170
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:32,608
Yeah. You'll find your way.
I mean, not all at once, but in...

171
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,004
I don't know.

172
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:39,686
I keep thinking about it -

173
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,162
when I found her.

174
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:45,689
If I had just gotten there ten minutes earlier...

175
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:49,928
You said they told you
it wouldn't have made a difference.

176
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:54,404
They said "probably"
wouldn't have made a difference.

177
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,883
The exact thing they said was "probably".

178
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,803
I haven't told that to anyone.

179
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:08,171
Doesn't make it your fault. You
couldn't have done anything different.

180
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:11,404
I didn't even start CPR until they told me.

181
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:14,604
I fell apart.

182
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:21,008
- That's how good I am at being a grown-up.
- Buffy...

183
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:25,291
And it'd be OK if it was
just me I had to worry about.

184
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:29,482
- But Dawn...
- Look, it's OK.

185
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:32,485
I know you don't feel like it now,
but you are strong, Buffy.

186
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:35,167
You're gonna figure this out.

187
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:40,008
And you have people to help you.
You don't have to do this alone.

188
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:47,367
It's gonna be light soon.

189
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:53,011
I can stay in town as long as you want me.

190
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:58,243
How's for ever? Does for ever work for you?

191
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:06,082
That's a bad idea.

192
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:10,007
I'm seriously needy right now.

193
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:15,172
Let me worry about the
neediness. I can handle it.

194
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:51,004
I told you.

195
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:54,491
You'd better go.

196
00:17:58,173 --> 00:18:00,289
- I'm sorry.
- No.

197
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,331
I'm so grateful that you came, Angel.

198
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,607
I didn't think I was gonna
be able to make it through the night.

199
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:18,449
Well, we still have a few more
minutes until I have to go.

200
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:21,931
Good.

201
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,891
Good.

202
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:44,005
Tell my sister I'm sick
of running into her Jawa rejects.

203
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:49,048
She bade me come to you. The news
of your relationship with the Slayer...

204
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,930
We don't have one.

205
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:55,529
- You attempted to court her, did you not?
- You're more fun when I hit you.

206
00:18:55,653 --> 00:19:00,727
It's just, Glory would like to encourage
this interest of yours in the Slayer.

207
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:03,885
It might lead to more
information about the Key.

208
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:07,170
And why would I share that
with the Most Unstable One?

209
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:09,847
Time is running short, sir.

210
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:15,051
Every moment you fight Glory,
you're only fighting yourself, you see?

211
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:20,890
Fine. Let the best me win. Let Glory
understand this: I won't help her find the Key.

212
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:23,487
I would never do that to an innocent...

213
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:26,362
An innocent? The Key?

214
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:29,206
- Interesting choice of words.
- That's not what I...

215
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,682
I understand. Sorry to bother you. I'll leave.

216
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:35,561
You understand what? When I said
"innocent" I didn't mean that the Key is...

217
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:37,689
- It's not a person.
- Of course not.

218
00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:42,051
You're gonna tell her, aren't you? Do you
know what'll happen if she finds the Key?

219
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,601
- How many people will die?
- I heard nothing.

220
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:47,332
I can't let that happen. Don't you see?

221
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:51,604
I can't.

222
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:58,006
We're heading down to breakfast.

223
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,724
- I'm not hungry.
- OK.

224
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:09,089
It's just, we have class after that, and
I didn't know if you want to go home, or...

225
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:13,925
I was gonna sleep some more.
Giles said he'd pick me up whenever.

226
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:16,683
OK. Great.

227
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,329
Sure, hang out.

228
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:23,042
I have a break around lunchtime.
I can come back.

229
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:27,208
- I might not be here.
- Well, I'll try my luck.

230
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:31,364
Take care, Dawn.

231
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,124
"Age of Levitation."

232
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,922
"War of the Warlocks."

233
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,651
"Resurrection: A Controversy Born."

234
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:44,171
You don't have to do that, Dawn. Just relax.

235
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:48,451
Yes, sit down. We have some very
amusing chicken feet you can play with.

236
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,165
That's OK.

237
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:55,691
Don't you watch television? I thought all
children despise effort and enjoy cartoons.

238
00:21:57,173 --> 00:22:00,165
I like being useful.
It keeps my mind off things.

239
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,645
Then useful you shall be.
I can always use a hand.

240
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:10,287
But you have a hand. A paid hand. A hand
that isn't the hand of illegal child labour.

241
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:11,601
Anya.

242
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:19,203
But of course, it's wonderful that
you find doing my job so distracting.

243
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:21,682
I am unthreatened. Proceed.

244
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,204
Yes, carry on, Dawn.

245
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:30,451
Is there anything I should know,
like off-limits stuff?

246
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:35,332
Willow told me that some of the books
and things are kind of dangerous.

247
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:40,644
Quite right. But they're all labelled
and kept off the floor.

248
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:45,569
Most of our more potent texts
and potions are all up there.

249
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:49,851
If anyone asks you about anything
in that area, just come and get me.

250
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:52,402
OK. Anything else?

251
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,970
If you like, I could teach you
how to work the cash register.

252
00:22:58,053 --> 00:23:00,647
- You can ring up sales.
- Cool.

253
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:04,886
Ring up sales? With the money?
She gets to fondle the money?

254
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,884
- Customer. Hello, customer.
- I'll just be a moment.

255
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,362
- I'll help you.
- No problem.

256
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,652
Dawn.

257
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:20,005
Do you want to watch this transaction
that Anya's doing? Then I'll let you try.

258
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,084
You got it.

259
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:44,047
I hope it's just dirt you're after.

260
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:50,763
If the spell calls for anything more, you're
into zombie territory, and that's bad news.

261
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:54,607
- Spike, I wasn't...
- I know good and well what you're up to.

262
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,048
That book you've got is infamous.

263
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:59,767
Please, don't tell Buffy. I just...

264
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,684
I have to get her back. I have to.

265
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:10,092
I'm not gonna tell, little bit.

266
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,403
I'm gonna help.

267
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:38,611
I've never used this bloke's
services, but there's talk.

268
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:42,447
Word is, he knows everything there is
to know about resurrection spells.

269
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:45,047
Come on, now. No worries.

270
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:48,443
You don't have to be all nice to me.
I know why you're doing this.

271
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:51,047
Do you, now? Enlighten me.

272
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,601
Spike, I'm not stupid.

273
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:59,006
You're, like, stalking my sister.
You'd do anything to get in good with her.

274
00:25:59,213 --> 00:26:01,852
Buffy never hears about this, OK?

275
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:06,163
Found out, she'd drive
a redwood through my chest.

276
00:26:06,253 --> 00:26:09,484
Then, if you don't want credit,
why are you helping me?

277
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:15,004
I just don't like to see Summers women
take it so hard on the chin, is all.

278
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:17,926
And I'm dead serious. You
breathe a word of this to Buffy,

279
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:21,528
I'll see to it that you end up
in the ground. Got it?

280
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,929
Yeah. Got it.

281
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,205
Where is he? He should
have been back hours ago.

282
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:32,846
I'm sure Jinx is on his way,
Your New-And-Improvedness.

283
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:37,051
- He's most Ioyal to...
- He'd better be Ioyal.

284
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:39,650
Jinxie?

285
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,289
Oh, no, no.

286
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:45,365
Mind the rug, honeys.
Blood's a bitch. Was this the Slayer?

287
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:48,729
- I'll pull her wings off.
- No. It was Ben.

288
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:51,244
Ben?

289
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,009
Ben?

290
00:26:53,093 --> 00:26:59,089
Oh, God, you pointless, stupid lump.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.

291
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:01,767
The Key. He told me.

292
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:06,762
The Key? What about the Key?

293
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:10,131
He indicated that it was a person,

294
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:13,489
Most Highest You.

295
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:21,087
- The Key's in human form?
- I believe so, Good One.

296
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:28,208
Jinx, you robed stud, you're my man.

297
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:33,003
I'm even gonna let you slide on the lame
toadying, on account of your dying and stuff.

298
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:38,850
So, the Key's all secreted away
in a flesh wrapper.

299
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:43,882
This narrows the search
in a serious way. We didn't have a clue.

300
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:47,522
It could have been a log or
a bicycle pump or whatever. Am I right?

301
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:56,130
Get him fixed. I wanna hear the whole story
again without all that annoying moaning.

302
00:28:04,693 --> 00:28:07,491
This place belongs to a magic guy?

303
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,169
It smells like Grandpa.

304
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:13,252
Anybody home?

305
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:21,168
- I know you.
- I don't think so, mate.

306
00:28:21,253 --> 00:28:25,405
No. You're that guy, that guy,
hangs around down at the corner mart.

307
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:29,327
- Big into dominoes, aren't you?
- Can't say I am. We came here because...

308
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:35,125
That's crazy, isn't it? I mean,
I'd swear you were that guy.

309
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:41,292
I mean, your hair's a different colour
and you're a vampire, but other than that...

310
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:43,841
- Maybe we should just go.
- No.

311
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:48,324
Now, just because the lights are dim
doesn't mean the juice is all gone.

312
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:52,486
- What can I do for you?
- This one's mum kicked it a few days back.

313
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,922
I'm so sorry.

314
00:28:57,013 --> 00:29:01,689
We were wondering what's to be done
about it. Heard you were the one to ask.

315
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:08,492
No, no, that's... You
don't wanna mess with that.

316
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:12,805
I know some tonics. They can
make the grieving fly by...

317
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:15,088
I don't want any tonics.

318
00:29:15,373 --> 00:29:17,762
Either one of you witches?

319
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:20,845
Got any experience with
spells of this magnitude?

320
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:27,689
Didn't think so.

321
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:35,325
Your mother's a good candidate,
at least. Strong DNA.

322
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,324
Right.

323
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:12,924
I've gathered some ingredients.

324
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:17,928
But the spell I found...
There's things on it I don't understand.

325
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:21,085
We've got the Ghora demon
standing between you and success.

326
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:26,452
- That's the translation you were missing.
- Ghora. I've heard of those. They local?

327
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:29,526
Yeah. They like to stick
close to the Hellmouth.

328
00:30:30,773 --> 00:30:35,164
Egg of the Ghora gives life.
It's key to the spell.

329
00:30:36,013 --> 00:30:38,288
Can you buy it, this egg, or...

330
00:30:38,373 --> 00:30:42,048
If it was as easy as making an
omelette, everyone would try it.

331
00:30:42,253 --> 00:30:46,166
No. You have to steal the egg
from the nest of the demon.

332
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:52,132
- And the Ghora won't be happy about it.
- Where do we find this demon?

333
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:56,843
First things first. We'll need an image
of your mother. A photo, a painting.

334
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:58,286
No problem.

335
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:03,563
Once you get all the ingredients together,
put them in the centre of a sacred circle

336
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,848
with the photo of your mother.

337
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:11,612
Then, say this incantation three times.

338
00:31:13,093 --> 00:31:15,891
She won't appear, you know, poof!

339
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:19,289
It'll take a while, but she will come to you.

340
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:23,164
Got it?

341
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:24,922
Got it.

342
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:29,012
Anything goes wrong,
the only way to reverse the spell

343
00:31:29,093 --> 00:31:31,846
is to destroy the image of
your mother. Understand?

344
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:35,448
- I'll do it right.
- It's a tricky spell, girl.

345
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:40,565
I can't say for sure your mother
will come back exactly like she was.

346
00:31:40,653 --> 00:31:44,566
Sometimes these things get a little off.

347
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,927
But she'll still be my mother.

348
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:51,446
- Won't she?
- More or less.

349
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:56,564
Good.

350
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,132
Good.

351
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:03,482
- And the Ghora?
- Oh, right.

352
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:05,644
Sorry.

353
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:09,123
Go in the sewer entrance near Tracy Street.

354
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:13,729
The opening's on the left. Can't
miss it. Just follow that down.

355
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:19,122
No, no. Keep your money.

356
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:25,286
Thank you.

357
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:31,763
You just keep in touch now.
Let me know how it goes.

358
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:41,724
I will.

359
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:55,844
It's here. Just like he said.

360
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:59,728
So, at least we know the old
coot isn't completely daft.

361
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:02,725
Look, you better let me
snatch this egg thing on my own.

362
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,963
No way. I'm going.

363
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:09,088
No, you are not. I've got
no idea what's down there.

364
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:13,286
You need me, Spike. Somebody's gotta get
the egg while you distract the Ghora.

365
00:33:13,453 --> 00:33:15,444
Now, come on.

366
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:20,167
Well, what do you know? Bitty Buffy.

367
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:35,088
- Doesn't look so bad.
- Wait till it wakes up.

368
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:38,207
That's usually when the bad starts.

369
00:33:39,213 --> 00:33:42,330
I can't get to the eggs
unless it moves. No way.

370
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,447
I'll make it move. You just be ready.

371
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:49,090
Ghora. Heads up.

372
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:55,487
Right. Heads it is.

373
00:33:57,773 --> 00:34:00,845
Over here, triptych.
If that's the best you can...

374
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:04,568
Dawn. Get away from her.

375
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:13,566
- Missed me.
- Spike, come on.

376
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:22,284
- Leave it.
- I can't. Mom.

377
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:26,048
It's too dangerous,
and I haven't got a weapon.

378
00:34:30,373 --> 00:34:33,092
Dawn. Get away from her.

379
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:40,362
Missed.

380
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:51,082
Come on, basset.

381
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:00,963
Spike.

382
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:07,369
- Sorry.
- Did you get it? Don't be sorry, then.

383
00:35:11,853 --> 00:35:13,844
Osiris,

384
00:35:14,493 --> 00:35:16,484
giver of darkness,

385
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:19,761
taker of life,

386
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:22,208
god of gods,

387
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:25,004
accept my offering.

388
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:29,370
Bone, flesh, breath.

389
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:34,165
Yours, eternally.

390
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,403
Bone, flesh, breath...

391
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:44,922
I beg of you,

392
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:47,004
return to me.

393
00:35:56,693 --> 00:36:00,686
What did I have for breakfast
this morning? Do you remember?

394
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:07,370
I wanna say bagel, but I think that was
yesterday. You had two eggs, sunny-side up.

395
00:36:07,453 --> 00:36:11,366
I remember, because they were
wiggling at me like little boobs.

396
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:15,408
Sassy eggs. What are you writing this for?

397
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:18,524
My journal.

398
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:23,161
- That's new.
- Yeah.

399
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:29,249
I figured, life goes by so fast, if you don't
write stuff down, itjust gets lost.

400
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:33,728
- And I wanna remember.
- Down to every last bagel.

401
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:38,091
Down to every last everything I do with you.

402
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:47,730
- What?
- What happened to History of Witchcraft?

403
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,246
I... It isn't there?

404
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:58,163
- Dawn must have taken it.
- No, she didn't. Did she?

405
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:01,443
This is bad. This is really bad.

406
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:05,805
But it's just a history book.
It might answer some of her questions.

407
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:09,325
I don't think she could
do any harm with that stuff.

408
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:14,044
It's not a how-to guide, but it refers to
specific resurrection spells and potions.

409
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:18,126
But I didn't... I mean...
How'd she know that?

410
00:37:18,213 --> 00:37:20,773
I don't know, but...
God, what else did she take?

411
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:22,889
Nothing. I... I think.

412
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:26,410
I... I think she took nothing else.

413
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:32,284
But maybe she did, and we should probably
look. Because who knows? I... I don't.

414
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:37,964
No, we can't waste time on that now.
We don't know what she's up to.

415
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:40,521
We have to call Buffy. Now.

416
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:46,963
Hello?

417
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:49,726
Bone, flesh, breath,

418
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:52,244
yours eternally.

419
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,403
Bone, flesh, breath,

420
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:58,047
I beg of you, return to me.

421
00:38:00,253 --> 00:38:01,129
Dawn.

422
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:06,646
- What have you done? What have you done?
- She's coming.

423
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:09,602
She's coming home.

424
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:18,604
Dawn. Dawn. You have no idea
what you're messing with.

425
00:38:18,693 --> 00:38:21,412
Who knows what you actually raised?

426
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:23,484
No, I know. It'll be her.

427
00:38:23,573 --> 00:38:27,771
No. Tara told me that these
spells go bad all the time.

428
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:32,210
- People come back wrong.
- She won't. He told me her DNA...

429
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:35,091
- Who told you? Who helped you?
- Nobody.

430
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:38,131
- Let me go.
- You have to stop it. Reverse it.

431
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:40,124
No.

432
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:42,727
Dawn. You know this is wrong.

433
00:38:42,813 --> 00:38:45,611
You know you can't let
this happen. Not to Mom.

434
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:49,403
But I need her. I don't care if she...

435
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:56,012
I'm not like you, Buffy. I don't have anybody.

436
00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:58,046
What?

437
00:38:58,133 --> 00:39:00,772
Of course you do. You have me.

438
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:04,169
No, I don't. You won't even look at me.

439
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:09,325
- It's so obvious you don't want me around.
- That's not true.

440
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:11,644
Yes, it is.

441
00:39:14,173 --> 00:39:18,132
Mom died, and it's like you don't even care.

442
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:25,204
Of course I care. How
can you even think that?

443
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:27,853
How can I not?

444
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:30,208
You haven't even cried.

445
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:35,003
You've just been running around like
it's been some big chore or something.

446
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,523
Cleaning up after Mom's mess.

447
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:42,521
Oh, my God.

448
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:44,692
Dawn...

449
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:47,764
I've been working.

450
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:51,806
I've been busy, because I have to...

451
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:54,453
No. You've been avoiding me.

452
00:39:54,613 --> 00:39:56,604
I'm not.

453
00:39:58,013 --> 00:40:01,528
I have to do these things cos...

454
00:40:03,253 --> 00:40:07,132
cos when I stop, then she's really gone.

455
00:40:09,613 --> 00:40:11,683
And I'm trying.

456
00:40:11,773 --> 00:40:15,766
Dawn, I am really trying
to take care of things,

457
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:18,847
but I don't even know what I'm doing.

458
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:24,449
- Mom always knew.
- Nobody's asking you to be Mom.

459
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:27,487
Well, who's gonna be if I'm not?

460
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:30,485
Huh, Dawn? Have you
even thought about that?

461
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,652
Who's gonna make things better?

462
00:40:34,773 --> 00:40:37,367
Who's gonna take care of us?

463
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:42,011
- Buffy...
- I didn't mean to push you away.

464
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:46,769
I didn't. I just...
I couldn't let you see me.

465
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:51,044
Oh, God, Dawnie...

466
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:54,167
I don't know what we're gonna do.

467
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:56,608
- I'm scared.
- Buffy...

468
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:02,525
Mommy?

469
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,129
- Buffy.
- Mom.

470
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:34,169
Dawn.

471
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:37,812
It's OK.

472
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:48,844
It's OK.

473
