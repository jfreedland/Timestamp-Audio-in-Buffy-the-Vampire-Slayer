1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:03,009
This is your objective.

2
00:00:03,093 --> 00:00:05,482
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

3
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,325
Demon class: Polgara species.

4
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:10,723
Bone skewers jut from
the creature's forearms during battle.

5
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:13,646
It's imperative not to damage its arms.

6
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:15,610
Why can't we damage its arms?

7
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:17,126
She's an unnecessary risk.

8
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:21,001
Two of our hostiles broke free
and escaped into the tunnels.

9
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,364
- She's dead.
- I don't understand.

10
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:28,492
If you think that's enough to kill me,
you really don't know what a slayer is.

11
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:31,406
- If she wants a fight, we'll give her one.
- It's not safe for any of us.

12
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:33,563
And when she least expects it...

13
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:37,490
- Adam.
- Mommy.

14
00:00:38,813 --> 00:00:42,010
Maggie sends me down into the sewers
with a blasto gun.

15
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:45,369
- The next thing I know, it's raining monsters.
- Hallelujah.

16
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:49,969
And then this gate slams down behind me,
and I try to use the gun but it goes "phtt".

17
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:52,613
You're saying that Maggie Walsh set you up?

18
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:54,763
That's exactly what I'm saying.

19
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:57,492
She sent me on a one-way recon.

20
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:59,768
Gotta hand it to you, Goldilocks.

21
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,765
You do have bleeding tragic taste in men.

22
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:07,210
I got a cousin married to a regurgitating
Frovalox demon that's got better instincts.

23
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:09,443
What does my taste in men
have to do with it?

24
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:14,891
Was Riley knitting bootees for your offspring
while Maggie was stringing you up?

25
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,086
You guys think Riley
had something to do with this?

26
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:27,964
Probably not. But we'd be remiss
if we didn't think of all the possibilities.

27
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:31,963
Right.

28
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:33,088
Remiss.

29
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:36,848
No. No. Maggie made sure
that he was nowhere around

30
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:39,891
when she sent me on this
"make Buffy dead" assignment.

31
00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:43,682
And plus, Riley? He seems like
he wouldn't tell a little white lie,

32
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:46,606
let alone a whole bunch of big, dirty ones.

33
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,843
That's why they call it the secret forces.

34
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,891
Cos they kinda keep
the whole lying thing to themselves.

35
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:57,001
All I know is that Maggie has it in for me.
Which means the Initiative has it in for me.

36
00:01:57,453 --> 00:02:00,889
The mad scientist isn't too keen
on the fact that the Scooby gang

37
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:03,123
knows that the Initiative is up to no good.

38
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:06,285
Which brings us back
to the "not safe for any of us" concept.

39
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:10,810
What could have happened
to make Professor Walsh want to kill you?

40
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:17,332
I don't know. She wasn't keen on the fact that
I was asking a lot of questions, that's for sure.

41
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:21,201
- You were getting too close to something.
- Clearly.

42
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:24,968
Although one can only imagine
what she'd be so desperate to hide.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,074
Advertise your product or brand here

44
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:37,961
OK, everybody grab a weapon.
We've gotta move.

45
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:41,284
And storm the Initiative?
Yeah, let's take on those suckers.

46
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:44,763
- I was thinking more that we'd hide.
- Thank God.

47
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,287
Buffy, I think perhaps
we should talk about this.

48
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:51,048
We need to relocate some place we're less
likely to be found. We need a plan.

49
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,931
- My place?
- The Initiative guys know how close we are.

50
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:56,607
They'll check the places that you hang out.

51
00:03:56,693 --> 00:04:00,811
What about your basement? The guys haven't
seen us together much, and there's room.

52
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:02,485
- Plus, mirror ball.
- Cool.

53
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:06,248
- Come and boogie at Xander's hideaway.
- Yes. Come boogie.

54
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,370
Absolutely not.
I will not squat in that dank hole.

55
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:12,126
What? It was good enough for me
but you're above it all?

56
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:16,365
Precisely. Besides, I don't see
why we can't stay right where we are.

57
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:21,766
I think it's very unlikely those Initiative boys
are gonna come round here to look for...

58
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,002
Buffy.

59
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,764
God, Buffy. Are you OK?

60
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:29,487
- What happened?
- You know?

61
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:33,805
I know something went down. Tell me.

62
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,642
Maggie tried to kill me.

63
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:40,366
It didn't work, but they're all upset anyway.

64
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:44,765
OK, listen. I need you
to go over everything. Step by step.

65
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:48,289
- There has to be some kind of mistake.
- There was no mistake.

66
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:53,845
- How do you know something happened?
- I was on a mission. But I came back and...

67
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:59,083
I'm not sure. Look, let's just
keep our heads and notjump to any...

68
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,483
What?

69
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:05,041
- That's Hostile 17.
- No.

70
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,727
I'm just a friend of Xander's.

71
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:10,964
Bugger it. I'm your guy.

72
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:13,203
This is Spike. He's...

73
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:19,081
It's a really long story.
But he's not bad any more.

74
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:22,404
What am I?
A bleedin' broken record? I'm bad.

75
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:26,566
It's just... I can't bite any more.
Thanks to you wankers.

76
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:30,282
We've been looking for him
but you've known where he's been all along?

77
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,365
- It's not like that.
- What is it like? What's he doing here?

78
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:36,968
Leaving you swabs to your dramatics, thanks.

79
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,965
I've got my stories on the telly for that.

80
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,851
By the by, if you're trying to kill her...

81
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:54,128
Buffy, what is this? You're hiding an HST?

82
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,681
Why don't you back off
and let her ask the questions?

83
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,163
Your boss just tried to make
monster food outta her.

84
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:11,206
I didn't see much. I wasn't there. All I know
is Professor Walsh told me you were dead.

85
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,409
But then I saw you on the monitors...

86
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:18,731
This isn't Professor Walsh. There must be
something making her act this way.

87
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,088
Something - I don't know - controlling her.

88
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,688
We think Buffy may have been
becoming too inquisitive,

89
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:30,245
that she was getting close to something
that Professor Walsh was trying to hide.

90
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:34,167
- Any idea what that might be?
- What about 314? Maybe that's it.

91
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:37,211
Maybe she was trying to test you.
What if it was only a drill?

92
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:41,127
Then why did she tell you I was dead?
Riley, it wasn't a test.

93
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:45,729
See, I've heard rumours that the Initiative
isn't all that we've been told,

94
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:50,125
that secretly they're working
towards some darker purpose.

95
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:54,445
- Something that might harm us all.
- No. That's not what happens there.

96
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:55,807
- Riley.
- I would know.

97
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,407
No one is sure. We're just trying to sort it out.

98
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:00,882
- I'll sort it out on my own.
- Riley.

99
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:02,964
No. Just...

100
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:05,884
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,203
What am I?

102
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,682
You're a monster.

103
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:42,524
I thought so.

104
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:46,810
- What are you?
- Me? I'm a boy.

105
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,164
A boy.

106
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:53,522
- How do you work?
- I don't know, I just do.

107
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,324
What's that for?

108
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:35,724
Dr Walsh?

109
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,724
Adam?

110
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:40,323
- That would never happen.
- Well, no, Buff.

111
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,531
That's why they call 'em cartoons,
not documentaries.

112
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:48,208
Must we have the noise? My head is splitting.

113
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,443
Look who's Cranky Bear in the morning.

114
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:55,367
Yes, I can't imagine why
I didn't sleep well in my beach ball.

115
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:58,968
Every time you moved, it made
squeaky noises. It was irritating.

116
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:02,682
Really? I'm surprised you could hear it
over your Wagnerian snoring.

117
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:05,412
OK, you guys, could we not, please?

118
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:10,408
Everything's screwed up enough without you
two doing scenes from my parents' marriage.

119
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,484
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

120
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,412
Thank you.

121
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:19,566
It'll be OK, Buffy.
Riley's just confused, that's all.

122
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,723
I don't know.

123
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:26,489
Itjust seems like things could get heavier.
His whole world's falling apart.

124
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:29,406
And after everything
you've been through with Angel.

125
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:33,327
You know, you really should get yourself
a boring boyfriend. Like Xander.

126
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:37,008
- You can't have Xander.
- That was the idea.

127
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:39,402
Riley was supposed to be Mr Joe Guy.

128
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:44,802
We were gonna do dumb things, like hold
hands through the daisies going "tra-la-la".

129
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:48,363
Poor Buffy. Your life
resists all things average.

130
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:51,206
So dump him. But you can't have Xander.

131
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,962
I'll try and remember that.

132
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:57,243
It's too late, anyway.

133
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:02,361
I'm already at the "I hurt when he hurts,
I smile when he smiles" stage.

134
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:06,846
- I hate that part.
- I'll just have to make it work.

135
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,922
Turn on the TV. Now.

136
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:16,211
Sunnydale is still reeling
from news of the crime.

137
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:19,683
A source in the coroner's office
tells us that the boy was stabbed

138
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:25,530
with what looks like some kind of large
skewer, and his body was then mutilated.

139
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:29,208
Police have not named a suspect,
and the killer is still at large.

140
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:32,285
The Polgara demon had a skewer in its arm.

141
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:34,967
That's the one Maggie
insisted we bring back alive.

142
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:38,728
- She must have sent it after you.
- And it got distracted. God.

143
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:41,281
Buffy, it's not your fault.
How could you know?

144
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:44,365
She's right. You mustn't blame yourself.

145
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:49,883
I'm not going to. I'm going to
the crime scene to see what I can find out.

146
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,646
Research the Polgara demon.
I wanna know where it is.

147
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,531
I am going to make him pay
for taking that kid's life.

148
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:58,810
I'll make him die
in ways he can't even imagine.

149
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:08,685
That would have sounded more commanding
if I wasn't wearing my yummy sushi pyjamas.

150
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,369
Where you been all night?

151
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:21,607
Well, congratulations. I see you and Buffy
have finally gotten past the shy phase.

152
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:26,847
I wasn't with Buffy. I needed to be alone.
Think some things through.

153
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,924
- What things?
- Hey, you guys.

154
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,523
This is mighty ominous. What's up, man?

155
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:45,331
- Professor Walsh tried to have Buffy killed.
- What? Did Buffy tell you that?

156
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:48,928
- I mean, do you have any proof?
- I saw enough to know it's true.

157
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:52,210
I don't get it. Why?

158
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:57,804
Buffy thinks that she's getting too close,
that Professor Walsh has some secret.

159
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:01,966
I can see Buffy getting on Walsh's bad side.
She puts her nose where it doesn't belong.

160
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:05,329
- What?
- She's a pain. "Why this?" and "Why that?"

161
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,722
- She should die because of that?
- I don't know.

162
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:11,408
Maybe Professor Walsh found out
that Buffy was up to something bad.

163
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:15,008
Why does it bug you that I hang with her?
Cos she's a better soldier than you?

164
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:19,450
- She's using you to infiltrate our operations.
- You're saying she's a spy? You're crazy.

165
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,923
Riley, think about it.
The professor's not stupid.

166
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:26,767
If she tried to kill Buffy,
maybe Buffy needed killing.

167
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,969
Guys.

168
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,169
Not now, Private.

169
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:33,968
What is it?

170
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:37,011
Professor Walsh is dead.

171
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,086
Look at that wound.

172
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:13,006
She's been staked,
wouldn't you say, brother?

173
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:16,051
- What?
- Only one person who could do that.

174
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:23,529
You better not be saying what I think you're
saying. The Polgara demon has a skewer...

175
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,923
- That's your girlfriend's MO.
- That's a serious accusation.

176
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,652
- Ready to deal with the consequences?
- Bring 'em on.

177
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:32,167
That supernatural freak has blinded you.

178
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:35,563
Stand back, man. Show some respect.

179
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:40,363
Listen, everybody's upset,
but arguing isn't gonna help anything.

180
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:43,889
And it's certainly not
what Professor Walsh would want.

181
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,768
- No, sir.
- All right.

182
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:53,562
Good. Now, Washington is sending in a team
to do an internal investigation.

183
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:56,690
- I've been told we have to wait for their word.
- Wait?

184
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:59,048
This has to be the work
of the Polgara demon.

185
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:03,365
Probably. Looks like last night
the Polgara escaped through tunnel 72.

186
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,125
- It's out loose?
- I'm afraid so.

187
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:07,852
- Then we go after it.
- My orders from Washington

188
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:11,972
are for a total lockdown
until they arrive. I'm sorry.

189
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:16,764
Now, return to your quarters.
There's nothing you can do here.

190
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:27,970
Listen, Angleman can talk all he wants,

191
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,329
but I'm still in charge till the brass gets here.

192
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:34,723
I say we got a demon to hunt.
Now suit up for armed patrol.

193
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:40,410
And by that I mean loaded guns.
Target practice is over. We're going for blood.

194
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:51,650
Let's go. Let's move.

195
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:55,089
Quick to one side. Establish a perimeter.

196
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,652
Somebody's been stayin' here.

197
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,406
What do you think, a homeless guy?

198
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:11,609
Could be.

199
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:14,082
Or a squatter of the demon variety.

200
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,604
Not the Polgara.

201
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:19,253
Who cares? I see a demon, it dies.

202
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,804
It's warm.

203
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,724
Damn.

204
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:48,404
Animals.

205
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:29,048
Buffy.

206
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:38,323
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.
I know that everyone came on pretty strong.

207
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:41,325
And the Spike thing
isn't as tweaked as it looked.

208
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:45,804
OK, maybe it is, but there's an explanation
that almost makes sense.

209
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:51,883
Hello? I'm apologising here.
And I think that's pretty big of me,

210
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:55,966
considering I'm the one who was
almost made a demon sandwich.

211
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:59,443
This is the part where you throw me a bone.

212
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:02,164
Maggie's dead.

213
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:06,164
Happy now?

214
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,931
How can you ask me that?
Of course I'm not happy.

215
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:15,089
What happened?

216
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:17,403
- That's classified.
- Classifi...

217
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:22,964
The Polgara. It got her and escaped, didn't it?

218
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:28,086
I'm gonna find it.
I'm gonna find it and destroy it.

219
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:32,246
And then you can stop asking me
how happy all this death makes me.

220
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:46,363
Howdy.

221
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:51,163
I just got your message a minute ago.
I was in class, but I was about to call you.

222
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:54,450
I had so much fun the other night.
Those spells.

223
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:57,568
Yeah, that was nice.

224
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:01,646
I hope you don't think that I just
come over for the spells and everything.

225
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:06,090
I mean, I really like just talking
and hanging out with you and stuff.

226
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:10,763
I know that. But you wanna do a spell.

227
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,447
Yeah. But only because
it's really important. There's this...

228
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:19,048
No, you don't have to explain.
I don't mind. Really.

229
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:22,842
I've been thinking about
that last spell we did all day.

230
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:26,448
You have? Well, this one
should be really fun, too.

231
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:30,765
We conjure the goddess Thespia
to help us locate demonic energy in the area.

232
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:34,209
- It shouldn't be too tricky.
- The goddess Thespia?

233
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:38,923
- Are you sure we're ready for that?
- You and me? This is beneath us.

234
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:43,282
OK, if you say so.

235
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:02,524
- You're killin' me here.
- Missed you, too. The joint's jumpin'.

236
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:07,368
You know. I'm making some changes with
my life. I'm getting away from my old image.

237
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,525
- As a double-dealing snitch?
- You think I'm blowing smoke,

238
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:15,209
but after those apocalypse demons nearly
did me in, I had a spiritual experience.

239
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:20,367
That's swell, but have you heard anything
about a Polgara demon doing some killings?

240
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:24,162
See, that's the thing. I don't talk
behind people's backs no more.

241
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:29,088
And I'm bringing some class to the joint.
It's Willy's Place. Brings in a better clientele.

242
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:33,485
I got one of those deep fryers. These demons
just go crazy for chicken fingers.

243
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:39,608
If they see me dealing with you, I'm just the
same Willy, working both sides of the street.

244
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:44,084
- I'm gonna have to punch you.
- Just once, and it don't have to hurt.

245
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:49,923
- Not yet. I haven't touched you.
- Sorry. Right.

246
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:52,927
Right. Go ahead. Wait.

247
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:54,890
No. I can't talk to you...

248
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,047
What have you heard about the Polgara?

249
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:03,367
Heard there was one around
a week or two back.

250
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:06,013
Word was you got him,
you and those army guys.

251
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:10,086
- And that was the last you heard?
- Yeah. As far as I know, he's off the streets.

252
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:14,052
What about those army guys?
You heard anything about 314?

253
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:24,407
What are you doing here? Following me?

254
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,963
You told me you were tracking
the Polgara demon. I thought I'd help.

255
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:32,569
But now I see you're not hunting demons,
you're socialising with them - again.

256
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:36,566
I thought you were supposed to be
killing these things, not buying them drinks.

257
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:40,726
Smooth, Officer Riley. They teach you
those undercover moves in Special Forces?

258
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:45,125
- I'm serious. What are you doing here?
- Just coolin' her dog, like the rest of us.

259
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:49,923
- Why don't you sit down, relax?
- I want you to tell me. Who are you?

260
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,608
How about some chicken fingers
on the house?

261
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:55,729
- Shut up.
- I'm just saying...

262
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:58,964
I said shut up. Or maybe you'd like
to go back to the lab with me.

263
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:02,204
I'm sure the coats would love
to classify a... whatever you are.

264
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:05,126
Leave him alone, Riley. He's human.

265
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:07,966
- So he's human.
- You're shaking.

266
00:22:08,053 --> 00:22:12,092
He just harbours demons.
Which makes him a good guy like you?

267
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:17,323
- The truth, Buffy. Now.
- You have it. You are just too screwed up

268
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:20,211
because of what happened
to Walsh to see it. Let go.

269
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:22,170
Hold it. You.

270
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,923
No leaving till I say so. Got it?

271
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:29,087
We got new rules here. No killing.

272
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:33,689
Right, except the rules don't seem
to apply much these days, do they?

273
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:39,612
Like if I shot you right now, I don't know
if I'd have a corpse on my hands

274
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,843
- or one pissed-off vampire.
- Riley.

275
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:47,053
I mean, who do you believe? First
it sounds like lies, then it sounds like truth.

276
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,130
Riley.

277
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,362
What's happening to me?

278
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:28,165
Riley, why don't you lie down?

279
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:31,209
You'll be more comfortable.

280
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,724
Stop it.

281
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:39,204
I can't. It's like something's crawling inside.

282
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,687
No. You're hurting yourself.

283
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:46,723
Come here.

284
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:48,804
OK.

285
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:52,327
I thought I knew, but I don't.

286
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:56,081
I don't know anything.

287
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:59,961
- You're sick. Once you get some rest...
- No. Buffy...

288
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,566
I don't know anything.

289
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:07,565
I don't know which team I'm on.

290
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,002
Who the bad guys are.

291
00:24:13,413 --> 00:24:17,486
Maybe I'm the bad guy.
Maybe I'm the thing you should kill.

292
00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:21,125
No. Don't you even think that.

293
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:25,728
OK, listen to me. You're sick.

294
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:28,850
You just need to get some sleep.

295
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,811
Please. Lie down for me.

296
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:37,564
Come on.

297
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:54,444
You're gonna be OK.

298
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:20,244
- How is he?
- This isn'tjust grief making him act this way.

299
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:23,530
Something's affecting him physically
and it's getting worse.

300
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:27,401
- You think Walsh did something to him?
- I don't know, but I'm ready to find out.

301
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:31,566
- Tough, with Maggie's deadness and all.
- She must have kept records somewhere.

302
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:34,087
About Riley, about 314, about all of it.

303
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:37,006
And she wasn't the only person
that knew what she was up to.

304
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:40,403
- So what's the plan?
- Giles, Anya, keep researching.

305
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:43,565
Xander, you and I are going undercover.

306
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:46,562
Remember before? No Xander.

307
00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:49,884
Not in a boyfriend way
or a "lead him to a certain death" way.

308
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:53,852
- He's the only one with military experience.
- It's not like he was in the Nam.

309
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:58,324
- He was GI Joe for one night.
- It's OK, Anya. I've backed up Buffy before.

310
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:02,531
Can't you do something else to help them?
Like Xerox hand-outs or something?

311
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:04,763
I'll be careful.

312
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,764
Promise.

313
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:13,887
How do you plan to get into the Initiative?
I'm sure their security system's impenetrable.

314
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:18,012
I have my clearance.
I'm hoping she didn't have time to revoke it.

315
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:23,213
Well, as for the whereabouts of this Polgara
demon, I'm afraid we've not turned up much.

316
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:27,411
- No reports since its original capture.
- Then we'll just have to keep looking.

317
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:31,692
So, the square is Sunnydale?

318
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:34,367
Right. It's like a map.

319
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:38,731
We both take different parts of the potion,
and when we do the incantation,

320
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:42,123
we both blow it onto the square
at the exact same time.

321
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:45,171
- But how does it work?
- Well, that's the cool part.

322
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:48,802
When the potion mixes and Thespia's called,

323
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:53,091
it creates this mist
over the parts where the demons are.

324
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:56,643
It even makes different colours
for different breeds.

325
00:26:56,733 --> 00:26:58,166
Wow.

326
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,128
You ready?

327
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:15,168
Let's do it.

328
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:21,492
Thespia, we walk in shadow.

329
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,768
Walk in blindness.

330
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:26,765
You are the protector of the night.

331
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,844
Thespia, goddess,

332
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:32,243
ruler of all darkness, we implore you,

333
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:36,121
open a window
to the world of the underbeing.

334
00:27:41,053 --> 00:27:44,125
With your knowledge, may we go in safety.

335
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:47,410
With your grace,
may we speak of your benevolence.

336
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:54,283
Or not.

337
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:03,730
- Seems pretty quiet.
- Usually is this time of...

338
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:21,771
Buff, maybe you should check the look later.

339
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:25,404
- What'd you do that for?
- Sorry.

340
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:28,485
I'm the only one that can pass
the retinal scan.

341
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:33,483
- I don't wanna see that.
- Retinal scan, Xander.

342
00:28:35,893 --> 00:28:39,442
Well, we'll know in a few seconds
if my clearance is still good.

343
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:42,093
Or if we're about die at the hands
of 50 military goons.

344
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:45,882
Retinal scan recorded. Summers, Buffy.

345
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:51,963
Why am I not entirely comforted
by the arrival of the man-sized microwave?

346
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:06,522
Holy moly.

347
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:08,604
I know.

348
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:13,361
I totally get it now.
Can I have sex with Riley, too?

349
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:25,006
- Pretend to make out with me.
- What are you talking about?

350
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:30,121
Well, I... you know, in the movies,
the guy and the girl have to hide.

351
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:33,808
Please. Could you possibly
draw more attention to us?

352
00:29:39,853 --> 00:29:44,324
This is the Initiative. Military guys and
scientists do not make out with each other.

353
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:47,803
Maybe that's what's wrong with the world.
Ever think about that?

354
00:29:47,893 --> 00:29:53,411
I totally failed. It wasn't even like
the spell went wrong. Itjust wouldn't.

355
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:56,530
If it's any consolation,
we haven't fared much better here.

356
00:29:56,613 --> 00:30:01,129
- Really? Is Riley OK?
- Well, he's asleep. Finally.

357
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:05,604
But he doesn't look good.
And the research is troubling as well.

358
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:09,606
I mean, this demon we're after
seems highly atypical for a Polgara.

359
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:15,723
This child it killed was mutilated. There's no
recorded cases of a Polgara having done that.

360
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:18,373
Also the Polgara have to eat every two hours.

361
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:21,525
With the low IQ, you have a demon
who's not exactly low-profile.

362
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:26,448
So how has he been hiding out in Sunnydale
for two days without anyone seeing him?

363
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,649
Exactly.

364
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:34,168
- Riley.
- Where's Buffy?

365
00:30:34,253 --> 00:30:36,608
She went out. Can I get you something?

366
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:42,087
- Just tell me where she is.
- You're not well, Riley. You need to rest.

367
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,926
Did she find the Polgara? Is that it?

368
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:47,527
- No, we're still looking, but...
- But what?

369
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,922
She went to find out what's making you sick.

370
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:54,245
I'm not sick. You're telling me
she went to the Initiative?

371
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,807
- Riley, she's just trying to help you.
- She doesn't belong there.

372
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:00,687
Riley, listen...

373
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:04,368
- Stand away from the stairs.
- No. You're gonna get Buffy killed.

374
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:09,886
You all right?

375
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:16,805
How many of the men are still out?
The longer they go without their meds...

376
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:20,568
- Everyone's off their schedules.
- It's dangerous.

377
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:23,929
I don't wanna think about the damage
our guys could do in withdrawal.

378
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:26,652
They won't understand
what's happening to them.

379
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:31,602
They don't know they've been getting meds
in their food, so we'd better get them in here.

380
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:36,364
We've located all but a few. The last ones
were in bad shape, but we stabilised them.

381
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:40,366
But Finn wasn't one of them, right?
Find him. He's the one I care about.

382
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:44,048
- He's too important to the work to lose now.
- Indeed.

383
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,007
Double shot of O neg, 'keep.

384
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:58,165
Make it the good stuff.
I don't want no freakin' orang-utan.

385
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:00,244
Got ya.

386
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:03,288
Been a pisser of a day.

387
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:06,012
Those army blokes are on the tear.

388
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:09,688
They ran me outta my place.
And all over town.

389
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,842
Yeah, what's up?

390
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:17,402
Keep me posted. I'll be in records.

391
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:37,921
I don't generally like to kill humans,
but I've learned it pays to be flexible.

392
00:32:38,013 --> 00:32:41,562
- I was wondering when you'd turn up.
- Darn.

393
00:32:41,653 --> 00:32:44,042
So this isn't a surprise?

394
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:49,442
Now, you can tell me what you did to Riley
and after that we can take a tour of room 314.

395
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:54,209
Somebody's coming, you know. They've
already seen you on the security monitors.

396
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:57,012
Monitors are nonfunctional at this time, sir.

397
00:32:57,093 --> 00:33:00,210
- Went down about ten minutes ago.
- What? I didn't do that.

398
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:03,569
Thank God for small favours
and we'll worry about details later.

399
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:06,486
Finn, take this girl
to the stockade immediately.

400
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:11,363
Riley, he can tell us what we need to know.
Maggie wanted me dead, didn't she?

401
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:16,527
She did. But understand, the Initiative
has no interest in eliminating the Slayer.

402
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:20,289
- It was her own vendetta.
- Why? Spell it out for me.

403
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,445
- I feel a "dumb blonde" attack coming on.
- I don't know.

404
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:25,922
Well, think harder.

405
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:29,407
It was the project.

406
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:31,964
Project? 314.

407
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:34,245
It...

408
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:39,201
- It escaped.
- That's enough.

409
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:43,692
You're making her sound like
some psychopath. She wasn't like that.

410
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,606
- She was a brilliant woman.
- She was. It's not...

411
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:50,049
She tried to help people. This is
the way you want them to remember her?

412
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:53,091
- Walsh was feeding you drugs.
- You're doing this to me.

413
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:55,687
- This all started because of you.
- Just listen.

414
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:59,686
- I am trying to help you get to the truth.
- You want truth? Then tell me.

415
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:03,129
- What did you do to her, Buffy?
- Stop it. I didn't do anything.

416
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:06,410
Riley, stop. This isn't about us.

417
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:11,169
Everything that we need to know is here.
We just need to find out what was in 314.

418
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:16,846
Me.

419
00:34:20,573 --> 00:34:23,371
I've been thinking about the world.

420
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,927
I wanted to see it. Learn it.

421
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:31,528
I saw the inside of that boy
and it was beautiful.

422
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,764
But it didn't tell me about the world.

423
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:37,367
Itjust made me feel.

424
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:41,241
So now I want to learn about me.

425
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,724
Why I feel.

426
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,849
What I am.

427
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,483
So I came home.

428
00:34:56,853 --> 00:35:02,211
I'm a kinematically redundant, biomechanical
demonoid, designed by Maggie Walsh.

429
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:05,285
She called me Adam and I called her Mother.

430
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:08,410
Adam, Maggie would want you
to stand down.

431
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:11,685
Yes. But I seem to have a design flaw.

432
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:20,805
In addition to organic material, I'm equipped
with GP2D11 infrared detectors,

433
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:23,202
a harmonic decelerator, plus DC servo.

434
00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:25,932
She pieced you together
from parts of other demons.

435
00:35:26,013 --> 00:35:28,811
And man. And machine.

436
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:35,047
Which tells me what I am, but not who I am.

437
00:35:37,293 --> 00:35:39,682
Mother wrote things down.

438
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:43,327
Hard data, but also her feelings.

439
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:48,764
That's how I learned that I have ajob here.
And that she loved me.

440
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:51,572
She wasn't your mother.
And she didn't love you.

441
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:55,168
- Is that really the issue?
- She made you because she was a scientist.

442
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,766
Riley.

443
00:35:57,893 --> 00:35:59,167
Riley Finn.

444
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:03,043
Stop. Those files...

445
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:06,604
- Mother created you, too.
- Maggie is not my mother.

446
00:36:06,693 --> 00:36:10,083
- I have a mother. A real...
- A birth mother, yes.

447
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:15,406
But after you met Maggie, she was the one
who shaped your basic operating system.

448
00:36:15,493 --> 00:36:18,963
She taught you how to think, how to feel.

449
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:22,125
She fed you chemicals to make you stronger.

450
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,602
Your mind and body.

451
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:29,209
She said that you and I
were her favourite children. Her art.

452
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:32,012
That makes us brothers. Family.

453
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:34,687
No. I'm not like you.

454
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,291
That's pain, isn't it? Why?

455
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:44,367
Because your feeding schedule,
the chemicals, have been interrupted?

456
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:47,172
Or do you miss her? Tell me.

457
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:49,813
- I'll kill you.
- You won't.

458
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:53,681
- You haven't been programmed to.
- I cannot be programmed. I'm a man.

459
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:55,570
It's here.

460
00:36:55,653 --> 00:36:58,247
The plan she had for us. What happens.

461
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:02,365
- How it ends.
- No.

462
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,569
- Do you want to hear?
- No.

463
00:37:22,813 --> 00:37:24,804
Doctor.

464
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:45,409
Thank you.

465
00:37:45,493 --> 00:37:48,883
This has been very interesting.

466
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,524
Back away from the door!

467
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:06,883
Riley, are you OK?

468
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:10,764
Secure the room.

469
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,405
We got a demon in here.
It escaped through that vent.

470
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:18,166
It's not the Polgara. It looks sort of half man.

471
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:22,087
- Right, and you just happened to be here.
- She's telling the truth. I saw it.

472
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:25,085
It killed Angleman. Go. Now.

473
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:27,769
Yes, sir.

474
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:35,931
- He needs to go to a hospital.
- We'll take it from here.

475
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,163
- I'm going with him.
- A military hospital.

476
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:40,289
- No.
- Back off.

477
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:43,729
We take care of our own
around here, understand?

478
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:47,964
Buffy.

479
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,244
Escort them out.

480
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:02,124
Buffy.

481
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:17,929
What did you expect, Spike?
A welcome party?

482
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:21,369
Word's out. You've been
making war on the demon world.

483
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:23,444
- War?
- With the Slayer.

484
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:28,326
You kill other demons,
and the rest of us don't hold with that.

485
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:33,362
Still, if I see you around here again,
I'll be inclined to break that code.

486
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:35,929
Do you understand?

487
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:47,890
No word from Riley?

488
00:39:47,973 --> 00:39:52,922
Nothing. The Initiative probably
has him locked in some medical ward.

489
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:58,246
I can't get near him until I have a better plan
than just storming in and getting us all shot.

490
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:01,723
Yeah, you might wanna
work the kinks out of that one.

491
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:05,408
What am I gonna do?
He needs me and I can't get near him.

492
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:09,292
You'll find a way.

493
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:14,367
I can't spend all of my energy going after
the Initiative. Not while Adam's out there.

494
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,842
He's really that big of a threat?

495
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:22,484
I could barely fight him. It was like Maggie
designed him to be the ultimate warrior.

496
00:40:22,573 --> 00:40:26,043
He's smart and fast. He gave the commando
guys the slip with no problem.

497
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,522
There's gotta be a flaw.

498
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:32,970
I think the part where he's pure evil
and kills randomly was an oversight.

499
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,322
I never should have let them take Riley.

500
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:40,568
I need to be with him.

501
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:44,612
- I'm sure he's OK.
- There's no way he can be.

502
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:48,481
Everything he's ever believed in
has been taken away or...

503
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:51,924
He's alone.

504
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,844
He has nothing to hold on to.

505
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:20,961
