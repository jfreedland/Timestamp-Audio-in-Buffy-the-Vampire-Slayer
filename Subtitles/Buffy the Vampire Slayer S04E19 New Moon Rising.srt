1
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:06,282
- I'm a werewolf in love.
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,967
Oz, don't you love me?

3
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:12,171
The wolf is inside me all the time.

4
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:17,572
Until I figure out what that means,
I shouldn't be around you, or anybody.

5
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:20,292
The Initiative made it.
They can't stop it, but we will.

6
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:24,048
The implant works.
Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature.

7
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,886
I get this chip out,
we're gonna have a confrontation.

8
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:36,686
I just like having something that's mine.

9
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:39,048
I am, you know - yours.

10
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:45,923
- Do you like cats?
- I'm more of a dog person myself.

11
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:49,323
But I'm not, like, "Death to all cats." Why?

12
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:52,530
- Cos I was thinking of getting one.
- Can you have one in dorms?

13
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:55,491
No, but this would be a sneaky cat.

14
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:59,043
That would be cool.
You mean it'd be, sort of like a familiar?

15
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,489
Actually, I was thinking
it'd be sort of like a pet.

16
00:01:02,573 --> 00:01:07,693
You know, we could name her Trixie
or Miss Kitty Fantastico or something.

17
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:11,243
And we could make Kitty
go bonkers with string and catnip?

18
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,450
- Absolutely.
- Fun. I'm in.

19
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,491
- So you're not allergic or anything?
- Nope.

20
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:21,691
Good, cos I want my room
to be Willow-friendly.

21
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:23,968
Me, too.

22
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:27,125
So, I'm excited about the
Scooby meeting. I think.

23
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:29,568
- What's it about?
- I'm not sure.

24
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:32,725
Probably just your garden-variety disaster.

25
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:37,011
Zippo. Patrol's been totally uneventful.
My kill count's way down.

26
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:39,766
She means there's been less bad-guy activity.

27
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:44,165
- We know what that often indicates.
- Buffy doesn't make her quota? Bad slayer.

28
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:50,123
I wish it were that innocuous, but with
Adam around I feel he's involved somehow.

29
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:54,092
When things get slow it's usually
because there's extra evil brewing.

30
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:57,370
But the weird thing is,
we've been busy at the Initiative.

31
00:01:57,453 --> 00:02:00,490
Our squads have got demons
coming out our ears.

32
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:02,963
- That's a metaphor.
- I got it, thanks.

33
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:05,204
I'm overhelping, aren't I?

34
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:08,683
So the activity's shifted, not stopped.

35
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:13,806
- It's fascinating.
- To an extremely bored person maybe.

36
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,448
Well, that was a thrilling hour.

37
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:20,811
I don't appreciate your snide remarks, Anya.
I have a lot of experience.

38
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:24,488
If I say a matter of import is brewing, I...

39
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:33,284
Hey.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,074

41
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:28,486
Oz.

42
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:36,965
When... when did you get back?

43
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:40,802
Pretty much now.

44
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:46,727
Oz. Man... Hate to sound grandma,
but you don't call, you don't write.

45
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:49,444
Yeah. Sorry.

46
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:52,966
So are you here here,
orjust passing through?

47
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:57,490
Let's not bombard the poor chap
with questions right off.

48
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,643
Can I get you something? Tea perhaps?

49
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,088
I'll pass. Thanks.

50
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:10,453
Look, I'm going to Devon's to see
if he's got a place I can crash, but

51
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:13,047
I was hoping that we could talk.

52
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,851
Later.

53
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,924
Tonight?

54
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:20,884
I guess so.

55
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:24,562
I'll come by your place?

56
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,132
OK.

57
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,361
It's great to see you guys again.

58
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,250
Really.

59
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,210
Everyone's uncomfortable now.

60
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:46,402
- You OK?
- I...

61
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:51,089
I just... I realised I'm late for study group.

62
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:54,212
- Tara, wait.
- No, no, it's OK.

63
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:59,447
You should be with your friends,
and... and I should go.

64
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,530
But...

65
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:16,612
So, I was missing something
this afternoon, wasn't I?

66
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:22,086
Break-ups are tough, but when Oz walked in
it seemed emotions were running extra high.

67
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:24,289
Oz and Willow had a rough break-up.

68
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,605
Hold that thought.

69
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:37,964
Man. That was record time.

70
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,206
- It's no fun when they're that easy.
- Speak for yourself.

71
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:48,008
Base, this is Agent Finn. We've an HST down.
Please send a retrieval team to sector 72.

72
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,244
We're swamped here.
We'll get to it as soon as we can.

73
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:55,211
So, I was about to say something fascinating.

74
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:58,971
- Oz and Willow.
- Right.

75
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:01,044
They had a rough break-up.

76
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:06,528
Some stuff came up
and Oz pretty much bailed overnight.

77
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,968
It left Will really devastated.

78
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:10,850
I remember.

79
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:14,926
Before that they were doing great.
She was dealing with Oz being a werewolf...

80
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:17,004
Whoa. Back up there.

81
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:20,290
Oz is a werewolf
and Willow was dating him?

82
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:25,125
- Yes. Hence the high emotions.
- You're kidding me.

83
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:29,806
Gotta say, I'm surprised.
I didn't think Willow was that kind of girl.

84
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:32,930
- What kind of girl?
- Into dangerous guys.

85
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:36,403
- She seems smarter than that.
- Oz is not dangerous.

86
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,961
Something happened to him
that wasn't his fault.

87
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:41,283
God, I never knew you were such a bigot.

88
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:43,887
Whoa. Hey. How did we get to bigot?

89
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:46,726
It's just weird to date
someone who tries to eat you.

90
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,533
Yeah, well, love isn't logical, Riley.

91
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:53,322
It's not like you can be Mr Joe Sensible
about it all the time.

92
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,768
God knows, I haven't been.

93
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:58,162
I'm not talking about you.

94
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:02,644
How about we don't talk about this at all?
OK? Let's just patrol.

95
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:13,570
Hey.

96
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,171
Hey.

97
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:21,804
So,

98
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,723
you wanna come inside?

99
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:29,127
Actually, I want you to come outside.

100
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,201
I wanna show you something.

101
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,490
Oz.

102
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,763
This is all so weird.

103
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:50,048
I feel like

104
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:54,126
this isn't really happening.
Like it's a dream or something.

105
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,049
It's real.

106
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:58,771
Look up.

107
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,606
- What?
- Look at the sky.

108
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:07,567
I guess you stopped keeping track after I left.

109
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,644
Full moon.

110
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,130
Full moon.

111
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,805
Full moon, but how?

112
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,963
I mean, you did it.

113
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,443
How did you do it? Where did you go?

114
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:21,808
It's a long story.

115
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:24,604
My God, Oz.

116
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,566
This is...

117
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:39,043
I mean, that's wonderful for you.

118
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:44,969
I talked to Xander, and he said
you didn't have a new guy.

119
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,403
No.

120
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,688
No new guy.

121
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:01,566
I know what I put you through,
and I'm not gonna push.

122
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:08,567
But I am a different person than when I left.

123
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,367
And I can be what you need now.

124
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,808
That's what I want.

125
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:19,364
That's why I'm here.

126
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:25,686
This is sector 27. We're all clear.

127
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,930
Sir.

128
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,725
I love this.

129
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:04,203
A woman in Tibet traded it to me
for the Radiohead record.

130
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:07,490
Got a lot of mileage out of the barter system.

131
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,766
So, Tibet was your favourite?

132
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:13,048
Well, it's where I stayed the longest.

133
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:17,890
A warlock in Romania sent me to the monks
there to learn some meditation techniques.

134
00:10:17,973 --> 00:10:21,488
Very intense.
All about keeping your inner cool.

135
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:24,887
Good, cos you were such a spaz before.

136
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:28,491
So that's it?

137
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:31,849
You keep your cool and no more wolfie?

138
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:37,963
No, there's more. I take some herbs and stuff.
Some chanting. A couple of charms.

139
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,523
It's incredible.

140
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,922
You've been all around the world.

141
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:48,204
You've had this complete
mind/body transformation.

142
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:53,448
I've just been here. Same old Sunnydale.

143
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,763
- Doesn't mean you've not gone through a lot.
- It's true.

144
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:04,886
Some of it, you know, was me telling myself
I hated you and cursing your name.

145
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,725
- Not literally.
- Thanks for that.

146
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:13,728
And, I don't know, I...

147
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:17,806
I think I'm getting better
at my spells and stuff.

148
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:26,723
- It's so light out.
- Yeah, we talked all night.

149
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:31,042
I believe a manly-sized breakfast
is in order, don't you?

150
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:36,409
Or we could just sleep a little while.

151
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:42,048
Whatever you want.

152
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:46,570
I'll have the less confusing waffles right now.

153
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,207
Breakfast it is.

154
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,090
Let me just freshen up.

155
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:13,122
- Oh... Sorry, I'll come back.
- Are you looking for Willow?

156
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:17,092
- She's just in the bathroom down the hall.
- No, no. No, it's OK.

157
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:20,929
- I saw you at Giles' yesterday.
- Yeah.

158
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:24,608
Sometimes Willow
takes me with her to the Scoobies.

159
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,886
Are you sure you don't wanna come in?

160
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:49,929
- What?
- Your friend came by. The blonde girl.

161
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,324
But she wouldn't stay.

162
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,723
So what do you think?

163
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:57,849
Where do you wanna go?

164
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:11,847
- Morning.
- Morning.

165
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:39,647
Are those, like, regulation?
Do you have to do those every morning?

166
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,691
No. It's just a good way to start the day.

167
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:49,445
Then you can have your perfectly balanced
breakfast, and then you can call your mother.

168
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:54,290
OK, I've been up less than a minute
and somehow I've managed to piss you off.

169
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,284
- I should go home.
- No.

170
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:01,089
Come on.

171
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,688
Is it that whole thing about Willow last night?

172
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:09,767
Look, I only said what I said because
I'm concerned. I don't wanna see her get hurt.

173
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:14,684
You sounded like Mr Initiative:
"Demons bad, people good."

174
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:17,162
Something wrong with that theorem?

175
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,487
There's different degrees of...

176
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,370
Evil?

177
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:27,288
It's just different with different demons.

178
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:35,609
There are creatures - vampires, for example -
that aren't evil at all.

179
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:39,044
Name one.

180
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:43,121
Rye, we need you downstairs.

181
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,647
- The Beta team got hit.
- Bad?

182
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,724
We lost Willis.

183
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:50,725
- Graham?
- He's walking.

184
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:53,008
We're going on a hunt.

185
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:58,049
What kind of demon was it?

186
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,169
Does it matter?

187
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,527
- Hey.
- Hey.

188
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:15,769
You OK?

189
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:17,844
Yeah, I just...

190
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,768
I don't wanna talk about it.

191
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,243
I wanna hear about you and Oz.
You saw him, right?

192
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:31,483
- I was with him all night.
- All night? Oh, my God.

193
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:33,291
Wait.

194
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:37,207
- Last night was a wolf moon, right?
- Yep.

195
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:41,969
- Either you're gonna say something kinky...
- No kink.

196
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:44,169
He didn't change, Buffy.

197
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:48,292
He said he was gonna find a cure
and he did. In Tibet.

198
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,967
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

199
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:55,162
OK, I'm all with the whoo-hoo here
and you're not.

200
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,325
No, there's "whoo" and "hoo".

201
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:03,043
But there's "uh-oh" and "why now?"

202
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:06,523
And it's complicated.

203
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:09,484
Why complicated?

204
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:17,442
It's complicated because of Tara.

205
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,808
You mean Tara has a crush on Oz?

206
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,804
No, you...

207
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:35,810
Um,...

208
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:37,485
Well...

209
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:43,008
That's great. You know, I mean,
I think Tara's a really great girl, Will.

210
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:44,890
She is.

211
00:16:44,973 --> 00:16:48,443
And there's something between us.

212
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:51,812
It wasn't something I was looking for.

213
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:55,882
It's just powerful.

214
00:16:55,973 --> 00:17:00,763
And it's totally different
from what Oz and I have.

215
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,369
Well, there you go. I mean,

216
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:09,050
you have to... you have to follow your heart,
Will. And that's what's important, Will.

217
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:13,610
Why do you keep saying my name like that?

218
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,888
Like what, Will?

219
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:19,450
Are you freaked?

220
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:22,242
What? No, Will...

221
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:26,251
No.

222
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,882
No. Absolutely no to that question.

223
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,564
I'm glad you told me.

224
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:40,411
- What did you say to Oz?
- I was gonna tell him,

225
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:46,728
but then we started hanging out and
I could just feel everything coming back.

226
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,444
He's Oz, you know?

227
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,922
Yeah. I know.

228
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:58,563
I don't wanna hurt anyone, Buffy.

229
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:02,690
No matter what, somebody's gonna get hurt.

230
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:08,450
And the important thing is you just have
to be honest, or it's gonna be a lot worse.

231
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:28,129
From the sound of those massive
mud flaps, I'd peg you as a demon,

232
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,773
which means you're in for a world of

233
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,369
pain.

234
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:36,603
Spike, I want you to come with me.

235
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,325
Do you? Well, let's go then.

236
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:44,486
Come.

237
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:48,327
- You're going to help me with my problem.
- Why's that exactly?

238
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:50,802
I am going to help you with yours.

239
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,167
Hi.

240
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,330
Hi.

241
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:06,330
I can only stay for a minute. I have class.

242
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:10,082
Me, too. I have class, too.

243
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:16,087
I just want you to know that
what you saw this morning, it wasn't...

244
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:19,006
No, it's OK. I always knew
that if he came back...

245
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:22,369
We were just talking. Nothing happened.

246
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,166
Really?

247
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:33,607
But, you know, it was intense, just talking.

248
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:37,402
We have a lot to talk about.

249
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:41,845
I kinda feel like my head's gonna explode.

250
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:51,249
Whatever, you know, happens,
I'll still be here. I'll still be your friend.

251
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:56,763
Of course we'll be friends.
That's not even a question.

252
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:00,691
But I'm saying, I know what Oz means to you.

253
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:04,767
How can you, when I'm not even sure?

254
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:09,322
I mean, I know what he meant to me.

255
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:17,603
But he left and everything changed.

256
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:21,163
I changed, and then we...

257
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:24,003
What?

258
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:30,369
I don't know. I just... Life was starting
to get so good again, and

259
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:34,923
you're a big part of that.

260
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,804
And here comes the thing
I wanted most of all, and

261
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:43,884
I don't know what to do.

262
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:47,204
I wanna know, but I don't.

263
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:54,208
Do what makes you happy.

264
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,890
Willow.

265
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,651
Hey.

266
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,122
I thought I sme... heard Willow.

267
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,325
Hey.

268
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:34,247
You're... you're coming
back to school here, huh?

269
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,891
Pretty much feeling oddly motivated.

270
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:40,165
That's...

271
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:42,170
That's great.

272
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:45,290
I mean, that's great for you and Willow, right?

273
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:49,248
- I hope so.
- Good. That's... Because...

274
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:51,290
Is that her sweater?

275
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:54,843
I just hope that you guys'll be very happy.

276
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:59,362
You smell like her.

277
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:03,451
She's all over you, d'you know that?

278
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:07,651
I can't. I... I can't talk about this.

279
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,692
But there's something to talk about?

280
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:15,889
- Are you two involved?
- I have to... I have to go.

281
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:19,932
Because she never said anything to me.
We talked all night, and she never...

282
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:22,004
No, stop.

283
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:25,809
Is she in love with you?

284
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:27,884
Tell me. Is she?

285
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:38,689
Run.

286
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,248
- Are you OK?
- What's going on?

287
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:19,564
Looks like one of the demons
that took out Graham's guys.

288
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:21,644
We'll take it back and make an ID.

289
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,531
- If it is, we'll put him down.
- You don't understand...

290
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,332
Listen, we know what we're doing.
You're in shock.

291
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,404
- But...
- We'll handle it.

292
00:23:31,013 --> 00:23:32,207
No.

293
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:34,887
Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.

294
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:38,966
You see my problem, though. Total
annihilation of the humans doesn't help me.

295
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:42,568
- I'll need heavy casualties on both sides.
- I get that.

296
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:47,932
- I'm still not sure how the Slayer fits in.
- The humans need a leader. A champion.

297
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,330
The Slayer can do that.

298
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,404
Yeah...

299
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:55,132
The thing about the Slayer is, she is whiny,

300
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:58,842
but when it comes to the fighting
she does have a tendency to win.

301
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:01,248
Then I guess you should be on her side.

302
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:09,209
This all goes down,
the chip comes out, yeah? No tricks?

303
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:11,729
Scout's honour.

304
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:15,328
- You were a Boy Scout?
- Parts of me.

305
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:26,844
What's up? You OK?

306
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:31,085
Oz. We were talking
and he changed right in front of me.

307
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:34,927
- What? It's daylight.
- I know, but it happened.

308
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:37,402
- Oh, my God. Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

309
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:41,122
Riley and the commando guys
stopped him, but they don't know it's Oz.

310
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:45,570
- I tried to tell them, but they took him away.
- When? Just now?

311
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:48,451
- I think they might hurt him.
- I have to go find Buffy.

312
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:50,524
I know.

313
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,652
Tara said they took him,
right before she found me.

314
00:24:55,733 --> 00:25:00,807
So that's good, right? I mean, they probably
haven't had time to eviscerate him yet.

315
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:03,202
An, you can help by making this a quiet time.

316
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:07,127
Again we're faced with the prospect
of having to infiltrate the Initiative.

317
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:12,765
It'd be great if we knew someone dating
a man on the inside, with connections. Wait.

318
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:16,050
He's still not answering his pages.
I left him another message.

319
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,522
- So what do we do?
- We need to move fast.

320
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:22,811
So we make a plan without Riley
and hope he calls.

321
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:40,443
What's the word?
Is this the animal that took apart our men?

322
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:43,969
- We don't know yet.
- Why the delay? Graham gave a description.

323
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:48,729
He described characteristics present
in over 40 known varieties of demon.

324
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:53,603
- So we're crosschecking DNA evidence...
- And how long's that gonna take?

325
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:56,444
I have no idea.

326
00:25:56,533 --> 00:26:00,287
I don't need a bunch of tests
to know that this thing's a killer.

327
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:18,723
- Hey, he's coming to. Oz.
- We gave him Haldol to keep him quiet.

328
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:22,601
- Why? He's not a threat now.
- You only stay if you let us do our work.

329
00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:27,369
Only Colonel McNamara can place a cease
order on medical testing. He said proceed.

330
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:32,766
I always suspected werewolf transformations
being based on a lunar cycle was just talk.

331
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,283
That's enough. He's a student. I know him.

332
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:40,728
- Take him out.
- Yes, sir.

333
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,964
Let's go.

334
00:26:55,773 --> 00:27:00,164
See that? Transformation
related to negative stimulation.

335
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,803
Something's wrong.
Riley usually returns my calls by now.

336
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:07,330
- We can't wait much longer.
- I know.

337
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:10,769
OK. Xander, you and I are gonna go in.
We've done it before.

338
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:13,651
- I'm going with you.
- No. It's too dangerous, Will.

339
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:18,205
You need to help Giles hack into the
electrical grid and power down the Initiative.

340
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:23,413
Giles can do it without me. I can give him all
the instructions, I can show him what to do.

341
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:26,042
- Of course.
- I can'tjust sit here.

342
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:32,210
OK.

343
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:34,488
OK, you can back us up.

344
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:38,930
You get into the Initiative via the elevator in
the Lowell House, but my clearance is gone.

345
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:43,245
- So we grab a guy, make him take us.
- Or you could just use the back way.

346
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,166
- Hell of a lot less bother.
- How did you get in?

347
00:27:46,253 --> 00:27:48,323
The door was unlocked.

348
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:51,849
You might wanna watch that.
Someone dangerous could get in.

349
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:55,369
Or someone formerly dangerous
and currently annoying.

350
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:58,604
Now, now. None of that.

351
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,730
Or I won't help you get Red's mongrel back.

352
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:06,809
Bad news travels fast with us demons.
We all like a good laugh.

353
00:28:07,013 --> 00:28:09,049
Short of cash, Spike?

354
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:11,931
I happen to be seeking
monetary gratification, yeah.

355
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:15,483
But I also get a kick out of
jacking up those army ginks myself.

356
00:28:15,573 --> 00:28:18,770
I know how to find the big guy
who can take you to Oz.

357
00:28:18,853 --> 00:28:22,368
Uh-huh. So what's the going rate
on a wild-goose chase, Spike?

358
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:25,805
Fine, if you're not interested.

359
00:28:25,893 --> 00:28:30,523
But I was stuck in that hole, and I've
heard things from guys who've gotten out.

360
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:34,845
I can get you in. No alarms,
no cameras, no waiting.

361
00:28:58,173 --> 00:28:59,970
Oz.

362
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:03,569
Put these on, man.

363
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:05,769
Come on.

364
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:23,244
End of the line.

365
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:43,803
At ease.

366
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:47,169
- Permission to speak, Colonel.
- Denied.

367
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:51,644
Being new around here, Finn, I had a look
at your record and Professor Walsh's notes.

368
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:55,328
Until recently you were
an exemplary soldier headed for the top.

369
00:29:55,613 --> 00:30:01,404
Then you meet this girl, this slayer, and
suddenly begin to exhibit signs of disloyalty.

370
00:30:01,973 --> 00:30:03,884
You abuse your command.

371
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,324
But tonight?

372
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:11,770
To release a lethal HST
back into the population...

373
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:15,243
- Sir, the prisoner...
- You will speak when I tell you to.

374
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:21,531
Tomorrow I'll institute a court martial
to investigate your involvement

375
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:24,173
with the Slayer and her band of freaks.

376
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:29,362
They're anarchists, Finn.

377
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:32,083
Too backwards for the real world.

378
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:37,684
You help us take them down
and you just might save your military career.

379
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:41,209
Otherwise, you'll go to your grave
labelled a traitor.

380
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,689
No woman's worth that.

381
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:54,813
I mentioned I'd kill you
if this is a scam, right?

382
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:59,045
- Look, would I wear this if it was?
- You do sort of look like an evil olive.

383
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:01,408
Guys? Check it out.

384
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:24,252
For a nasty town like Sunnydale,
nobody seems to mind their locks.

385
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,722
You first.

386
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:49,285
Try tapping in "XH4J7" for
the emergency shutdown command.

387
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:54,006
That covers the entire electrical grid
for the university and outlying area.

388
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:12,487
Slap my hand now.

389
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:15,332
- Beg your pardon?
- In celebration.

390
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:19,884
Yes.

391
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:28,448
You know who I am?

392
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:33,131
- Yeah.
- Then you know I'm pretty good with this.

393
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:35,249
Take us to him.

394
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,688
Finn stays in the brig.

395
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:41,607
Helping an HST escape is a court-martial
offence. You'll make matters worse.

396
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,888
Riley tried to help Oz escape?

397
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:47,327
That's who you came for.

398
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:50,485
- The wolf.
- Guess we're two for one.

399
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:52,922
Get dressed.

400
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,324
Hey, you dropped...

401
00:33:10,493 --> 00:33:13,644
- How'd you get in?
- Talk later. Stealthy escape now.

402
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:15,371
Buffy.

403
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,887
I leave now, I can't ever come back.

404
00:33:20,493 --> 00:33:22,688
I just wanted to hear that out loud.

405
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,444
Hold it.

406
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:41,090
Stay back, or I'll pull a "William Burroughs"
on your leader here.

407
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:44,527
You'll bore him to death with free prose?

408
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,245
Was I the only one awake
in English that day?

409
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,324
I'll kill him.

410
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:53,404
Get him out.

411
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:03,844
- Oz.
- Willow, get back.

412
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:16,684
Let's go.

413
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:01,490
You're a dead man, Finn.

414
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:07,450
No, sir.

415
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:09,844
I'm an anarchist.

416
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:19,363
I hope everybody else is OK.

417
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:25,130
It was better to split up, right?
I mean, we're just too findable in a big clump.

418
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:30,128
It was better. Besides, I think
it's mostly me the Initiative wants now.

419
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:34,690
Probably.

420
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:38,091
So what shall we do?

421
00:35:38,173 --> 00:35:40,164
We'll be safe for tonight at least.

422
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:44,849
The camps are still blacked out,
so that oughta slow the Initiative down.

423
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:48,289
I'll figure out my next move tomorrow.

424
00:35:51,813 --> 00:35:54,202
Quite a day, huh?

425
00:35:56,653 --> 00:36:01,044
You woke up to a big bowl of Wheaties.
Now you're a fugitive.

426
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:05,364
I don't know.

427
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:09,247
I'm sorry it ended that way,
but I am glad it's done.

428
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,131
I'm glad I know where I stand, finally.

429
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:17,846
I was wrong about Oz. I was being a bigot.

430
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,089
No, you weren't.

431
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:23,528
You were thrown.

432
00:36:23,613 --> 00:36:28,733
You found out that Willow was in kind of
an unconventional relationship, and

433
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:31,850
it gave you momentary wiggins.

434
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:33,525
It happens.

435
00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:39,643
Still, I was in a totally black-and-white space -
people versus monsters. And it ain't like that.

436
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:42,402
Especially when it comes to love.

437
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:56,486
I have to tell you some stuff, about my past.

438
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,566
And it's not all stuff that you're gonna like.

439
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,407
You can tell me anything.

440
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:12,764
I think so.

441
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,524
I think I can.

442
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:25,931
This thing looks pretty good,
considering you drove it overseas.

443
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:29,492
Well, it broke down outside of Mexico.

444
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:32,883
I traded my bass
to have it fixed and garaged.

445
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,368
I shouldn't have come back now.

446
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,283
I just thought I'd changed.

447
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:47,408
You have changed.

448
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:51,010
You stopped the wolf
from coming out. I saw it.

449
00:37:51,093 --> 00:37:53,288
But I couldn't look at you.

450
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:59,610
I mean, it turns out the one thing
that brings it out of me is you.

451
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:04,849
Which falls under the heading
of "Ironic" in my book.

452
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:07,729
It was my fault.

453
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:09,804
I upset you.

454
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:17,323
Well, so we're safe then,
cos you'll never do that again.

455
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,846
But you're happy?

456
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:27,644
I am.

457
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:32,932
- I can't explain it.
- It may be safer for both of us if you don't.

458
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:41,608
I missed you, Oz.

459
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:45,648
I wrote you so many letters.

460
00:38:47,453 --> 00:38:51,048
But I didn't have any place
to send them, you know?

461
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:57,844
I couldn't live like that.

462
00:39:00,093 --> 00:39:03,369
It was stupid to think
that you'd just be waiting.

463
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:07,364
I was waiting.

464
00:39:09,493 --> 00:39:13,771
I feel like some part of me
will always be waiting for you.

465
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:20,809
Like, if I'm old and blue-haired and I turn
the corner in Istanbul and there you are,

466
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:22,884
I won't be surprised.

467
00:39:24,493 --> 00:39:29,362
Because you're with me, you know?

468
00:39:31,293 --> 00:39:33,329
I know.

469
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:38,725
But now is not that time, I guess.

470
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:44,445
No.

471
00:39:49,813 --> 00:39:52,088
What are you gonna do?

472
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:55,370
I think I'd better take off.

473
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:00,085
When?

474
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,688
Pretty much now.

475
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:57,690
No candles?

476
00:40:57,773 --> 00:41:00,162
Well, I brought one.

477
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:02,767
It's extra flamy.

478
00:41:14,893 --> 00:41:19,250
- Tara, I have to tell you...
- No, I understand.

479
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:23,167
You have to be with the person you love.

480
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,203
I am.

481
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:33,725
You mean...?

482
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:36,202
I mean.

483
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,692
OK?

484
00:41:38,773 --> 00:41:40,411
Oh, yes.

485
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:46,612
I feel horrible about everything I put you
through, and I'm gonna make it up to you.

486
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:50,287
Starting right now.

487
00:41:51,613 --> 00:41:53,808
Right now?

488
00:41:58,013 --> 00:42:01,688
