1
00:00:02,653 --> 00:00:05,451
The Initiative created this
and they can't stop it. But we will.

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,728
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

3
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:12,807
The power of the Slayer and all who wield it.
Last to ancient first, we invoke thee.

4
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:15,123
Make us mind and heart and spiritjoin.

5
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:18,569
- Spiritus: spirit.
- Animus: heart.

6
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:21,531
- Sophus: mind.
- And manus: the hand.

7
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:24,730
You could never hope to grasp
the source of our power.

9
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:23,607
Are you sure you'll be all right?
I can be there in the morning.

10
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:28,448
It's just a debriefing. I won't disappear
and they're not pinning anything on me.

11
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:31,843
Graham and the guys are testifying
I'm the reason they're alive.

12
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,447
I might actually get
an honourable discharge.

13
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,967
- In return for your silence, no doubt.
- Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:41,569
Having the scoop on the administration's
own Bay of Mutated Pigs is an advantage.

15
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:44,690
It's like you're blackmailing the government.

16
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,208
In a patriotic way.

17
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:50,004
I'll call you when it's over.

18
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:53,525
Dinner is served. And my very own recipe.

19
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:57,443
You pushed the button
on the microwave that says popcorn?

20
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:00,764
Actually, I pushed defrost,
but Joyce was there in the clinch.

21
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,844
Well, you guys have fun tonight.

22
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:06,528
- It was very nice meeting you.
- It was nice meeting you finally.

23
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:09,164
- Bye.
- Bye.

24
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:15,166
- Did you notice how pointedly I said finally?
- No.

25
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,244
Let the vidfest begin.

26
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:23,841
- You sure you won'tjoin us?
- No, you guys have your fun. I'm tired.

27
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:27,084
I can't believe you're not exhausted.
Have you slept since...?

28
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:32,167
- Still feel a little bit too wired.
- Yeah, that spell was powerful.

29
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:35,370
- Don't think I could sleep.
- Well, we got plenty of vid.

30
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,445
And I'm putting in a pre-emptive bid
for Apocalypse Now?

31
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,967
Did you get anything less
Heart-of-Darknessy?

32
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:44,443
It's a gay romp! It's the feel-good movie
of whatever year it was.

33
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,967
- What else?
- Don't worry.

34
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:51,843
Got plenty of chick and British-guy flicks.
These puppies should last us all night.

35
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:37,162
I think it's strange.

36
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:42,324
I mean, I think I should worry
that we haven't found her a name.

37
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:45,648
Who? Miss Kitty?

38
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:51,365
You'd think she'd let us
know her name by now.

39
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:54,445
She will. She's not all grown yet.

40
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:57,601
You're not worried?

41
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:00,253
I never worry here.

42
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,324
I'm safe here.

43
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:05,692
You don't know everything about me.

44
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,567
Have you told me your real name?

45
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:12,762
You know that.

46
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:20,726
They will find out, you know.

47
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,448
About you.

48
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,642
I don't have time to think about that.

49
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,326
You know I have all this homework to finish.

50
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:37,804
- Are you gonna finish in time for class?
- I can be late.

51
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:41,883
But you've never taken drama before.

52
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:44,362
You might miss something important.

53
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,962
I don't wanna leave here.

54
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:54,242
Why not?

55
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:03,282
It's so bright.

56
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:08,842
And there's something out there.

57
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:23,366
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.

58
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,523
Heard you're taking drama.

59
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:28,207
- It's a tough course.
- You took it?

60
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:31,569
- I've been here for ever.
- So what you been doing?

61
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:36,010
- Doing spells? She does spells with Tara.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

62
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,684
I'm gonna be late.

63
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:44,684
Sometimes I think about
two women doing a spell,

64
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:47,162
and then I do a spell by myself.

65
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:09,207
Isn't this exciting? Our first production!
I can't wait till our scene! I love you!

66
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:12,726
- Don't step on my cues.
- Production?

67
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,366
Oh, my God! The place is packed.
Everybody's here.

68
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,921
Your family's in the front row.
They look angry.

69
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:22,767
- There's a production?
- Somebody's got stage fright.

70
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:24,844
Isn't this the first class?

71
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:28,892
Well, you showed up late,
or you'd have a better part. I'm Cowboy Guy.

72
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:33,845
Your costume is perfect. Nobody's gonna
know the truth. You know, about you.

73
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:37,209
- Costume?
- You're already in character.

74
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:40,046
I should've done that!

75
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,612
But how come...

76
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:47,211
I was given to understand that a drama class
would have, you know, drama class.

77
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:51,252
- We haven't even rehearsed!
- Maybe some people haven't.

78
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,131
I showed up on time,
so I got to be Cowboy Guy!

79
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:59,608
I just think it's really early to be
putting on a play. I don't even know what...

80
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:02,810
It isn't Madame Butterfly, is it?
I have a problem with opera.

81
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:05,965
All right, everyone! Pay attention!

82
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:10,286
In just a few moments, that curtain
is going to open on our very first production.

83
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,968
Everyone Willow's ever met
is in that audience, including all of us.

84
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:16,089
That means we have to be perfect.

85
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:21,566
Stay in character, remember your lines,
and energy, energy in the musical numbers!

86
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:24,766
- Did anyone see that?
- Acting is about hiding.

87
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:29,404
The audience wants to find you, strip you
naked and eat you alive, so hide. Stop that!

88
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:32,769
Now, costumes, sets,
the things that you, you know...

89
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,413
You hold them, you touch them, use them.

90
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:36,892
- Props?
- No.

91
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,692
- Props?
- Yes! It's all about subterfuge.

92
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:44,563
That's very annoying. Now, go on out there,
lie like dogs and have a wonderful time.

93
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:48,532
If we stay in focus, keep our heads,
and if Willow doesn't step on cues,

94
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:52,401
this'll be the best production of
Death of a Salesman we've done. Stop it!

95
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:54,609
Good luck, everyone! Break a leg!

96
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,291
I've made a little space for the cheese slices.

97
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:48,288
- Things aren't going very well.
- No! This drama class is just...

98
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:53,049
They're not doing things in the proper way.
I'm in a play and my whole family's out there.

99
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,364
Why is there a cowboy
in Death of a Salesman anyway?

100
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:59,402
You don't understand yet, do you?

101
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,763
- Is there something following me?
- Yes.

102
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:07,933
Well, what should I do?

103
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:11,289
The play's gonna start soon
and I don't even know my lines.

104
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:14,012
The play's already started.
That's not the point.

105
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:23,928
Why, hello, little lady.
Can I hold those milk pails for you?

106
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:27,451
Why, thank you. But they're not very heavy.

107
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,331
Why have you come
to our Ionely small town,

108
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:33,723
which has no post office
and very few exports?

109
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,088
I've come looking for a man.

110
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,010
A salesman.

111
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,929
Everyone's starting to wonder about you.
The real you.

112
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:47,404
If they find out, they'll punish you.
I can't help you with that.

113
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:53,529
What's after me?
Is it something I was supposed to do?

114
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:56,207
- Was I supposed to...?
- Shh!

115
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,328
What was that?

116
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:06,126
What else could I expect from a bunch
of low-rent, no-account hoodlums like you?

117
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:10,968
Hoodlums, yes! You and your friends, your
whole sex. Throw 'em in the sea for all I care!

118
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:15,569
Throw 'em in and wait for the bubbles. Men
groping and spitting, all groin, no brain,

119
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:19,441
three billion of you passing around
the same worn-out urge. Men!

120
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:22,206
With your sales!

121
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:28,683
Tara?

122
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:31,044
Tara, this really isn't...

123
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:41,168
Will!

124
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:44,529
- Buffy! Oh, God.
- Come on.

125
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,644
Stay low.

126
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:52,367
- What did it look like?
- I don't know.

127
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:56,002
- I don't know what's after me.
- You must have done something.

128
00:10:56,093 --> 00:11:00,530
No. I never do anything.
I'm very seldom naughty.

129
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:04,125
I just came to class,
and the play was starting.

130
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:08,608
The play is long over.
Why are you still in costume?

131
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:11,969
OK, still having to explain,
wearing this is just my outfit.

132
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:15,490
Willow, everybody already knows. Take it off.

133
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:19,401
No. I need it.

134
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:22,087
For God's sake, just take it off!

135
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:26,047
That's better. It's much more realistic.

136
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:30,685
See? Is everybody very clear on this now?

137
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,287
Oh, my God, it's like a tragedy.

138
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:39,767
I tried to warn you.

139
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:43,808
It's exactly like a Greek tragedy.
There should only be Greeks.

140
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:53,609
My book report. This summer I read
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.

141
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:56,571
Oh, who cares!

142
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:03,082
This book has many themes.

143
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:09,686
Help! Help! Help me!

144
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,092
Help me!

145
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,924
I'm awake. I'm good.

146
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:34,005
- Did I miss anything?
- Nothing much at all really.

147
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:36,243
Bunch of massacring.

148
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:41,402
We gotta keep going, men.

149
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:44,648
We gotta take that hill.

150
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:47,684
Damn this war!

151
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:51,483
I have to say, I really feel
that Apocalypse Now is overrated.

152
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:54,167
No, no. It gets better.

153
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:57,451
- Men?
- I remember that it gets better.

154
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:01,164
Oh, my God.

155
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:03,644
What's happened to my men?

156
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:07,772
- Want some corn?
- Butter flavour?

157
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,526
- New-car smell.
- Cool!

158
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:14,771
- What's her deal?
- Big faker.

159
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:19,449
I'm beginning to understand this now.
It's all about the journey, isn't it?

160
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,127
Thanks for making me have to pee.

161
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:25,603
- You don't need any help with that, right?
- I got a system.

162
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:35,165
Hey.

163
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:38,931
Hey, Joyce... Mrs Summers.

164
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:41,962
We're not making too much noise
down there?

165
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:45,649
Oh, no. Anyway, they all left a while ago.

166
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,443
Oh, I should probably go catch up.

167
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:53,611
- Heard that before.
- I move pretty fast.

168
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:56,571
- You know, a man's always after...
- Conquest?

169
00:13:58,013 --> 00:14:00,288
I'm a conquistador.

170
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:03,044
You sure it isn't comfort?

171
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,683
I'm a comfortador also.

172
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:10,682
I do know the difference.
I've learned about boys.

173
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:13,448
That's cool about you.

174
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,765
It's very late.
Would you like to rest for a while?

175
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,247
Yeah. I'd like you.

176
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:29,245
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom first.

177
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,642
Don't get lost.

178
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,522
OK, I'm gonna find another bathroom.

179
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,042
I didn't order any vampires.

180
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:32,842
That's not the way out.

181
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,924
Hey, there you are.

182
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:54,251
Are you sure it's us you were looking for?

183
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:01,165
Giles here is gonna teach me to be a watcher.
Says I got the stuff.

184
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:05,004
- Spike's like a son to me.
- That's good.

185
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:09,685
I was into that for a while,
but I got other stuff going on.

186
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:20,603
You gotta have something.
Gotta be with moving forward.

187
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,044
Like a shark.

188
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:28,012
Like a shark with feet and much less fins.

189
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:31,369
- And on land.
- Very good!

190
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,802
Buffy, are you sure you wanna play there?

191
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:40,050
- It's a pretty big sandbox.
- I'm OK.

192
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,647
It's not coming for me yet.

193
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:48,683
I just mean you can't protect yourself
from some stuff.

194
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:52,763
- I'm way ahead of you, big brother.
- Brother?

195
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:04,001
Come on, put your back into it!
A watcher scoffs at gravity.

196
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,842
Do you know where you're going?

197
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:42,528
I've been thinking
about getting back into vengeance.

198
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:46,207
- Is that right?
- Well, you know how I miss it.

199
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:48,409
I'm so at loose ends since I quit.

200
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:51,451
I think this is going to be
a very big year for vengeance.

201
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:55,572
But isn't vengeance kind of vengeful?

202
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,843
- You don't want me to have a hobby.
- Not a vengeance hobby, no.

203
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:02,811
It's dangerous.
People can't do anything they want.

204
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:06,442
Society has rules and borders
and an end zone. It doesn't matter if...

205
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:11,842
Do you mind? I'm talking to my demon.

206
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:17,289
- Sorry.
- We just think you're really interesting.

207
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:21,892
- Oh, I'm going places.
- I'm way ahead of you.

208
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:31,128
Is that right?

209
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:35,048
Watch this.

210
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:50,247
Do you wanna come in the back with us?

211
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,885
Oh, go on.

212
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:57,123
- I don't have to.
- I'll be fine.

213
00:18:57,213 --> 00:19:01,411
I think I've figured out how to steer
by gesturing emphatically.

214
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,284
Girls?

215
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:59,082
I know what's up there!

216
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:07,845
These will not protect you.

217
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:30,045
Giles!

218
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,886
- Xander, what are you doing here?
- What's after me?

219
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:36,282
It's because of what we did, I know that.

220
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,763
What we did?

221
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:42,289
The others have gone on ahead.
Now, listen very carefully.

222
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:46,048
Your life may depend on
what I'm about to tell you. You need...

223
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:57,082
What? Go where? I don't understand.

224
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:09,523
Honey, I don't... I can't hear you.

225
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:15,002
Wait! Where are we going?

226
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:18,444
Where? Hey!

227
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,604
Let go! Hey!

228
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:42,491
Where are you from, Harris?

229
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:45,688
Well, the basement, mostly.

230
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:49,167
Were you born there?

231
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:52,290
Possibly.

232
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:56,366
I walked by
your guidance counsellor's office one time.

233
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:01,645
A bunch of you were sitting there,

234
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:05,968
waiting to be shepherded.

235
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,091
I remember it smelled like dead flowers.

236
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:14,442
Like decay.

237
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,967
Then it hit me.

238
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:21,243
The hope of our nation's future
is a bunch of mulch.

239
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:29,127
You know, I never got the chance to tell you
how glad I was you were eaten by a snake.

240
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,928
Where are you heading?

241
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:39,891
Well, I'm supposed to meet Tara and Willow.

242
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:44,924
And possibly Buffy's mom.

243
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:52,287
Your time is running out.

244
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:56,569
No, I'm just trying to get away.

245
00:22:56,653 --> 00:22:59,042
There's something I can't fight.

246
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:02,243
Are you a soldier?

247
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:05,444
I'm a comfortador.

248
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:11,971
You're neither. You're a whipping boy,

249
00:23:12,053 --> 00:23:16,046
raised by mongrels
and set on a sacrificial stone.

250
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:22,364
I'm getting a cramp.

251
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:36,525
- Giles, it's here!
- This is more serious than we thought.

252
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:40,208
- I can fight anything, right?
- Maybe we should slap her.

253
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,524
Buffy?

254
00:24:27,253 --> 00:24:29,562
That's not the way out.

255
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,205
What the hell is wrong with you?
You won't come upstairs?

256
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:39,602
What are you, ashamed of us?

257
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:44,161
- Your mother's crying her guts out!
- You don't understand.

258
00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:48,045
No. You don't understand.

259
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:51,043
The line ends here with us.

260
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:55,368
And you're not gonna change that.
You haven't got the heart.

261
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:12,048
You have to stop thinking.

262
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:15,244
Let it wash over you.

263
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:17,843
Don't you think it's old-fashioned?

264
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,289
This is the way women and men
have behaved since the beginning.

265
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:23,170
Before time.

266
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:25,289
Now look into the light.

267
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:31,686
Step on up, step on up! Try your luck!

268
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:34,162
Come on! Come on!

269
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:38,970
- We'll miss the good stuff!
- Does she always want to train so badly?

270
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:43,126
- She's never heard the fable about patience.
- Which one is that?

271
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:46,603
The one with the fox and the less patient fox.

272
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:49,526
- Here. I want to, I want to!
- Yes, go ahead.

273
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:51,604
I am a vampire!

274
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:56,162
Buffy, you have a sacred birthright
to protect mankind.

275
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:58,642
Don't stick out your elbow.

276
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:01,570
I am a vampire!

277
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:03,484
You staked me!

278
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:09,043
- I haven't got any treats.
- For God's sake, Rupert, go easy on the girl.

279
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:12,523
This is my business.
Blood of the lamb and all that.

280
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:16,285
Now you're gonna get that all over your face.

281
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:21,604
I know you. I know you.

282
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:25,367
Hey! Come on!

283
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:28,444
You're gonna miss everything!

284
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:36,047
Don't push me around.
I have a great deal to do.

285
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:40,567
I've hired myself out as an attraction.

286
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,049
Sideshow freak?

287
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,328
Well, at least it's showbiz.

288
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:56,369
- What do I do with all of this?
- You gotta make up your mind, Rupes.

289
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,523
What are you wasting time for?

290
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:04,331
Haven't you figured it all out yet
with your enormous squishy frontal lobe?

291
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,567
I still think Buffy should have killed you.

292
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:15,369
I wear the cheese. It does not wear me.

293
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:19,243
Honestly, you meet
the most appalling sort of people.

294
00:27:36,693 --> 00:27:41,164
I'm so sorry I'm late. There's a great deal
going on. And all at once!

295
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:44,848
Don't we know it. Only at death's door
over here. Look at Xander!

296
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,208
Got the sucking chest wound swinging.

297
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:51,286
I promised Anya I'd be there for her big night.
Now I'll be pushing up daisies,

298
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:55,571
in the sense of being in the ground
and fertilising the soil with decomposition.

299
00:27:56,493 --> 00:28:00,771
OK. A man walks into the office of a doctor.

300
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,605
He's wearing on his head...

301
00:28:03,693 --> 00:28:07,527
- Wait, there's a duck. Is that right?
- You suck!

302
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:10,685
Quiet! You'll miss the humorous conclusion.

303
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:14,288
- She's doing quite well.
- Do you know this is your fault?

304
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:17,128
We have to think of the facts, Willow.

305
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:20,011
I'm very busy. I have a gig myself, you know.

306
00:28:20,653 --> 00:28:26,967
Something's after us.
It's like some primal, animal force.

307
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:30,443
- That used to be us.
- Don't get linear on me now, man.

308
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:35,843
And then the duck tells the doctor
that there's a man that's attached to my ass.

309
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:41,043
See, it was the duck
and not the man that spoke.

310
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:48,163
Rupert, you've gotta focus.
You must have some kind of explanation.

311
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:52,531
If we don't know what we're fighting,
I don't think we stand a chance.

312
00:28:52,613 --> 00:28:53,841
 It's strange

313
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:57,528
 It's not like anything we've faced before

314
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:01,445
 It seems familiar somehow

315
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,446
 Of course!

316
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:08,046
 The spell we cast with Buffy

317
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,124
 Must have released

318
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:14,003
 Some primal evil that's come back seeking

319
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:16,206
 I'm not sure what

320
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:20,730
 Willow, look through the chronicles
for some reference

321
00:29:20,813 --> 00:29:23,407
 To a warrior beast

322
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:26,082
 I've got to warn Buffy

323
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:29,451
 There's every chance she might be next

324
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:32,641
 And Xander, help Willow

325
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:39,291
 And try not to bleed on my couch,
I've just had it steam-cleaned

326
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,967
 No, wait

327
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,693
Well, that was obvious.

328
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,962
I know who you are.

329
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:34,163
And I can defeat you with my intellect.

330
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:38,205
I can cripple you with my thoughts.

331
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:43,923
Of course, you underestimate me.
You couldn't know.

332
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:46,644
You never had a watcher.

333
00:31:02,013 --> 00:31:04,004
Buffy, wake up!

334
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:08,169
Buffy, you have to wake up right away!

335
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,527
I'm not really in charge of these things.

336
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:15,447
Please wake up. Oh, please!

337
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:20,286
I need my beauty sleep. So stop it, OK?

338
00:31:29,533 --> 00:31:31,842
Faith and I just made that bed.

339
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:33,932
For who?

340
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,442
I thought you were here to tell me.

341
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,928
The guys aren't here, are they?

342
00:31:44,013 --> 00:31:46,573
We were gonna hang out and watch movies.

343
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:49,451
- You lost them.
- No.

344
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:53,170
No.

345
00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:55,642
I think they need me to find them.

346
00:31:58,453 --> 00:32:00,842
It's so late.

347
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:05,128
That clock's completely wrong. Here.

348
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:11,243
- I'm never gonna use those.
- You think you know.

349
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:14,891
What's to come. What you are.

350
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:18,773
You haven't even begun.

351
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:25,522
I think I need to go find the others.

352
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,524
Be back before dawn.

353
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:36,448
Have you seen my friends?

354
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:38,922
They wouldn'tjust disappear.

355
00:32:51,373 --> 00:32:54,206
- Mom?
- Oh, hi, honey!

356
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,009
Why are you living in the walls?

357
00:32:57,093 --> 00:33:00,369
Oh, sweetie, no, I'm fine here.
Don't worry about me.

358
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:07,368
- It looks dirty.
- Well, it seems that way to you.

359
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,970
I made some lemonade
and I'm learning how to play mahjong.

360
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:14,932
- You go find your friends.
- I think they might be in danger.

361
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:20,046
I'm sorry, dear!

362
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:24,047
A mouse is playing with my knees.

363
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,931
I really don't think you should live in there.

364
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:31,969
Well, you could probably
break through the wall.

365
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:40,773
- Hey, there, killer.
- Riley? You're back?

366
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,844
I never left.

367
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:46,448
- How did the debriefing go?
- I told you not to worry about that.

368
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:49,411
It went great. They made me surgeon general.

369
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:54,929
Why didn't you come and tell me?
We could have celebrated.

370
00:33:56,693 --> 00:33:59,366
We're drawing up a plan
for world domination.

371
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:02,650
The key element? Coffee makers that think.

372
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:08,366
World domination? Is that a good?

373
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:12,924
Baby, we're the government. It's what we do.

374
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:16,403
She's uncomfortable with certain concepts.
It's understandable.

375
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:21,772
Aggression is a natural human tendency,
though you and me come by it another way.

376
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,642
We're not demons.

377
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,530
Is that a fact?

378
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:32,528
Buffy, we've got important work here.
A lot of filing, giving things names.

379
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,084
What was yours?

380
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:39,961
Before Adam?
Not a man among us can remember.

381
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:43,011
The demons have escaped. Run for your lives.

382
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:45,766
- This could be trouble.
- We'd better make a fort.

383
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:47,844
I'll get some pillows.

384
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:57,127
Wait! I have weapons!

385
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,851
I thought you were looking for your friends.

386
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,608
OK, killer. If that's the way you want it,

387
00:35:47,693 --> 00:35:49,888
I guess you're on your own.

388
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:50,842
I'm never gonna find them here.

389
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:56,565
Of course not. That's the reason you came.

390
00:36:59,573 --> 00:37:01,689
You're not in my dream.

391
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:03,968
I was borrowed.

392
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:07,762
- Someone has to speak for her.
- Let her speak for herself.

393
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:10,922
That's what's done in polite circles.

394
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:17,167
- Why do you follow me?
- I don't.

395
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,808
Where are my friends?

396
00:37:20,373 --> 00:37:23,012
You're asking the wrong questions.

397
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:25,243
Make her speak.

398
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:30,407
I have no speech. No name.
I live in the action of death.

399
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:33,371
The blood cry. The penetrating wound.

400
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:37,285
I am destruction. Absolute.

401
00:37:38,013 --> 00:37:39,605
Alone.

402
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:43,082
The Slayer?

403
00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:45,844
The first.

404
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:53,842
I am not alone.

405
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:56,527
The Slayer does not walk in this world.

406
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:01,247
I walk. I talk.

407
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,563
I shop. I sneeze.

408
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:06,565
I'm gonna be a fireman
when the floods roll back.

409
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:09,326
There's trees in the desert
since you moved out.

410
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,802
And I don't sleep on a bed of bones.

411
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:15,728
Now give me back my friends.

412
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:19,604
No friends!

413
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,249
Just the kill.

414
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:25,087
We are alone!

415
00:38:28,213 --> 00:38:30,568
That's it. I'm waking up.

416
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,923
It's over. We don't do this any more.

417
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:04,124
Enough!

418
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:29,163
Are you quite finished? It's over, OK?

419
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:32,245
I'm going to ignore you
and you're going to go away.

420
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:36,923
You're gonna have to get over
the whole primal-power thing.

421
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:41,524
You're not the source of me.

422
00:39:43,973 --> 00:39:47,010
Also, in terms of hair care,
you really wanna say

423
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,653
"What impression am I
making in the workplace?"

424
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:04,372
The first Slayer. Wow!

425
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:07,968
- Not big with the socialisation.
- Or the floss.

426
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:10,044
Somehow ourjoining with Buffy

427
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:13,489
and invoking the essence
of the Slayer's power

428
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:16,246
was an affront to the source of that power.

429
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,450
You know, you could have
brought that up to us before we did it.

430
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:24,561
- I said there could be dire consequences.
- But you say that about chewing too fast.

431
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:27,486
I'm guessing I missed some fun?

432
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:31,771
The spirit of the first Slayer
tried to kill us in our dreams.

433
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:34,367
You want some hot chocolate?

434
00:40:34,853 --> 00:40:36,844
- Xander?
- Yes, what, Joyce?

435
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:41,171
- Buffy's mom.
- Be my kitchen buddy again.

436
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:45,371
- Help me carry?
- Yes. Sure, Buffy's mom.

437
00:40:45,453 --> 00:40:47,683
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

438
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:53,244
- I think I mightjump in the shower.
- You seem a bit, you know...

439
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,324
A little.

440
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:59,926
The first Slayer.
I never really thought about it.

441
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:05,611
It was intense. But I guess you guys
got a taste of that, huh?

442
00:41:05,973 --> 00:41:10,524
Yeah. From now on, you keep your slayer
friends out of my dreams. Is that clear?

443
00:41:10,613 --> 00:41:12,808
She's not good for the sleeping.

444
00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:19,003
Yeah. Well, at least you all didn't
dream about that guy with the cheese.

445
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:22,367
Don't know where the hell that came from.

446
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:39,524
You think you know.

447
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:42,411
What's to come. What you are.

448
00:41:44,453 --> 00:41:46,967
You haven't even begun.

449
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:03,409
