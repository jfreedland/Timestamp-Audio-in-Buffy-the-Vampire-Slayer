00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:05,131
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,528
- What are you?
- I'm the Slayer.

3
00:00:07,693 --> 00:00:12,813
The implant works. Hostile 17 can't harm
any living creature without intense pain.

4
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,691
I can hurt a demon.

5
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:18,652
That's right. I'm back,
and I'm a bloody animal.

6
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,242
I thought we made a pretty good team.

7
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:28,083
You're really strong. I like it.

8
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:34,729
I implore you, Neesah, blessed
goddess of chance and fortune,

9
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:36,804
heed my call.

10
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:39,327
Send to me the heart I desire.

11
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:43,201
You know, magic at the poker table
qualifies as cheating.

12
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,761
That wasn't magic. I was praying.

13
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:47,844
Two, please.

14
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,002
Five.

15
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,847
An, I keep telling you, four's the max,
and only if you have an ace.

16
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:59,168
- OK, four.
- Let's see the ace.

17
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:02,289
Three.

18
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:05,888
What a stupid game. All these rules
just to win little plastic discs.

19
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:09,045
Chips. They're called chips.
They represent money,

20
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:14,492
since none of us has any money. But that'll
change once my merchandise hits the street.

21
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:18,208
What ya got in the boxes? Drugs?

22
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:21,729
- It's not drugs, is it, Xander?
- Not drugs.

23
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:29,451
You are looking at the new
local distributor for Boost bars.

24
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,525
"The natural food bar
that provides a nutritional boost

25
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:34,968
for active, health-conscious people."

26
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,044
- Want one?
- No. Thanks.

27
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:42,605
Those things usually taste kinda tasteless,
and then leave a bad after-tastelessness.

28
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:46,245
Don't let the healthy scare ya.
Check out the ingredients.

29
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,449
See? Loaded with fatty goodness.

30
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:51,650
Come on, somebody bet already.
I got three K cards.

31
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:59,047
Wish that Buff could've made it.
This three-hand poker is not quite the game.

32
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:02,648
Must be with Riley. You know
how it is with a spanking-new boyfriend.

33
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:05,122
Yes, we've enjoyed spanking.

34
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:10,327
Well, the thing is,

35
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:15,005
I think Riley is OK, in an oafish kind of way,

36
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:20,372
but am I the only one with a question mark
over his head about this Initiative thing?

37
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:23,491
Well, they do seem
to fall in the good-guy camp.

38
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:26,087
I mean, they are anti-demon.

39
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:31,048
- Probably pro ex-demon.
- Maybe.

40
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,522
- I choose to feel threatened.
- And why not?

41
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:38,323
There's still heaps we don't know about these
commandos. What exactly are they up to?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,074
Advertise your product or brand here

43
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:02,202
Riley.

44
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:09,652
It took the patrol team
42 minutes to track you,

45
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:12,407
and you neutralised them in 28 seconds.

46
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,529
I was just lucky.

47
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:20,082
I see. Well, still very impressive.

48
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:29,362
I was just being modest with the whole
"lucky" thing. You got that, right?

49
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:31,444
I got it.

50
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,728
Awesome, Buffy.

51
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:39,848
See? You're a hit. Everybody loves you.

52
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,684
Then Professor Walsh said
I was as amazing as Riley had said.

53
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:48,970
Later, he said she couldn't
stop talking about a move I made

54
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:51,886
where I used a commando
as a shield to block a Taser blast.

55
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:56,410
It was, like, 12,000 volts. It took
the guy almost two hours to recover.

56
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,810
How was your night?

57
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:04,124
Like a normal person's.
Light on the action-packed.

58
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:08,729
Hope tonight's not too much
of a letdown for ya, excitement-wise.

59
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,361
You do remember about tonight, right?

60
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:15,092
Bronze. The gang. Are you kidding?

61
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:17,926
I wouldn't be anywhere else. I miss you guys.

62
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:21,043
We haven't spent much time together lately.

63
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:24,609
You've been busy. Fighting armies and stuff.

64
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:28,208
Not to mention other
distractions of a more romantic...

65
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:30,803
Riley just walked in.

66
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:36,964
Do ya wanna let him know you're here?

67
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:42,048
No. Just enjoying a good stare.
Tell me about your night.

68
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:46,287
Well, spent most of it at Xander's
teaching Anya to play poker.

69
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:51,601
- That sounds like fun.
- Except the Anya part and the poker part.

70
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,811
Will, I think you'd better
get used to... A Twinkie?

71
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:58,966
That's his lunch?
Oh, he is so gonna be punished.

72
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,530
- Everyone's gettin' spanked but me.
- What?

73
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:05,608
Nothing.

74
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:20,887
Hey, wipe your feet
when you enter a person's home.

75
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,568
Oh, yes. Careless of me.

76
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:27,524
Tracking mud all over your mud.

77
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:30,010
I admit,

78
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:32,084
it's a bit of a fixer-upper.

79
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:35,927
Needs a woman's touch.

80
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:38,573
Care to have a crack at it?

81
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:44,330
While I'd love to go on trading jabs with
you, Spike, perhaps I'll come to the point.

82
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:46,449
Much as it pains me to say it,

83
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:51,766
I owe you a debt of gratitude for the help
you provided me in my metamorphosis.

84
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:55,732
Stuff the gratitude.
You owe me more than that, mate.

85
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:59,692
There's 300 there. Count it if you like.

86
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,048
I'll do that.

87
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,089
Thinking about your affliction

88
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:18,486
and new-found discovery
that you can fight only demons,

89
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,643
it occurs to me that...

90
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,042
I realise this is completely
against your nature,

91
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:27,968
but has it occurred to you
there may be a higher purpose?

92
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:31,807
You made me lose count.
What are you still doing here?

93
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:34,845
- Talking to myself, apparently.
- Well, piss off, then.

94
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:38,369
This bit of business wraps up
any I got with you and your slayerettes.

95
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:41,013
From now on, I want nothing to do
with the lot of you.

96
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,768
Your choosing to remain in Sunnydale
might make that a little difficult.

97
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:47,890
Well, you and yours'll
just have to show a little restraint.

98
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:49,167
Now get out.

99
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:57,846
And I don't want you crawling back here
knocking on my door pleading for help

100
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:01,892
the second Teen Witch's magic goes
all wonky or little Xander cuts a new tooth.

101
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:04,567
We're through. Got it?

102
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,208
Honeymoon is over.

103
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:19,533
We don't have to do this.

104
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:21,569
I know.

105
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:24,604
I mean, if you'd rather wait.

106
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:29,248
I'm ready. I want to.

107
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:44,889
New retinal scan recorded: Summers, Buffy.

108
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,366
My God.

109
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:20,088
You said it was big.

110
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:24,451
You told me, but you never said it was huge.

111
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:27,124
I don't like to brag.

112
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:32,328
I had no idea. This is incredible.

113
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:35,969
But not that I thought
it was some fly-by-night operation.

114
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:41,332
Unless it is. I mean, can you guys fly?
At night. With those jet-pack things?

115
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:43,847
I can't really talk about it.

116
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,128
This is unreal.

117
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,083
So, you like our little operation?

118
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:54,806
Yeah. Yes. It's very clean.

119
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:57,050
Your visitor's pass.

120
00:09:57,573 --> 00:10:00,883
And I've assembled some reading
material to bring you up to speed.

121
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:04,488
Oh. And I thought I was never
gonna get homework from you again.

122
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:08,691
You can't take that home.
That's classified material. Highly sensitive.

123
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:13,005
When you're through reading
those pages you'll have to eat them.

124
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:16,768
- She's joking.
- Don't worry, it doesn't happen very often.

125
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:18,844
Shall we?

126
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:26,652
Much of our hands-on research
with the HSTs is performed here.

127
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,724
We call this "The Pit".

128
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:31,691
And what do you call those?

129
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:34,333
Tough. It took eight of us to bring 'em down.

130
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:37,291
They'll be under control soon.
Doctor Angleman.

131
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:43,604
Head of our science team. A leader in the
field of xenomorphic behaviour modification.

132
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,092
Behaviour modification?

133
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:48,524
We've made advances in
reconditioning the subterrestrials.

134
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:51,366
Bringing them to a point
where they don't pose a threat.

135
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:53,603
So I've seen.

136
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:56,524
On the Discovery Channel.

137
00:10:56,613 --> 00:11:00,367
With gorillas and sharks. They made
them all nice. You haven't seen it?

138
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:05,451
What's over there?

139
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:15,043
The armoury.

140
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,011
You'll have to be cleared for use
on each of these weapons.

141
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:23,087
The more advanced arsenal is complicated,
but I'm certain, in time, you'll pick that up.

142
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,971
- Don't pick that up.
- What is it?

143
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:30,444
- About $20,000.
- It's a prototype for a com-cam.

144
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:36,448
Communications camera. Gives us a direct
link to Control when we're out in the field.

145
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:41,732
Also monitors the heart rate of the wearer.
A good tool for research in stress in combat.

146
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:45,089
If you'll follow me, I'll show you
the HST containment area.

147
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,483
We have a few more things to give you.

148
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:56,767
- What's in there?
- Research area.

149
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:59,323
Very restricted for security reasons.

150
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:03,011
Here is your security card and your pager.

151
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:07,090
- Been thinking about gettin' one.
- We alone have the number,

152
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:10,085
- and it stays that way.
- Right.

153
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:14,291
Lose either one of them, there's hell
to pay. And down here we mean that literally.

154
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:16,250
Again, welcome to the team.

155
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:28,168
Wow. I've been trying to find
a doll's-eye crystal my entire life.

156
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:32,050
Well, since June, anyway. Where'd you get it?

157
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:35,173
It was my grandma's, I think.

158
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,483
I found it a long time ago in my attic.

159
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:40,965
I want you to have it.

160
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,489
Oh, no, Tara.

161
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:49,041
That's really sweet, but I can't.
It's like a family heirloom.

162
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:53,043
I just wouldn't feel comfortable.

163
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:57,729
But if you wanted to try out some spells
with it sometime, I wouldn't say no.

164
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:03,081
Maybe tonight? If you're not doing
something, you could come over

165
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:05,562
and we could do something.

166
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:14,530
Tonight. That sounds really nice, but tonight,
I already have plans with people. Other.

167
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,086
That's OK. Another time.

168
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:24,289
Absolutely.

169
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:29,925
It's just tonight, it's kind of a specific crowd.
You might feel out of place.

170
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,362
I'd better get to class.

171
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,852
Well, I'll see ya later. OK?

172
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,643
- How did the tour go?
- I'm not sure. She's unpredictable.

173
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,566
- She's an unnecessary risk.
- Possibly.

174
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:20,161
- How's our baby doing today?
- Adjusting nicely.

175
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:25,452
- Reflexes, motor functions. All off the charts.
- That's what I like to hear.

176
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:30,126
Almost time to wake up, Adam,

177
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:33,850
and take your first look at the world.

178
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,211
I know you're gonna make me proud.

179
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:53,248
Xander? You haven't been paying
any attention to me tonight.

180
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:57,042
Just peddling those processed-food
bricks. I don't know why.

181
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:01,286
Well, let me put it in a way you'll understand.

182
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:03,568
Sell bars. Make money.

183
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,884
Take Anya nice places. Buy pretty things.

184
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:10,248
It does make sense.

185
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,609
All right, I support you. Go sell more.

186
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:17,246
Well, this was the only one I had on me.
Besides, it's late. Maybe we should go.

187
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,689
Go? You can't go.
Buffy hasn't gotten here yet.

188
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:22,889
Let's face it. She's almost an hour late.

189
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:25,726
She's living the life of Riley.
I doubt she's coming.

190
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:31,126
She is. She said she was looking forward
to spending quality time with just us.

191
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,922
See? Here she comes.

192
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:39,404
With Riley and some other guys.

193
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:45,730
- Hi, all. Sorry about the late-itude.
- Late? Really? Hadn't noticed.

194
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:52,483
- Hope you don't mind us tagging along.
- No, of course not. The more the more.

195
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,682
This is Graham, this is Forrest,
that's Kevin, and that's Jay in the back.

196
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:59,526
- We'll grab some drinks. Want anything?
- Coke, please.

197
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:00,608
I'm good.

198
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:03,008
No.

199
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:09,085
- We're going away. To dance. Over there.
- We are?

200
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:14,809
Anya seems a bit on edge.

201
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:17,327
She's a little antsy
around commando types.

202
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:19,769
Ex-demon issues.

203
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,444
I didn't think that you would mind.

204
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:25,286
Riley and the guys threw
a celebration in my honour

205
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:28,046
and it made it, like,
impossible to not invite them.

206
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:31,125
Oh. That's neat about the celebrating.

207
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:35,889
I just thought this was
supposed to be, you know, us.

208
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,123
Just the Scooby Corps, you know.

209
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:42,650
I mean, I could have invited somebody else
if I knew it was an open free-for-all.

210
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:46,568
I'm sorry. I had no idea. My total bad.

211
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:50,683
- So, who did you wanna invite?
- What?

212
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:54,288
- You said you wanted to invite someone.
- No, not... No one.

213
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:58,286
I mean, I meant a hypothetical
someone, which is to say no one.

214
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:02,844
- What are we celebrating?
- I'm in. The Initiative.

215
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:06,084
Prof Walsh gave me the grand tour,
and I mean grand as in Canyon.

216
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,688
- You'd never believe the size of it.
- That's really...

217
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:12,412
Again, I say "neat".

218
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:16,122
So, what do you mean, exactly?
You've joined them?

219
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,842
No. Not exactly.

220
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:22,403
It means that when I patrol, I'll have
a heavily armed team as backup.

221
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:26,247
Plus, boyfriend going to
work with me. Big extra perk.

222
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:31,090
Buffy, do you really think this is a good idea?

223
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:34,884
I mean, don't you think
you're rushing things a little?

224
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:40,890
- I thought you liked Riley.
- Not with Riley. With the Initiative.

225
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:44,522
I mean, there's a bunch of stuff
about them we still don't know.

226
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:47,173
I know that. Like what?

227
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:50,213
Well, what's their ultimate agenda?

228
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:54,332
I mean, OK, yeah, they neuter
vampires and demons. But then what?

229
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:56,563
Will they reintegrate them into society?

230
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:58,962
Get them jobs as bag boys at Wal-Mart?

231
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,731
Does Wal-Mart have bag boys?

232
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:07,091
Plus, don't forget that 314 thing
that Ethan told Giles about.

233
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:11,963
Well, a man that worships chaos
and tries to kill you is a man you can trust.

234
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:16,843
Bad info or not, certain questions
should be asked before you go off and enlist.

235
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,168
That's us. Let's go.

236
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:28,643
- When did you get a pager? What's going...?
- That's our cue. Mother wants us.

237
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,406
- Will.
- I know. Talk later.

238
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,922
So what's the big emergency?

239
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:39,370
This is your objective: Sub-T 67119.

240
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,489
Demon class: Polgara species.

241
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:44,167
Though visual confirmation
has not been made,

242
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:49,088
we're confident of its approximate position
as it leaves behind a distinct protein marker.

243
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:52,131
Dr Angleman will brief you on its defences.

244
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:54,204
When threatened,

245
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:57,729
bone skewers jut from
the creature's forearms during battle.

246
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:02,841
It's imperative when ensnaring it
not to damage its arms.

247
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,003
That's all you really need to know.

248
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:06,970
Question.

249
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,804
Buffy?

250
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:12,926
Why exactly can't we damage
this poker thing's arms?

251
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:15,129
I mean, not that I want to, it's just

252
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:21,209
in my experience when fighting, body parts
get damaged, and better its bits than mine.

253
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,090
Or ours.

254
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:27,052
We wish to study the physiology
of every subterrestrial's natural defences.

255
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,806
Part of the research we do here.

256
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,121
Yes?

257
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:34,173
- What do they want?
- Want?

258
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:39,566
Why are they here? Sacrifices,
treasure, or they just get rampagey?

259
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:45,287
- I find it's easier to predict their responses...
- They're not sentient. Just destructive.

260
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:50,493
They do have keen eyesight, however.
You might wanna be suited up for this.

261
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:53,243
Oh. You mean the camo and stuff?

262
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,803
I thought about it, but, I mean,
it's gonna look all Private Benjamin.

263
00:19:56,893 --> 00:20:00,329
Don't worry, I've patrolled
in this halter many times.

264
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:04,128
Let's give our attention to Dr Angleman
and save questions till the end.

265
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:06,568
Actually, I'm finished.

266
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:09,850
Oh, well, Agent Finn, deploy the teams.

267
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:13,889
OK, listen up. We'll be going
in a four-squad setup.

268
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:17,568
Team leaders Gates, Taggart and
Stavros. Alpha team, you're with me.

269
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:20,406
Report to TLs for assignments
and weapon requisitions.

270
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:25,851
Reminder: this is a zap 'n' trap, people.
Capture, not a kill. Any questions?

271
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:28,323
Buffy.

272
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,125
Willow.

273
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:36,047
A funny thing happened
with my prior social engagement.

274
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,488
Pretty much ended when a friend of mine

275
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:42,612
went off to do something
with another crowd she hangs out with.

276
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,961
Irony is kind of ironic that way.

277
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:50,770
Anyway, I know it's late,
but I thought maybe...

278
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:54,971
I mean, if you still wanted to do something?

279
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:07,970
- So I guess she hates me now.
- What?

280
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:12,968
Professor Walsh. Questions.
An Initiative faux pas, yes?

281
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:17,012
It's a little unusual. She's just not used to it.

282
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:20,130
You barely ever opened
your mouth in her classroom.

283
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:23,842
But I know she likes you.
In fact, she liked you before I did.

284
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:26,652
- Really?
- Told me so herself.

285
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:31,763
- Maybe I should get her a present...
- Can we talk about this later?

286
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:35,846
There's a dangerous hostile out here,
and since I don't have your reflexes,

287
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:38,163
I kinda need to focus.

288
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,403
Right.

289
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:47,686
What do you mean, she liked me
before you did? You didn't like me?

290
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:54,763
- Itjust isn't right.
- He made you team leader, didn't he?

291
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:59,847
That's not the point. I've always been Riley's
second in command. Instead he picks a girl.

292
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,571
- His girl.
- Whatever.

293
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,406
Three guesses on what
that boy's thinkin' with.

294
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:07,451
Maybe he just wanted to let you
get out from under his shadow.

295
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:10,411
Hey, I'm not under anybody's shadow.

296
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:15,044
It was ajoke, man. Don't get your panties
in a bunch. I'm just sayin'...

297
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,203
- Hang on. Got somethin'.
- Target?

298
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:19,449
Negative.

299
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,126
- Hello, Hostile 17.
- You two, standard flanking. Go.

300
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:49,523
Alert Control and Alpha team. We've tagged
Hostile 17 with a tracer and we're in pursuit.

301
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,210
Sir.

302
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,729
Graham's on the talkie for you.
Reception's not too good.

303
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:05,763
This is Alpha team, go ahead.

304
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:08,844
Say again. You're breakin' up.

305
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:10,161
Riley.

306
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:46,690
So,

307
00:24:46,773 --> 00:24:48,764
what do you wanna do now?

308
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:23,089
I don't know how many more ways
I can say "I'm not interested".

309
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:29,169
Check these flavours. Cherry Berry.
Maple Walnut. Almond Liquorice.

310
00:25:29,253 --> 00:25:30,322
Eugh.

311
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:33,644
Anya, we don't say "Eugh"
in front of potential customers.

312
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:38,568
Just skip this part and say you want money
to buy me pretty things. He'll understand.

313
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:42,009
Very well. Maple Walnut.

314
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:44,482
An excellent choice.

315
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:58,770
- Please leave my home now.
- It's the gritty texture, isn't it?

316
00:25:58,853 --> 00:26:01,845
Maybe you're more of a Cherry Berry fellow.

317
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,726
- Close the door.
- Spike?

318
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:13,122
You may wanna give up these morning jogs.

319
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:17,206
Soldiers are out. I've been tryin' to
keep 'em off my scent, run 'em in circles.

320
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:19,682
But they keep comin'.

321
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:26,004
And how is this our concern? You expressed
the wish to have nothing more to do with us.

322
00:26:26,093 --> 00:26:28,084
Spike said that?

323
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:31,971
- That hurts.
- All right. Whaddaya want me to say?

324
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:34,487
I need help. And no cheek from you.

325
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:40,444
Look. The buggers shot me in the back.

326
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:43,686
Remind me. Why should I help you?

327
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:48,246
Because you do that.
You're the goody-good guys.

328
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,528
You're the bloody freaking cavalry.

329
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:55,044
No, you can come up with a better
answer than that. Why should I help you?

330
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:58,322
Oh. Because I helped you.

331
00:26:58,413 --> 00:27:01,371
When you turned into that
Fyarl demon, I helped you, didn't I?

332
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,013
And that was out of
the evilness of your heart?

333
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:06,482
Oh, hell, no. I made you pay me...

334
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:12,202
You right bastard.

335
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:19,769
That's all that's left. I spent
the rest on blood and smokes,

336
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:21,844
which I'll never see again.

337
00:27:23,013 --> 00:27:28,292
Come on. Circle the wagons. Tend to
the wounded here. No time for layabouts.

338
00:27:35,773 --> 00:27:37,092
Hey.

339
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:41,646
What's the matter?
Weren't expecting to see me?

340
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:45,682
I never know what to expect.

341
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:59,284
Your robot bird sounds hungry.

342
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:04,082
- It's just a reminder to take my vitamins.
- You're kidding.

343
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:15,524
I'm sorry.

344
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:18,173
Quite the regimental soldier.

345
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:21,006
- I am how they trained me.
- They?

346
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:24,287
- Who they?
- You know, the government.

347
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:27,285
Plucked me out of special op training for this.

348
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,604
- What did they tell you it was for?
- Didn't.

349
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:35,606
In the military you learn to
follow orders, not ask questions.

350
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:37,649
I don't understand.

351
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:42,682
Aren't you curious about all the science
and research stuff they're doing?

352
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:47,524
I know all I need to know. We're doing
good here. Protecting the public.

353
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:50,332
Removing the subterrestrial threat.

354
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:52,802
It's work worth doing.

355
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:58,768
What's 314?

356
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:07,850
- Riley.
- We have a situation. You're needed.

357
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:10,288
- On my way.
- What is it?

358
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:12,964
Don't know.

359
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:18,801
You're really not one
for asking questions, are you?

360
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:22,331
I'll leave that to you.

361
00:29:39,493 --> 00:29:41,484
Lose your way, Agent?

362
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,487
No, ma'am.

363
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:48,249
I've instructed Beta team to suspend
pursuit of Hostile 17 until your arrival.

364
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,006
I didn't want slip-ups,
that's why you're in charge.

365
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:54,290
You'll rendezvous with them
at these coordinates.

366
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:56,609
Riley.

367
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:00,410
Make me proud.

368
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,204
Yes, ma'am.

369
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:13,164
I think we've got a situation.

370
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:15,769
The Slayer?

371
00:30:15,853 --> 00:30:18,811
- She's becoming a liability.
- We knew that was a danger.

372
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:22,203
- Does she know about the project?
- She knows it exists.

373
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:26,650
She already holds too much influence
over Riley - over Agent Finn.

374
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:30,009
- We move to the contingency scenario?
- Right away.

375
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:32,723
That's too bad.

376
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:35,566
- She could have been a powerful ally.
- I know.

377
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:38,850
- And Finn will take it hard.
- That's why sooner is better.

378
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:50,084
It's better.

379
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:54,649
Watch it. That hurts.

380
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,247
It doesn't appear to be a bullet.

381
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,972
It's too deeply embedded
for a tranquilliser dart.

382
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:02,726
Also, not tranquil.

383
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:05,691
Some sort of illumination emanating from it.

384
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:07,603
It's blinking.

385
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:12,926
I don't care if it's playing "Rock the Casbah"
on the bloody jew's-harp. Get it out of me.

386
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:16,801
Anya, there's a bottle of Cognac in the
cupboard by the sink. Can you get it?

387
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:19,805
- What? Gonna get snockered now?
- It's not for me, you prat.

388
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:23,363
If I'm gonna operate, I need you
anaesthetised. This'll take time.

389
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:25,967
We don't have any. That blinking thing?

390
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:29,363
My pseudo-soldier memory bank
tells me that's a tracer.

391
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:30,886
- A what?
- A what?

392
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:36,491
It's like a homing beacon. And if commandos
are reading the signal, they're comin' home.

393
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,723
Well, we need to buy some time.
It's in deep, and I'm no surgeon.

394
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:57,648
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

395
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:01,283
Out all night, huh?

396
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:03,204
You, too.

397
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:05,284
Yeah.

398
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,732
Sorry about bailing
on you guys at the Bronze.

399
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,964
That's OK. I...

400
00:32:14,493 --> 00:32:16,131
Don't worry about it.

401
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:18,525
OK.

402
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:25,726
- They really keep ya hoppin', don't they?
- Yeah. I gotta go. I'll see ya?

403
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,927
- Hello?
- Willow. You're there at last.

404
00:32:38,013 --> 00:32:40,243
We have a problem. Where's Buffy?

405
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:45,322
Just left. Beeped away by her new buds.
You want me to go after her?

406
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,608
No, no. It's your help I need, actually.

407
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:49,809
Really? What do you want me to do?

408
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:54,490
It's a small job. Reconnaissance.
Probably a waste of a slayer's abilities,

409
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:59,010
- but my boys are on assignment, so I...
- No, it's OK. I'm up for some action.

410
00:32:59,253 --> 00:33:01,448
I doubt you'll get any on this one.

411
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:05,208
We've a class-three subterrestrial
moving through the sewers

412
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:08,365
-just on the north edge of town.
- Class three?

413
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:12,048
It's a low-level threat.
Minimal aggression. Meagre defences.

414
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:17,002
They barely show up on the scanner,
and occasionally turn out to be raccoons.

415
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:19,732
Wow. You're not crazy about raccoons, huh?

416
00:33:20,013 --> 00:33:22,766
We always take precautions.

417
00:33:23,213 --> 00:33:25,807
All we need you to do
is get a visual on this thing.

418
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:29,169
This will feed me back an image,
and I can advise you from there.

419
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:31,608
I don't wanna put you
in unnecessary danger.

420
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:35,489
That's OK. Danger's my birthright. Sorry.

421
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:38,564
Professor Walsh,

422
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:43,488
there's still some stuff
about all this that I'm not clear on.

423
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:47,252
Well, when you get back we can have a talk.

424
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,563
Good. OK.

425
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,928
When I get back.

426
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,724
Am I supposed to salute you?

427
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:55,802
No.

428
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:58,404
OK.

429
00:34:09,453 --> 00:34:15,403
"Tropo, strato, meso, aero, iono, exo..."

430
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:18,764
So, how does it work?

431
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:24,644
If she succeeds, her spell will ionise the
atmosphere, disrupting the tracer's signal.

432
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:27,293
- It buys us time.
- "Elements are brought to bear."

433
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:31,401
"Wind, earth and water
churned amidst the fire."

434
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:33,882
"Let the air be burned."

435
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:39,690
Did it work? Is the atmosphere ionised?

436
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,612
I'd venture "Yes".

437
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:47,370
- What do you mean, "the signal's whacked"?
- The blip's a blob.

438
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,843
- There's some interference with the tracer.
- Try to lock it down.

439
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:53,493
- We headed in the right direction?
- I think so.

440
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:56,246
It's gonna put us in populated areas.

441
00:34:56,333 --> 00:35:01,123
OK, then. We change into civvies then
move out. Maybe somethin' will turn up.

442
00:35:26,453 --> 00:35:28,489
Professor Walsh, are you getting this?

443
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:31,212
Possible HST? Make it a definite.

444
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:34,928
He's brought along a friend.

445
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:36,082
They seem...

446
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:50,046
Talk to me, Forrest.

447
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:54,285
Signal's somewhere in this neighbourhood.
Estimate within a two-block radius.

448
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:57,171
It feels, and looks, like the spell's wearing off.

449
00:36:57,373 --> 00:37:00,012
- Giles?
- I've got it.

450
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:07,241
We wanna keep this hostile contained, so...

451
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,642
Wait. The signal's cleared up.

452
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,803
- There.
- Let's go.

453
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:15,012
Go.

454
00:37:18,213 --> 00:37:19,931
- What?
- It's on the move.

455
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:23,085
- Heading?
- Straight at us. 40 metres and closing fast.

456
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:25,641
- In broad daylight?
- Weapons at the ready.

457
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:28,566
25 metres... 20... 15.

458
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:31,042
- Where?
- To the left. Ten metres... Five...

459
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:32,612
- Anyone?
- I got nothing.

460
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:35,048
This doesn't make sense.
It went right past us.

461
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:41,961
Flushed. The tracer's been flushed.

462
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,447
Regret to report Hostile 17's still at large.

463
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,730
- I've left Beta team to comb...
- Riley, something's happened.

464
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:35,088
I don't know what to say.

465
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:38,324
- It's about Buffy.
- Buffy?

466
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:41,450
Two of our hostiles broke free
and escaped into the tunnels.

467
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:44,730
She went after them on her own.

468
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:48,452
She's dead, Riley.

469
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:51,286
- What?
- I did everything I could to stop her.

470
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:55,048
I told her to wait for a backup team.
She insisted she didn't need one,

471
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:58,443
she could handle it by herself. I'm so sorry.

472
00:38:58,533 --> 00:39:01,172
- I don't understand.
- I know what she meant to you.

473
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:04,165
- How could this happen?
- She was a very special girl.

474
00:39:04,253 --> 00:39:09,088
I didn't understand at first,
but she had something.

475
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:15,408
I don't know, maybe I could have
stopped her. It's hard not to blame myself.

476
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:19,725
Professor Walsh? That simple
little recon you sent me on?

477
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:22,124
It wasn't a raccoon.

478
00:39:22,213 --> 00:39:27,492
Turns out I was trapped in the sewers with
a faulty weapon and two of your pet demons.

479
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,133
If you think that's enough to kill me,

480
00:39:30,413 --> 00:39:32,847
you really don't know what a slayer is.

481
00:39:34,693 --> 00:39:37,207
Trust me when I say you're gonna find out.

482
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,690
Riley.

483
00:39:58,293 --> 00:40:00,853
Agent Finn, I order you to stop.

484
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,604
Agent Finn.

485
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,364
Riley.

486
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:09,363
It will be dark soon.

487
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:13,287
- It would be wise for you to leave Sunnydale.
- I'm not going anywhere.

488
00:40:13,373 --> 00:40:17,252
Not until those bastards undo whatever
they did to me, put me back the way I was.

489
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:23,329
Sure. Just explain to the nice scientist guys
that you miss killing and torturing innocents.

490
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:25,608
- You think that would work?
- Spike,

491
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:29,049
Lord knows why I'm telling you this.
It's for your own good.

492
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:32,489
As long as the Initiative is in operation,
it's not safe for you here.

493
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:33,972
No.

494
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:40,202
It's not safe for any of us.

495
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,404
So...

496
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:54,730
All right, fine.

497
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:58,088
If she wants a fight, we'll give her one.

498
00:40:58,173 --> 00:41:00,448
Won't we, Adam?

499
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:02,524
I've worked too long,

500
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:08,885
too long to let some little bitch
threaten this project.

501
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:11,644
Threaten me.

502
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:16,050
She has no idea who she's dealing with.

503
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:21,012
Once she's gone, Riley will come around.

504
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:23,084
He'll understand.

505
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:26,731
It's for the greater good.

506
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:29,403
He'll see that.

507
00:41:30,013 --> 00:41:32,004
And if he doesn't...

508
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:36,367
Well, first things first.

509
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,369
Remove the complication,

510
00:41:40,253 --> 00:41:42,642
and when she least expects it...

511
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,162
Adam?

512
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:57,884
Mommy.

513
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,761
