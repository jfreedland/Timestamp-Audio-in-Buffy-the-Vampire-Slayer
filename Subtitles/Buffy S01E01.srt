1
00:00:02,062 --> 00:00:04,462
In every generation there is a Chosen One.

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:10,093
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness.

3
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,621
She is the Slayer.

4
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:13,115
Are you sure this is a good idea?

5
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:16,451
It's a great idea. Now, come on.

6
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,986
- Do you go to school here?
- I used to.

7
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:27,614
On top of the gym it's so cool.

8
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,783
You can see the whole town.

9
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:35,331
I-I-I don't want to go up there.

10
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,749
Oh, you can't wait, huh?

11
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,043
We're just gonna get in trouble.

12
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:43,504
Yeah, you can count on it.

13
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:51,597
- What was that?
- What was what?

14
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,517
I heard a noise.

15
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:55,654
It's nothing.

16
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,103
Uh... maybe it's something.

17
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,421
Well, maybe it's some thing.

18
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:02,533
It's not funny.

19
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:06,819
Hello?

20
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,576
There's nobody here.

21
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:16,156
Are you sure?

22
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:18,773
Yes, I'm sure.

23
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,847
OK.

24
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:27,681
<b>Welcome to the Hellmouth</b>

25
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:10,821
Buffy?

26
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:14,048
I'm up, Mom!

27
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,054
Don't wanna be late for your first day!

28
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:20,933
No. Wouldn't want that.

29
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:40,211
OK.

30
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:44,031
Have a good time.

31
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:48,491
I know you're gonna make friends
right away. Just think positive.

32
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,210
And honey?

33
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:55,541
Try not to get kicked out.

34
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:58,255
- I promise.
- OK

35
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:08,628
Excuse me. Coming through.
Pardon me. Excuse me. Whoa!

36
00:05:09,796 --> 00:05:11,965
Excuse me. An accident. Stop!

37
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:14,217
Please move. Whoa! Excuse me.

38
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,100
Oh, God! OK, I feel good.

39
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:26,896
Willow! You're so very much
the person I wanted to see.

40
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,650
- Really?
- Yeah. I kinda had a problem with the math.

41
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,843
- Uh, which part?
- The math.

42
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:35,939
Can you help me out tonight?
Please be my study buddy.

43
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:38,826
- Well, what's in it for me?
- A shiny nickel.

44
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,537
OK. Do you have "Theories in Trig"?
You should check it out.

45
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:43,705
Check it out?

46
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:46,362
From the library. Where the books live.

47
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:49,002
Right. I'm there. See? I wanna change.

48
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:51,047
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, Jesse! What's what?

49
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,590
- New girl!
- That's right. I saw her.

50
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:56,844
- Pretty much a hottie.
- I heard someone was transferring.

51
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,846
- So, tell.
- Tell what?

52
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:01,473
What's the sitch?
What do you know about her?

53
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:05,269
- New girl.
- Well, you're certainly a font of nothing.

54
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:10,983
Buffy Summers. Sophomore.
Late of Hemery High in Los Angeles.

55
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:14,946
Interesting record. Quite a career.

56
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:25,846
Welcome to Sunnydale. A clean slate, Buffy.
That's what you get here.

57
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,047
What's past is past.

58
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:30,655
We're not interested in
what it says on a piece of paper.

59
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,453
Even if it says...

60
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:36,104
Mr Flutie...

61
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,323
All the kids here are free to call me Bob.

62
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:40,137
- Bob...
- But they don't.

63
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:43,516
I know my transcripts
are a little... colourful.

64
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:50,106
We're not caring about that.
Do you think, uh, colourful is the word?

65
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,025
Not, uh... dismal?

66
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,986
- It wasn't that bad.
- You burned down the gym.

67
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:59,324
I did. I really did, but...
you're not seeing the big picture here.

68
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,785
I mean, that gym was full of vampi...

69
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,788
Asbestos.

70
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:06,915
Buffy. Don't worry.

71
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,734
Any other school, they might say

72
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:13,022
"Watch your step,"
or "We'll be watching you."

73
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,395
But that's just not the way here.

74
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:21,388
We want to service your needs
and help you to respect our needs.

75
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:25,600
And if your needs
and our needs don't mesh...

76
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:40,407
Ooh! Oh, sorry! It's... OK.

77
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:46,413
Can I have you?

78
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:48,707
Duh! Can I help you?

79
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,586
- Thanks.
- I don't know you, do I?

80
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,006
- I'm Buffy. I'm new.
- Xander...

81
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,216
..is... is me. Hi.

82
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,052
Oh, thanks!

83
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:02,929
Well, um, maybe I'll see you around.

84
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,141
Maybe at school, since we...

85
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:08,227
both... go there.

86
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,355
Great!

87
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:12,523
It was nice to meet you.

88
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:18,654
"We both go to school." Very suave.

89
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:21,616
Very not pathetic. Oh! Hey!

90
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:26,287
Hey! You forgot your stake.

91
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:38,591
It's estimated that about 25 million people
died in that one four-year span.

92
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:44,012
But the fun part of the Black Plague
is that it originated in Europe... how?

93
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:48,476
As an early form of germ warfare.

94
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:54,398
If you'll look at the map on page 63,
you can trace the spread of the disease

95
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:57,652
- Into Rome and then north.
- Thanks.

96
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:03,241
And this popular plague
led to what social changes? Steve?

97
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:11,082
- Hi, I'm Cordelia.
- I'm Buffy.

98
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:14,082
If you're looking for
a textbook of your very own,

99
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,863
there's probably a few in the library.

100
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:19,424
- Oh, great. Thanks. Where would that be?
- I'll show you. Come on.

101
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,301
- So, you're from Hemery, right? In LA?
- Yeah.

102
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:26,973
Oh, I would kill to live in LA.
That close to that many shoes!

103
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:33,980
You'll be OK here. If you hang with me
and mine, you'll be accepted in no time.

104
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:37,192
Of course,
we do have to test your coolness factor.

105
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:41,029
You're from LA, so you can skip
the written, but, let's see...

106
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:43,155
Vamp nail polish?

107
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,199
Um... over?

108
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:47,994
So over. James Spader?

109
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:50,122
He needs to call me!

110
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,874
- Frappuchinos?
- Trendy but tasty.

111
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,960
- John Tesh?
- The Devil.

112
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:57,504
That was pretty much a gimme,
but you passed!

113
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,714
Oh, goody!

114
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,091
Willow!

115
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:05,887
Nice dress! Good to know
you've seen the softer side of Sears.

116
00:10:06,513 --> 00:10:08,639
Oh, well, my mom picked it out.

117
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:11,852
No wonder you're
such a guy-magnet. Are you done?

118
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:20,820
If you wanna fit in here,
the first rule is "know your losers".

119
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:24,990
Once you can identify them all by sight,
they're a lot easier to avoid.

120
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,169
And if you're not swamped with catching up,
you should come by the Bronze tonight.

121
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:37,124
The who?

122
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,955
The Bronze. It's the only club
worth going to round here.

123
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:43,967
They let anybody in, but it's still the scene.
It's in the bad part of town.

124
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:47,320
- Where's that?
- About a half a block from the good part.

125
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,474
We don't have a whole lot of town here.
But, um, you should show.

126
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:52,726
Well, I'll try. Uh, thanks.

127
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,063
Good. So, um, I'll see you at gym,

128
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:58,774
and you can tell me absolutely
everything there is to know about you.

129
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,401
Great!

130
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:02,695
Oh, that sounds like fun!

131
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:11,537
Hello?

132
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:20,629
Is anybody here?

133
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,934
- Oh! Anybody's here.
- Can I help you?

134
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:38,106
I was looking for some, well, books. I'm new.

135
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:39,815
Miss Summers?

136
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,111
Good call. I guess I'm the only new kid, huh?

137
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:47,657
I'm Mr Giles. The librarian.

138
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,826
I was told you were coming.

139
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:54,163
Great. So, um, I'm gonna need
"Perspectives on 20th-Century..."

140
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,584
I know what you're after.

141
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:03,631
That's not what I'm looking for.

142
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:07,636
- Are you sure?
- I'm way sure.

143
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,681
My mistake.

144
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:15,268
So, what is it you said?

145
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:24,945
The new kid? She seems weird to me.
And what kind of name is Buffy?

146
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:26,446
- Hey, Aphrodisia.
- Hey!

147
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,372
The chatter in the caff is
that she got kicked out

148
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,315
and that's why her mom
had to get a new job.

149
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:34,246
- Neg.
- Pos. She was starting fights!

150
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:38,000
- Neg-ly!
- Well, I heard it from Blue, and she said...

151
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,141
Uh, hi.

152
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:56,935
- Willow, right?
- Why?

153
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,064
I mean, hi.
Did you want me to move?

154
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,399
Why don't we start with "Hi, I'm Buffy"?

155
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:06,320
And then let's segue
directly into me asking you for a favour.

156
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:09,683
It doesn't involve moving but it does
involve hanging out with me for a while.

157
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:12,368
But aren't you hanging out with Cordelia?

158
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:15,370
- I can't do both?
- Not legally.

159
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:19,291
Look, I really wanna get by here.
New school and...

160
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:22,336
Cordelia's been really nice to me, anyway.

161
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:27,175
But, I have this burning desire
not to flunk all my classes and

162
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,888
I heard a rumor that you were the person
to talk to if I wanted to get caught up.

163
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,889
Oh, I could totally help you out!

164
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,682
If you have sixth period free,
we could meet in the library.

165
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,392
Or not.

166
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:40,996
We could meet someplace quieter. Louder.
That place just kinda gives me the wiggins.

167
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,235
It has that effect on most kids.
I love it though.

168
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,511
It's a great collection.
And the new librarian is really cool.

169
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:49,572
- He's new?
- Yeah, he just started.

170
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:54,377
He was a curator at some British museum.
Or The British Museum. I'm not sure.

171
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:58,297
But he knows everything. And he brought all
these historical volumes and biographies

172
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:01,450
- and am I the single dullest person alive?
- Not at all.

173
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,878
Hey, you guys busy? Are we interrupting?
We're interrupting.

174
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:04,962
Hey.

175
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:06,715
- Hey.
- Hey, there.

176
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:09,133
This is Jesse, and that's Xander.

177
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:12,303
Me and Buffy go way back.
Old friends. Very close.

178
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:16,057
Then there's that period of estrangement
when I think we were growing as people,

179
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,644
but now here we are, like old times,
I'm quite moved.

180
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:23,856
Is it me,
or are you turning into a bibbling idiot?

181
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:27,110
No. It's, uh, it's not you.

182
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:29,946
Well, it's nice to meet you guys. I think.

183
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,867
We wanted to welcome you,
make you feel at home.

184
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:35,910
- Unless you have a scary home.
- And to return this.

185
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:39,915
The only thing I could think is that
you're building a really little fence.

186
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:45,462
Uh... no, um... Actually, it was for
self-defence. Everyone has them in LA.

187
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:48,052
Pepper spray is just so passé.

188
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:51,467
What do you do for fun? What do you like?
What do you look for in a man? Let's hear it.

189
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:54,775
If you have any dark, painful secrets
you'd like us to publish...

190
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:58,433
Gee, everyone wants to know about me.
How keen.

191
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:02,873
Not much goes on in a one Starbucks town
like Sunnydale. You're pretty big news.

192
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,148
I'm not. Really.

193
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:08,442
- Are these guys bothering you?
- Uh, no!

194
00:15:08,526 --> 00:15:10,654
She's not hanging out with us.

195
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:13,073
- Hey, Cordelia.
- Oh, please.

196
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:15,379
I don't mean to interrupt
your downward mobility,

197
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,291
but I just wanted to tell you
that you won't be meeting Coach Foster,

198
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:21,493
the woman with the chest hair,
because gym was cancelled

199
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:23,991
due to the extreme dead guy in the locker.

200
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,085
- What?
- What are you talking about?

201
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:28,297
Some guy was stuffed in Aura's locker.

202
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:30,632
- Dead?
- Totally dead. Way dead.

203
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:33,817
- So not just a little dead, then?
- Don't you have an elsewhere to be?

204
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:37,140
You know, if you need a shoulder to cry on,
or just to nibble on...

205
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:39,933
- How did he die?
- I don't know.

206
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:44,188
- Well, were there any marks?
- Morbid much! I didn't ask!

207
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:50,486
I gotta book. I'II... I'll see you guys later.

208
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,865
What's her deal?

209
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:22,392
Oh, great!

210
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,149
- OK, what's the sitch?
- Sorry?

211
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:31,235
You heard about the dead guy, right?
The dead guy in the locker?

212
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:34,280
- Yes.
- 'Cause it's the weirdest thing.

213
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:39,201
He's got two little holes in his neck
and all his blood's been drained.

214
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:42,580
Isn't that bizarre?
Aren't you just going "Oooh..."?

215
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:46,752
- I was afraid of this.
- Well, I wasn't.

216
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:51,214
It's my first day. I was afraid that
I was gonna be behind in all my classes,

217
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:55,385
that I wouldn't make any friends,
that I would have last month's hair.

218
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:58,345
I didn't think
there'd be vampires on campus.

219
00:16:58,346 --> 00:16:59,543
And I don't care.

220
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,350
Then why are you here?

221
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:05,436
To... tell you that... I don't care,

222
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,399
which... I don't, and... have now told you.

223
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:11,693
So... bye.

224
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:14,619
Is he... will he rise again?

225
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:17,073
- Who?
- The boy.

226
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:21,161
- No. He's just dead.
- Can you be sure?

227
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:23,638
To make you a vampire,
they have to suck your blood

228
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:25,470
and then you have to suck their blood.

229
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:29,393
It's like a whole big sucking thing.
Mostly, they're just gonna kill you.

230
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,741
Why am I still talking to you?

231
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:33,985
You really have no idea
what's going on, do you?

232
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,243
You think it's coincidence, your being
here? That boy was just the beginning.

233
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:39,346
Why can't you people just leave me alone?

234
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,100
Because you are the Slayer.
Into each generation, a slayer is born.

235
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:47,939
One girl, in all the world, a Chosen One.
One born with the strength

236
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:51,705
and skill to hunt the vampires. To stop
the spread of evil blah, blah, blah...

237
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:53,112
I've heard it, okay?

238
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:54,685
I really don't understand this attitude.

239
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:57,857
You've accepted your duty,
you've slain vampires before.

240
00:17:57,948 --> 00:18:01,608
Yeah, and I've both been there
and done that, and I'm moving on.

241
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:05,123
What do you know about this town?

242
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:07,875
It's two hours on the freeway
from Neiman Marcus?

243
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,368
Dig a bit in the history
of this place and you'll find

244
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:13,159
a steady stream of fairly odd occurrences.

245
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:15,632
I believe this whole area
is a centre of mystical energy.

246
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:19,344
Things gravitate towards it
that you might not find elsewhere.

247
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:24,325
- Like vampires.
- Like zombies. Werewolves. Incubi. Succubi.

248
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:27,017
Everything you dreaded was under your bed
but told yourself couldn't be

249
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:30,015
by the light of day. They're all real.

250
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,525
What? You, like,
sent away for the Time-Life series?

251
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:34,526
Um... yes.

252
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,405
- Did you get the free phone?
- The calendar.

253
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,644
Cool! But...

254
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:44,508
OK, first of all, I'm a vampire slayer.
And secondly, I'm retired.

255
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:48,917
- Hey, I know! Why don't you kill 'em?
- I'm a watcher. I haven't the skill.

256
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:51,503
Oh, come on! A stake through the heart,
a little sunlight...

257
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:53,326
It's like falling off a log.

258
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:55,798
- A slayer slays. A watcher...
- Watches?

259
00:18:55,881 --> 00:19:01,162
Yes. No! He trains her.
He prepares her.

260
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:03,002
Prepares me for what?

261
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:07,355
For getting kicked out of school?
For losing all of my friends?

262
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,729
For having to spend
all of my time fighting for my life

263
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:12,828
and never getting to tell anyone
because I might endanger them?

264
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:16,735
Go ahead. Prepare me.

265
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:27,122
Damn!

266
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:33,544
What?

267
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,256
- It's getting worse.
- What's getting worse?

268
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:40,518
The influx of the undead.

269
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:43,049
The-the... supernatural occurences.
It's been building for years.

270
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:45,543
There's a reason why you're here
and a reason why it's now.

271
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:48,268
Because now is the time
my mom moved here.

272
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:53,399
Something is coming. Something...
Something is... gonna happen here. Soon.

273
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:55,649
Gee, can you vague that up for me?

274
00:19:55,733 --> 00:20:00,322
The signs, as far as I can tell, point
to a crucial mystical upheaval very soon.

275
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:02,324
Days, possibly less.

276
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:07,163
Oh, come on! This is Sunnydale.
How bad an evil can there be here?

277
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:41,197
The sleeper will wake.

278
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:47,452
The sleeper will wake.

279
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,544
The sleeper will wake.

280
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,802
The sleeper will wake.

281
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:05,929
And the world will bleed.

282
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,145
Amen!

283
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:20,611
Hi! I'm an enormous slut!

284
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:24,573
Hello. Would you like a copy
of "The Watchtower"?

285
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,284
I used to be so good at this.

286
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:29,454
- Hi, hon.
- Hey!

287
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:33,291
- Are you going out tonight?
- Yeah. I'm going to a club.

288
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,879
- Oh. Will there be boys there?
- No, Mom. It's a nun club!

289
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,132
- Well, just be careful.
- I will.

290
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:49,641
You know, I think we can make it work here.
I've got my positive energy flowing.

291
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:52,268
I'm gonna get the gallery on its feet.

292
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:55,062
- We may have found a space today.
- That's great.

293
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:59,443
That school is a very nurturing environment,
which is what you need.

294
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,487
- Well, actually...
- Oh, not too nurturing.

295
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,450
I know. You're 16. I've read all about
the dangers of over-nurturing.

296
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:15,710
It's hard. New town and everything.
It is for me, too.

297
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:21,548
I'm trying to make it work.
I'm going to make it work.

298
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,925
- I know.
- You're a good girl, Buffy.

299
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,764
You just fell in with the wrong crowd.
But that is all behind us now.

300
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:32,851
It is. From now on, I am only
going to hang out with the living.

301
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,895
I mean lively... people.

302
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:37,773
OK.

303
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,941
You have fun.

304
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,740
- Is there a problem, ma'am?
- Yeah, there's a problem.

305
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,742
Why are you following me?

306
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:16,872
I know what you're thinking,
but don't worry. I don't bite.

307
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:32,680
The truth is, I thought you'd be taller.
Or bigger muscles and all that.

308
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,475
You're pretty spry, though.

309
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,645
- What do you want?
- The same thing you do.

310
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,814
OK... What do I want?

311
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,528
To kill 'em. To kill 'em all.

312
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,490
Sorry, incorrect, but you do get this
watch and a year's supply of Turtle Wax.

313
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:55,536
- What I want is to be left alone!
- Do you think that's an option any more?

314
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,998
You're standing at the mouth of Hell.

315
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,168
And it's about to open.

316
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,672
Don't turn your back on this.

317
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,678
- You've gotta be ready.
- What for?

318
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,931
For the Harvest.

319
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,268
Who are you?

320
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:21,395
Let's just say... I'm a friend.

321
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,693
Yeah, well, maybe I don't want a friend.

322
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:30,029
I didn't say I was yours.

323
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,925
What's up?

324
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,729
Hey.

325
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,241
- Hey!
- Oh, hi!

326
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,159
Hi!

327
00:26:57,243 --> 00:27:00,830
- Are you here with someone?
- No. I'm just here.

328
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:05,000
- I thought Xander was gonna show up.
- Oh! Are you guys going out?

329
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:09,255
No, we're just friends.
We used to go out, but we broke up.

330
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:13,009
- How come?
- He stole my Barbie.

331
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,720
Oh, we were five.

332
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:21,090
I don't actually date a whole lot...
lately.

333
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:22,530
Why not?

334
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:25,772
Well, when I'm with a boy I like,

335
00:27:25,856 --> 00:27:30,234
it's hard for me to say anything cool,
or... or witty, or at all.

336
00:27:30,318 --> 00:27:33,822
I can usually make a few vowel sounds,
and then I have to go away.

337
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:36,741
- It's not that bad.
- No, it is.

338
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:40,494
I thinks boys are more interested
in a girl who can talk.

339
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:45,583
- You really haven't been dating lately.
- It's probably easy for you.

340
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:48,461
Yeah. Real easy.

341
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,756
I mean, you don't seem too shy.

342
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:54,467
Well, my philosophy...
Do you want to hear my philosophy?

343
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:56,886
- Yeah, I do.
- Life is short.

344
00:27:57,721 --> 00:27:59,090
Life is short.

345
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:02,040
Not original, I'll grant you,
but it's true... you know.

346
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:05,728
Why waste time being shy and worrying
about some guy laughing at you?

347
00:28:05,812 --> 00:28:08,815
Seize the moment,
'cause tomorrow you might be dead.

348
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,694
Oh, that's nice!

349
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:17,408
Um, I'll be back in a minute.

350
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:20,703
Oh, that's... that's OK.
You don't have to come back.

351
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,871
I'll be back in a minute.

352
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:26,875
"Seize the moment."

353
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:49,106
So... you like to party with students?
Ain't that skanky?

354
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:51,567
Oh, right! This is me having fun.

355
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:55,279
Watching "clown hair" prance about
is hardly my idea of a party.

356
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:58,532
I'd rather be at home
with a cup of Bovril and a good book.

357
00:28:58,615 --> 00:29:00,201
You need a personality, stat!

358
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:04,581
This is a perfect breeding ground
for vampires. It's dark, crowded...

359
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:07,917
I knew you would show up.
I have to make you understand.

360
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,919
That the Harvest is coming.
I know. Your friend told me.

361
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,963
- What did you say?
- The Harvest.

362
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:16,092
Does that mean something to you?
'Cause I'm drawing a blank.

363
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:19,303
I'm not sure. Who told you this?

364
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:26,060
This guy. Dark, gorgeous in an annoying
sort of way. I figured you two were buds.

365
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:28,187
No.

366
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:31,650
The Harvest... Did he say anything else?

367
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:36,320
Something about the "mouth of Hell".
I really didn't like him.

368
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:52,379
Look at them. Throwing themselves about.
Unaware of the danger that surrounds them.

369
00:29:52,463 --> 00:29:55,006
- Lucky them.
- Or perhaps you're right.

370
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,718
Perhaps there is no trouble coming.
The signs could be wrong.

371
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:02,179
It's not as though
you've been having the nightmares.

372
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:10,647
Mom doesn't even get out of bed any more.
The doctor says it's Epstein-Barr.

373
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:15,651
I'm, like, "It's chronic hepatitis
or at least chronic fatigue syndrome."

374
00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:18,822
I mean, nobody cool
has Epstein-Barr any more.

375
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:23,034
- Hey, Cordelia!
- Oh, yea, it's my stalker!

376
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:27,719
- You look... you look great.
- I'm glad we had this little chat.

377
00:30:27,754 --> 00:30:31,209
Listen, you know, wanna dance? You know?

378
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:33,461
- With you?
- Well, uh, yeah.

379
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:35,630
Well, uh, no!

380
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:36,841
Come on, guys.

381
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,179
Fine.

382
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:44,348
Plenty other fish in the sea.

383
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,268
Oh, yeah, I'm... on the prowl!

384
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:51,188
Witness me prowling!

385
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,695
I didn't say I'd never
slay another vampire.

386
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:00,489
It's not like I'm having all these
fluffy bunny feelings for them.

387
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:03,273
I'm just not gonna get
way extracurricular with it.

388
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:06,036
- If I see one, sure...
- Will you be ready?

389
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,957
There's so much you don't know about them,
about your own powers.

390
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:13,209
A vampire appears to be completely normal
until the feed is upon them.

391
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:16,297
Only then do they reveal
their... true demonic visage.

392
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:19,149
You're like a textbook with arms.
I know this.

393
00:31:19,184 --> 00:31:22,428
The point is, a slayer
should be able to see them anyway.

394
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:25,305
Without looking, without thinking.

395
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:29,143
Can you tell me
if there's a vampire in this building?

396
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:31,312
- Maybe.
- You should know.

397
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:34,482
Even through this mass and this din,

398
00:31:34,564 --> 00:31:36,651
you should be able to sense them.

399
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,568
Well, try.

400
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:41,808
Reach out with your mind.
You have to hone your senses.

401
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:46,203
Focus until the energy washes over you,
until you feel every particle of...

402
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:48,412
- There's one.
- Wh-where?

403
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:50,665
Right there. Talking to that girl.

404
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:53,417
- You don't know...
- Oh, please!

405
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:56,337
Look at his jacket.
He's got the sleeves rolled up.

406
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,299
And the shirt?
Deal with that outfit for a moment.

407
00:31:59,382 --> 00:32:01,926
- It's dated?
- It's carbon dated.

408
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,045
Trust me.

409
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,290
Only someone living underground for 10
years would think that was still the look.

410
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,827
But you didn't... hone.

411
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:13,646
Oh, no!

412
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:17,609
- Isn't that...?
- Willow.

413
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:20,946
- What's she doing?
- Seizing the moment.

414
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:26,594
Cordelia!

415
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:30,724
God! What is your childhood trauma?!

416
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:34,311
Have you guys seen Willow?
Did she come by here?

417
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:36,855
Do you need to attack her with the stick?

418
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:39,441
Jeez!

419
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,697
Excuse me. I have to call everyone
I have ever met, right now.

420
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:52,662
That was quick. Well done.
I need to go to the library.

421
00:33:52,746 --> 00:33:55,916
- This Harvest thing...
- I didn't find them.

422
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,825
The vampire is not dead?

423
00:33:57,826 --> 00:34:00,449
No, but my social life
is on the critical list.

424
00:34:00,547 --> 00:34:03,006
- So, what do we do?
- I'll take care of it.

425
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,428
- I need to come with you, yes?
- Don't worry. One vampire I can handle.

426
00:34:08,054 --> 00:34:10,806
So, um, what did you say your name was?

427
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:16,311
- Darla.
- Darla. I haven't seen you around before.

428
00:34:16,395 --> 00:34:20,900
- Are you from around here?
- No, but I have family here.

429
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:26,113
- Have I met them?
- You probably will.

430
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,863
Master.

431
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:17,332
- I am weak.
- Come the Harvest, you will be restored.

432
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,500
The Harvest.

433
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,961
We're almost there.

434
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:24,130
Soon you will be free.

435
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:39,020
I must be ready. I need my strength.

436
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:42,113
I've sent your servants
to bring you some food.

437
00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:43,469
Good.

438
00:35:43,484 --> 00:35:44,860
- Luke?
- Yes?

439
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:47,529
Bring me something young.

440
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,825
Sure is dark.

441
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:55,078
- It's night.
- Well, that's a dark time. Night.

442
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:59,207
Traditionally. I still can't believe
I've never seen you at school.

443
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,919
Do you have Mr Chomsky for history?

444
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:08,509
The ice-cream bar is this way.
It's past Hamilton Street.

445
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:10,678
I know a shortcut.

446
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:26,610
- Leaving already?
- Xander. Have you seen Willow?

447
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:29,946
- Not tonight, no.
- She left with a guy.

448
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,616
We're talking about Willow?
Scoring at the Bronze! Work it, girl!

449
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,704
No, I need to find her.
Where would he take her?

450
00:36:36,787 --> 00:36:42,168
Why? Oh, hey, I hope he's not a vampire,
because then you might have to slay him.

451
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:48,507
Was there a school bulletin?
Was it in the newspaper?

452
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:52,010
Is there anyone in this town
who doesn't know I'm the Slayer?

453
00:36:52,094 --> 00:36:55,389
I know you think you're the Slayer,
and the reason why...

454
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:59,184
Whatever. It doesn't matter.
Just tell me where would Willow go?

455
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:01,187
You're serious.

456
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:05,024
We don't find her, and there's gonna be
one more dead body in the morning.

457
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:09,237
OK, this... this is nice... and scary.

458
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:12,073
Are you sure this is faster?

459
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:15,076
Hey, you ever been in one of these?

460
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,493
No...

461
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,037
Thank you.

462
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:20,998
Come on.

463
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:27,255
What are you afraid of?

464
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,142
That wasn't funny.

465
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:54,240
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Is that what you think?

466
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,084
- Is this the best you could do?
- She's fresh.

467
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,253
Hardly enough to share.

468
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,547
Why didn't you bring your own?

469
00:38:10,215 --> 00:38:12,009
- I did.
- Hey!

470
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:13,551
Wait up!

471
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:17,180
Oh, my God! Jesse!

472
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:25,356
You know, you gave me a hickey.

473
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:30,526
- I got hungry on the way.
- Oh, Jesse, let's get outta here!

474
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,531
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

475
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:36,742
Leave us alone!

476
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:40,412
You're not going anywhere until we've fed!

477
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:44,833
Well, this is nice.

478
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:48,962
It's a little bare, but a dash of paint,

479
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:51,632
a few throw pillows... call it home!

480
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:53,300
Who the hell are you?

481
00:38:53,383 --> 00:38:56,908
You mean, there's actually someone
in this town who doesn't know already?

482
00:38:56,943 --> 00:38:58,871
Phew! That's a relief. I'm telling you

483
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:01,220
having a secret identity
in this town is a job of work.

484
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:04,186
- Buffy, we bail now, right?
- Not yet.

485
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:10,108
OK, first of all, what's with the outfit?
Live in the now, OK? You look like DeBarge.

486
00:39:12,862 --> 00:39:17,616
Now, we can do this the hard way, or...
Well, actually, there's just the hard way.

487
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,433
That's fine with me.

488
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:21,644
Are you sure? This is not gonna be pretty.

489
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:24,957
We're talking violence,
strong language, adult content...

490
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:42,725
- See what happens when you roughhouse?
- He was young and stupid.

491
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,893
- Xander, go!
- Don't go far.

492
00:39:58,825 --> 00:40:02,661
You know, I just wanted to start over.
Be like everybody else.

493
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:06,874
Have some friends, you know, maybe a dog.
But no. You had to come here.

494
00:40:06,957 --> 00:40:10,336
- You couldn't go suck on some other town.
- Who are you?

495
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,797
Don't you know?

496
00:40:14,924 --> 00:40:17,010
I don't care.

497
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:24,184
You were supposed to bring
an offering for the Master.

498
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:27,396
We're almost at Harvest
and you dally with this child.

499
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:29,814
We had someone. But then she came.

500
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:33,234
She killed Thomas. Luke she's strong.

501
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:35,237
You go.

502
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:37,905
I'll see if I can handle the little girl.

503
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,794
You're strong.

504
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,966
I'm stronger.

505
00:40:57,259 --> 00:41:00,553
We'll get the police!
It's just a few blocks up!

506
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:10,939
- You're wasting my time.
- Hey! I had other plans, too, OK?

507
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,035
You think you can stop me? Stop us?

508
00:41:27,706 --> 00:41:30,709
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

509
00:41:35,548 --> 00:41:41,594
"And like a plague of boils,
the race of Man covered the Earth."

510
00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:47,184
"But on the third day of the newest light
will come the Harvest

511
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:50,687
and the blood of men will flow as wine

512
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:55,067
when the Master
will walk among them once more."

513
00:41:56,694 --> 00:42:00,364
"The Earth will belong to the Old Ones."

514
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:06,997
"And Hell itself will come to town."

515
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:36,610
Amen.
