2
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:18,411
You demons can't resist
a run-and-stumble, can you?

3
00:00:37,306 --> 00:00:40,469
One down... one gone.

4
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:48,749
So scabby demon
got away?

5
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,344
Scabby demon number 2
got away.

6
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:51,615
Scabby demon number one...

7
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,486
Big check
in the "slay" column.

8
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:55,185
I don't like this
little "no mouth" thing.

9
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,692
It's disquieting.

10
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:59,559
Well, no mouth
means no teeth.

11
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,427
Unless they have them
somewhere else.

12
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:02,830
Giles:
Good morning, girls.

13
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,337
We've been researching
the mayor's forthcoming ascension.

14
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:08,599
It's pretty riveting stuff.

15
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:10,004
What do we know?

16
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:12,167
What don't we know?

17
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:13,676
Tell her, Giles.

18
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:15,610
Well, based
on the supposed date...

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,114
Graduation day... and the mayor
being impervious to harm...

20
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:19,615
I've cross-referenced...

21
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:22,244
He's a cross-referencing fool.

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,811
And I've eliminated
several possibilities.

23
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:27,619
It's not the ritual flaying
of the demon Azorath...

24
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:28,784
nor the, um...

25
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:35,160
I don't know
what's going to happen.

26
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,892
That was kind of
an anticlimax.

27
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,334
Buffy: We don't know anything?

28
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:41,201
The whole Faith-Angel thing
was for nothing?

29
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:42,739
No, no, no. Um...

30
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:44,399
if nothing else,
Angel's charade

31
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:47,171
has brought Faith's treachery
into the open...

32
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:49,509
and this information about
the ascension will prove...

33
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,070
useful.

34
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:53,879
Eventually, I just need
to put it together.

35
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:56,078
Terribly sorry.
I was detained.

36
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,019
Official Council business.

37
00:02:58,089 --> 00:02:59,784
Mr. Giles, you were speaking?

38
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:02,519
I was just filling Buffy in
on my progress

39
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:04,652
regarding the research
of the ascension.

40
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,493
Oh. And what took up
the rest of the minute?

41
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:12,002
Touché.

42
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,469
Of course, my work
is unofficial.

43
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:15,631
I'm sure, however...

44
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:19,164
with the resources of the Council
at your disposal...

45
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:20,710
you will have something to add.

46
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:25,774
Well...

47
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,408
I am pleased to state

48
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:29,180
with certainty

49
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:31,585
that the demon Azorath
will not in any way be...

50
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:32,884
involved in...

51
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:36,754
I'm sure we'll
find out more soon.

52
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:45,763
The demon Azorath?

53
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:49,034
So, have you talked
to Angel lately?

54
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:50,768
Not really.

55
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:53,743
Seeing him bad,
even pretend-bad...

56
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:55,210
and with Faith...

57
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:57,611
he only kissed her
for the greater good.

58
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:00,249
I don't know.

59
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,343
To the naked eye,
it looked like fun.

60
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,751
Or maybe it wasn't.

61
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:06,813
Maybe... he
wasn't even tempted.

62
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:08,449
I just wish
I could be sure.

63
00:04:08,526 --> 00:04:11,017
As always,
I advise you to ask.

64
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:12,119
Like he'd tell me?

65
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:15,458
Student: Hogan!

66
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,125
Great game, man!

67
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,133
Thanks.

68
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:21,171
Hogan Martin thinks
he's soooo hot!

69
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,729
Like we should
all be awed by him

70
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:23,933
'cause he can put
a ball in the net.

71
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:25,236
Hey, Xander.

72
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,334
He said my name!
He knows my name!

73
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:30,073
Hey, Willow.

74
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:31,513
- Hi.
- Um...

75
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:34,449
Look, I can't make the study session
after school today.

76
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,816
Um... can we do it
fifth period?

77
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:37,047
OK.

78
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:38,315
Did you finish
the reading?

79
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,651
Most of it.

80
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:40,656
Percy...

81
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:41,987
I'll finish it at lunch.

82
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:44,323
That's my little trooper.

83
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:45,555
I don't know
what you're doing to him.

84
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,791
I actually heard him
complete a sentence.

85
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:49,423
Had a clause
and everything.

86
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,128
Going to watch
the game, right?

87
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:53,135
Wouldn't miss it.

88
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:54,136
See you, Hogan!

89
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:56,070
Ladies.

90
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,368
You're going
to the game?

91
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:58,999
I didn't know
you liked basketball.

92
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:00,100
I didn't, either...

93
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:01,975
but I've really started
getting into it.

94
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:03,809
Especially now that
we're in the championships...

95
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,939
it's so exciting.

96
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,244
Too bad you're patrolling...

97
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:09,616
'cause we're all going.
Oz, Xander, everybody.

98
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:10,984
Right.

99
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:13,387
Everybody who isn't
currently Buffy.

100
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:18,691
You touched
one of the demons.

101
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:20,230
A good touch.

102
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:22,323
Not a bad touch.

103
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,164
Anyway, it's been
itching like crazy.

104
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:26,203
No big.

105
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,237
Just another problem

106
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:29,330
for the good people
at Lubriderm, right?

107
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:30,806
This the demon
in question?

108
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:33,535
In the disgusting flesh.

109
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:34,737
Hmm...

110
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:37,146
What?

111
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,979
It says they
can infect a host.

112
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:41,882
Infect?

113
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:43,477
Infect?

114
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:44,486
Giles!

115
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,455
- Hmm?
- Infect?!

116
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:48,458
Oh. Uh...
"infect the host

117
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:50,790
with an aspect
of the demon."

118
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,793
That's all it says.

119
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:53,830
An aspect
of the demon?

120
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,024
That's rather terse, isn't it?

121
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,498
You mean
like a part of it?

122
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,127
There could be
any number of explanations

123
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:01,467
for your hand. I mean,
a new fabric softener

124
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:03,063
can cause irritation.

125
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,005
In any case,
I... I would advise

126
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:08,102
not to attempt to track
the one that got away.

127
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,409
Let's minimize
your exposure.

128
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:13,075
A part of the demon.

129
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,584
I hope it's not
the outside part.

130
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:21,148
H-O-G-A-N. It's Hogan!

131
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:23,989
Go Hogan!

132
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:33,430
Is it me, or is this
really lame?

133
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:35,597
I don't know. I usually
enjoy lameness...

134
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:37,436
and this is leaving me
kinda cold.

135
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,100
Well, according to
Freddy's latest editorial...

136
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:41,110
"The pep rally is a place for

137
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:42,907
"pseudo-prostitutes
to provoke men

138
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,413
"into a sexual frenzy...

139
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:48,248
which, when thwarted, results
in pointless athletic competition."

140
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,753
And the downside being?

141
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:53,756
The school paper is edging
on depressing lately.

142
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:55,621
Have you guys noticed that?

143
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:58,287
I don't know. I always
go straight to the obits.

144
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:02,265
What are you doing, Buffy?

145
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,391
Nothing.

146
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,367
Checking for horns.

147
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:10,571
Ah, you know, Buffy,
I don't even think Giles is right

148
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:13,201
about you becoming
like a demon.

149
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:15,177
I mean, he's totally burnt,
you know...

150
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:17,271
dealing with Faith
and this ascension thing.

151
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:20,613
Between you and me,
he's not doing his best work.

152
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:22,152
But what if he is right?

153
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:24,346
I'm suddenly gonna grow
this demon part...

154
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:26,583
and we don't even know
what it is.

155
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:28,249
It could be claws
or scales...

156
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,259
What?

157
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:31,886
Was it a boy demon?

158
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,258
T-O-M.

159
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:37,266
It's Tom!

160
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:38,768
Go Tom!

161
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:41,737
They really are very good.

162
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:43,239
Their spelling's improved.

163
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:46,105
You know, Oz, I look
at all this beauty...

164
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:48,111
all these healthy
young women...

165
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:50,909
and I wonder why I ever
wasted my time on Cordelia.

166
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:52,778
I mean, look at her.

167
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,681
She's no better-looking
than the rest of'em.

168
00:07:54,752 --> 00:07:56,117
None of'em
are really my...

169
00:07:56,187 --> 00:07:57,484
Oh, my God,
he's looking at her!

170
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,413
He's got his filthy...

171
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:03,221
adult Pierce Brosnan-y
eyes all over my Cordy.

172
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:07,155
You're a very complex man,
aren't you?

173
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,533
It's just I'm scared, Wil.

174
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:15,971
There's this thing in me,
and I can't find it. I can't stop it.

175
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,304
What if it changes me?

176
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:20,640
I mean not just
the way I look.

177
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:23,305
All of a sudden, I... I could be
something that's not me anymore.

178
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,245
Yeah, whoo-hoo!

179
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:27,450
Oh, sorry.
They spelled Percy...

180
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:31,010
and... and I have
to show support. He's needy.

181
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,147
But... But I heard what you
were saying, really...

182
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:34,984
and... and I would be
frightened, too...

183
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:37,211
but I'm sure
you're gonna be OK.

184
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:56,727
Still got a mouth.

185
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:00,406
Sorry.

186
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:01,409
It's OK.

187
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:02,467
I didn't see you...

188
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:05,070
so I should've known
you were there.

189
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:08,183
What are you doing here?

190
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,448
It's a dangerous time,
you know, with Faith.

191
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:15,182
Yeah, Faith.

192
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,487
She, well...

193
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,688
Faith, what can
you say about her?

194
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:25,496
I just want to make sure that you're,
you know, OK, that you're safe.

195
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:28,059
Well, the fact that
you're right here...

196
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:31,039
Does that mean
Faith's around?

197
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:33,371
Are you keeping me safe

198
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,775
by tracking me,
or are you tracking her?

199
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:37,506
I'm tracking you.

200
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,741
Something's bothering you.

201
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:41,875
A lot of things...

202
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:48,955
the most recent
being this demon... actually, 2.

203
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:50,458
I touched one of them...

204
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:52,995
and now I'm gonna get
a big case of the bumpies

205
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:54,859
or a tail or something.

206
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:56,364
Aspect of the demon.

207
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:57,524
You know the drill.

208
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,034
By rumor. But that
doesn't mean anything.

209
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:03,095
I mean, sometimes demons...
they just exaggerate their power.

210
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:06,301
Demon hype...
or maybe not.

211
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:09,539
I spend all my time
in the dark here anyway.

212
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:13,048
It's not like I'd be at a game,
you know, with my friends

213
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:16,984
where someone could see me
in my new monster part.

214
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,452
Hey.

215
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:21,547
I won't let anything happen
to you if I can help it.

216
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:27,128
And no matter what,
I'll always be with you.

217
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:33,859
Hey, I'll love you even
if you're covered with slime.

218
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:38,998
I liked everything
until that part.

219
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,008
Could you believe it?

220
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:48,016
Right at the buzzer,
3 points for the win.

221
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:49,073
It was intense.

222
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:50,380
Yeah, for a minute there...

223
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,216
I thought you were gonna
make an expression.

224
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:53,846
I felt one coming on.
I won't lie.

225
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:56,448
Man, I've never seen anyone
jump like Hogan Martin.

226
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,153
They should call him
"TheJumper."

227
00:10:58,228 --> 00:11:01,493
Or a name that isn't an article
of women's clothing. Hey, remember...

228
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,464
Shh.

229
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:09,333
Hmm. Quietness.

230
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:10,599
We either lost...

231
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:12,971
or we won, and you don't
want me to feel bad.

232
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:16,034
Ooh, yeah, it wasn't
really a good game.

233
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:17,545
Yeah, tall hoops,
but then tall guys.

234
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:18,842
What's the point?

235
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:19,882
Pretty dull.

236
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:21,143
Are you guys crazy?

237
00:11:21,217 --> 00:11:22,514
It was an incredible game.

238
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:24,519
I've never cheered so hard
in my life.

239
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:27,351
I still have knee marks
on my back.

240
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:30,616
From the pyramid.

241
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:36,994
Yeah, well, I still bet
patrolling was way better...

242
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,499
'cause, wow, important.

243
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:42,197
Well, I thought I saw
a 4-legged demon...

244
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:44,206
but it was just a dog.

245
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:45,206
Weredog?

246
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:46,401
Regular.

247
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:47,408
Tough luck.

248
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:48,569
Yeah.

249
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:53,846
Thinking: I wonder if she and
Wesley have kissed.

250
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,042
It really bugs you, huh?

251
00:11:55,118 --> 00:11:56,847
What?

252
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,183
Cordelia and Wesley
smooching.

253
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,723
Man, you read my mind.

254
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:17,530
Ooh!

255
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:19,472
Whoa there. You watch
where you're going now.

256
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,703
I'm sorry, Mr. Beach. I will.

257
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:25,908
Thinking: Students. If we could just
get rid of all the students.

258
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:27,176
Boy: When I'm a software jillionaire...

259
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,342
and you're all
flippin'burgers...

260
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:30,352
who's the loser then?

261
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,651
Girl: Maybe I'll take French,
I said. How hard can it be?

262
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:36,055
French babies learn it, idiot.

263
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,353
Boy: I swear,
someday my pants

264
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:38,894
are gonna fall right off.

265
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:43,198
Boy: God, Buffy
is so beautiful.

266
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:46,861
I mean,
look at that body.

267
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:48,870
God...

268
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:52,874
I'd love to shove her against
that locker right now and just... Ooh!

269
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:57,772
Is this the thing,
the aspect thing?

270
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:00,611
Because I gotta say, if it is,
it is way better than a tail.

271
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:02,617
I mean, I have a hard
enough time as it is

272
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:04,118
finding jeans
that fit right.

273
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:05,620
Buffy, slow down.

274
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:11,126
I'm... I'm not even convinced
that this is genuine mind reading.

275
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:13,628
Y-Y-You're most likely
projecting your...

276
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:16,062
When I walked in
a few minutes ago...

277
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:18,066
you thought,
"Look at her shoes.

278
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:19,863
"If a fashion magazine
told her to...

279
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:21,904
she'd wear cats strapped
to her feet."

280
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:22,938
I, um...

281
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:25,405
the demons are telepathic.

282
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:27,238
I should have known.
That's why they don't need mouths.

283
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,074
Of course. The demons
are telepathic.

284
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:31,943
I know. You just told me.

285
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:33,709
That's why they don't
need mouths.

286
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,876
And you should have known.

287
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:38,079
I... This is astounding.

288
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:40,247
It was happening out
in the hallway.

289
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:43,121
Principal Snyder has Walk Like
an Egyptian stuck in his head.

290
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:46,161
And the boys of the school
are seriously disturbed.

291
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:49,562
It's weird, but, Giles,
think about it.

292
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:51,065
I mean, think
about what I could do.

293
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,068
It could be very useful.

294
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:56,071
You could anticipate
your opponent's every move...

295
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,265
turn his plans
against him.

296
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,774
Oh, way better than that.

297
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:00,774
Jealousy.

298
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:04,904
Buffy! Right. Very good.

299
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:06,346
Ms. Murray: Jealousy...

300
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,815
I knew that.

301
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:10,614
...Clearly is the tool that
Iago uses to undo Othello.

302
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:12,313
But what's his motivation?

303
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:16,620
What reason does Iago give for
destroying his superior officer?

304
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:19,422
"Cassio has my place.

305
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:21,486
'Twixt my sheets,
he's done my office. "

306
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:23,759
Well, he was passed over
for promotion.

307
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,323
Cassio was picked instead...

308
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:30,361
and people were saying
that Othello slept with his wife.

309
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,067
Buffy did the reading?

310
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:33,165
Buffy understood
the reading?

311
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:35,005
Xander: When did she study?

312
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:37,011
Was I supposed to study?

313
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,671
Ms. Murray's kinda hot.

314
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:40,943
I was gonna say Cassio.

315
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,247
Ugh! I hate her.

316
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,287
Any other reason?

317
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:46,651
Race!

318
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:49,987
Um, good, Nancy.
Can't overlook that.

319
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,857
Boy: Look at them, scrambling
for the teacher's praise

320
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:55,090
like pigeons
for old bread crusts.

321
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:57,462
Wil, who's that guy?

322
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,794
That's Freddy Iverson.

323
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,569
He writes those editorials
for the school paper. He's sardonic.

324
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:08,303
Freddy: Bread crusts.
That's deep.

325
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,504
I should write that down.

326
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,548
Ms. Murray: Cites race
as a motive.

327
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:13,980
Is there something else
at work here?

328
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,381
Well, he, um...

329
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:20,912
he sort of admits himself
that his motives are... spurious.

330
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,724
He... He does things
because he enjoys them.

331
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:30,527
It's like he's not...
he's not really a person.

332
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,333
He's a... the dark half
of Othello himself.

333
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,872
[Students React]
Wow! Whoa!

334
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,779
Buffy. Really. Very astute.

335
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:45,814
I said something quite
like that in my dissertation.

336
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:50,547
I know. I mean,
I agree... with that.

337
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:55,558
Yes, and doesn't that also explain
Othello's readiness to believe Iago?

338
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:58,288
Within seconds,
he turns on Desdemona.

339
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:00,796
He believes that
she's been unfaithful...

340
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:02,798
and we're all like that.

341
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:05,835
We all have
our little internal Iagos

342
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:09,964
that tell us our husbands
or our girlfriends or whatever

343
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,564
don't really love us.

344
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:15,703
We can never really see
what's in someone's heart.

345
00:16:19,716 --> 00:16:20,648
Oh!

346
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:21,911
Oh, sorry!

347
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:23,919
Sorry about the daytime.

348
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:28,185
I just ducked out of school,
and that's when they have it.

349
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:32,428
Um... you look good.

350
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:35,932
I mean, I... I know
I saw you last night...

351
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:39,935
but sometimes things
can change real quick.

352
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:41,436
I mean, really quickly.

353
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,973
Listen to me.
I'm talking like Faith.

354
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:52,542
Not that she was so bad to have around,
you know, before the evil.

355
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:56,978
You know, I think
she was hurting a lot.

356
00:16:57,054 --> 00:17:00,956
And some people...
protective-type people...

357
00:17:01,024 --> 00:17:02,992
Might be drawn
to that, I guess.

358
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,120
Well, the thing about Faith...

359
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:08,027
You can't get
into my mind.

360
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:09,963

361
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,830
Why not?

362
00:17:11,902 --> 00:17:12,960
It's like the mirror.

363
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:13,968
The thoughts are there...

364
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:16,631
but they create
no reflection in you.

365

of the demon.

366
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:23,476

Giles doesn't know how long
it's gonna last, but it's OK.

368
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:30,443
A little headachy, but...

369
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,580
You don't have to play games
with me, Buffy... ever.

370

Well, you're not exactly
"Joe, here's what I'm thinking."

371
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,425
So ask me.

372
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,929
Oh, but that would've
made sense.

373
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:44,263
What do you wanna
know about? Faith?

374
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:47,235
How I felt kissing her?
Pretending to have no soul?

375
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:48,828
Watching you suffer?

376
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,032
Well, since you bring it up.

377
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:55,568
I hated hurting you...
more than I could stand.

378
00:17:57,547 --> 00:18:01,574
Look, the thing
about Faith... I'd understand.

379
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:06,179
You know, she has that whole
"bad girl" thing working for her.

380
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:07,689
Kissing her meant nothing.

381
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:10,921
I don't want a bad girl.
I've done that before.

382
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:17,756
I've lived a long time, Buffy,
and I'm past that.

383
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:21,861
I've been with dozens
of girls like her. More.

384
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:24,702
Oh, this honesty stuff is fun.

385
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:27,608
I mean,
there's no comparison.

386
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:32,910
In 243 years, I've loved
exactly one person.

387
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:36,418
Who?

388
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:38,716
It is me, right?

389
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,527
Next time just ask.

390
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:46,824
OK.

391
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:49,957
And, Buffy, be careful
with this gift.

392
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:53,935
A lot of things that seem strong
and good and powerful...

393
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:55,062
they can be painful.

394
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:58,801
Like, say, immortality?

395
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,311
Exactly. I'm dying
to get rid of that.

396
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:04,108
Funny.

397
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:05,944

Yeah.

409

all you think about?

right inside.

better than I do.

they meant it?

531
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:01,460
Xander: Yeah, who hasn't
just idly thought

532
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:03,795
about taking out the whole place
with a semiautomatic?

533
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:07,493
I said idly.

534
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,197
I know the difference.

535
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:12,400
He... She... Whoever...
They meant it...

536
00:25:12,475 --> 00:25:14,272
and they're gonna do it.

537
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:15,777
She looks so tired.

538
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:17,107
How horrible.

539
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,169
Xander: I'll bet it was Hogan.

540
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:19,215
I'm not getting
any warmer.

541
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:21,113
Shut up!

542
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:27,316
I'm sorry. Just... Could
you guys not think so loud?

543
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,482
Or so much?

544
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:30,719
Buffy, you should go home.
I'll take you home.

545
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:31,920
Yeah. OK. No.

546
00:25:31,995 --> 00:25:33,690
I need you guys to go back
to the cafeteria.

547
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:35,924
Make a list of everyone
who's there.

548
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:38,467
We have to find the killer
before lunch tomorrow.

549
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:40,059
We'll do it, Buffy.
A list of all the students.

550
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:43,071
Yeah, Nancy was there.
She's scary.

551
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,868
And, oh, teachers, too.

552
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:47,637
Mr. Beach... he thought
something

553
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,940
about getting rid
of all the students.

554
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:51,947
I can't shut it out, Giles.

555
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:54,540
It's like this invasion
of my head.

556
00:25:54,617 --> 00:25:57,745
It's like there are these strangers
walking around in there.

557
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:01,757
Look at this. I can't even be
around people anymore...

558
00:26:01,825 --> 00:26:05,761
not that they're really clamoring
to be near me anyway, even you.

559
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:06,887
Well, I'm sorry, Buffy.

560
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:08,897
It's hard for all of us.

561
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:12,662
But Wesley and I are looking
for a way to help.

562
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:13,895
I'll be OK, right?

563
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,938
I mean, even if you
can't get rid of it?

564
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:17,905
You'll be fine.
I promise.

565
00:26:17,974 --> 00:26:20,704
If it doesn't go away,
she'll go insane.

566
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:25,503
I think we have everyone
that was in the cafeteria.

567
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:27,413
I'll do some computer work;

568
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:29,474
match it against the FBI
mass murderer profiles...

569
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:31,884
see if maybe we can rule
some people out.

570
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:33,354
I'm still having trouble
with the fact

571
00:26:33,423 --> 00:26:35,050
that one of us
is just gonna

572
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:36,921
gun everybody down
for no reason.

573
00:26:36,993 --> 00:26:39,894
Yeah, because that never happens
in American high schools.

574
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:40,930
It's bordering on trendy
at this point.

575
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:43,329
Besides which,
Sunnydale High...

576
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:45,594
center of evil
and all that.

577
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:47,101
Let's get to work.

578
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,933
We have till
lunchtime tomorrow...

579
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:50,438
we hope.

580
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:54,937
There. You look better already.

581
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:56,444
Thanks, Mom.

582
00:26:56,512 --> 00:26:59,640
I'm, uh, I'm just gonna
get you another pillow.

583
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:00,683
I really don't need one.

584
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,776
But you need
another blanket.

585
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:06,822
Mom, I'm fine.

586
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:11,891
How, uh...
about some soup?

587
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:13,394
Chicken and stars?

588
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:16,193
Mom, please,
just come sit with me.

589
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:18,894
Um... I've, uh...

590
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:20,731
I've got laundry.

591
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:22,930
Why are you...

592
00:27:24,374 --> 00:27:26,137
You had sex with Giles?

593
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:29,504
You had sex with Giles?

594
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:31,911
It was the candy.
We were teenagers.

595
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:34,313
On the hood
of a police car?

596
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:35,715
I'll be downstairs.

597
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:37,776
You feel better.

598
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:39,913
Twice?!

599
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:41,081
OK, I've taken our list

600
00:27:41,157 --> 00:27:43,421
and narrowed it down
to a dozen strong suspects.

601
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:45,427
Here are your
personalized assignments.

602
00:27:45,495 --> 00:27:47,429
Ooh! I was hoping
there'd be assignments.

603
00:27:47,497 --> 00:27:49,931
I think I should
work with Wesley.

604
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:51,432
You have no shame.

605
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:54,527
Oh, please. Like shame
is something to be proud of?

606
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,401
Be quiet!

607
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:59,032
Sorry,
but this is important.

608
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:00,769
Talk to everyone
on your list

609
00:28:00,843 --> 00:28:03,869
and... and use
the sample questions.

610
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:07,848
Today, people!

611
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:14,116
Oh! Write neatly and
label your work sheets.

612
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:23,899
Fantasies are fun,
aren't they, Jonathan?

613
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,401
I guess.

614
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:32,408
We all have fantasies
where we're powerful and respected...

615
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:35,000
where people
pay attention to us.

616
00:28:35,078 --> 00:28:37,137
Maybe.

617
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,909
But sometimes the fantasy
isn't enough...

618
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:41,917
is it, Jonathan?

619
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:45,716
Sometimes we have to make it
so people don't ignore us...

620
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:48,416
make them pay attention.

621
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:52,086
You know what
I'm talking about, don't you?

622
00:28:52,161 --> 00:28:55,892
You w-w-want me
to pay attention?

623
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:01,436
This is
for the yearbook?

624
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:02,937
Yeah.
Personality profiles.

625
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,530
Can you ask it again?

626
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:07,940
Sure. Do you ever feel that you've
created a false persona for yourself

627
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,444
of the guy who does
everything right...

628
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:11,810
and how much of a strain does it
put on you to maintain it?

629
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:14,941
Huh. Wow. I guess...

630
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:16,451
moderate strain?

631
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,987
Is that a good answer?
I wanna get this right.

632
00:29:20,523 --> 00:29:21,956
Yeah, that's good.

633
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:25,153
Hi, Mr. Beach.
I was just wondering...

634
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:27,458
were you planning on killing
a bunch of people tomorrow?

635
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,464
Oh, it's for the yearbook.

636
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:33,468
OK, so turnoffs include
smoking, insensitive men...

637
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:34,833
and Birkenstocks.

638
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:37,964
Now, your idea of the perfect
romantic evening.

639
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,975
Kay, let's start with you.

640
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:41,976
Freddy?

641
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:07,134
I should've just quit.

642
00:30:07,203 --> 00:30:08,932
Look at him smiling...

643
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:10,597
like he thinks
I don't know about her.

644
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:11,935
She doesn't know a thing.

645
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:14,943
I can't believe
I'm getting away with this.

646
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:16,842
One more drink.
That'll do it.

647
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:20,948
20 years with that company.

648
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:22,348
You think I can't
smell her perfume?

649
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:23,442
It's just a little drink.

650
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,952
He shouldn't even
be the boss.

651
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:26,454
The bottle's almost empty
anyway.

652
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:28,456
I should've had a promotion
a long time ago.

653
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:31,186
Wait till next time
he comes home smelling like that.

[Thoughts Continue]

655
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:41,336
Well, seems to be
coming along all right.

656
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,803
Yes. Buffy's being driven mad...

657
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:44,500
we have no proof
that this is gonna work...

658
00:30:44,574 --> 00:30:46,337
and it still requires the heart
of the second demon...

659
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:49,071
which we have no idea
how to get without the slayer.

660
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:52,342

doesn't solve problems.

Who is going to get
the demon heart?

662

Berk.

663
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:46,835
Do I often imagine
classmates are spying on me

664
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:48,837
or otherwise
acting suspiciously?

665
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:50,304
Right.

666
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:52,807

Talk louder, dude.

669

I'm just saying it's
gotta be frustrating...

having this secret.

671
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:06,786
You gotta be kind of filling up
with resentment...

he'd put in like a...

for you.

00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:44,853
Who?

708
00:33:48,391 --> 00:33:49,323
All right.

709
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:52,827
Shh.

710
00:34:01,404 --> 00:34:02,336
Giles!

711
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:42,944
Angel.

712
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,415
Thank God.

713
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:48,144
Are you all right?

714
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:50,846
Do you hear thoughts?

715
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,353
No.

716
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:54,788
Did you find the killer?

717
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:01,524
OK, Oz, you got me.

718
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:03,532
What are your friends
gonna do, hold me down?

719
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,090
You better believe it,
buster.

720
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:07,295
You can't threaten
a big murder

721
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,167
without getting us
pretty darn ticked.

722
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:12,003
Murder? What murder?

723
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:13,736
You're not here
about the review?

724
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,742
The review?

725
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:17,644
Yeah. Last Thursday?

726
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:23,418
"Dingoes Ate My Baby
played their instruments

727
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:28,253
as if they had plump Polish sausages
taped to their fingers."

728
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:29,757
Sorry, man.

729
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:32,827
No. It's fair.

730
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:34,830
I just get
a lot of hate mail...

731
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:37,332
and I thought you were gonna come
and deliver some personally.

732
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,834
Hey, if you find any tasteful
announcement about me from Larry...

733
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:41,837
Xander, we have
to figure this out.

734
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:43,338
We have no shot.

735
00:35:43,406 --> 00:35:45,237
The killer could be anyone.

736
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:46,240
We lose.

737
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,470
Buffy: We still have
a few minutes.

738
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:50,513
- Buffy!
- You're OK!

739
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,741
Can you hear thoughts?

740
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:54,784
Just when I wasn't
thinking about sex.

741
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,785
OK. Here's the new plan.

742
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,787
We're gonna get Snyder
to evacuate the school...

743
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:00,288
and just hope the killer's
not waiting outside.

744
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:02,221
"By this time tomorrow
you'll all know what I've done.

745
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,783
"I'm sure you understand
that I had to do it...

746
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:07,295
"and that although
death is never easy...

747
00:36:07,363 --> 00:36:09,297
it's the only way."

748
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:13,426
God! Doesn't anyone write in
to praise the cheerleaders?

749
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:14,902
We are so unsung.

750
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,802
Jonathan. Ohh!

751
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:19,808
I had him in my grasp!
Slippery weasel!

752
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:22,436
Split up. Find him.

753
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:40,828
Jonathan!

754
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:42,956
Are you in here?

755
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:47,835
Jonathan!

756
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:48,836
Jonathan!

757
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:51,338
Ooh.

758
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:52,339
Jell-O.

759
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:45,186
Huh. I could've done that.

760
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:56,653
Get away from me.

761
00:37:58,258 --> 00:38:00,920
OK, Jonathan, you wanna
point that somewhere else?

762
00:38:00,994 --> 00:38:04,225
Don't you
try and stop me.

763
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:08,132
No. No, no stopping.

764
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,136
Just here for the view.

765
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,297
Hey, look. City Hall.

766
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:14,465
Go away.

767
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:17,336
Never gonna happen.

768
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:19,072
You think
I won't use this?

769
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:22,047
I don't know, Jonathan.
I just...

770
00:38:22,115 --> 00:38:24,515
Stop... doing that!

771
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,482
Doing what?

772
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:31,650
Stop saying my name
like we're friends.

773
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:33,659
We're not friends.

774
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:36,161
You all think
I'm an idiot.

775
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,164
A short idiot.

776
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,599
I don't.

777
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:47,171
I don't think about you
much at all.

778
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,108
Nobody here really does.

779
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:53,679
Bugs you, doesn't it?

780
00:38:53,747 --> 00:38:57,683
You have all this pain,
all these feelings...

781
00:38:57,751 --> 00:39:00,515
and nobody's really
paying attention.

782
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:02,953
You think
I just want attention?

783
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:05,184
No. I think you're up in the clock
tower with a high-powered rifle

784
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,817
because
you wanna blend in.

785
00:39:06,894 --> 00:39:09,362
Believe it or not,
Jonathan...

786
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:12,455
I understand
about the pain.

787
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:13,727
Oh, right...

788
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,200
'cause the burden
of being beautiful and athletic...

789
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,635
that's a crippler.

790
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,207
You know what?
I was wrong.

791
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,572
You are an idiot.

792
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,706
My life happens to,
on occasion...

793
00:39:27,781 --> 00:39:30,215
suck beyond
the telling of it...

794
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,684
sometimes more
than I can handle.

795
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:35,187
And it's not just mine.

796
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:38,713
Every single person down there
is ignoring your pain

797
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:41,283
because they're too busy
with their own.

798
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,162
The beautiful ones...

799
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:47,063
the popular ones...

800
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,228
the guys that pick on you.

801
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:53,238
Everyone.

802
00:39:57,744 --> 00:40:01,180
If you could hear
what they were feeling...

803
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:05,548
the loneliness,
the confusion...

804
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:09,555
It looks quiet down there.

805
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:11,682
It's not.

806
00:40:11,758 --> 00:40:13,191
It's deafening.

807
00:40:18,765 --> 00:40:21,700
You know, I could've
taken that by now.

808
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,601
I know.

809
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:32,267
I'd rather do it this way.

810
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,521
I just wanted it to stop.

811
00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:48,754
Yeah, well, mass murder?

812
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,263
Not really doctor recommended
for that kind of pain.

813
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:53,731
Besides, prison,
it's a lot like high school...

814
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,664
only instead of noogies...

815
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,100
What are you
talking about?

816
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:59,400
Actions having consequences.
You know, stuff like that.

817
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:01,168
Well, I...

818
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,402
I wouldn't ever
hurt anybody.

819
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:08,544
I came up here
to kill myself.

820
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:33,205
Rat poison!

821
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:34,706
Rat poison!

822
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:36,072
Drop your spoons!

823
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:37,474
Step away from the spoons!

824
00:41:44,484 --> 00:41:46,179
OK, let's calm down.

825
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,720
Vermin.

826
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:49,483
You're all vermin.

827
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:54,960
You come in here,
and you eat filth!

828
00:41:55,028 --> 00:41:57,553
I don't see this being
settled with logic.

829
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,551
So you're feeling better
about Angel?

830
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,052
Well, we talked...

831
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,181
then he ripped out the heart
of a demon and fed it to me...

832
00:42:24,257 --> 00:42:25,690
and then we
talked some more.

833
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:27,693
See? That's how
it should work.

834
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:28,693
Morning.

835
00:42:28,762 --> 00:42:29,729
Hi, Giles.

836
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:31,696
Oh, I should get
to the yearbook office.

837
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:33,699
I'm gonna give 'em
the murderer profiles.

838
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:35,701
They're really
a good read.

839
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:37,202
- Bye.
- See ya.

840
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,703
How are you?

841
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:41,707
Nothing but quiet.
Nobody in here but me.

842
00:42:41,775 --> 00:42:43,140
Jonathan. How's he?

843
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,234
Pretty crappy.

844
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,711
His parents are freaking.
He got suspended.

845
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,714
And toting
a piece to school...

846
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,716
not exactly winning him
a place with the in-crowd.

847
00:42:50,784 --> 00:42:53,218
But I think he's dealing.

848
00:42:53,286 --> 00:42:55,652
Well, it's good of you
to check on him.

849
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:57,656
It's nice to be able
to help someone

850
00:42:57,724 --> 00:42:59,658
in a nonslaying capacity...

851
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:01,660
except he's starting
to get that look.

852
00:43:01,728 --> 00:43:04,663
You know, like he's
gonna ask me to prom.

853
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:07,165
It'd probably be good
for his self-esteem if you...

854
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:09,168
Oh, come on!
What am I, Saint Buffy?

855
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:11,170
He's like 3 feet tall.

856
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:14,173
I'm glad to see you've recovered
from your psychic encounter

857
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:15,674
more or less intact.

858
00:43:15,742 --> 00:43:17,175
Feel up to some
training?

859
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:19,075
Sure. We can work out
after school.

860
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:23,701
You know, if you're not too busy
having sex with my mother.

861
00:43:59,073 --> 00:44:01,371
Aargh!
