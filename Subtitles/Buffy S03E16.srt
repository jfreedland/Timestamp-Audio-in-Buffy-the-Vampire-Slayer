1
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:05,891
Do not ask again.

2
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:10,129
Your powers were a gift
of the lower beings.

3
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:12,260
You have proved
unworthy of them.

4
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:13,462
I was robbed of them.

5
00:00:13,537 --> 00:00:15,664
By your carelessness.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,264
For 1,000 years

7
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:19,468
I wielded the powers
of the wish.

8
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:20,601
I brought ruin

9
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,509
to the heads of
unfaithful men.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,946
I brought forth
destruction and chaos

11
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:26,812
for the pleasure
of the lower beings.

12
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:28,112
I was feared
and worshipped

13
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:29,675
across the mortal globe.

14
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:33,190
And now I'm stuck
at Sunnydale High.

15
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:35,191
Mortal.

16
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:37,727
Child.

17
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:39,558
And I'm flunking math.

18
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,495
This is no concern of ours.

19
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:44,363
You will live out
your mortal life and die.

20
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:45,663
Give me another chance.

21
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:47,033
You can fold
the fabric of time.

22
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,230
Send me back
to that place

23
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:49,704
and I'll change it.

24
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:51,867
I won't fail again.

25
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:53,773
Your time is passed.

26
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:57,143
Do you have any idea
how boring 12th graders are?

27
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:59,682
I'm getting
my power center back.

28
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,842
And if you
won't help me,

29
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:01,885
then by
the pestilent gods,

30
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,317
I will find someone
who will.

31
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,160
The Watcher Council shrink
is heavy into tests.

32
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:15,755
He's got tests
for everything.

33
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,232
T.A.T. s, Rorschach,

34
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:19,963
associative logic.

35
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:21,664
He even has that test
to see if you're crazy

36
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:23,070
that asks if you
ever hear voices

37
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,437
or you ever wanted
to be a florist.

38
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,533
Ooh, I used to want...
Wait.

39
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,578
Florist means crazy, right?

40
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:30,443
I never wanted to do that.

41
00:01:30,514 --> 00:01:32,209
Neat.

42
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:35,946
Thanks. It's all about
emotional control.

43
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,580
Plus, obviously, magic.

44
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:40,419
Hey, you want to go
to the espresso pump

45
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:42,584
and get sugared up on mochas?

46
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,355
I'm gonna pass.
Hit the pool and do some laps.

47
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:46,589
How come the sudden
calisthenics?

48
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:49,497
Aren't you sort of
naturally buff, Buff?

49
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,194
[Chuckles]
Buff Buff.

50
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:53,566
Well, they've got us running around
on the physical side, too.

51
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:55,298
A lot of reflex
evaluation

52
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:56,430
and precision training,
you know.

53
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:58,498
I just... Well,
I want to do...

54
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,203
Better than Faith?

55
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,178
So very shallow.

56
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:06,876
Competition is
natural and healthy.

57
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,078
Plus, you'll definitely ace her
on the psych tests.

58
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:11,280
Just don't mark
the box that says

59
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:13,323
"I sometimes like to kill people."

60
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,325
I know Faith's not
gonna be on the cover

61
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:17,690
of Sanity Fair,

62
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:19,820
but she had it rough.

63
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:22,331
Different circumstances,
that could be me.

64
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,457
No way.

65
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:26,367
Some people just don't
have that in them.

66
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,234
Look, I'm sorry.

67
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:30,296
I know how you hate
talking about Faith.

68
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:32,137
No, it's OK.

69
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:33,301
No, really,
we should just...

70
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:35,709
No. It doesn't bother me.
I mean it.

71
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:38,009
Uh, Will?

72
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:40,081
Oh.

73
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,850
Emotional control?

74
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,916
I'm working on it.

75
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,707
[Howling]

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

77
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:50,170
As far as I'm concerned,

78
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:53,178
this is a marriage
made in heaven.

79
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:54,907
Willow Rosenberg,

80
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:58,883
despite her unsavory
associations,

81
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,580
represents the pinnacle
of academic achievement

82
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:02,882
at Sunnydale High.

83
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:06,448
Percy West represents
a devastating fast break

84
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:10,860
and 50% from behind
the 3-point line.

85
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,865
I'm not sure I understand
the marriage part.

86
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,332
You've got the brains,

87
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,369
he's got the fast break.

88
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:18,927
It's a perfect match.

89
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:21,997
Match?

90
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:24,202
You want us to breed?

91
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,040
I want you to tutor him.

92
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:29,570
Percy is flunking
history.

93
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,277
Nothing seems to be able
to motivate him.

94
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,683
Hey, I'm challenged.

95
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:36,153
You're lazy, self-involved,
and spoiled.

96
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:37,154
That's quite
the challenge.

97
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:40,021
But we need
a winning year,

98
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:42,527
especially after last year's debacle
with the swim team.

99
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:44,290
Can't have our
point guard benched.

100
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:47,094
So, you're gonna take on
a little teaching job.

101
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,656
I know how you
enjoy teaching.

102
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:51,260
Well, I have a lot
of work of my own.

103
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:52,668
You've got a letter
of acceptance

104
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,297
from every university
with a stamp.

105
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:57,207
Yes, but I still have
classes and I don't...

106
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:58,209
Rosenberg...

107
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,745
it's time to give
something back

108
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:02,406
to the community.

109
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:05,781
I know you want to help
your school out here.

110
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,012
Ask me how I know.

111
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:08,144
How do you...

112
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:11,486
I just know.

113
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:14,856
So he threatened you?
With what?

114
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,828
Well, it wasn't exactly
anything he said.

115
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:19,489
It was all in his eyes.

116
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:21,396
I mean, there was some
nostril work as well,

117
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:22,991
but mostly eyes.

118
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,196
Snyder needs me
to kick his ass.

119
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,068
Oh, no, Buffy,
don't get in trouble.

120
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,300
I'll be OK.

121
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:31,343
I just hate the way
he bullies people.

122
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:34,141
He just assumes
everyone's time is his.

123
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:35,703
Willow, get on
the computer.

124
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:37,079
I want you to
take another pass

125
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,344
at accessing
the mayor's files.

126
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,215
OK.

127
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:42,117
Well, that
was a blast.

128
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,382
How did it go?

129
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:44,480
Princess Margaret here

130
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,889
had a little trouble
keeping up.

131
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,359
How did it go?

132
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:52,057
[Breathing Heavily]
Faith, uh...

133
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:54,065
did quite well on
the obstacle field.

134
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,725
Still a little
sloppy, though.

135
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:59,465
Do you feel up to taking
Buffy out, or shall I?

136
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,439
Oh, no, no, no,
I'll be fine.

137
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:03,805
Just give me
a minute.

138
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:05,366
And some
defibrillators,

139
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:06,742
if it's not
too much trouble.

140
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,075
You're gonna
love it, B.

141
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:10,547
It's just like fun,
only boring.

142
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:12,379
Faith, this evaluation

143
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:13,783
is a necessary part
of the Council.

144
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:15,684
I know.
I'm on board here.

145
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:16,881
Just shooting
my mouth off.

146
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:19,550
I better change.

147
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,428
Good luck.

148
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,266
What you doing?

149
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,399
I'm trying to access
the mayor's personal files.

150
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:38,171
Can you do that?

151
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:41,145
Well, he's got some
tricky barriers set up.

152
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:42,841
Can you get past 'em?

153
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:45,475
Eventually,
I'll get through.

154
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,580
That's very interesting.

155
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:52,317
Yeah, I thought so, too.

156
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:54,257
Are you serious
about this place?

157
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:56,056
Of course I am.
No slayer of mine

158
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,790
is gonna live in
a fleabag hotel.

159
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,458
That place has a very
unsavory reputation.

160
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:03,093
There are immoral liaisons
going on there.

161
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:04,727
Yeah, plus
all the screwing.

162
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:06,328
This place is the kick.

163
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:07,464
We'll keep your old place,

164
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,802
in case you need to see
your friends there,

165
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,172
but from now on...

166
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,074
Oh, hey.
Hey, hey, shoes. Shoes.

167
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:15,507
Thanks, sugar daddy.

168
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:18,015
Now, Faith, I don't find
that sort of thing amusing.

169
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,517
I'm a family man.

170
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,481
Now, let's kill
your little friend.

171
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:26,718
Don't worry. I wouldn't
ask you to do it.

172
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,852
Not this early in
the relationship.

173
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:31,294
Besides, I think
a vampire attack

174
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:34,333
would be less suspicious
anyway.

175
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,458
In the meantime,
let's take a look

176
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:36,661
at the rest of
the apartment, huh?

177
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:38,636
If I'm not mistaken,
some lucky girl

178
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:40,638
has herself
a Play Station.

179
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:41,638
No way.

180
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:43,641
Yes way.

181
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:47,743
Hey.

182
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:49,008
Oz. Hi.

183
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:50,207
There's something
about you

184
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,581
that's causing me
to hug you.

185
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:55,519
It's like I have
no will of my own.

186
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,954
Where were you yesterday?

187
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:00,458
We got back late,
sort of very.

188
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:02,357
We? Who? Where?

189
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:05,295
The band. We had a gig
in Monterey Sunday night.

190
00:08:05,364 --> 00:08:07,389
Oh, you did?

191
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,094
How come I didn't know?

192
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:10,658
I thought you did.

193
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:13,671
Maybe I would
have liked to go.

194
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:16,037
Didn't figure you
for missing school.

195
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,405
You think I'm boring.

196
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:20,503
I'd call that a radical
interpretation of the text.

197
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,446
We're playing tonight
at The Bronze.

198
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:27,782
I can't. I have
too much homework.

199
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,378
If you get done early...

200
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:36,853
Percy. Hey.

201
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,397
Listen, I thought we could
get together today at lunch

202
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:42,127
and go over
your Roosevelt paper.

203
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:43,998
You know, what books
you'll need and stuff.

204
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,367
What are you
talking about?

205
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,633
Me tutoring you.
Your history paper?

206
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:50,005
Oh, yeah. Snyder said
you were gonna do it.

207
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,271
He never said that.

208
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,313
What meeting
were you at?

209
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,245
Look, I'll get
the books you need.

210
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:57,407
Just meet me at lunch
and we'll...

211
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:58,882
No, no, no. I don't
have any time at lunch.

212
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,145
I gotta hang out.

213
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:01,151
Well...

214
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,586
What, you got something
better to do?

215
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:05,715
Just type it up
and put my name on it.

216
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,453
Oh, and don't type too good.
Dead giveaway.

217
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,471
I'm eating this now.

218
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:26,341
It's not lunchtime,
I don't even care.

219
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:28,312
- Hey.
- Willow,

220
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:29,507
did you remember
to tape

221
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:30,674
Biography last Friday?

222
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,012
Uh-huh.

223
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:34,985
See, I told you.
Old Reliable.

224
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,783
Oh, thanks.

225
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:37,823
What?

226
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,790
Old Reliable?
Yeah, great.

227
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:43,295
There's a sexy
nickname.

228
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:45,159
Well, I didn't
mean it as...

229
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:48,064
No, it's fine.
I'm Old Reliable.

230
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,328
She just means,
you know,

231
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,370
the geyser. You're
like a geyser of fun

232
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,667
that goes off at
regular intervals.

233
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:55,468
That's Old Faithful.

234
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,304
Isn't that the dog
that the guy had to shoot...

235
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:58,638
That's Old Yeller.

236
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,770
Xander, I beg you
not to help me.

237
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:03,110
Will, I didn't mean it
as a bad thing.

238
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:04,774
I think it's good
to be reliable.

239
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,011
Well, maybe
I don't want to be

240
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:09,020
reliable all the time.

241
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:12,546
Maybe I'm not just
some doormat person.

242
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,024
Homework gal.

243
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:16,857
I'm thinking
nerve strike.

244
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:20,726
Maybe I'll
change my look.

245
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,927
Or cut class.
You don't know.

246
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:25,898
And I'm eating
this banana.

247
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:27,940
Lunchtime be damned.

248
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:30,606
Will, wait.

249
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:31,609
I'm really sorry.

250
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:34,306
Buff, I'm storming off.

251
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,611
It doesn't really work
if you come with me.

252
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:39,311
Oh.

253
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:52,693
Uh, Willow?

254
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:55,097
Uh, hi.

255
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,659
Anya. I'm sort of
new here.

256
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,136
Um, I know Cordelia.

257
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:01,298
Oh, fun.

258
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:03,740
Yeah. Um, listen,

259
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,778
I have this little
project I'm working on,

260
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,506
and I heard you were
the person to ask...

261
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,243
Yeah, that's me.
Reliable dog geyser person.

262
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,750
What do you need?

263
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:14,013
Oh, it's nothing big.

264
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:16,214
Just a little spell
I'm working on.

265
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,620
A spell?

266
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,523
Oh. I like the black arts.

267
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:23,187
I just need a secondary
to create a temporal fold.

268
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,992
I heard you were
a pretty powerful wicca, so...

269
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:27,259
You heard right, mister.

270
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,666
I'm always ready to work
some dark mojo.

271
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:33,467
So, tell me,
is it dangerous?

272
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,803
Oh, no.

273
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,208
Well, could we
pretend it is?

274
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:41,940
The necklace was
a family heirloom

275
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,142
passed down for generations.

276
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:46,811
Then it was stolen
from my mom's apartment.

277
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:48,649
How does the spell work?

278
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:51,019
Uh, well...

279
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,991
we both call on Eryishon,
the endless one...

280
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,460
offer up the standard
supplication,

281
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,965
then there's a teensy
temporal fold... we hope.

282
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,025
Um, then I pour
the sacred sand

283
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,535
on the representation
of the necklace,

284
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:06,003
and Eryishon brings it forth

285
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:08,006
from the time and place
it was lost.

286
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:09,541
Cool.

287
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:10,871
Are we ready?

288
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:12,741
I think so.

289
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,939
Eryishon. K'shala.
Meh-uhn.

290
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:20,110
Diprecht. Doh-tehenlo
nu-Eryishon.

291
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:23,951
The child to the mother.

292
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,547
The river to the sea.

293
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,320
Eryishon, hear my prayer.

294
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,262
That was... What was that?

295
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,197
Oh, it's not here.

296
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:10,868
It's not here.

297
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,565
OK, that's
a little blacker

298
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,867
than I like my arts.

299
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:16,841
Oh, don't be such a wimp.

300
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,878
That wasn't just
some temporal fold,

301
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:21,777
that was some weird
hell place.

302
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,715
I don't think you're
telling me everything.

303
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:28,083
I swear, I am just trying
to find my necklace.

304
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:31,180
Well, did you try looking
inside the sofa in hell?

305
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:34,283
Look, we'll just
try it again, and...

306
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,158
No. I think
emphatically not.

307
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,959
I can't do it by myself.

308
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:40,294
That's a relief.

309
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:41,458
I'm out of here.

310
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,559
Fine. Go.

311
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:44,864
Idiot child.

312
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:49,105
I believe these
chicken feet are mine.

313
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:50,802
Look...

314
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:53,311
magic is dangerous,
Anya.

315
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:55,973
It's not to be
toyed with.

316
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:57,346
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

317
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,180
I have someone else's
homework to do.

318
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:05,788
Nothing!

319
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,732
This is weird.

320
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,037
Excuse me, young lady...

321
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,041
Shh!

322
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,907
Oh... oh...

323
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:06,874
* There's a chair in my head *

324
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:09,444
* In which I used to sit *

325
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:13,219
* Took a pencil and I wrote *

326
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:16,227
* The following on it *

327
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:19,526
* Now there's a key *

328
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:23,558
* Where my wonderful mouth
used to be *

329
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:30,604
* Dig it up
and throw it at me *

330
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,770
* Dig it up
and throw it at me *

331
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:40,875
* Where can I run to
Where can I hide *

332
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:44,889
* Who will I turn to *

333
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:48,984
* Now I'm in
a virgin state of mind *

334
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,586
* Got a knife to disengage *

335
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:54,155
* The voids that I can't bear *

336
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:58,101
* Cut out words
I've got written *

337
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:00,867
* On my chair *

338
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,933
* Like
Do you think I'm sexy *

339
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,340
Hey.

340
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,711
Rosenberg?

341
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:11,010
What are you doing,
trick-or-treating?

342
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,246
You're supposed to be at home
doing my history report.

343
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,788
I flunk that class, you're
in big trouble with Snyder.

344
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:21,156
Till we graduate,
I own your ass.

345
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:23,127
Bored now.

346
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:30,493
I'm having
a terrible night.

347
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,609
Want to make it better?

348
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,685
What's going on?
Is there a funny thing?

349
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,152
Back off.

350
00:16:51,224 --> 00:16:53,055
You stay the hell
away from her.

351
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,683
OK. Sure.

352
00:16:58,197 --> 00:16:59,391
Xander...

353
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,296
Will. Changing the look

354
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,664
not an idle threat
with you.

355
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,794
You're alive.

356
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:09,699
Uh...

357
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,869
Will, this is verging on
naughty touching here.

358
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:14,742
Don't want to fall
back on bad habits.

359
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:17,009
Hands. Hands
in new places.

360
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,813
You're alive.

361
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:23,446
You mentioned that
before.

362
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:24,546
Will, are you OK?

363
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:29,074
No. Everything's different.

364
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:30,538
There you are.

365
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:31,803
Hey, Buff.

366
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:33,276
Aren't you gonna
introduce me to your...

367
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,939
Holy God, you're Willow.

368
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,914
You.

369
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:41,111
You know what?
I like the look.

370
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,882
It's, um, it's extreme,

371
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,355
but it looks good,
you know.

372
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:48,325
It's a leather thing.

373
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:53,296
And, uh... I said extreme
already, right?

374
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:59,069
I don't like you.

375
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,404
Will, I'm sorry
about today.

376
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:04,635
You know how my foot
likes to live in my mouth,

377
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,337
but you know,

378
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:08,606
you really didn't have
to prove anything.

379
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,944
Leaving now.

380
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:14,850
Will, gotta say,
not loving the new you.

381
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,887
Will, wait...

382
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:17,444
Get off me.

383
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,803
Willow Rosenberg.

384
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:38,866
I'm not supposed to
talk to strangers.

385
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:40,138
Then we won't talk.

386
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,861
You made me cranky.

387
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,193
There's been a mistake here.

388
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,256
We were sent after a human.

389
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:04,461
Really?

390
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:05,764
Who do you work for?

391
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:07,327
I'm not telling you
a thing.

392
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:11,741
Aah!

393
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,276
Who do you work for?

394
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:18,316
Wilkins. The mayor.

395
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,016
Aah!

396
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:28,423
Who do you work for?

397
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,427
You.

398
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,055
Get your friends.

399
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,157
Bring them here.

400
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:38,225
The world's no fun anymore.

401
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:43,034
We're gonna make it
the way it was.

402
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:45,474
Starting with The Bronze.

403
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:51,775
Oh, Buffy. I thought you
were going out tonight.

404
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,112
I didn't expect...

405
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:58,616
What is it?

406
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:04,085
This isn't real.

407
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,559
I can't feel
anything.

408
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:12,296
Arms, legs,
anything.

409
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:17,103
She was truly the finest
of all of us.

410
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:22,480
Way better than me.

411
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:24,947
Much, much better.

412
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,916
It's all my fault.

413
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:30,148
No, it's me.

414
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:31,587
It's me.

415
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:33,886
I'm the one that
called her reliable.

416
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,551
She must have gone out
and gotten attacked,

417
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:36,821
which she never
would have done

418
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:39,455
if I hadn't have
called her reliable.

419
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,089
And now my best
friend is...

420
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,656
What's going on?

421
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:45,462
Geez, who died?

422
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:49,536
Oh, God. Who died?

423
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:51,075
Back!

424
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:52,609
Get back, demon.

425
00:20:58,617 --> 00:21:00,881
Willow,
you're alive.

426
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:02,579
Aren't I usually?

427
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:05,314
Oh!

428
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:11,562
I love you guys, too.

429
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,532
OK. Oxygen becoming
an issue.

430
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,001
Giles, what's going on
with these...

431
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,040
Oh.

432
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:25,576
Oh. Sorry.

433
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:30,977
It's really nice that
you guys missed me.

434
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:33,210
Say, you all didn't
happen to do

435
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:34,946
a bunch of drugs,
did you?

436
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,784
Will, we saw you
at The Bronze.

437
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,153
A vampire.

438
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:41,624
I'm not a vampire.

439
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:46,221
You are. I mean,
you were.

440
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:47,526
Giles, planning on
jumping in

441
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,089
with an explanation
any time soon?

442
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:51,032
Well, uh... something...

443
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:55,698
something very strange
is happening.

444
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:59,073
Can you believe the Watcher's Council
let this guy go?

445
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:07,875
What a day.

446
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,580
Give me a beer.

447
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:11,315
I.D.

448
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:15,288
I.D.

449
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,160
I'm 1,120 years old.
Just give me a friggin' beer.

450
00:22:20,265 --> 00:22:21,698
I.D.

451
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:24,030
[Sighs] Give me a Coke.

452
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:28,069
Man, we need
a roadie.

453
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,367
Other bands
have roadies.

454
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:31,773
Well, other bands
know more than 3 chords.

455
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:34,004
Your professional bands
can play up to 6,

456
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,104
sometimes 7 completely
different chords.

457
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:38,979
That's just, like,
fruity jazz bands.

458
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,347
Oz.

459
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:41,908
Hey, man.

460
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,045
You looking
for Buffy?

461
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:44,088
As always.

462
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,555
Well, no sightings
as of yet,

463
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,751
but I think she
said she'd show.

464
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,933
That doesn't look good.

465
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,370
Everybody, shut up.

466
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,870
All right.

467
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:08,572
Nobody cause any trouble
or try to leave...

468
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:11,810
and nobody gets hurt.

469
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:13,282
Why don't
I believe him?

470
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,410
Well, he lacks
credibility.

471
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,824
Can you get
out of here?

472
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:22,154
Skylight in the roof.

473
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:24,525
I can make it.

474
00:23:24,596 --> 00:23:26,086
I think we need
some backup.

475
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:27,995
I think
I'm needed here.

476
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:30,159
10-1. Could get
pointless.

477
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:55,392
Look. Everyone's
all afraid.

478
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,020
It's just like
old times.

479
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:02,991
Get Buffy.

480
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,660
Do it now.

481
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:12,474
Dude, check out
your girlfriend.

482
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:23,212
What's your name?

483
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:25,336
Sandy.

484
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:34,254
You don't have
to be afraid...

485
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:36,587
just to please me.

486
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:40,457
If you're all good
boys and girls,

487
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,588
we'll make you young

488
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:47,193
and strong forever
and ever.

489
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:49,294
We'll have fun.

490
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,370
If you're not...

491
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,089
Questions? Comments?

492
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,355
Willow.

493
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,420
You don't want
to do this.

494
00:25:15,498 --> 00:25:17,398
I don't?

495
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:20,299
But I'm so good at it.

496
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,972
Who did this to you?

497
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,134
I know you.

498
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,110
You're a white hat.

499
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,740
How come you're talking
to me like we're friends?

500
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:36,683
'Cause he thinks
you're someone else.

501
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:40,813
He thinks you're the Willow
that belongs in this reality.

502
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,824
Another me?

503
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:44,291
You know this isn't
your world, right?

504
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,918
I mean, you know you
don't belong here.

505
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:49,453
No. This is
a dumb world.

506
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:53,298
In my world there are
people in chains,

507
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:55,860
and we can ride them
like ponies.

508
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:58,338
You want to get
back there.

509
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:00,341
Yeah.

510
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:02,502
So do I.

511
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:06,937
This is creepy.

512
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:09,143
I don't like the thought
that there's a vampire

513
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:10,446
out there that
looks like me.

514
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,282
Not looks like... is.

515
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:14,879
It was exactly you,
Will, every detail.

516
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:17,619
Except for your not
being a dominatrix...

517
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,217
as far as we know.

518
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:21,024
Oh, right.
Me and Oz

519
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:23,326
play Mistress of Pain
every night.

520
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,525
Did anyone else

521
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:27,193
just go to a scary
visual place?

522
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:28,964
Oh, yeah.

523
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:35,374
Buffy, I...

524
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:36,706
Something's happened
that...

525
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:41,277
Willow's dead.

526
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:45,485
Hey, Willow.

527
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:49,780
Wait a second.

528
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:52,621
We're right there
with you, buddy.

529
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,356
We saw her, too.
At The Bronze.

530
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:58,296
OK. She's there now

531
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,665
with a cadre of vampires
looking to party.

532
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,601
We can figure out
who she is

533
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:04,764
after we stop
the feeding frenzy.

534
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,808
- How many of them were there?
- 8 or 10.

535
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,899
Should we
call Faith?

536
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:09,137
No, I don't want her
in combat yet.

537
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,769
- Not around civilians.
- Here, here.

538
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:12,006
Guys?

539
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:16,878
What are we gonna do with me?
The other me?

540
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,720
I don't know, Will.

541
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,951
I mean, we just have
to stop them.

542
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:25,084
I get that.

543
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,856
I just kind of
wanted to know...

544
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,525
Oh. Hey. Go.
I'll catch up.

545
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:43,202
Alone at last.

546
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,686
Well, look at me.

547
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:54,984
I'm all fuzzy.

548
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:58,617
What do I want with you?
Uh...

549
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:00,321
Your little school friend
Anya said

550
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,159
that you're the one
that brought me here.

551
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,026
She said that you could
get me back to my world.

552
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,433
Oh.

553
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:10,699
Oh. Oops.

554
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,799
But I don't know...

555
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:16,868
I kind of like the idea
of the two of us.

556
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:22,117
We could be
quite a team

557
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:24,175
if you came around
to my way of thinking.

558
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:27,416
Would that mean
we have to snuggle?

559
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,984
What do you say?

560
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:37,798
Want to be bad?

561
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:40,061
This just can't get
more disturbing.

562
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,159
[Growls]

563
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:43,136
Ack! No more.

564
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:45,332
You're really starting
to freak me out.

565
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:55,674
You don't want to play,

566
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,446
I guess I can't
force you.

567
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,547
Oh, wait.

568
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:04,389
I can.

569
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,420
Bitch.

570
00:29:16,138 --> 00:29:18,163
It's extraordinary.

571
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,140
It's horrible.

572
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:22,040
That's me as a vampire?

573
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:25,205
I'm so evil,
and skanky.

574
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,111
And I think
I'm kind of gay.

575
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,376
Willow,
just remember,

576
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,576
a vampire's
personality

577
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:32,085
has nothing to do
with the person it was.

578
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:33,781
Well, actually...

579
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:36,982
That's a good point.

580
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:38,492
So, uh,
what do we do now?

581
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,494
We still have to
get to The Bronze.

582
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:41,494
Even if they're supposed
to wait for her

583
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:42,655
they may start feeding.

584
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,699
Vampires are not
notoriously reliable.

585
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,029
So we charge in,

586
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:47,864
much in the style
of John Wayne?

587
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:50,029
High casualty risk.

588
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:52,039
I haven't any other
plan, though.

589
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:54,871
Uh, I have a
really bad idea.

590
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:03,949
They're still in
a holding pattern.

591
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,043
That's good.

592
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,088
It means they must really
be afraid of you.

593
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:08,589
Who wouldn't be?

594
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:12,723
Are you OK
in that?

595
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:14,228
It's a little binding.

596
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:18,027
I guess vampires really
don't have to breathe.

597
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:20,762
Gosh, look at those.

598
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:24,363
Um, Willow,
you go in

599
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,498
and defuse the situation
as best you can.

600
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,440
At least try and get
some of them to come out

601
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,034
and even up the odds
a bit.

602
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:32,046
First sign of trouble,
you give us a signal.

603
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:33,843
We come in hard and fast.

604
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,178
What is the signal?

605
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,410
Me screaming.

606
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:38,817
Giles, you and Xander
wait by the back entrance.

607
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:39,819
Good.

608
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:42,379
Now, you're sure
you're up to this?

609
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:43,890
Don't worry.
I won't do anything

610
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,722
that could be interpreted
as brave.

611
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:47,352
We'll be right outside.

612
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,516
Hi. I'm back.

613
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:19,527
Alphonse:
Did you find the girl?

614
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,795
Yep. I did.

615
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,299
Where is she?

616
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,569
I killed her.

617
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:34,074
And sucked her blood,
as we vampires do.

618
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:43,405
You know, I think maybe
I heard something out there.

619
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:44,906
Why don't you
go check?

620
00:31:54,518 --> 00:31:56,543
How could you kill her?

621
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,316
She was our best shot
at getting your world back.

622
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:03,883
I don't like that
you dare question me.

623
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:08,364
Maybe I'll have my minions take you
out back and kill you horribly.

624
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,362
Vampires. Always thinking
with your teeth.

625
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:14,370
She bothered me.

626
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:16,929
She's so weak
and accommodating.

627
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:22,708
She's always letting people
walk all over her,

628
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:25,873
and then she gets cranky
with her friends for no reason.

629
00:32:25,949 --> 00:32:28,383
I just couldn't
let her live.

630
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:32,387
You know, he's been gone
for a while.

631
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:34,390
Why don't you
go check on him?

632
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:39,885
Well, boss, since
that plan is out,

633
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:42,955
why don't we get
with the killing?

634
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:03,352
Oh, this is
like a nightmare.

635
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:07,386
Hello? Giles?

636
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:10,957
Wesley?

637
00:33:11,028 --> 00:33:15,158
I just happened
to stop by...

638
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:16,529
for books.

639
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:21,870
Hey, you.

640
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:22,870
Hey me?

641
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:24,133
Hey me what?

642
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:26,801
I have a name, you know.

643
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:29,937
Uh, Cordelia.

644
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,708
What did you do?

645
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:33,977
Lock yourself
in the book cage?

646
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:35,382
Yeah.

647
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:38,386
Let me out...

648
00:33:38,455 --> 00:33:41,720
'cause I'm so
helpless.

649
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,885
OK.

650
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,396
I think Giles keeps a spare.

651
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:50,627
How'd you manage to lock
yourself in, anyway?

652
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:53,568
Uh, I was looking
at books.

653
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:55,764
I like books...

654
00:33:57,407 --> 00:33:59,068
'cause I'm shy.

655
00:33:59,142 --> 00:34:00,200
Yeah, right.

656
00:34:00,277 --> 00:34:02,802
The famous shy girl act
all the boys fall for.

657
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:04,574
Open the cage.

658
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:12,644
Wait.

659
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:16,022
It occurs to me that we've never
really had the opportunity to talk.

660
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:18,027
You know, woman to woman...

661
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:20,325
with you locked up.

662
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:22,262
Don't want to talk.
Hungry.

663
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:25,932
What could we talk about?
Oh!

664
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:30,200
Hey! How about the ethics
of boyfriend stealing?

665
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:34,869
I don't know if I feel
like killing anymore.

666
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:37,379
I'm so bored.

667
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:46,889
It would be like
shooting fish in a barrel.

668
00:34:46,957 --> 00:34:48,891
Where's the fun?

669
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:53,453
With all due respect, boss,
the fun would be the eating.

670
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:57,330
Maybe we should let
everyone go,

671
00:34:57,401 --> 00:34:59,733
give them a 30-second
head start.

672
00:34:59,803 --> 00:35:01,498
Wait a minute.

673
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:04,665
No! I like my plan.

674
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:06,470
Oh, nice try.

675
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:08,340
OK, let's get
to the killing.

676
00:35:08,412 --> 00:35:09,674
Why don't we start with her?

677
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:11,646
Why don't we start
with you?

678
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:15,082
If she's a vampire, then I'm
the Creature from the Black Lagoon.

679
00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:17,086
And, OK...

680
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:19,679
it isn't even like I was
that attracted to Xander.

681
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:24,090
It was more just that we kept being
put in these life or death situations,

682
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:26,629
and that's always
all sexy and stuff.

683
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:30,560
I mean, I more or less
knew he was a loser,

684
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:36,197
but that doesn't make it OK
for you to come around and... What?

685
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:39,703
Do I have something
on my neck?

686
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:41,107
Not yet.

687
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:43,612
Am I getting a zit?

688
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,377
Cordelia,
I'm very sorry.

689
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:49,783
I realize I was wrong.

690
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:52,754
I'll never steal
your boyfriend again.

691
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:55,121
Like you could.

692
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:57,285
I should just leave you
in there,

693
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,089
but I'm a great humanitarian,

694
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:04,099
and you will just have to think
of a way to pay me back sometime.

695
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:08,035
OK.

696
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,672
How about dinner?

697
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:19,779
Aah! Aah! Aah!

698
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:23,853
I didn't mean all that
stuff I said before.

699
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,048
I want you to have Xander.
My blessings on you both.

700
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:29,250
I'm so over him.

701
00:36:29,326 --> 00:36:32,124
I need fresh blood.

702
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:33,287
Aah!

703
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:35,797
Aah!

704
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:44,570
No more hiding.

705
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,377
Back!
Creature of the night.

706
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:50,379
Leave this place!

707
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:52,381
Don't wanna.

708
00:36:57,721 --> 00:36:59,518
[Sighs] Whatever.

709
00:37:07,264 --> 00:37:08,993
Yaahh!

710
00:37:09,065 --> 00:37:10,828
I'm sorry.

711
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:14,530
No, no.
A little on edge.

712
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:16,936
You know,
men in combat.

713
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:18,338
Grr.

714
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:19,966
Are you all right?

715
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:21,908
You saved my life.

716
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,536
Thank you.

717
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:28,414
Oh, yes. Uh... yes.

718
00:37:30,554 --> 00:37:32,488
Was that?

719
00:37:32,556 --> 00:37:33,488
Willow.

720
00:37:33,557 --> 00:37:35,548
They got Willow.

721
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,385
So, you doing anything
tonight?

722
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:40,529
I'm just so tired of being around
human beings and all their baggage.

723
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:44,431
I'm just so tired of being around
human beings and all their baggage.

724
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,968
I don't care if I
ever get my powers back.

725
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:50,766
I think he should eat you.

726
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:56,368
This girl has a history of mental
problems dating back to early childhood.

727
00:37:56,445 --> 00:37:58,379
I'm a blood-sucking fiend.

728
00:37:58,447 --> 00:37:59,880
Look at my outfit.

729
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:03,406
A human. I should have
smelled it right away.

730
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:07,285
A human? Oh, yeah?
Could a human do this?

731
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:09,051
Aaaah!

732
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,888
- Sure. Yeah.
- Yeah.

733
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,224
- Humans do that. Yeah.
- I think, yeah.

734
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:28,099
Uhh!

735
00:38:28,177 --> 00:38:30,407
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Happy, but ow!

736
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:42,455
Devon, come on!

737
00:38:49,698 --> 00:38:51,222
No more snuggles?

738
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,354
Buffy, no!

739
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:04,033
Nice reflexes.

740
00:40:04,106 --> 00:40:05,869
Well, I work out.

741
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,403
This world's no fun.

742
00:40:12,014 --> 00:40:13,447
You noticed that, too?

743
00:40:22,024 --> 00:40:26,961
So, um, in your reality,
I'm like this bad ass vampire, huh?

744
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:28,656
People afraid of me?

745
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:32,395
Oh, yeah.

746
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:33,399
I'm bad.

747
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:40,936
I'm not sure about releasing
this thing into the wild, Will.

748
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:42,533
It is a demon.

749
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:45,603
I just can't kill her.

750
00:40:45,681 --> 00:40:47,239
No.

751
00:40:47,316 --> 00:40:48,783
Me, neither.

752
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,785
I mean,
I know she's not me.

753
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:56,415
We have a big nothing
in common, but still.

754
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:58,823
There but for the grace
of getting bit.

755
00:40:58,894 --> 00:41:03,422
We send her back to her world,
then she stands a chance.

756
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:05,932
It's the way
it should be anyway.

757
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:08,367
Uh, we're
about ready here.

758
00:41:14,543 --> 00:41:17,307
Don't you try any
tricks now, dear.

759
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:18,812
I don't need tricks.

760
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,816
When I get my powers back,
you will all grovel before me.

761
00:41:22,884 --> 00:41:23,851
Pfff!

762
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,150
If you, uh, Willows
would like to, uh,

763
00:41:30,225 --> 00:41:31,852
complete the circle.

764
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:35,257
Good luck.

765
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:38,666
Try not to kill people.

766
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:46,736
Hands! Hands!

767
00:42:14,002 --> 00:42:15,936
You wanna go out
tonight?

768
00:42:16,004 --> 00:42:19,030
Strangely, I feel
like staying at home...

769
00:42:19,107 --> 00:42:21,302
and doing my homework...

770
00:42:21,376 --> 00:42:22,968
and flossing...

771
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:24,512
and dying a virgin.

772
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:27,844
You know,
you can O.D. on virtue.

773
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:31,875
Between me and my evil self,
I've double guilt coupons.

774
00:42:31,953 --> 00:42:35,445
I see now where the path
of vice leads.

775
00:42:35,524 --> 00:42:38,493
I mean, she messed up
everything she touched.

776
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,360
I don't ever
want to be like that.

777
00:42:42,431 --> 00:42:43,693
Hey. Oh, hi.

778
00:42:43,765 --> 00:42:46,393
Oh, hi, listen,
I didn't have a chance...

779
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:50,404
OK, so I did the outline
for the paper on Roosevelt.

780
00:42:50,472 --> 00:42:52,702
It turns out there were
2 President Roosevelts,

781
00:42:52,774 --> 00:42:56,369
so I didn't know exactly
which one to do, so I did both.

782
00:42:56,445 --> 00:43:00,779
I know they're kind of short,
but I can flesh them out.

783
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:03,044
Oh, and here's
the bibliography.

784
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:05,882
Um, and I can retype
that if you want.

785
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:10,755
You just let me know what I did wrong,
and I'll get on it.

786
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:21,768
You wanna go out
tonight?

787
00:43:21,837 --> 00:43:25,483
9:00 sound good?

788
