<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:05,553
l believe in you, Spike.

3
00:00:07,156 --> 00:00:10,865
<i>(Buffy) They were after Spike all along.</i>
<i>You know what we're up against. The First.</i>

4
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:14,266
Now, Spike, you wanna see
what a real vampire looks like?

5
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,870
We won't use magic to fight this
until we know what we're doing.

6
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:18,594
- Giles.
- Buffy.

7
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:21,190
- <i>(Buffy)</i> They're all slayers?
- <i>(Giles)</i> Potentials.

8
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:25,269
Waiting for one to be called. There were
many more like them all over the world,

9
00:00:25,356 --> 00:00:29,634
but now there's just a handful,
and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.

10
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:32,674
What you fought was a vampire,
but it was something more.

11
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,872
lt was a Turok-Han.

12
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:38,551
<i>A ferociously powerful killing machine</i>
<i>as single-minded as an animal.</i>

13
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:41,150
l think the Turok-Han
is here as an agent of the First.

14
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:44,990
They want an apocalypse? We'll give 'em one.
Cos we just became an army.

15
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:51,106
There is only one thing on this earth
more powerful than evil, and that's us.

16
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:55,674
<i>(bus driver)</i> Sunnydale. Watch your step.

17
00:00:58,636 --> 00:01:00,627

Uh!

20
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,113
<i>(Buffy)</i> Hey!

21
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,545
Try picking on someone my own size.

22
00:01:57,356 --> 00:01:59,472
Ow! Urgh!

23
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:07,390
Rona, right?

24
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:10,036
l just got word you were arriving.

25
00:02:10,716 --> 00:02:12,547
You're her.

26
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:13,785
Her is me.

27
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:19,586
You know, l thought...
They told me l'd be safe here.

28
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:25,706
Right. Well, you are.
l mean, you will be... safer... with me around.

29
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:28,435
- This is good.
- Next time you're attacked...

30
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:32,714
Whoa, whoa. Next time?
You sayin' l'm gonna get attacked again?

31
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:35,390
Welcome to the Hellmouth.

32
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:43,394
<i>(Kennedy)</i> You don't have to do this.

33
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:45,592
Flooring it. ln the bag.

34
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:48,429
Cos nice big comfy bed right here.

35
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:51,588
- l mean, you oughta know. Your bed.
- Yeah.

36
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:54,474
But no. l'm OK. l just...

37
00:03:54,556 --> 00:04:00,233
- l like it down here. lt's firm.
- Funny, you look a little uncomfortable.

38
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:02,511
- Or is itjust me?
- No.

39
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:05,872
l'm just, uh... uneasy cos Buffy's out.

40
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:09,949
- Right. How many girls arriving this time?
- Just one.

41
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:15,394
But since Giles has the coven searching for
other slayers-in-waiting to send 'em our way,

42
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:18,149
l bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.

43
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:23,708
So you're saying l should enjoy having
this bed all to myself as long as l can?

44
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:29,473
- lt is starting to get crowded around here.
- Totally. And with this many girls,

45
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:33,708
if we don't get another bathroom in this
house soon, things are gonna get ugly.

46
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:37,027
Somebody had to share mirror time
with a bunch of siblings.

47
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:41,712
Somebody not me. l only got a half-sister
and we didn't have to share.

48
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:44,469
Her bedroom was in
a different wing of the house.

49
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:48,549
- Wing? Your house had wings?
- Yeah.

50
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:51,070
Just a couple. A few.

51
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:55,991
Our summer home in the Hamptons
didn't have any at all. Well, one, actually.

52
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:57,945
Huh.

53
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,345
Well, that's... that's... Huh!

54
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:06,705
But never mind my deal. What's your story,
Willow? l mean, witchcraft? Wow!

55
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:09,549
That sounds... New-Agey.

56
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:15,586
No, it's safe to say that what l practise
is definitely... Old-Agey.

57
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:19,187
- So, show me a trick.
- A trick?

58
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:22,586
Pull a rabbit out of something,
or make something float.

59
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:23,950
Uh, yeah.

60
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:29,394
Listen, Kennedy, it's almost morning
and we really need to get some sleep.

61
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:34,911
Hey, if l wanted to sleep, l'd be downstairs
catching z's with the other girls.

62
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:40,712
Annabelle was all
"Control your fear, control your fear."

63
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:43,754
Meanwhile, she's the one
that goes scamperin' off,

64
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,908
right into that Turok-Han vampire.

65
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:48,748
Poor Annie.

66
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:53,193
Great. So the Slayer who's supposed
to protect us let her get killed?

67
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:58,225
She didn't let her. Annabelle was foolish.
Buffy can't be faulted for arriving too late.

68
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,195
lt's not like she could've stopped it.
The supervampire messed her up good.

69
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:06,394
No lie. She still looked like
a big bruise when l got here,

70
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:09,627
and that was already, like, the day after.

71
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:15,074
And why isn't she back yet? Buffy?
She left to get the new girl over an hour ago.

72
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:21,831
Maybe she ran into trouble. You don't
think maybe she was too late again?

73
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,713
- Maybe...
- Maybe we can save maybes

74
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:26,788
for a more of a dayish part of the day, girls.

75
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:34,153
Potential slayers can function without sleep.
l'm no good without my usual 90 minutes.

76
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:37,194
l'm with him. Keep the chatter down.

77
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:39,870
Or speak up so l can hear you.

78
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:44,353
l'm bored. <i>Episode One</i> bored.

79
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:48,711
- You guys are all still up?
- Ah! Who needs sleep?

80
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:50,830
- Everybody, this is Rona.
- <i>(girls)</i> Hey.

81
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,626
- Hey, Rona.
- Hey, Rona.

82
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:57,108
Um...

83
00:06:57,196 --> 00:06:59,187
Why is that guy tied to a chair?

84
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:03,064
The question you'll soon be asking is
"Why isn't he gagged?"

85
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:07,232
Molly, show our new house guest
where the kitchen is.

86
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:13,266
- l'm sure she's hungry after her travels.
- Fair enough. A bit peckish meself.

87
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:16,792
- Bit what as well?
- That's English for "hungry".

88
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,229
Oh.

89
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,989
l thought "hungry" was English for "hungry".

90
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:24,748
- Everything all right?
- She had a welcoming committee.

91
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:27,908
The First knows potential slayers
are coming here?

92
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:32,114
- l must warn the coven.
- The First will always be one step ahead.

93
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:36,747
l need to know how to stop it.
No, not stop it, hurt it.

94
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:38,872
l want to hurt it real bad.

95
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:41,231
- Tell me how.
- l, uh...

96
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:43,910
l don't know, Buffy.

97
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,272
l've exhausted all the sources
l have left with little result.

98
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:50,905
The watchers' records
are still really all we have to go on.

99
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:55,387
l made the rounds myself. Tried to dig up
anything useful from the demon community.

100
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,548
They're a community now?
What's next, a Ladies' Auxiliary?

101
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:02,424
The ones that didn't attack me didn't know
or didn't talk. We've got squat.

102
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:05,508
Squat's not gonna cut it.
What about the Turok-Han?

103
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:10,147
- <i>(Xander)</i> The vampire time forgot?
- <i>(Buffy)</i> Time may forget him, but l won't.

104
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:14,514
We know stakes don't kill it, but anything
in those ancient myths about what does?

105
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:17,588
Sunlight, fire. Germs?

106
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:24,115
Giles, with that thing guarding the entrance to
the First's crib, how will Buffy get to Spike?

107
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:29,708
l really hate to admit this,
but he's not wrong.

108
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:32,435
There's no way to help Spike
until it's out of the way.

109
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:33,915
Spike?

110
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:38,786
Sorry, l'm confused. He's that vampire
who's been killin' people, right?

111
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:43,631
- He's the one you're worried about helping?
- <i>(Buffy)</i> Well, we need him to...

112
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:45,991
He's the one that's been...

113
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:49,472
lt's complicated, Chloö.

114
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,432
l'm Chloö. She's Eve.

115
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:58,193
lt's just... Well, we've been talkin',
and... do we have some kind of plan?

116
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:02,508
You know, any kind of plan to...
keep us from dying?

117
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:07,354
We're workin' on it.

118
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:10,428
There is one avenue
that we haven't tried yet.

119
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,427
- Giles!
- Beljoxa's Eye.

120
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:17,226
- Exactly what part of town is that avenue in?
- l told you no.

121
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:19,591
What is Botox's eye?

122
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:24,704
Beljoxa's Eye. lt's an oracle-type creature
that exists in a dark dimension.

123
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:27,105
- lnternal vortex more like.
- Fun.

124
00:09:27,196 --> 00:09:31,269
- Not really, no.
- Only demons can open the gateway to it.

125
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:33,153
Excuse me, ex-demon here.

126
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:36,626
You've still friends in the fold.
Or murderous acquaintances.

127
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:41,392
There's no reason to think Beljoxa's Eye
will have the answers we're looking for.

128
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:47,153
l'll take anything l can get.
Anya, please, we're running out of time.

129
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,227
Spike's running out of time.

130
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:43,034
Dreaming of me again, aren't you?

131
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,107
Poor Spike.

132
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,994
He still thinks l believe in him.

133
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:52,149
Be realistic.
l don't even believe in myself.

134
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:55,751
At least, not enough
to risk my skin to save your ass.

135
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:59,866
Not enough to face... that.

136
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:01,548
<i>(growls)</i>

137
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,907
l'm sorry, Spike.

138
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:09,715
But you need to accept this.

139
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:16,065
You know it never would've worked out.
lt's time to let go so we can both move on.

140
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:18,465
l promise, soon it'll all be...

141
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:20,148
<i>(whispers)</i>

142
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:29,710
<i>(whispers)</i> She... She...

143
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:32,515
She will come for me.

144
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:35,952
She... will come for me.

145
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:50,147
No.

146
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:52,227
l won't.

147
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,714
- <i>(Anya)</i> Why not?
- <i>(man)</i> You have the nerve to ask me that?

148
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:00,993
Come on, Torg, that was a lifetime ago.

149
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:03,670
Three, but who's counting?

150
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:07,513
- You broke my heart, Anyanka.
- Don't be so dramatic, Torg.

151
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,666
You don't even have a heart.

152
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:13,066
Six spleens, two stomachs,
half a brain maybe, but no heart.

153
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:15,306
Don't mock this.

154
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:18,274
The night we spent together
was important to me.

155
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:20,870
lt was one date. lt wasn't even a date.

156
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:25,313
We just happened to be invited to the same
massacre and you hit on me after l had a few.

157
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,626
l remember, you wore pink.

158
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:32,836
- Those were entrails.
- Sorry, perhaps we could skip the nostalgic...

159
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:38,113
- Sorry, no, no. Carry on.
- OK, Torg, look.

160
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:43,395
You open this tiny little gateway
to the Beljoxa's Eye for me, and l'll...

161
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:47,434
You and l can go...

162
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,029
<i>(sighs)</i>

163
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:54,270
l'll have sex with you again.

164
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,311
<i>(Torg)</i> Urgh!

165
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:58,830
Please, you're human.

166
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,955
The way you look now, l wouldn't
touch you for all the kittens in Korea.

167
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:07,268
You're rejecting my sexual bribery?
What am l, a leper? l can't even give it away.

168
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:10,268
- Come back when you are a leper.
- Um...

169
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,507
Perhaps this might change your mind.
You help us,

170
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:19,785
and the Slayer will not kill all your clientele
and burn your establishment to the ground.

171
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:28,107
<i>(breathes heavily)</i>

172
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:36,471
<i>(chants spell in ancient language)</i>

173
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:47,675
There's your stinkin' gateway, Anyanka.
Don't let it hit you on the way out.

174
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:54,749
- lt's the hair, right? Not attractive?
- Come on.

175
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,827
Buckle up.

176
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:03,266
- <i>(Anya)</i> God, l hate this place.
- Where's the Beljoxa's Eye?

177
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,347
<i>(male voice)</i> Here.

178
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:10,346
Ah! Oh.

179
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:12,313
Hi.

180
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:15,389
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- Hello?

181
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:19,469
No, Giles isn't here right...
Yeah, this is Willow.

182
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:23,595
Althenea, hi! How's the coven?
Oh, l miss you guys.

183
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:27,146
Still workin' out
that Pleiadian spirit conjuring?

184
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:29,867
What?

185
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,868
Oh. OK, when?

186
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,948
Ow! Watch it. That's my joystick hand.

187
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:39,025
- l'm not gonna touch that one.
- <i>(Buffy)</i> OK.

188
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:42,028
Listen up, Andrew.
l don't know what to do with you.

189
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:47,634
- We don't have time to baby-sit a hostage.
- Especially one that's more than a little ripe.

190
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:53,953
So l'm here to tell you,
if you try anything, try to run...

191
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:57,870
- Did you ever see the movie <i>Misery?</i>
- Six times. But the book was scarier

192
00:14:57,956 --> 00:15:03,633
cos instead of crushing his foot with a
sledgehammer, Kathy Bates chops it off...

193
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,510
- l'll be good.
- Buffy?

194
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:13,626
Word from the underground. Another
potential arrived the day before yesterday.

195
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:16,389
She's at the Sunspot Motel, near the highway.

196
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:18,910
Why are we just finding out about it now?

197
00:15:18,996 --> 00:15:21,669
Bringers killed her watcher
before he could tell us.

198
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:27,194
lf it wasn't for a powerful seer in the coven,
we wouldn't even know about it now.

199
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:30,188
OK. There's still a couple
of hours of daylight left.

200
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:33,712
- You guys should be safe here. l'll get her.
- l'll go with you.

201
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:36,833
All right, retrieving a potential.
Let's do it!

202
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:42,748
Or l could just go wash up.

203
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:50,311
- Where are they going?
- Bring another newbie in from the cold.

204
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:53,229
- Another one?
- Well, the more the better, l figure.

205
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:55,466
We need all the help we can get.

206
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:58,946
- Help. Sure, that's cool, but...
- What?

207
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:05,391
l'm just not sure more scared
slayer wannabes translates as help.

208
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:18,627
- What are we all doin' here?
- lt's called training.

209
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:22,311
- Didn't your watcher teach you the word?
- l never had a watcher.

210
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:27,151
l only found out what l was - or might be -
after those crazy-ass monks came after me.

211
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,034
l meant why are we all botherin'?

212
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:34,026
- lt's not like we can make a difference.
- <i>(Molly)</i> We've gotta train.

213
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:38,155
- We gotta keep our reflexes sharp.
- <i>(Kennedy)</i> We have to be ready.

214
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:42,229
- lf something comes down...
- No, something's already come down.

215
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:45,353
She's right. And what are we
supposed to do about it?

216
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:51,432
l mean, l've never seen a real vampire
in my whole life, much less a slayed one.

217
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:53,711
l've seen one.

218
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:57,471
Well, my watcher once showed me
a photograph of one.

219
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:02,026
- A blurry photograph.
- That's what l'm sayin'.

220
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:06,348
Not one of us is remotely prepared
to be activated as the new Chosen One.

221
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:09,189
- l feel pretty prepared.
- Excuse the newness of me,

222
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:11,710
butjust so l understand, if a slayer dies...

223
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:14,549
Well, <i>when</i> the Slayer dies.

224
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:17,992
l mean, nobody lives forever, right?

225
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:21,352
- One of us...
- Gets activated. Uh-huh.

226
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:24,553
- l prefer "called".
- l heard there's more than one.

227
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:29,027
- More than one what?
- Slayer. There's another one. Somewhere.

228
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:32,631
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Like any of this does.

229
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:37,471
No matter how many there are,
one of us is gonna be the next Slayer,

230
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,866
with the weight of the world on her shoulders.

231
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:44,153
lt won't be me. l mean, not now.

232
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:48,033
l mean, l'm too young.

233
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:51,392
lt doesn't work that way.
ln fact, the younger the better.

234
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:53,785
l'm starting to think
it might be too late for me.

235
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:59,985
Never too late. lt could be anyone.
Especially since there are so few of us left.

236
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:03,068
They'll just run through each one of us.

237
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:06,228
One after the other.

238
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:08,466
Kinda creepy, huh?

239
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:12,549
All we do is wait around for each other to die.

240
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:21,671
- You sure this is it?
- Clerk said it's the only check-in in a week.

241
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:25,305
- Tourism must be down.
- Right in the middle of apocalypse season.

242
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,988
Hello.

243
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:32,225
lt's OK. We're friendly.
And we have eyes.

244
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:34,034
Buffy.

245
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:36,107
Kick the door down.

246
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:47,314
She's cold. Been dead for days.

247
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:50,945
Poor kid. Made it all the way to Sunnydale
just to get herself killed.

248
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:53,391
- lf only we...
- Eve.

249
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:55,512
Eve, who's in our house?

250
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,391
Just my personal opinion,

251
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:12,311
but l don't think the Slayer
can protect us from the First.

252
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:22,231
Another interesting thing:
how come the Slayer's always a girl?

253
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:26,275
- l dunno. Cos girls are cooler?
- l think a guy slayer would be badass.

254
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:29,666
Like, if there was this ninja,
a guy slayer would be like:

255
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:32,714
"You may be silent, but this'll shut you up."

256
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:38,306
- Buffy could stomp ninja ass.
- The silent warrior? Ha-ha! l think not.

257
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:43,914
She can't even slay that special vampire.
Everyone's saying.

258
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:48,274
Everyone should shut up. And stop
pretending anybody here is your friend.

259
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:53,908
And also, why's she so about saving Spike?
He's a worse killer than me by... a way lot.

260
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:57,193
Spike was being controlled by the First.

261
00:19:57,276 --> 00:19:59,312
And he has a soul now.

262
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:01,751
Besides, we need his help.

263
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:06,864
What about me? Did it ever occur to anyone
that l could be a lot more useful?

264
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:11,905
- l used to be an evil genius. Hello?
- And what was your genius thing?

265
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:15,033
Well, um... raising demons mostly.

266
00:20:15,956 --> 00:20:19,915
OK, so not for now,
but also there was planning.

267
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:22,385
There were, um... blueprints.

268
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:27,592
l can be in this, kickin' it righteous.
Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah.

269
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:33,147
Buffy said if you talked enough,
l'm allowed to kill you.

270
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:35,830
- Not even.
- Even.

271
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:39,145
Licence to kill, huh?

272
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:42,945
Pretty cool. You know,
Timothy Dalton never got his props

273
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:46,312
cos he came in at the end of an old regime,
but he had it going on.

274
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:51,868
He went rogue with the Broccolis.
They were just treading water, stylistically.

275
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:54,709
ls there a language that you're speaking?

276
00:20:58,356 --> 00:20:59,914
l'm so alone.

277
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:03,625
Then maybe you shouldn't
have killed your only friend.

278
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:06,594
l hate that. You don't even know.

279
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:10,395
- l don't plan to.
- The Slayer's not getting it done.

280
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:15,994
l have got my ear to the ground,
and... that's the word.

281
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:22,270
Do you wanna play Kevin Bacon?

282
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:32,830
- Buffy.
- <i>(Dawn)</i> What is it?

283
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:47,310
- Get away from them.
- Who? Get away from who?

284
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:51,951
- What's the problem, officer?
- l said get away from them now.

285
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:54,425
- Buffy, what did Eve do?
- That's not Eve.

286
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:57,633
- Eve's dead.
- l don't understand.

287
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:00,911
Oops! One more down.

288
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:04,306
Oh, well, can't save 'em all, can ya, Buffy?

289
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:09,787
Thanks for the slumber party, girls.
lt's been real fun these past couple of nights.

290
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:13,152
- l learned a whole lot...
- Shut up and get out!

291
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:18,826
Or you'll do what? l'll be sending
a guest over to visit y'all later on tonight,

292
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,305
after the sun goes down, of course.

293
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:25,594
Try and make him feel welcome
before he rips y'all to pieces.

294
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:29,267
Bye.

295
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,276
l need to go wash up again.

296
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:37,232
lt cannot be fought, it cannot be killed.

297
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:40,752
The First Evil has been and always will be.

298
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:45,864
Since before the universe was born,
long after there is nothing else, it will go on.

299
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:48,754
l refuse to believe that.
There must be a way to destroy it.

300
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:51,509
Am l talkin' to myself here? There's no way.

301
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:54,474
OK, we tried. Let's go, Giles.

302
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:58,674
Are you saying the First will succeed
in wiping out the line of slayers?

303
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:03,876
The Eye sees not the future,
only the truth of the now and before.

304
00:23:03,956 --> 00:23:07,187
Yes, we've all got that. lt's called memory.

305
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:10,313
Can you help us out with something
a little bit more demony?

306
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:13,866
lf the First has been around
for all time, then...

307
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:17,028
why hasn't it attempted
something like this before? Why now?

308
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:20,233
The opportunity
has only recently presented itself.

309
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,351
Opportunity?

310
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:25,748
The mystical forces surrounding the chosen
line have become irrevocably altered,

311
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:28,669
become unstable, vulnerable.

312
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:32,226
- Something the First did?
- The First did not cause the disruption,

313
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:37,185
only seized upon it to extinguish
the lives of the chosen forever.

314
00:23:37,956 --> 00:23:42,746
Then what has caused the disruption?
What is responsible for letting this happen?

315
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:44,827
The Slayer.

316
00:23:45,796 --> 00:23:47,434
- We should run.
- And go where, Vi?

317
00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:50,349
- Annabelle ran. Look where it got her.
- Safer in than out.

318
00:23:50,436 --> 00:23:54,111
How can you say that?
lt was here, Buffy, in the house.

319
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:56,915
- Livin' with us for days.
- You didn't even know it.

320
00:23:56,996 --> 00:24:00,227
- None of us did.
- lt could still be here. lt could be one of us.

321
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:03,308
No, the First can only take
the form of dead people.

322
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:07,514
There'll be plenty more of those soon enough.
We're dropping like flies here.

323
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,474
<i>(all talk at once)</i>

324
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:16,028
l know you're all scared. l am too.
But Giles and Anya will be back soon.

325
00:24:16,116 --> 00:24:19,153
Hopefully they will have
the information that we need.

326
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:23,434
ln the meantime, we need to stick together.
OK? We're stronger that way.

327
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:27,668
- We cannot afford to fall apart now.
- Right. Where would the Justice League be

328
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:33,194
if they hadn't put their differences aside
to stop the lmperium and his alien horde?

329
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:36,029
- Don't help me.
- <i>(Xander)</i> Buff, the sun goes down,

330
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:40,268
and Übervamp's on its way,
so a plan'd be good right about now.

331
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:46,954
- Will, l'm sorry to ask, but...
- l know. We need a barrier.

332
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:48,867
A major one.

333
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:53,393
Something tells me this vampire doesn't
need an invite to get into the house.

334
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:56,434
- Can you do it?
- l'll try.

335
00:24:56,516 --> 00:24:58,268
- Try?
- You heard her.

336
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:00,745
Are you sure about Willow
doing the hocus-pocus?

337
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:03,304
- Last time she...
- We don't have a lot of choices.

338
00:25:03,396 --> 00:25:06,593
What if it doesn't work?
What if the monster gets through?

339
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:08,667
- Then we'll deal.
- <i>(Rona)</i> Deal?

340
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:11,270
Fight, you mean.
How are we supposed to do that?

341
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:14,792
- And with what?
- With whatever it takes! Right?

342
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:19,392
Buffy, you fought the Turok-Han,
and it almost killed you.

343
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,788
- And you're the real Slayer.
- What chance do <i>we</i> have?

344
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:28,712
Honestly, you staked that thing,
and it didn't die.

345
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:32,186
- No, but that doesn't...
- Maybe it can't be killed.

346
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:35,154
- <i>(Dawn)</i> So we shouldn't try?
- <i>(Rona)</i> That word again.

347
00:25:35,236 --> 00:25:38,512
- <i>(Kennedy)</i> lt's a good word.
- <i>(Vi)</i> Give up. Can we do that?

348
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:41,429
Surrender, l mean, so it won't kill us.

349
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:42,835
What?

350
00:25:43,396 --> 00:25:45,705
l said trying is good.

351
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:51,950
- l just thought it beared repeating.
- <i>(potential slayers all talk at once)</i>

352
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:56,631
- We're all potential slayers.
- We need to think positive here.

353
00:25:56,716 --> 00:26:00,834
- l mean, fighting is one thing...
- l don't wanna die.

354
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:03,112
<i>(Eve) The time has come...</i>

355
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:08,429

<i>(growls)</i>

359

Well, alone again.

00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:29,227
l just love having you all to myself.

361
00:26:36,676 --> 00:26:39,634
There's more of them now.

362
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:44,028
- And two more out back.
- Why aren't they doin' anything? Attackin'?

363
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:48,029
They don't want in.
They're here to make sure we don't get out.

364
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:49,708
Rona.

365
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:55,633
Like this'll do any good.
l mean, what's the point?

366
00:26:55,716 --> 00:27:01,507
lt's this end right here. You stick that
in the bad guys. Any more questions?

367
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:07,386
- This will do me.
- Are you sure you know how to use it?

368
00:27:09,716 --> 00:27:12,105
Since l was eight.

369
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:21,147
Can l have something? Come on, the
Turok-Han's coming for me too, you know.

370
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:23,466
l have a right to defend myself.

371
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:25,592
lf you say so.

372
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:41,991
Facing my fear. l'm facing my fear.

373
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:44,874
Hear that, fear? l'm facing you.

374
00:27:45,716 --> 00:27:47,786
Wow!

375
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,151
You really can float stuff.

376
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:51,908
Just testing.

377
00:27:51,996 --> 00:27:53,668
Oh, right.

378
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:59,114
Heard this voodoo once turned you
into the big scary. Big, scary Willow.

379
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:02,313
- That's something l'd almost like to see.
- No, you wouldn't.

380
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:04,466
l said "almost".

381
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:08,555
l needed to make sure.

382
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:12,265
Last time l tried using magic,
the First, it...

383
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:16,031
it turned it around on me, got inside.

384
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:22,112
l felt it surging through me
in every fibre of my being.

385
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:25,666
Pure, undiluted evil.

386
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:27,508
l could taste it.

387
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:29,873
How's evil taste?

388
00:28:32,196 --> 00:28:35,393
- A little chalky.
- <i>(Dawn)</i> Guys?

Something's happening.

390

Oh, my God.

391
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:45,827
Here it comes.

Deflector shields up.

<i>Saepio impedimentum!</i>

<i>(Buffy)</i> Will..

- Hang on, Willow.
- l don't know.

404
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:32,151
- <i>(Dawn)</i> She can't hold it.
- What do we do? What do we do?

405
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:34,227
Run. Everybody run.

406
00:29:53,636 --> 00:29:55,274
Aargh!

00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:01,266
Come on!

00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,709
Are you all right?

409
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:08,865
Yeah.

410
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:14,588
l just... l don't understand how Buffy's death
mucked up the whole slayer mojo.

411
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:18,032
- lt's not like she hasn't died before.
- lt's not because she died.

412
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:22,394
The Beljoxa's Eye was quite clear
about that... in its enigmatic way.

413
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:24,785
lt's because she lives. Again.

414
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:28,828
Buffy's not responsible for that.

415
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:31,592
Oh.

416
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,553
No.

417
00:30:33,636 --> 00:30:37,515
Willow and me and Xander and Tara.

418
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:40,508
We're the ones who brought Buffy back.

419
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:45,351
We're the reason the First is here and the
reason the girls were murdered. lt's our fault.

420
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:49,429
The world would've been better off
if Buffy had just stayed dead.

421
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:03,309
No Bringers.
They'll save us for old snaggletooth.

422
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:06,468
- Where is the Turok-Han?
- Right behind us. Time to split up.

423

Split up? We're splitting up? ls that wise?

424
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:12,747
- Take everyone and find a safe location.
- l know a place.

425
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:15,555
- What are you gonna do?
- Try to slow the Turok down.

426
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:19,470
- Lead him away. Get him to chase me.
- You can't take that thing on yourself.

427
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:21,786
- l'll stay.
- No!

428

Hey, l need that.

429
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:27,792
Willow, Xander, take everyone to
a safe location. Get 'em out of here. Now!

- Some leader.

- Future site of the new public library,

lf l ever get back to work, that is.

Spread out, take positions.

- And don't make a sound.

That's the plan? Spread out?

446
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:14,707
That thing is gonna kill Buffy,
then it's going to come after us.

For all we know, it's killing her right now.

448
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:21,512

Waiting to be picked off.
