1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,169
The project. It escaped.

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:06,050
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

3
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:09,330
The Initiative created this.
They can't stop it, but we will.

4
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:11,369
It's Faith. She's awake.

5
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:15,684
- Are you all right?
- Five by five.

6
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:17,923
Open the box. Surprise!

7
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:22,002
- You sure you're OK?
- Five by five.

8
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,612
We've been looking for this girl
since she broke out of hospital.

9
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:35,253
- What'll happen to her?
- We'll get her checked out.

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:40,407
- If she's stable, she goes to jail, pending trial.
- I just hope she gets some kind of help.

11
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:44,008
The first thing is to keep her
from hurting anybody else.

13
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:59,685
You'll be safe now. We may have
a couple of questions in the morning.

14
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:02,082
- Of course.
- Thank you, both.

15
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:05,609
- I'm glad we finally got the kid.
- She's not a kid.

16
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:08,491
- I just mean that she's very strong.
- Yeah.

17
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,491
This Faith chick? Definitely dangerous.

18
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:23,164
She truly is.

19
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,608
Faith.

20
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,922
Why do you think she's like that?

21
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:33,165
Well, you know. She's a nutjob.

22
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,612
I don't understand what could drive
a person to that kind of behaviour.

23
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,769
How do you know she got drove?

24
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:44,687
- I mean, maybe she likes being that way.
- I'll never believe that.

25
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:46,963
I think she's horribly unhappy.

26
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:51,008
Well, could be things are lookin' up.

27
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:54,563
A little stint in the poky,
show her the error of her ways.

28
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:59,249
I'm sure there's some big old bertha waitin'
to shower her ripe little self with affection.

29
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,210
Buffy.

30
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:05,123
I'm sorry, Mom.

31
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:06,805
It's just

32
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:10,568
when I think about
how she might've hurt you, I just...

33
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,330
I can't stand it.

34
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:20,845
Sorry.

35
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,925
No, I'm just sore from the fight.

36
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:29,205
- I've missed you.
- Cos I haven't visited, right? I knew it.

37
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,444
I know how it is.
You've got so much in your life now.

38
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:38,007
- I'm a busy little beaver. College and all.
- Of course.

39
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,881
But maybe we could
spend some time together soon?

40
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:47,005
Some night when I'm not being
held hostage by a raving psychotic.

41
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:50,801
Count on it.

42
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,004
I'm gonna take a bath.

43
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:33,841
Why, yes, I would be Buffy. May I help you?

44
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:36,969
Buffy.

45
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:42,126
You can't do that. It's wrong.

46
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:46,248
You can't do that because it's naughty.

47
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,369
Because it's wrong.

48
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:51,728
Because it's wrong.

49
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:57,204
You can't do that. It's wrong.
I'll kick your ass. I'm gonna kill you.

50
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:03,407
- Let me go!
- Get me a sedative, now!

51
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:06,053
- Hold her.
- I have to go home. She's with my mother!

52
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,283
- No!
- Just lie still.

53
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,807
- You don't understand.
- Keep holding her.

54
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,691
She's taken my body.

55
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:19,645
- I wonder where she is.
- Who, Faith?

56
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,244
Yeah.

57
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:27,453
I wish she would make a move.
She's making my stomach all acidy.

58
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,683
But you think Buffy can handle her?

59
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:33,489
I think so.

60
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:38,288
But that doesn't mean
Faith won't hurt someone else.

61
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:42,244
Well, you should be safe.
Nobody knows you're here.

62
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,370
I mean, they don't even know I exist, right?

63
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:49,291
I know all about them, but...

64
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:55,485
I mean, that's totally cool.
I mean, it's good. It's better.

65
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:59,771
Tara, it's not like I don't want
my friends to know you. It's just...

66
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:05,201
Well, Buffy's, like, my best friend
and she's really special.

67
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:10,886
And there's this whole bunch of us
and we sort of have this group thing

68
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:13,123
that revolves around the slaying.

69
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:15,852
And I really want you to meet them.

70
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:24,206
But I just kinda like having something
that's just, you know, mine.

71
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:32,047
And I usually don't use so many words
to say stuff that little,

72
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,727
but do you get it at all?

73
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:39,244
I do.

74
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:47,561
I should check in with Giles,
get a situation update.

75
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,088
I am, you know.

76
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,970
What?

77
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,889
Yours.

78
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,084
Not too bad.

79
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,530
Score.

80
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:27,443
..six, four, four, seven.

81
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:30,642
Expiration, 5/01.

82
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:35,804
Yeah.

83
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:39,407
10am's your earliest flight? I'll take it.

84
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,244
What are you doing?

85
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:48,767
Just getting my mail.

86
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:53,085
That was Giles on the other line.
He wanted you to meet your friends there.

87
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,164
Said he had news.

88
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,326
Yeah. I got some time to kill.

89
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:03,012
I'll go see the gang. All my friends.

90
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:07,450
- You don't mind if I steal this?
- Is that the Harlot?

91
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,525
- Yeah.
- That's the same one Faith picked.

92
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:14,004
Burn it.

93
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:26,610
She's coming to.
Man, I want this kid's constitution.

94
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:29,845
Faith.

95
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,401
Move it. I wanna get her in before she's 100°%.

96
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:52,530
By order of the Watcher's Council, you are
being taken into custody until such time...

97
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:54,604
Skip the speech.

98
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:02,812
Let's go.

99
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:12,684
Buffy. Good.

100
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:15,604
The Scooby gang's all here.

101
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:18,127
Willow, Xander and...

102
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:20,645
everybody.

103
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,406
- What's up?
- It's about Faith, not surprisingly.

104
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:26,405
Didn't Joyce tell you?
I already kicked that ass.

105
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:29,087
- I feel a high-five comin' on.
- Where is she?

106
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:32,529
On her way to the big house.
Cops took her off my hands an hour ago.

107
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,964
Poetic justice.

108
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:37,123
How's that?

109
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:40,489
Well, she did all those crimes
and now she's being arrested.

110
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:45,971
I guess that's just regularjustice.
It's cool, anyway.

111
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:50,046
Unless I'm mistaken,
Faith is no longer in police custody.

112
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,764
What are you talking about?

113
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:58,483
The Watcher's Council.
They sent a retrieval team to capture Faith.

114
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:02,803
Well, yeah, cos it worked
so well when Wesley tried it.

115
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:08,727
This is a special operations unit.
They handle the Council's trickierjobs:

116
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:12,362
- smuggling, interrogation, wet works.
- What's wet works?

117
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:15,286
- Scuba-type stuff.
- I thought it was murder.

118
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:20,292
Well, yeah. But there could be
underwater murder, with snorkels.

119
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:25,242
- So they're taking her to England?
- It'll be a long, long time before she returns.

120
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:33,691
I'm sorry. It's just...

121
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:39,321
- I'm happy. Faith is evil.
- Yeah. I hope they throw the book at her.

122
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:44,043
- I'm not sure there is a book for this.
- They could throw other things.

123
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:48,445
- I forgot how much you don't like Faith.
- After what she's done to you?

124
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:52,890
I wish those council guys would let me
have an hour alone in the room with her.

125
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,767
If I was larger and had grenades.

126
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:58,487
I bet I know what Faith would say to that.

127
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:06,008
- So you're saying everything's fine?
- Yes.

128
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:10,644
I'm glad you called us here because that
information can never be conveyed by phone.

129
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,531
- What's up?
- I just thought it was best to convene...

130
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:16,571
I'd never let her hurt you.

131
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:19,486
- I know.
- But if you're keen to go,

132
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:23,805
- please, by all means, go.
- We kinda have a romantic evening planned.

133
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:27,283
We were gonna light a bunch of candles
and have sex near them.

134
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:30,490
- We don't wanna cut into that seven minutes.
- Hey.

135
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:33,041
I believe that's my "hey". Hey!

136
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:37,205
Lighten up. We're outta danger.

137
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,923
- Everything's good.
- We still have Adam to take care of.

138
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:43,208
Yeah.

139
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:44,885
Adam.

140
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:48,409
- What's up with him?
- I wish we knew.

141
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:53,050
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll patrol tonight as long as it takes.

142
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,409
You guys have your fun.
I'll be out there doing my job.

143
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:19,810
You.

144
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:21,485
And you.

145
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:25,852
What? Are you keepin' tabs on me?
You gonna give me a hard time now?

146
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:31,489
- Do I usually give you a hard time?
- Very funny.

147
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:35,366
Well, you don't have to worry
about me drinking.

148
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:38,365
Unless you're here to protect innocent beers.

149
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:45,562
- You're a vampire.
- Was.

150
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:50,131
And as soon as I get this chip
out of my head, I'll be a vampire again.

151
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:55,287
But until then I'm just as helpless as
a kitten up a tree, so why don't you sod off?

152
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,409
OK.

153
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,643
Fine. Throw it in my face.

154
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:03,282
Spike's not a threat any more,
I'll turn my back. He can't hurt me.

155
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:05,170
Spike?

156
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:08,170
Spike.

157
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:12,767
William the Bloody with a chip in his head.
I kinda love this town.

158
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:17,802
God. You know why
I really hate you, Summers?

159
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:21,283
Cos I'm a stuck-up tight-ass
with no sense of fun?

160
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:24,843
Well, yeah. That covers a lot of it.

161
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:30,485
Cos I could do anything and instead I choose
to pout and feel the burden of slayerness?

162
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:33,929
I mean, I could be rich. I could be famous.

163
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,004
I could have anything.

164
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,090
Anyone.

165
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,523
Even you, Spike.

166
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:48,606
I could ride you at a gallop until
your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up.

167
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:51,527
I've got muscles
you've never even dreamed of.

168
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:54,969
I could squeeze you
until you popped like warm champagne

169
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:58,170
and you'd beg me
to hurt you just a little bit more.

170
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:00,847
And you know why I don't?

171
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:08,288
Because it's wrong.

172
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:18,370
I get this chip out, you and me
are gonna have a confrontation.

173
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,009
Count on it.

174
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:36,245
It's too crowded. We gotta hold out for
a few hours, pick up a straggler. Some drunk.

175
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,403
Can't be calling attention to...

176
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:42,164
- ourselves.
- I've been thinking.

177
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:45,689
About vampires.

178
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:49,523
- This is my place.
- Your place.

179
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:51,604
Yes. The sewers.

180
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:56,728
You hide from them, crawl about in their filth,

181
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,804
scavenging like rats.

182
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:01,564
What do you fear?

183
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:04,887
Kill this guy already.

184
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:11,606
You fear the cross, the sun, fire,

185
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,684
and, oh, yes...

186
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:23,926
- I believe decapitation is a problem as well.
- You can have the place.

187
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:27,801
- We don't have to stay here any more.
- You fear death.

188
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:32,125
Being immortal, you fear it more
than those to whom it comes naturally.

189
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,202
Vampires are a paradox.

190
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:39,763
OK. We're a paradox. That's cool.

191
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,890
Demon in a human body.

192
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,325
You walk in both worlds
and belong to neither.

193
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,524
I can relate.

194
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:53,332
Come. We have a lot to talk about.

195
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:03,164
Well, it's awake.

196
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,167
- Who are you?
- Council.

197
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:12,407
We're taking you back to the mother country.
Seems you've been a naughty girl.

198
00:16:13,493 --> 00:16:16,371
Listen to me. You've made a mistake.

199
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,689
I am not Faith.

200
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:25,252
I'm Buffy Summers. Faith performed
some kind of spell. She switched our bodies.

201
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,723
Congratulations. No one's
ever tried that one on me before.

202
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,289
You have to find Faith.

203
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:34,171
Call Giles. Just get him here.

204
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:39,812
Giles doesn't work for the Council any more.
For that matter, neither does Buffy Summers.

205
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:43,727
And what you are, miss, is the package.
I deliver the package.

206
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,844
I don't much care what's inside.

207
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,124
Come on.

208
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,931
He may not care, but I do.

209
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:56,285
The Watcher's Council
used to mean something.

210
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:58,170
You perverted it.

211
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:02,129
You're trash. We should have
killed you while you were asleep.

212
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:22,527
I can't believe you've never been here.
The Bronze is the coolest place in Sunnydale.

213
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:25,286
Of course, there's not a lot of competition.

214
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:28,570
I think the vending machine
at Bergen's came in second.

215
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:31,565
- You used to come here a lot?
- We lived here.

216
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:33,564
Me, Xander,

217
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,450
Buffy?

218
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:42,090
Wow. I didn't think she'd be here.

219
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:46,004
Come on, I want you to meet her.

220
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:49,483
Back off.
You're nothing but a disappointment.

221
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:54,408
- Hey, Buffy.
- Willow and...

222
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:56,404
- Buffy, this is Tara.
- Hi.

223
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,684
So we've never met?

224
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,285
Cool. Just having a thing with names.

225
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:06,161
Tara was in my Wicca group.

226
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:12,252
So, what's up? Patrol a no-go?

227
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:16,487
Got tired. You know, the whole Faith thing.
I let off some steam.

228
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:19,963
Good for you.
You shouldn't work yourself too hard.

229
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,803
That's my philosophy.

230
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,924
Anyone want a soda?

231
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:28,004
Water.

232
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:42,687
So, you guys been hanging out a lot lately?

233
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,046
Yeah. She's... she's really cool.

234
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,972
So Willow's not driving stick any more.

235
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,930
Who would have thought?

236
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:58,609
I guess you never really know someone
until you've been inside their skin.

237
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:01,765
And Oz is out of the picture?

238
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:04,651
I've never seen two people so much in love.

239
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:08,009
She just couldn't get enough of old Oz.

240
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:11,722
She said he w-w-w...

241
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:15,683
W-w-what? You gonna get
that sentence out some time tonight?

242
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,884
Buffy, guy in the corner.

243
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:25,449
Yeah. Good call.

244
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,888
- What?
- Vampire.

245
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,410
It's wicked obvious.

246
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:38,409
So I should slay him.

247
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:40,644
- You want help?
- Nah, I got it.

248
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:10,964
You'll live.

249
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:15,606
- He was so strong.
- Yeah, well, he's gone now.

250
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,844
Thank you.

251
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,608
Thank you.

252
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,924
Yeah. It's cool.

253
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:39,684
Everything poofed?

254
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,207
All is well in the world.

255
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:45,330
Tara's not feeling well.
I'm gonna walk her home.

256
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:49,890
Yeah. You give her whatever she needs.

257
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:53,568
Are you gonna be in later,
or are you going over to Riley's?

258
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:07,644
This'll bloody keep you quiet.

259
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:18,489
How about this?
I'll be quiet and you can scream.

260
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:26,091
Now, you unchain me very slowly
and politely, or I kill this guy.

261
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:32,809
When we go on ajob we always put
our affairs in order first, in case of accident.

262
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:37,444
- Collins!
- Sorry, Smithy.

263
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:45,290
- She's starting to bother me.
- Getting her across the border'll be trouble.

264
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:48,888
If the Council can even get us passage.
I'll call 'em.

265
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:51,441
It's time for a contingency plan.

266
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,724
Hi, baby.

267
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,642
I'm sorry you're feeling all bleghy.

268
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:25,652
But we'll get together with Buffy another
time soon. I think you'll really like her.

269
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,924
She's not your friend.

270
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:33,005
I may have overestimated
the "you liking her" factor.

271
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:35,084
No, no. I mean, I don't...

272
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:39,210
I don't think she's her.

273
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:46,328
- You lost me.
- Well, a person's energy has a flow, a unity.

274
00:22:47,773 --> 00:22:50,890
Buffy's was fragmented.

275
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:54,852
It grated like something forced in
where it doesn't belong.

276
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:58,323
Plus, she was kind of mean.

277
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:04,048
So you think Buffy's not herself?
Like she's been possessed or something?

278
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:08,404
- I'm not sure.
- You didn't sense a hyena energy, did you?

279
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:11,690
Because hyena possession
is just unpleasant.

280
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:17,043
- Do you have anything of hers?
- Of Buffy's?

281
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,603
This ring.

282
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:23,082
I think there's a way we can...

283
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,201
The passage to the Nether Realm.

284
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:34,366
There's a ritual. If you can find Buffy there,
you should be able to see.

285
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,004
If it'll help her.

286
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,330
What?

287
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:44,086
The Nether Realm exists
beyond the physical world.

288
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:49,372
Accessing it is kind of like
astral projection. It's very intense.

289
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:53,525
I'd have to be your anchor,
keep you on this plane.

290
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:57,610
- I trust you.
- It's not like anything that we've ever...

291
00:23:57,693 --> 00:23:59,684
I trust you.

292
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,328
You miss me?

293
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:08,203
I did, actually. Everything's OK?

294
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,764
Everything's great.

295
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:16,085
- What about Faith?
- Faith has won a fabulous trip to England

296
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:20,007
and I got the consolation prize, which is you.

297
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:24,565
So I don't have to worry
about Faith showing up?

298
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:28,043
Though I have to admit,
I was kind of curious to meet her.

299
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:34,931
- Or I was until about 30 seconds ago.
- You wouldn't have liked Faith.

300
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:37,891
She's not proper and joyless,
like a girl should be.

301
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:41,569
She has a tendency
to give in to her animal instincts.

302
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,405
- Door's open.
- So?

303
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:53,008
So my fantasies don't include
a bunch of marines starin' at me.

304
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:55,561
Maybe they could learn something.

305
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:04,969
- You're hurt?
- Not that bad, actually.

306
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:10,685
The drugs the professor gave me really did
make me stronger. I'm healin' pretty quick.

307
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:12,968
Maybe we should take you for a test drive.

308
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,209
I wouldn't say no.

309
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:21,449
So, how do you want me?

310
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:27,690
- How do I...?
- Yeah. What d'you wanna do with this body?

311
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:32,005
What nasty little desire
have you been itching to try out?

312
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:34,288
Am I a bad girl?

313
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:36,409
D'you wanna hurt me?

314
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:41,008
What are we playin' at here?

315
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:44,644
I'm Buffy.

316
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,724
OK. Then I'll be Riley.

317
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:53,284
- Well, if you don't wanna play...
- Right. I don't wanna play.

318
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:24,168
The sightless sea

319
00:26:24,253 --> 00:26:27,848
Ayala flows through the river in me

320
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:31,562
The inward eye, the sightless sea

321
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:35,282
Ayala flows through the river in me

322
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:38,604
The inward eye, the sightless sea

323
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:41,924
Ayala flows through the river in me

324
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:41,164
I love you.

325
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,444
Get off.

326
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:50,932
No.

327
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:53,083
No. No. Get off.

328
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,050
No. Off me.

329
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,725
- Get off.
- Buffy?

330
00:27:56,813 --> 00:27:58,804
No. No. Get...

331
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:05,884
Buffy, what?

332
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,521
What's wrong?

333
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:12,889
Who are you? What do you want from her?

334
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,724
Should I not have...?

335
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:19,804
This is meaningless.

336
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:26,004
You're shaking.

337
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,204
What happened?

338
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,970
Nothing.

339
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:44,890
Nothing.

340
00:28:54,773 --> 00:28:57,162
I have a gift no man has,

341
00:28:58,173 --> 00:29:00,687
no demon has ever had.

342
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:03,164
I know why I'm here.

343
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,524
I was created to kill.

344
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:09,292
To extinguish life wherever I find it.

345
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,728
And I have accepted that responsibility.

346
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:16,725
You have lived in fear and desperation
because you didn't have that gift,

347
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:19,008
but it's time to face your fear.

348
00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:23,208
Tell us what to do.

349
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:26,802
You are here to be my first.

350
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,728
To let them know that I am coming.

351
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:35,006
- We're ready.
- Then ask yourself: what is it?

352
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:39,243
More than man. More than anything else.

353
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:42,367
What is the thing you fear?

354
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:07,608
Hope you left him alive.

355
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:11,484
- What?
- Boy should be on the mend.

356
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:15,566
- I don't see you lettin' him get much rest.
- Stay out of other people's lives.

357
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:18,372
We've got a mission.
When Riley could think for himself...

358
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:22,332
A mission? I've been fighting demons
since before you could shave.

359
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,370
Yeah, you're a killer.

360
00:30:24,893 --> 00:30:27,282
I am not a killer.

361
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,523
I am the Slayer.

362
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:34,288
- You don't know the first thing about me.
- You really care what I think?

363
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:39,129
No.

364
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,204
I don't care.

365
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,888
God, I don't care.

366
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:55,968
They can't get us passage.
They've ordered the kill.

367
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:58,044
- Torch the place?
- Get the gas.

368
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,487
She could've killed me. She didn't.

369
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,925
Lucky you.

370
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:18,210
Weatherby!

371
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:24,886
Keys, keys.

372
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,524
Stop her, you ponce.

373
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:37,204
OK. I'm good at this.

374
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:40,852
Drive.

375
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:04,368
OK, there you go.

376
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:06,444
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

377
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:13,972
- Giles!
- God!

378
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:15,486
Don't move.

379
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:19,726
OK, Giles, you have
to listen to me very carefully.

380
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:22,205
- I'm not Faith.
- Really?

381
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:24,602
- Really.
- Cos the resemblance is striking.

382
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:28,612
I know. Giles, you just have to...
Stop inching. You were inching.

383
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:32,329
- Look, I know what you're going to say and...
- I'm Buffy.

384
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,843
OK, I didn't know what you were
going to say, but you're still crazy.

385
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:40,690
Faith switched. I mean, she had some device.
She switched our bodies.

386
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:45,048
Giles, I swear.

387
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,771
It's me.

388
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:51,244
If you are Buffy,

389
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:56,765
you'll let me tie you up, without killing me,

390
00:32:56,853 --> 00:32:59,811
until we find out
whether you're telling the truth.

391
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:04,291
Giles, Faith has taken my body and, for
all I know, she's taken it to Mexico by now.

392
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:06,523
I don't have time for bondage fun.

393
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:11,371
Ask me a question. Ask me anything.

394
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:15,529
- Who's President?
- We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion.

395
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,727
- Yes. All right.
- This is...

396
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:21,771
Giles, you turned into a demon
and I knew it was you.

397
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:25,562
Can't you just look in my eyes
and be all intuitive?

398
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:30,286
- How did I turn into a demon?
- Cos of Ethan Rayne.

399
00:33:30,693 --> 00:33:32,729
And you have a girlfriend named Olivia.

400
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:37,728
And you haven't had ajob since we blew up
the school, which is valid, lifestyle-wise.

401
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:40,930
I mean, it's not like
you're a slacker type, but...

402
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:46,005
When I had psychic power I heard Mom
think you were like a stevedore during sex.

403
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:48,766
- Do you want me to continue?
- Actually, I beg you to stop.

404
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:53,165
- What's a stevedore?
- All right. I need you to explain everything.

405
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:55,562
And I will, after we get Faith.

406
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:57,609
- Giles!
- Will.

407
00:33:57,693 --> 00:34:00,526
- Oh, my God.
- Willow, wait. You don't understand.

408
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:04,288
You're Buffy. You and Faith
switched bodies through a Katra spell.

409
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:06,569
She understands it better than I do.

410
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:08,723
- How did you...?
- Tara.

411
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,726
- Tara, this is Buffy. Only really, this time.
- Hi.

412
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:15,247
- Tara's a powerful witch.
- Not really.

413
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,927
No, really. She knew
right away you weren't you.

414
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:23,646
So we connected with the Nether Realms to
find out what happened and we conjured this.

415
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:28,161
- What is...?
- It's a Katra.

416
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:30,084
Or the home-conjured version.

417
00:34:30,373 --> 00:34:34,730
It should switch you back,
if you can get ahold of Faith.

418
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,284
Thank God.

419
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:40,404
I'll get it.

420
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,603
- Hello.
- Do you know where Faith is?

421
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:47,932
Yes. Buffy's here with me. Actually, she's...

422
00:34:48,493 --> 00:34:50,131
All right.

423
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:54,047
Xander. Apparently,
there's a report on the television.

424
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,921
..and barricaded themselves
in the church with 20 parishioners.

425
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:04,049
One of the few who escaped described
the three men as disfigured, almost inhuman.

426
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:07,489
So far one escapee
has since died of severe neck wounds.

427
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:12,011
There is no report on the condition
of the parishioners still inside,

428
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:17,770
but their assailants have vowed to kill all
of them if police attempt to storm the church.

429
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,484
It's hard to believe.

430
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:28,165
I've been avoiding this place
for so many years and it's nothing.

431
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:30,603
It's nice.

432
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:34,732
It's got the pretty windows, the pillars,

433
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,650
lots of folks to eat.

434
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:42,525
Where's the thing I was so afraid of?

435
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,364
You know, the Lord?

436
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:49,530
He was supposed to be here.
He gave us this address.

437
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:55,925
Well, we'll just have
to start killing off his people.

438
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:57,890
See if he shows up.

439
00:36:02,253 --> 00:36:06,451
- What did he say?
- He said I should defer command to you.

440
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:09,684
Wait till the reserves arrive.
This is a military situation.

441
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:14,005
- What, they got bombs in there?
- Your men aren't prepared to deal with them.

442
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,651
Buffy.

443
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:26,372
- How many are in there?
- We think there's three.

444
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:28,364
- I can do three.
- Not alone.

445
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:31,251
Wait for the troops to get here.
They're mobilising.

446
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:35,167
- How did you respond so fast?
- I didn't. I was just late for church.

447
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:39,405
When the troops get here
send them in, but I'm going.

448
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:43,281
- I don't want you risking...
- Don't tell me what to do.

449
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:47,729
I'm Buffy. I have to do this.

450
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,764
Then I'm coming with.

451
00:36:54,293 --> 00:36:56,284
I can't use you.

452
00:36:57,693 --> 00:37:01,891
Someone comes out, you get 'em to safety,
unless they've got fangs.

453
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:18,528
I told the cops, they send anyone in,
I start the whole massacre thing.

454
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:21,964
Well, I'm not the cops.

455
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:24,248
I just come to pray.

456
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:28,044
Now's a good time to start.

457
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:32,082
You're not gonna kill these people.

458
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:37,647
- Why not?
- Because it's wrong.

459
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:47,570
You're the Slayer.

460
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,049
The one and only.

461
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:02,205
- You people, get outta here.
- We've gotta get inside.

462
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:08,323
- The police are handling this. Back off now.
- But we can't. You don't understand.

463
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:11,928
- You have to clear the area.
- Damn it, man! We have to get inside!

464
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:14,004
Our...

465
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:19,167
Our families are in there.
Our mothers, and tiny, tiny babies.

466
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,522
You think we're afraid of you?

467
00:38:23,493 --> 00:38:25,961
We're not afraid of anything any more.

468
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:30,331
Then let all these people go,
and all three of you can take me on.

469
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:32,131
I got a better idea.

470
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,522
- Forgot your coat.
- Riley.

471
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,967
It's OK, miss. Get yourself out of harm's way.

472
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:14,362
Riley, it's me.

473
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:18,689
- Never mind. How many are in there?
- Well...

474
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,762
Who are you?

475
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,253
I have strength you couldn't dream of.

476
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:28,290
Adam has shown me the way
and there is nothing...

477
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:53,330
- You can't win this.
- Shut up. D'you think I'm afraid of you?

478
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:56,450
You're nothing.

479
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:58,888
Disgusting, murderous bitch.

480
00:39:58,973 --> 00:40:00,804
You're nothing.

481
00:40:02,493 --> 00:40:04,927
You're disgusting.

482
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:33,448
She's gone.

483
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:35,524
Not a trace.

484
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:40,043
Giles said the council guys
have cleared out, too.

485
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,324
I don't understand.

486
00:40:44,413 --> 00:40:47,371
How could she have...?
I mean, how's it possible?

487
00:40:48,653 --> 00:40:50,245
Magic.

488
00:40:51,653 --> 00:40:54,850
I knew there was something.
I should've picked up on it.

489
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:56,924
I should've just...

490
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:07,842
You slept with her.

491
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:15,082
I slept with you.

492
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:25,123
Man, would I like to get my hands on her.

493
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:27,283
Not in a sex way.

494
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:33,242
- I don't think she's coming back.
- I guess she's had her fun.

495
00:41:36,173 --> 00:41:37,970
Yeah.

496
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:40,650
Fun.

497
