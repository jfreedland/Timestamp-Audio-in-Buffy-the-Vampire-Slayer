1
00:00:01,157 --> 00:00:02,689
You are the Slayer.

2
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:04,890
To each generation a Slayer is born.

3
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:07,391
One girl in all the world.
The Chosen One.

4
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:09,959
- Who's that?
- That must be Angel.

5
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:12,398
Last season, on Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

6
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,353
Vampire in love with the Slayer?

7
00:00:17,354 --> 00:00:18,999
It's rather poetic.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,774
And in this time shall come the Anointed.

9
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:26,807
Buffy will face the Master...
and she will die.

10
00:00:28,882 --> 00:00:33,752
She's not breathing. She's dead.

11
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:36,922
Breathe! Come on!

12
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:40,829
- You're dead!
- I may be dead, but I'm still pretty.

13
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:01,682
OK, um...

14
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:05,858
- It's your turn.
- OK. Uh...

15
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:11,293
"In the few hours that we had together,
we loved a lifetime's worth."

16
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:13,479
- Terminator,
- Good! Right.

17
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:15,401
OK, I got one.

18
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:18,613
- "It's a madhouse! A mad..."
- Planet of the Apes,

19
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:22,367
- Can I finish, please?
- Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

20
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:24,744
house!."

21
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:29,707
Planet of the Apes.
OK, good. Me. Uh...

22
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:32,836
Well?

23
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:35,306
I'm thinking.

24
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:37,298
"Use the Force, Luke."

25
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,076
Do I even have to
dignify that with a guess?

26
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:42,179
I couldn't think of anything.

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,875
- It's a dumb game anyway.
- What else d'you wanna do?

28
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,599
We already played rock, paper, scissors.
My hand's cramped up.

29
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:51,119
Well, yes, if you're always "scissors",
of course, your tendons...

30
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:54,062
I just gotta say this has been
the most boring summer ever.

31
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,627
Yeah, but on the plus side,
no monsters or stuff.

32
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:59,615
I'm just so restless!

33
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:02,323
I'm actually looking forward
to school starting up again.

34
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:04,472
Yeah, and that
wouldn't have anything to do

35
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:07,889
with a certain girl we both know,
who is a vampire slayer.

36
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:09,706
Please! I'm so over her.

37
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,945
Did she, uh, mention
when she might be gettin' back?

38
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:16,370
- About which I do not care.
- I haven't heard from her.

39
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:19,716
I got a couple of postcards when
she went to LA, but they're like nothing.

40
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:23,295
Well, she's probably with her dad
havin' a good time.

41
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,913
- And you don't care?
- Well, OK. There might be some interest.

42
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm a man. I have
certain desires, certain needs.

43
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:32,661
I-I don't wanna know.

44
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,533
I got a movie for ya.

45
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:36,533
- Xander!
- You're Amish.

46
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:41,137
You can't fight back 'cause you're Amish.
I mock you with my ice cream, Amish guy.

47
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:42,498
Witness.

48
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:45,380
- My nose is cold.
- Let me get that for ya.

49
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,950
Xander!

50
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:49,796
Sorry, I can't help myself.
Your nose looks so tasty.

51
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,718
Willow, go.

52
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:35,731
Hi, guys.

53
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,013
Miss me?

54
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:36,261
<b>"When She Was Bad"</b>

55
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:37,896
- Buffy!
- Hey!

56
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:39,981
Hey!

57
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:42,150
Hey, Will.

58
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:45,347
Man, your timing really doesn't suck.

59
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:48,648
- When d'you get back?
- Uh, just now. Dad drove me down.

60
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:51,784
And I figured you two losers
would be getting into some kind of trouble.

61
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:55,836
I think we had the upper hand...
in a subtle way.

62
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:58,358
Does either of you even have a cross?
Very sloppy.

63
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,629
Well, it's been a slow summer.
I mean, it's the first vampire we've seen

64
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:05,620
- since you killed the Master.
- It's like they knew I was coming back.

65
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:08,568
So what about you? How was
your summer? Did you slay anything?

66
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:13,660
No. Just hung out, partied some,
shopping was also a major theme.

67
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:15,573
Oh, you haven't lost your touch.
That vampire...

68
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:18,478
I did kinda whale on him, didn't I?

69
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:20,980
I like your hair.

70
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:23,274
So, how did you guys fare?
Did you have any fun without me?

71
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:24,734
- Yes.
- No.

72
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:29,211
Our summer was yawn-worthy. Our
biggest excitement was burying the Master.

73
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,242
That's right, you missed it.
Right out by that tree.

74
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:36,287
Giles buried the bones and we poured
holy water and we got to wear robes.

75
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:38,814
Very intense. You shoulda been.

76
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:41,554
Have you seen Giles?

77
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:44,128
Why would I do that?
I'll see him at school.

78
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:47,277
Man, I'm really glad you're back.

79
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:50,569
Me too.

80
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:58,402
- OK, then. This is the last of it.
- More clothes?

81
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:01,972
- Oh, do shoes count as clothes?
- How much shopping did you let her do?

82
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:06,562
Oh, I just thought I was saving you from
the big back-to-school clothing nightmare.

83
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:10,105
My nightmares with Buffy in school
have nothing to do with clothes.

84
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,782
Did she manage to
stay out of trouble in LA?

85
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,410
She did, yeah.

86
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:19,163
She was... you know... great.

87
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:21,417
But?

88
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:25,129
She was just, I don't know, um...

89
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,671
Distant?

90
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:31,667
Not brooding or sulking, just...
There was no connection.

91
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:36,461
The more time we spent together, the more
I felt like she was nowhere to be seen.

92
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,089
Hence the shoes?

93
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:42,837
I may have overcompensated a little bit.

94
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:46,318
It's so strange. You know,
at least when she was burning stuff down

95
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:50,445
- I knew what to say.
- Welcome to my world.

96
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,083
I haven't been able to get through
to her for so long.

97
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,659
I'll just be happy if
she makes it through the school year.

98
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:04,583
It was a nightmare. A total nightmare.

99
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:07,293
I mean, they promised me
they'd take me to St Croix,

100
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:10,381
and then they just decide
to go to Tuscany.

101
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,135
Art and buildings? I was totally beachless
for a month and a half.

102
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,027
No one has suffered like I have suffered.

103
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:20,717
Of course, I think
that kind of adversity builds character.

104
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:23,945
Well, then I thought,
I already have a lot of character.

105
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,022
Is it possible to have too much character?

106
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:29,460
The first day back. It always gets me.

107
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:31,498
- Yes.
- I mean, it's incredible.

108
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:35,081
One day the campus is
completely bare, empty.

109
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:38,800
The next,
there are children everywhere.

110
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,644
Like locusts, crawling around,
mindlessly bent on feeding and mating,...

111
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:51,047
destroying everything in sight in their
relentless, pointless desire to exist.

112
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:53,350
I do enjoy these pep talks.

113
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:56,803
Have you ever considered,
given your abhorrence of children,

114
00:07:56,838 --> 00:08:00,431
school's principal was not,
perhaps, your true vocation?

115
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:05,436
Somebody's gotta keep an eye on them.
They're a bunch of hormonal time bombs.

116
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:11,493
Every time a pretty girl walks by,
every boy turns into a gibbering fool.

117
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:14,195
- Ms Calendar.
- Mr. Giles.

118
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,030
Well, I... um...

119
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:18,241
Hello.

120
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:22,754
You see the way these kids
gaze at each other... all moony?

121
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,831
- It's good to see you.
- Yes.

122
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:27,333
Think they're thinking about learning?

123
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:30,546
Were you headed to the faculty room?

124
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,881
Sounds like fun.

125
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:36,525
I try and tell them about
the important things in life.

126
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,424
Discipline, responsibility, punctuality.

127
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:43,682
I might as well be talkin' to myself.

128
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:49,130
- How was your summer?
- Extreme.

129
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:50,888
I did "Burning Man" in Black Rock.

130
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,410
Ohhh, such a great festival.
You should've been there.

131
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:58,788
They had drum rituals, mobile sculptures,
raves, naked mud dances.

132
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:01,743
You would have just...
hated it with a fiery passion.

133
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:05,496
I can't imagine finding any redeeming...

134
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:06,789
Naked?

135
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:10,047
And you probably spent all summer
with your nose in a book.

136
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,915
Yes. I suppose you'd consider that
frightfully dull.

137
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,408
Depends on the book.

138
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:19,552
- Giles!
- Yo, G-Man! What's up?

139
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:22,139
Nice to see you.
And don't ever call me that.

140
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:23,014
Hi, kids.

141
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:25,330
- Hey.
- Hi.

142
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:30,219
- How are you?
- Alive and kicking.

143
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:32,728
Buffy killed a vampire last night.

144
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,109
I think you can get a little more volume
if you speak from the diaphragm.

145
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,964
- Sorry.
- We've got vampires?

146
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:42,241
- I thought the Hellmouth was closed.
- It's-it's closed, but not gone.

147
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:45,537
The mystical energy that emanates from it
is still concentrated in this area.

148
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:48,365
Which means we're still
the undead's favorite party town.

149
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,541
I wonder if they're here
for any purpose particularly.

150
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:53,470
You're the Watcher. I just work here.

151
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,547
Yes, I must consult my books.

152
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,966
Oh, eight minutes and 33 seconds. Pay up.

153
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:02,785
I called ten minutes before you'd consult
your books about something. Thank you.

154
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:05,799
We'd better get to class.

155
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:08,585
Oh, Buffy, uh...

156
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,278
I realize you've only just returned,
but when you're ready

157
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,315
I-I think we should
start your training again.

158
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,343
I'm ready. I'll see you after school.

159
00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:19,850
Well, I-I-I understand
if, if you want a few days to...

160
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,140
I'm ready.

161
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:05,491
Buffy, that's enough.

162
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:08,057
Buffy!

163
00:11:11,748 --> 00:11:15,226
- Safe to say you've stayed in shape.
- I'm ready.

164
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:17,975
Whatever they've got
coming next, I'm ready.

165
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:21,457
Yeah.

166
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:27,805
We have been put down, kinsmen.

167
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,308
We have lost our way.

168
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:33,436
We have lost the night.

169
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:36,790
But despair is for the living.

170
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:40,135
Where they are weak, we will be strong.

171
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,446
Where they weep, we rejoice.

172
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:45,423
Where they bleed...

173
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,106

174
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:51,579
Within three days a new hope will arise.

175
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:55,959
We will put our faith in him.

176
00:11:55,994 --> 00:12:00,903
He will show us the way.

177
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:12,642
Buffy!

178
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:16,229
- Buffy?
- Fine. I'm fine.

179
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:20,558
Good. It's good that you're fine.

180
00:12:20,593 --> 00:12:23,244
- What were you thinking about?
- Nothing.

181
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,799
Oh, come on, you can tell us.
We're your bosom friends.

182
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,666

183
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,211

184
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:32,571
I wasn't thinking anything. Really.

185
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:37,288
- What did you do last night?
- Slept. I had weird dreams.

186
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,167
Dreams are meaningful.

187
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:42,881
Tsh! Tell me about it.
The other night I dreamt that Xander...

188
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:47,056
Uh, I-it wasn't Xander.
I-in fact it wasn't me.

189
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:48,611
It was a friend's dream and...

190
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:51,810
- She doesn't remember it.
- I bet she doesn't.

191
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:53,454

192
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,389
Giles.

193
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:56,828
What is it? You look worried.

194
00:12:56,863 --> 00:13:00,056
This... vampire activity.
I think I know what they're up to.

195
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:03,610
- Well, we'll deal with it.
- I hope it's that simple.

196
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:05,904
It is not to worry. Trust me.

197
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:08,754
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I've killed you once.

198
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,117
It shouldn't be
too difficult to do it again.

199
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:12,410
What?

200
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:53,910
Hello.

201
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:57,226
Mind if I come in?

202
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:59,249
Be my guest.

203
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:03,795
How are you?

204
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:06,422
Peachy.

205
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:11,083
So, is this a social call?

206
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,180
It is kinda late...
Or, well, it is for me, anyway.

207
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:16,182
What is it for you, lunch hour?

208
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,685
It's not a social call.

209
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,003
Ah, so let me guess.
That means grave danger.

210
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,992
Gosh, it's good to be home.

211
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm sorry. I wish I had better news.

212
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:31,822
So, some of your cousins are in town

213
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:34,851
for a family barbecue,
and we're all on the menu.

214
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,713
The Anointed One.

215
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:41,107
He's been gathering forces
somewhere in town. I'm not sure why.

216
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:43,490
Guess I'll find out soon enough, huh?

217
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:48,089
- You don't sound too concerned.
- I can handle myself.

218
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:51,679
Besides,
I could use a little action anyway.

219
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:56,122
Don't underestimate the Anointed One
just because he looks like a child.

220
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:58,725
He has power over the rest of them.

221
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,530
They'll do anything for him.

222
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,858

223

was it having to do with kissing?

242
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,901
Willow, grow up.
Not everything is about kissing.

243
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,574
Yeah, some stuff's about groping.

244
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:38,210
- It wasn't about groping?
- OK, hormones on parade here?

245

gonna be at the Bronze tonight?

251

- Cibo Matto! They're playing?
- No, they're gonna be clog-dancing.

Cibo Matto can clog-dance?

253

- Oh, sarcasm. Right.
- We should attend, no?

254

Oh, look. It's the Three Musketeers.

255
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:08,713
- Was that an insult?
- Kinda lacked punch.

256
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:10,912
The Three Musketeers were cool.

257
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,860
- I see your point.
- I'd've gone with "Stooges".

258
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:16,371
Well, I just meant that you guys
always hang out together.

259
00:17:16,406 --> 00:17:18,631

fight any demons this summer?

260

Uh, yes! Our own personal demons.

261
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:26,486
- Such as lust and thrift.
- I would have to go with "Stooges" also.

I'm talking about

No. It's, see, we can't mention that stuff
in front of other people,

our little adventure all summer, have you?

270
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:49,461
Are you nuts?

271
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:53,133
You think I would tell people
that I spent the whole evening with you?

272
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:57,608
Besides, it was all so creepy.
That Master guy, all the screaming.

273
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,489
I don't even like to think about it.

274

So, your secret's safe with me.

275

Well, that works out great.

276

and I won't tell anyone you're a moron.

00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:12,478

- A little too good.

00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:08,733
As defending champion, you nervous?

342
00:24:08,768 --> 00:24:11,094
I can hold my own.

343
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:13,698
You know, we've never really been close,

344
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:17,450
which is nice 'cause
I don't really like you that much, but...

345
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:19,689
you have, on occasion,
saved the world and stuff,

346
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,355
so I'm gonna... do you a favor.

347
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:27,069
- And this great favor is?
- I'm gonna give you some advice.

348
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:29,272
- Get over it.
- Excuse me?

349
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:32,033
Whatever's causing
the Joan Collins 'tude,

350
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,336
deal with it.

351
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,942
Embrace the pain,
spank your inner moppet,

352
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:38,751
whatever, but get over it.

353
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:42,810
'Cause pretty soon you're not even gonna
have the loser friends you've got now.

354
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:46,202
I think it's about time
you start minding your own business.

355
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:49,201
It's long past.

356
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,739
Nighty-night.

357
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,056
I'll just see if
Angel feels like dancing.

358
00:25:24,434 --> 00:25:27,077
Ms... Ms Calendar?

359
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:31,014
Oh, God! Ms Calendar!

360
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:16,686
- She's possessed.
- Possessed?

361
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:19,914
That's the only explanation
that makes any sense.

362
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:22,826
You should have seen her last night.
That wasn't Buffy.

363
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:27,442
Are we overlooking the idea
that she may be very attracted to me?

364
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:31,050
She's possessed.

365
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:33,778
- Possessed by what?
- Uh, a possessing thing.

366
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:36,381
- That narrows it down.
- You're the expert.

367
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,595
Hey, maybe when
the Master killed her, some...

368
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,712
mystical bad-guy
transference thing happened.

369
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:45,274
That's what it was! I mean, why else
would she be acting as such a B-I-T-C-H?

370
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:48,993
Willow, we're all a little too old
to be spelling things out.

371
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:50,832
A bitca?

372
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:52,063
Yes...

373
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:54,216
I suggest that...

374
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:59,017
the explanation for her behavior
may be something more... more mundane.

375
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,908
She may simply have what
you Americans refer to as "issues".

376
00:27:03,943 --> 00:27:07,662
Her experience with the Master
must have been extremely traumatic.

377
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:11,770
She was, for at least a few minutes,
technically dead.

378
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:14,651
I-I don't think she's dealt with that
on a conscious level.

379
00:27:14,686 --> 00:27:16,468
She's convinced herself
that she's invulnerable...

380
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:18,157
for the very reason that she feels...

381
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:21,115
That's a very interesting point
about trout, you just brought up now.

382
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:27,378
Trout? Trout!
Yes, trout... is a fish.

383
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:30,912
- Good morning. Did you sleep well?
- Like a rock.

384
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:33,376
Master's gone.

385
00:27:33,411 --> 00:27:35,148
- I'm sorry?
- The Master.

386
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,594
I went by his grave last night
and they have a vacancy.

387
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:40,155
Good God!

388
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:42,369
What would somebody want
with Master bones?

389
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:45,200
A trophy? A horrible conversation piece?

390
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:48,551
They're gonna bring him back.

391
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:52,589
They're gonna bring the Master
back to life, and I seem to recall

392
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,584
you telling me he was history.

393
00:27:54,619 --> 00:28:00,050
Buffy, I-I've never heard of
a revivification ritual being successful.

394
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:03,601
But you've heard of them?!
Thanks for the warning.

395
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:06,693
- Well, Buffy, Giles did bury him in...
- Look, this is Slayer stuff, OK?

396
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,497
Could we have just a little less
from the civilians, please?

397
00:28:08,498 --> 00:28:12,479
- OK, that's just about enough!
- I believe some of us have class.

398
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:14,604
And some of us have jobs.

399
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,928
Y-yes, well, I'll, uh, I'll see you all,
uh, in the library. Later.

400
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:21,938
- We'll continue this discussion.
- About trout.

401
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:33,663
There are some things I can just smell.
It's like a sixth sense.

402
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:36,546
No, actually, that would be
one of the five.

403
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:41,855
That Summers girl.
I smell trouble, I smell expulsion,

404
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:45,260
and just the faintest aroma of jail.

405
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:47,407
Before you throw away the key,
you might consider giving her

406
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:50,890
the benefit of the doubt.
She may surprise you.

407
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:54,049
You really have faith
in those kids, don't you?

408
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:56,102
Yes, I do.

409
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:59,187
Weird.

410
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:06,942
All right, I've got something.
It's... Latin, so bear with me.

411
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:12,547
To revive the vampire,
they need his bones - which they have -

412
00:29:12,787 --> 00:29:18,231
and the blood - this is very unclear -
of the closest person...

413
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:22,052
- Someone connected to the vampire.
- That'd be me.

414
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:26,126
- Perhaps.
- We were close.

415
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:29,470
We killed each other.
It really promotes togetherness.

416
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,143
Well, is there anything on
when the ceremony might take... Whoa!

417
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,822
This is Cordelia's.

418
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,068
"Come to the Bronze before it opens,
or we make her a meal."

419
00:29:44,103 --> 00:29:47,197
They're gonna cook her dinner?

420
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:50,525
- I'll pretend I didn't say that.
- What do we do?

421
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,252
I go to the Bronze and save the day.

422
00:29:52,253 --> 00:29:53,253
- I don't like this.
- Nor I.

423
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:56,578
- Yeah? Well, you guys aren't going.
- What do you mean?

424
00:29:56,613 --> 00:30:01,275
I can't do it any more. I can't look after
the three of you guys while I'm fighting.

425
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,714
- Well, what about the rest of the note?
- What rest of the note?

426
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:07,318
The part that says "PS, this is a trap"?

427
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,619
You'll be playing
straight into their hands.

428
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:11,716
- I can handle this.
- Stop saying that!

429
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:16,103
- God! What's wrong with you?
- Cordelia may be dead.

430
00:30:17,227 --> 00:30:19,987
This is my fight.

431
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:38,874
You know, being stalked
isn't really a big turn-on for girls.

432
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:41,845
You need help.
Someone to watch your back.

433
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,781
- Sure you don't mean my neck?
- Why are you ridin' me?

434
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:51,261
Because I don't trust you.
You're a vampire.

435
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:56,317
Oh, I'm sorry, was that an offensive term?
Should I say "undead American"?

436
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:00,555
You have to trust someone.
You can't do this alone.

437
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:05,669
- I trust me.
- You're not as strong as you think.

438
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:09,272
Think you can take me?

439
00:31:09,404 --> 00:31:11,089
What?

440
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:15,034
Oh, come on. I mean,
you must have thought about it.

441
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:17,613
What would happen
if it ever came down to a fight?

442
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:21,191
You vampire, me the Slayer.
I mean, you must have wondered.

443
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:24,377
Well, why don't we find out?

444
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:28,338
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- Come on.

445
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:32,703
Kick my ass.

446
00:31:35,054 --> 00:31:38,455
Don't you have somewhere to be?

447
00:31:39,434 --> 00:31:43,802
- I do.
- Well, you're wastin' time.

448
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:47,359
Just stay out of my way.

449
00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:49,994
Happy to oblige.

450
00:32:19,474 --> 00:32:22,469
That's not Cordelia.

451
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,484
Cordelia couldn't make it.

452
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,706
- Where is she?
- I'm not supposed to tell.

453
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:35,740
I don't like this.

454
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:38,768
- Don't like what?
- There's the bait.

455
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:41,432
Where's the hook?

456
00:32:45,685 --> 00:32:49,070
You're right.
Why would they send just one?

457
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:52,340
I still think we should've gone with her.

458
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,838
Buffy's about to lose it. I think we should
be trying to reach minimum safe distance.

459
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:58,321
Xander, you know it's a trap!

460
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:04,705
The Latin is translated from
the Sumerian, and rather badly.

461
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,441
"Closest" to the Master, actually
translates as "nearest", physically.

462
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:12,911
The person or persons who were with him...

463
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:16,800
when he...

464
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:20,703
It is a trap.

465
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,811
It just isn't for her.

466
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,878
Watch her.
Don't kill her unless you have to.

467
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:32,380
Buffy, what's going on?

468
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:34,669
I'll be back.

469
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:01,576
Xander!

470
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,139
- What happened?
- Vampires.

471
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:07,851
The ones you could handle yourself.

472
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,931
- Where are the others?
- I don't know.

473
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:14,533
I don't know what your problem is,
what your issues are,...

474
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:17,387
but as of now I officially don't care.

475
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:21,953
If you'd worked with us for five seconds,
you could've stopped this.

476
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:28,061
W-we just have to think.
Where would they have taken them?

477
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:33,691
If they hurt Willow, I'll kill you.

478
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:37,739
Why did they take them and not you?

479
00:34:40,573 --> 00:34:43,427
Giles said the ritual was, um...

480
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:48,081
They needed people who were close to
the Master, physically close when he...

481
00:34:48,116 --> 00:34:51,311
The ones who were
with the Master when he died.

482
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:55,523
- Giles, Willow, Cordelia...
- Ms Calendar.

483
00:34:55,558 --> 00:34:58,523
Odds are they've got a complete set by now.

484
00:34:58,716 --> 00:35:01,145
We need to find out where.

485
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,709
How?

486
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:06,850
One more time: where are they?

487
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:10,549
You're too late. Your friends are dead.

488
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,952
Tell me where they are!

489
00:35:14,983 --> 00:35:18,868
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

490
00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:21,352
As a matter of fact...

491
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:25,535
Yes.

492
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:29,272
But, since I'm not gonna kill you
any time soon...

493
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:34,029
the question becomes
how are we gonna pass the time till then?

494
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:42,395
So, one more time.

495
00:35:57,692 --> 00:36:00,316
Begin.

496
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,863
Behold, these poor mortals.

497
00:36:18,898 --> 00:36:22,091
Witnesses to our Master's wretched demise.

498
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:25,220
They will breathe their last this night.

499
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:30,025
The blood that pours from their throats
will bring new life to the Old One.

500
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,727
Gather for his resurrection,

501
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:37,979
for the dawn of this new hell.

502
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,237
Buffy!

503
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:43,783
Buffy!

504
00:36:43,818 --> 00:36:46,840
We gotta do something now!

505
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:52,121
- You two get the others out of here.
- We need you to distract the vampires.

506
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:55,509
- Right.
- What are you gonna do?

507
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:59,325
I'm gonna kill them all.

508
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,703
That oughta distract 'em.

509
00:37:03,383 --> 00:37:07,779
For the Old One. For his pain.

510
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:10,765
- For the dark.
- For the dark.

511
00:37:11,516 --> 00:37:13,351
For the...

512
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:45,292
The sacrifices! Stop them!

513
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,444
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

514
00:38:48,488 --> 00:38:52,881
- Where's Buffy?
- She's workin' out her issues.

515
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:17,439
Enough!

516
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:22,062
Your day is done, girl.

517
00:39:22,097 --> 00:39:25,451
I'll grind you into a sticky paste!

518
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:31,535
And hear you beg
before I smash in your face.

519
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:37,238
So, are you gonna kill me,
or are we just making small talk?

520
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:13,845
- It's over.
- No, it's not.

521
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,336
It's OK.

522
00:41:08,878 --> 00:41:10,713
It's OK.

523
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,074
What an ordeal.
And you know what the worst part is?

524
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:41,012
- What?
- It stays with you forever.

525
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:43,880
No matter what they tell you,
none of that

526
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:47,745
rust and blood and grime comes out.

527
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:50,024
I mean, you can dry-clean
till Judgment Day,

528
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:52,463
you are living with those stains.

529
00:41:52,498 --> 00:41:54,726
Yeah that's the worst part of
being hung upside down

530
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:57,468
by a vampire
who wants to slit your throat.

531
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,971
- The stains.
- I hear ya.

532
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:03,725
- I don't think I can face them.
- Hm? Oh, of course you can.

533
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,372
I can't!
What am I supposed to say?

534
00:42:07,407 --> 00:42:10,101
"Sorry I almost got your throat slit.
What's the homework?"

535
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:12,433
Punishing yourself like this is pointless.

536
00:42:12,434 --> 00:42:16,763
It's entirely pointy. I was a moron.

537
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:20,518
I put my best friends in mortal danger
on the second day of school.

538
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:23,631
What are you going to do, crawl into
a dark cave for the rest of your life?

539
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,522
Would it have cable?

540
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:27,797
Buffy, you acted wrongly, I admit that.

541
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:32,520
But, believe me, that was hardly
the worst mistake you'll ever make.

542
00:42:32,555 --> 00:42:35,732
Uh, that wasn't quite as comforting
as it was meant to be.

543
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:39,185
Well, points for effort.

544
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,984
I'll see ya.

545
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:08,309
Hey, Buffy.

546
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,796
Hey.

547
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:14,626
We saved you a seat.

548
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:21,348
There's a rumor going around that, uh...

549
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,400
Mr. Cox is the most boring teacher
in the entire world.

550
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,005
Like, I think he won a belt or something.

551
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,228
Like, yes.

552
00:43:29,229 --> 00:43:34,440
Well, I hear he nods off a lot,
so that's a plus.

553
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:37,569
- So, we Bronzin' it tonight?
- Wednesday is kinda beat.

554
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:40,506
Well, we could grind our enemies
into talcum powder with a sledgehammer,

555
00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:44,289
but, gosh, we did that last night.

556
00:43:46,888 --> 00:43:48,830
Hey, I gotta plan.
How about miniature golf?

557
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:52,779
- There's no course here.
- OK, uh... miniature tennis?

558
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:57,042
A very tiny form of tennis
that we could invent...

559
00:44:38,254 --> 00:44:40,340
I hate that girl.

560
00:44:40,341 --> 00:44:45,510
