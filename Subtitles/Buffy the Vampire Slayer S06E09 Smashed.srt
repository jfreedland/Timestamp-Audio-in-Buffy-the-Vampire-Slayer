00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,435
Previously on
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,233
You wanna fry a witch?
I'll give you a witch.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,557
Before thee,
let the unclean thing crawl!

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,550
She's a perfectly normal girl.
Then she's a rat.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,955
We should get her
one of those wheel thingies.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,358
- Can we not do this now?
- Forget it ever happened.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,033
Forget.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,275
What is wrong with you?!

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,072
I know you used that spell on me.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,556
I will go a month without doing any magic.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,875
- Go a week.
- Fine. That's easy.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,279
When the fire goes out, and the crystal
turns black, the spell will be cast.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,430
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- Are you gonna leave me?

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,997
- I'm placing an order.
- I'm not making any more girls.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,556
Sure you are. And here's your specs.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,036
So... you guys wanna team up
and take over Sunnydale?

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,349
- OK.
- OK.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,675
The Trio versus the Slayer.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,190
We're, like, supervillains.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,073
- I can't do this without you.
- You can.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,031
That's why I'm going.

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,673
I'm headed back to England.
And I plan to stay.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,109
We have to talk.

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,118
- About what?
- We kissed, Buffy.

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,878
- I'm sure we can work somethin' out.
- A deal of some sort. Anything you want.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,956
I always wanted a pony.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,310
Oh. You weren't really speaking to me,
were you? My bad.

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,396
Well, as long as I'm here...

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,470
- Lady!
- Wow. A mugging.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,069
Haven't gotten one of those in a while.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,349
Usually it's blood, and with the horror...
Just a good old-fashioned mugging.

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,270
Kinda sweet, actually.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,516
Well, probably not for you.

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,518
Here. Go. Now.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,918
Not too sweet for you either, huh?
Come on, rush me. It'll be funny.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,434
No!

37
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,394
- What the hell are you doing?
- Thought they were demons.

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,717
Way to go with the keen observiness,
Jessica Fletcher.

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,513
- Remind me not to help you.
- More often?

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,030
Hey. A little sympathy for the man
with the migraine, can we?

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,948
- That's what you get for attacking a human.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,311
You'd think if the government
put a chip in my head,

43
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:41,471
I could at least attack criminals.

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,637
Yes, because muggers deserve to be eaten.

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,991
Just have to get your rocks off
fightin' demons.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,429
There are other ways.

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,269
And to that, an extreme "see you later".

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,229
Buffy.

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,996
Spike, it's late, OK.
Can we just finish this another time?

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,717
So you wanna jump
right to the kissing, then, eh?

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,719
- I am not kissing you, Spike. Once was...
- Twice.

52
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,876
But not again.

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,036
You're a tease, you know that, Slayer?
Get a fella's motor revvin',

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,472
let the tension marinate a couple of days,
then - bam! - crown yourself the ice queen.

55
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,353
Need a few more metaphors
for that little mix?

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,439
It's only a matter of time before you
realise I'm the only one here for you, pet.

57
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,073
You got no one else!

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,953
What's the matter, Amy?

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,036
You lonely?

61
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,748
We need to get you a nice companion rat

62
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,431
that you can love... play with...
and grow attached to,

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,870
until one day they leave you
for no good reason.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,070
Won't that be fun?

65
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,354
Relax, Amy. I'm just kiddin'.

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,796
I swear, if I could figure out
how to turn you back...

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,716
Any way...

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,955
Revele!

69
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,555
Ciò che fu, non è più.

70
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,717
Ciò che fu fatto, disfa.

71
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,912
Passato è il pericolo,

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,429
finita è la prova.

73
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,994
Metti le cose a posto.

74
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,629
- Dude, what are you doing?
- We're not breakin' into Langley here.

75
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,877
You never know what new stuff they have.
Better safe than...

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,675
The security system here
is a guy named Rusty.

77
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,678
- Now get up.
- Whoa, head rush. Cool!

78
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,633
Guys, come on. Quit jerkin' around.

79
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,470
See, that's cool. How come
he gets to play with all the cool stuff?

80
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,195
I'm allergic to methane
and you're afraid of hot things.

81
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,279
Besides, the tank kept
makin' both of us tip over, remember?

82
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,715
- Got it.
- It's beautiful.

83
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,906
Boys, congratulations.
Phase one of the plan is now complete.

84
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:02,855
Let's get the hell outta here.

85
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,394
What are you boys doing?

86
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,750
We're with a tour group.

87
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,156
The "Get The Freeze Ray" tour group.
Must've gotten separated.

88
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,350
Museum closed five hours ago.

89
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,790
Really?

90
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,278
Guess we just lost track of time. We should
probably get the freeze ray outta here now.

91
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,914
Cos we love the learning, Rusty.

92
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,794
Museums, libraries, Disney Hall
of Presidents... not boring.

93
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,992
But more to the point, goodbye.

94
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,590
Dude, that is so cool!

95
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,035
The freeze ray totally worked.

96
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,435
Yeah... Not exactly.

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,389
There's a kink or two.
It's just a prototype.

98
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,911
Hey, that's really neato and stuff,
but in the meantime, you know... ow!

99
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,792
Be a bigger wuss.

100
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,913
Can we just go back to the lair?
Because... I can't really feel my fingers.

101
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,078
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

102
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,189
- Is he gonna, like...?
- He'll be fine.

103
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,153
He'll defrost in a couple of days.
No harm, no foul.

104
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,794
- Won't he tell on us?
- And say what?

105
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,118
"Two guys and a mime took me out
with their freeze ray"? It's likely.

106
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,196
Come on.

107
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,156
Hey. Here's some hot chocolate. You want...?

108
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,475
No, thanks.

109
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,194
Still... kinda queasy.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,877
OK. Maybe later.

111
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,878
Hey. No, it's OK. It's... it's just a siren.

112
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,354
It's... it's all right. OK?

113
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,556
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

114
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,593
Yeah. Just... you know.

115
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,956
Everything feels weird.

116
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,755
I mean, it's like...
I felt like I was in that cage for weeks.

117
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,669
But it can still be OK... right?

118
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,638
I can still get into the swing of things.
Like... prom's coming up.

119
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,356
I was so hoping Larry would ask me.
We would make such a splash at...

120
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,516
Oh. Oh, God.

121
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,113
He hasn't asked someone else, has he?

122
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,677
Amy...

123
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519
three things we have to talk about.

124
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,756
One, Larry's gay.

125
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,549
Two, Larry's dead.

126
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,635
And three, high school's...

127
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,556
kinda over.

128
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,955
How long was I in the cage?

129
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,159
How long?!

130
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,678
Willow?

131
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,554
Hey. How you doin'?

132
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
Oh. Um... OK.

133
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,757
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,236
Not parades and cotton candy, but... OK.

135
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,312
Will, um... can I talk to you
about something?

136
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,396
- Of course.
- Right.

137
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,396
OK. Um...

138
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,319
You know how we all make choices?

139
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,072
And sometimes they're good, and...
sometimes they're... less good.

140
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,118
Uh-huh.

141
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,474
Well, lately, I, um...

142
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,868
Oh, Tara, hey...

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,513
Amy?

144
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,835
The whole school?

145
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,190
By a giant snake thing.

146
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,672
OK, still adjusting. Hey, Buffy.

147
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,433
Hi.

148
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,436
- How've you been?
- Rat. You?

149
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,391
- Dead.
- Oh.

150
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,356
Well, I should let you guys catch up.
I can...

151
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:10,512
No, no, no, stay.

152
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,710
Do you have any cookies?

153
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,992
- Yeah. What kind?
- Any kind. Not cheese.

154
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,148
- Sure, in the kitchen. I'll just get 'em.
- No, I'll grab 'em.

155
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,353
OK, well, at least, you know,
let me make up the couch for you.

156
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,631
It's late, you should stay here.
Everybody does.

157
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,751
Thank you.

158
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,716
- Wow.
- I know.

159
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,159
Is... she gonna be OK?

160
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,512
Don't know. She's kinda freaked out.
But then I would be too.

161
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,109
Wow.

162
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,719
Yeah, I just realised I could.
Thought of the right thing, and...

163
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,995
It's nice, having another
magically-inclined friend around.

164
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,673
So, what were you gonna tell me?
You were sounding all serious.

165
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,610
It's nothing. I mean,
the whole Amy, rat, Amy thing...

166
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,554
No way I'm toppin' that.

167
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,952
Hey.

168
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,355
How you doin'? Need anything?

169
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,194
No, thanks. Good cookies.

170
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,393
- Sorry about your mom.
- Thanks.

171
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,589
It's crazy, all the things that've happened
since I went away.

172
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:41,829
No kidding.

173
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,158
Snyder got eaten by a snake.
High school got destroyed...

174
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,078
Oh, Gatorade has a new flavour. Blue.

175
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,636
See? Head spinning.

176
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,959
People getting frozen.
Willow's dating girls.

177
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:59,232
And did you hear about Tom and Nicole?

178
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,999
People getting frozen?

179
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,318
.. in critical yet stable condition,
as authorities continue their investigation

180
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,352
into the robbery
that left one man frozen solid.

181
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,517
Live from the museum, Bryan Morris, KOUS.

182
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,153
Weird.

183
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,109
Excuse me.

184
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,514
Great.

185
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,076
Well, well. Look who decided to show up.

186
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,316
What are you doing here, Spike?

187
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,594
Well, you know a man was frozen alive
in there? A little compassion, love.

188
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,474
As long as we're both here, you might
as well tag along. As a team, we could...

189
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,869
Yeah, that never really ends well, does it?

190
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:07,673
It did the other night.

191
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,475
You really seem awfully fixated
on a couple of kisses, Spike.

192
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,717
And you seem awfully quick
to forget about 'em.

193
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Look, I'm sorry, OK?
I'm sorry if you thought that it meant more.

194
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,992
But?

195
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,028
But... when I kissed you... you know
I was thinking about Giles, right?

196
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,716
I always wondered about you two.

197
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,274
What?

198
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,755
Oh, gross, Spike!

199
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,632
He left. I was depressed. Ergo
vulnerability and bad kissing decisions.

200
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,636
But that's all that it was.
You have to let it go.

201
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,434
- Did it work?
- What?

202
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,038
You convince yourself?

203
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,469
Please, stop.

204
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,955
A man can change.

205
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,758
You're not a man. You're a thing.

206
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,436
- Stop walkin' away.
- Don't touch me!

207
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,677
You're a thing. An evil, disgusting thing.

208
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,995
Look at all the goodies.

209
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,195
That's right, you should scream.

210
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,228
Creature of the night here, yeah?
Some people forget that.

211
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,750
- Please.
- She thinks I'm house-broken.

212
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,189
- She forgot who she's dealing with.
- Anything...

213
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,737
Just cos she's confused
about where she fits in,

214
00:16:22,738 --> 00:16:25,155
I'm supposed to be too? Cos I'm not.

215
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,114
I know what I am. I'm dangerous. I'm evil.

216
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,830
- I'm sure you're not evil.
- Yes, I am.

217
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,953
I am a killer. That's what I do. I kill.

218
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,551
And, yeah, maybe it's been a long time,
but... it's not like you forget how.

219
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,594
You just... do it.

220
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,670
And now I can - again - all right?

221
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,234
So here goes.

222
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,549
This might hurt a little.

223
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,795
What the hell is going on?

224
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,630
Good God, that's a lot of shake.

225
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,356
I mean, I know... part of
our big movie and milkshake fun day,

226
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,189
but... good God, that's a lot of shake.

227
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,716
Helps to wash down the Raisinets.

228
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,358
Promise me you will eat something green
tonight. Leafy green, not... gummy green.

229
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,679
- Movie was fun.
- Yeah.

230
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,271
It was ironic when all those cute inner-city
kids taught their coach a valuable lesson.

231
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,517
You know that I will
always be there for you, right?

232
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,236
There was actually more of a lead-in
when I practised that at home.

233
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,115
- I know.
- It's just...

234
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,470
I wanted you to know that...

235
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,197
my moving out had nothing to do with you,
and I will never stop loving you.

236
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,276
I know.

237
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,252
Do you think you'll ever get back together?

238
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,139
I wish I knew.

239
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,317
- But you still love her.
- Very much. I just...

240
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,915
Sometimes...
other things get in the way.

241
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,474
I know. She's been doing
a lot better lately, though.

242
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,310
She's been really good about...
being careful... about stuff.

243
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,272
Well, good.

244
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,153
Great. That's... that's great.

245
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,879
Here.
Says the guard's definitely gonna live.

246
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,629
He's all thawed out.
It says they used hair dryers. Huh.

247
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,753
Everything slowed down.
His nervous system, circulatory system...

248
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,155
He's still unconscious.

249
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,559
Anya?

250
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,719
It's such a pain. The text I wanted,
Giles took it with him.

251
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,231
He has this thing that...
owning a book makes it, like, his property.

252
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,113
What should we do? Should we call him?
It's, like, the middle of last night there.

253
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,710
Or maybe it's tomorrow.
Anyone remember how that works?

254
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,515
It's OK, no one freak.
We'll just do it another way.

255
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,791
I don't think we need to resort to...
I mean...

256
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,758
Oh. Hey. Cool.

257
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,233
Back to basics. A little old-fashioned
state-of-the-art hacker action.

258
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,150
That's great, Will,
I haven't seen you do that in a long time.

259
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,515
I don't remember that part.

260
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,790
It's quicker. It'll just take a sec
to go through the files.

261
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,878
OK. Internal police report.

262
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,754
A diamond was stolen from
the museum last night. A big one.

263
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,235
On loan from the British Museum.

264
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,399
They're withholding information
to smoke out the criminals.

265
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,035
It's pretty. There's a picture.

266
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,479
Well, is it a supernatural diamond? You
know, like, healing powers, or good-lucky?

267
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,195
Maybe it's cursed.
Diamonds are excellent for cursing.

268
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
Well, we'll keep checkin', shall we?

269
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,468
Well, you know, I am kinda beat,

270
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,038
and I betcha that's tiring,
that... thing you're doin' there...

271
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,719
- Guys, I'm fine. What's the deal with...?
- Oh, for cryin' out loud. This is bizarre.

272
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,799
You're all "la la la!" with the magic, and
the not talking, like everything's normal,

273
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,011
when we all know that Tara up and left you,

274
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:36,278
and now everyone's scared
to say anything to you.

275
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,150
Except me.

276
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,113
Is this that thing I do
that you were commenting...?

277
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,470
Guys, it's OK.

278
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,876
It's hard, but it's better this way.

279
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,958
Little things started taking over
- things that didn't matter,

280
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:55,545
but we saw them differently,

281
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,875
so... they got blown out of proportion.

282
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,630
And this time away
will help us sort through things.

283
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,558
Really.

284
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,448
Now, let's just keep working on this.

285
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:10,195
I don't wanna leave Amy
alone in the house so long.

286
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,074
Amy, is she...? How is she adjusting?

287
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,311
It's hard to say. It's a lot to take in.

288
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,877
I keep expecting her to do, like, ratty
stuff. You know, licking her hands clean,

289
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,754
shredding newspaper,
leaving little pellets in the corner.

290
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,917
Let's definitely not leave her alone
in the house too long.

291
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,435
- I didn't know it'd be so sparkly.
- And so big.

292
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,035
Yes, gentlemen,
it turns out size is everything.

293
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,832
No offence, man.

294
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,834
It makes colours with the light.

295
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,958
All right, we've finished the first part.
Time for phase two. Is the van fired up?

296
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,274
Check.

297
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,040
Hello! It's called knocking!

298
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,478
Knock, knock, robot boy.
Need you to look at my chip.

299
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,512
Is that British slang or something?
Cos we're not...

300
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,474
- In my head. The chip in my head.
- We're kind of in the middle of somethin'.

301
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,195
You can play holodeck another time.
Right now, I'm in charge.

302
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,949
What are you gonna do if we don't
especially feel like playing your...

303
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,036
Wait, what are you doing?

304
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,188
Examine my chip, or else
Mr... Fett here is the first to die.

305
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,756
Hey, all right. Let's not...
let's not do anything crazy here.

306
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,395
That's a limited edition,
1979 mint-condition Boba Fett.

307
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
All right. Dude... chill.

308
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,389
You can still make it right.
You know you don't wanna do this.

309
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,273
What I want... is answers, nimrod.

310
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,872
Right. But you don't wanna hurt the Fett,
cos, man, you're not comin' back from that.

311
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,468
You know, you don't just
do that and walk away.

312
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,957
- That right? Let's find out.
- One second.

313
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,233
- I think that's Spike.
- Of course it is, and he's evil.

314
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,636
- Completely capable of removing that head.
- I'm gonna help him.

315
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,309
Are you sure we can trust him?
I mean, we all have heads too.

316
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,075
We help him, and he owes us one.

317
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,953
We get Spike on our side,
we get info on Buffy.

318
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,799
Maybe we can even find a way
to keep her out of phase two.

319
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,145
Jonathan's right. Can we trust him?

320
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:22,718
Course not.
But alliances aren't about trust.

321
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,436
See, he needs us, we need him.
That's how these things work.

322
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,030
- I think we're ready. Agreed?
- Agreed.

323
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,710
Do what you need to do.

324
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,835
I think we can work somethin' out.

325
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,397
I'll take a look at your chip. It'll be
a deal. We scratch your back, you scratch...

326
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,117
I'm not scratching your anything. You do
what I tell you. That's the deal. Deal?

327
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,194
- Deal.
- Then let's go.

328
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,033
It's OK, it's OK. It'll be fine.

329
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,631
Amy?

330
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,070
God, you're back. You said
you wouldn't be gone that long.

331
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,431
- I wasn't. I mean, I thought it was...
- Let's go somewhere.

332
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,195
- Don't you wanna go see your dad?
- No.

333
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,550
I can't.

334
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,716
Not yet. Too many questions.

335
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,474
- About where you were.
- No, about how I got there.

336
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,317
I wish there was a way I could
make him forget the last three years.

337
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,476
Well, hey, I can help you with that.

338
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,549
Only... you might wanna sew your name
into your clothes first or somethin'.

339
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,036
I just don't wanna deal with him right now.
I think I would be... bored.

340
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,153
- Well.
- Come on, let's get outta here.

341
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,675
Well, what do you wanna do?

342
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,472
I don't know. Something fun.
Anything... not involving a big wheel.

343
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,596
Or... maybe...

344
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,475
you'd rather sit home all night,
alone, like in high school.

345
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,638
No.

346
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,558
No. You know what? I can have fun.

347
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,355
- Heck, I deserve some fun.
- Yeah, you do.

348
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,155
I can party! Not like I owe anyone anything.

349
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,316
I am totally free.

350
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,795
So let's make with the fun.

351
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,715
You're English, right?

352
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,039
Yeah.

353
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,637
I've seen every episode of Doctor Who.

354
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,875
- Not Red Dwarf, though, cos, um...
- Cos it's not out yet on DVD.

355
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,798
Right. It's not out yet on... DVD.

356
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,834
- Warren!
- Here... I am. Here.

357
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,030
Bloody hell. Get on with it, then.

358
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,239
Help me out here, Spock,
I don't speak loser.

359
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:05,476
OK. Right. Um...

360
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,750
Your chip works fine. Yeah.

361
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,473
- There's gotta be something wrong...
- No, no, listen.

362
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,115
I don't know what that thing does.
I'd like to.

363
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,470
- Hey.
- But whatever it is, it works fine.

364
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,549
The signal still is coming through
on a steady pulse - which it's supposed to.

365
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,319
- If you're lying to me...
- No! It's all right here.

366
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,195
I mean, it is. It's really not that hard
to figure out, if you just... What?

367
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,630
- You tell anyone about this...
- No, I promise. Who would I tell?

368
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,788
- I don't even know what this is about.
- It's about the rules having changed.

369
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,275
Everything's different now.

370
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,271
Nothin' wrong with me.
Something wrong with her.

371
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,830
Hello! We're home!

372
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,639
- Looks like no one's here.
- Well, I'm sure they'll be back soon.

373
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,389
I know Willow and Buffy were meeting up
with Xander to do some research.

374
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,829
Well, then, I should probably get back.

375
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,269
Or you can stay and wait for them.

376
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,710
Then you can get a chance
to catch up with... everyone.

377
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,277
Yeah, I don't think
that's such a great idea.

378
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,713
OK. Your call. I have the TV
to keep me company till they get back.

379
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,991
You notice how it's been getting dark
so much earlier these days?

380
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,035
Ha. Talking cat.

381
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,316
Fine. I'll stay,
but just until they get back.

382
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,197
And only to make sure that you're not alone.
This has nothing to do with... anyone else.

383
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,276
Sure. Cool.

384
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,356
Up to you.

385
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,789
I know. Xander engaged,
I couldn't believe it either.

386
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,436
It's so weird.

387
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,030
So, what's she like?

388
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,914
Thousand-year-old capitalist ex-demon
with rabbit phobia.

389
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,190
Well, that's so his type.

390
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,548
- Hey.
- Hey.

391
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,995
Hey.

392
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,798
Well, let's go, then.
We're gonna go dance. Do you wanna come?

393
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,796
Oh. No. You go.
I'll keep an eye on our drinks.

394
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,190
OK. You know, because if you want
something a little more your style...

395
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,394
I'm sure we can swing that.

396
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,278
No. Really, no.

397
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,637
Hi. Brie.

398
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,988
Willow.

399
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,190
Nice... um, top.

400
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,229
- No. Thanks, but no.
- Are you sure?

401
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,158
- I'm not... She... I'm still...
- It's cool.

402
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,950
Oh. Sorry.

403
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,795
- So, are we gonna go?
- Yeah.

404
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,229
- Sure you're gonna be OK?
- Yeah. Go. I'm all kinds of good.

405
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,238
No use looking at me like that.
It's the gullet for you, mister.

406
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,473
Hey. Sorry. I kinda got caught up.

407
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,470
No, it's OK.

408
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,239
You know, if rats could dance
they probably wouldn't gnaw so much.

409
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,277
Hey, come on. We're just gettin' started.

410
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,146
I think I'll sit this one out.

411
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:27,754
You can't just work us up like that,
then...

412
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,950
- Hey!
- I think she said no.

413
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,920
Well, nobody asked you... Ellen.

414
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,030
- You wanna dance?
- That's all.

415
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,311
Nice, slow... relaxing dance.

416
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,790
- Gee.
- I think I do feel more relaxed.

417
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,709
Aha! I got it!
Here's our villain, right here!

418
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,589
What?

419
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,154
That's a D&D manual, sweetie.

420
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,236
No, but it could...

421
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,437
Face it, we're not gonna find it
because it doesn't exist.

422
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,394
There's no such thing
as a frost monster who eats diamonds.

423
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,878
Well, maybe he doesn't eat them. You know,
maybe he just... thinks they're pretty.

424
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,996
We suck.

425
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,714
We need new brains. What's up with Willow?

426
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,079
- Out with Amy, I guess.
- Great, someone to do more magic with.

427
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,156
But at least she's not all cooped up
and crying. That's forward momentum.

428
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,192
I don't know everything
that happened with Tara, but...

429
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,438
Tara thinks Willow is doin' too much magic.
And she's not the only one.

430
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,677
I know. But I think she'll be fine.
It's Willow. She of the level head.

431
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,635
Those are the ones you have to
watch out for the most - responsible types.

432
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,470
Right. She might go crazy
and start alphabetising everything.

433
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,276
I'm serious. Responsible people are always
so concerned with being good all the time,

434
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,781
that when they finally
get a taste of being bad,

435
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:13,428
they can't get enough. It's all... kablooey.

436
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,309
- That's not true.
- OK, not kablooey, more like bam!

437
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,736
It's human nature, Buff. Will's getting
a taste of something powerful,

438
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:23,396
way bigger than her.

439
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:27,672
She was getting out of control with it
before Tara left, and now that she's gone...

440
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,032
It's gotta be seductive.
Just giving in to it, going totally wild.

441
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,318
- We need to keep an eye on her.
- OK.

442
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,719
We'll keep an eye. But we can't assume
everybody's getting seduced. Sometimes...

443
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,874
Magic Box.

444
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,588
Slayer.

445
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,199
Spike?

446
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,595
Meet me at the cemetery.

447
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,757
20 minutes. Come alone.

448
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,595
Spike?

449
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,795
Bloody hell. Yes, it's me.

450
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,796
You're calling me on the phone?

451
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,358
- Just be there.
- Why? Are you helping again?

452
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,675
You have a lead on this frost monster?

453
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,118
Something like that, yeah. Thought you
might be up for a little grunt work.

454
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,519
What?! No. No grunting!

455
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,910
I was talking shop, love,
but if you got other ideas -

456
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,794
you, me, cosy little tomb with a view...

457
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,114
- So, what did Captain Peroxide want?
- Nothing.

458
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,075
He just, you know, wanted to see
if I wanted to patrol, for the monster.

459
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,033
But I told him that I... would not.

460
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,431
I'm telling you, I think
there's something about this thing.

461
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,757
I don't know. It seems like
we've been through every book.

462
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,599
Even the ones that weren't
so boring you wanna die.

463
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,156
- We have those?
- All the things that have happened lately,

464
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,717
- the bank robbery, the jewellery heist...
- The exploding lint.

465
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,196
- Is it me, or do these things seem really...
- Lame?

466
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,718
Well, I was gonna go with unusual, but yeah.

467
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,874
I'll do a quick patrol tonight,
and after a good night's sleep,

468
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,231
we can solve this tomorrow.

469
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,638
- Optimism. I remember optimism.
- That's because you're, like, a thousand.

470
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,115
- Good night, guys.
- Night.

471
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,672
- Slayer.
- And so my night is now complete.

472
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,078
- You never showed.
- Sorry. Little busy actually doing stuff.

473
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,590
- You shouldn't be so flip.
- You gonna walk-behind-me to death?

474
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,757
I'm just sayin' things
might be a little different.

475
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,475
You ought to be careful.

476
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,158
Enough.

477
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,509
Get outta my way.

478
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,596
Or what?

479
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,474
Oh, the pain, the pain...

480
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,309
is gone.

481
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,193
Guess what I just found out.

482
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,949
Looks like I'm not as toothless
as you thought, sweetheart.

483
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,433
How?

484
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,433
Don't you get it? Don't you see?

485
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,628
You came back wrong.

486
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,359
It's a trick. You did something to the chip.

487
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,110
It's no trick. It's not me, it's you.
Just you, in fact - that's the funny part.

488
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,518
You're the one that's changed.
That's why this doesn't hurt me.

489
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,438
Came back a little less human than you were.

490
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,755
You're wrong.

491
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,152
Then how come you're so spooked, love?
And why can I... do that?

492
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,118
You're wrong.

493
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,598
You know, this music isn't quite...

494
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,555
Poor little lost girl.

495
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,190
She doesn't fit in anywhere.
She's got no one to love.

496
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,389
Me? I'm lost? Look at you, you idiot!

497
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,269
Poor Spikey.
Can't be a human, can't be a vampire.

498
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,228
Where the hell do you fit in?

499
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,369
Your job is to kill the Slayer.

500
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:15,076
But all you can do is follow
me around making moon eyes.

501
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,796
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain. Admit it.

502
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,789
You like me... because you enjoy getting
beat down. So, really, who's screwed up?

503
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,191
Hello! Vampire!

504
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,195
I'm supposed to be treading on
the dark side.

505
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,430
What's your excuse?

506
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,311
So we've kinda played this scene.

507
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,318
- Yeah.
- Return.

508
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,360
I just keep thinking there's gotta be
someplace, like, bigger than this.

509
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,991
Besides, it's way too early to go home yet.

510
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,598
- I wasn't plannin' on hurtin' you. Much.
- You haven't even come close to hurting me.

511
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,188
Afraid to give me the chance?

512
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,350
You afraid I'm gonna...?

513
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:46,650
