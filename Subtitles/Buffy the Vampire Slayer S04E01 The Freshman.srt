1
00:00:07,613 --> 00:00:08,966
Anything?

2
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:14,411
Ah! "Introduction to the Modern Novel.
A survey study of 20th-century novelists."

3
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:19,442
- "Open to freshmen." You might like that.
- "Introduction to the Modern Novel"?

4
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:22,730
I'm guessing I'd probably
have to read the modern novel.

5
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:25,285
Maybe more than one.

6
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:30,049
I like books. I just don't
wanna take on too much.

7
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:34,205
Do they have an "Introduction
to the Modern Blurb"?

8
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:37,128
- Oh! "Short Story"!
- Well, that's good.

9
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:41,001
- Oh, no. It conflicts with psych.
- Maybe I shouldn't take psych.

10
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:45,652
You gotta. It's fun, and you can use it
as your science requirement.

11
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:50,329
Anyway, Professor Walsh is supposed
to be great. She's, like, world-renowned.

12
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:53,493
How do you get to be renowned?

13
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:56,485
I mean, like,
do you have to be "nowned" first?

14
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:59,929
Yes. First there's the painful
nowning process.

15
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,573
Wait! "Images of Pop Culture."

16
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:08,450
This is good. They watch movies,
TV shows, even commercials.

17
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:10,171
For credit?

18
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:13,928
- Isn't college cool?
- How did I miss that one?

19
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:17,972
Well, you did sort of wait till the last minute
with your course selection.

20
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:22,489
Sorry, Miss l-Chose-My-Major-in-Playgroup.

21
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:28,851
That's an exaggeration. I just, you know,
think it's good to be prepared.

22
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,524
Don't wanna be caught unawares.

23
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:35,841
I've been busy!
It's been a very slay-heavy summer.

24
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:40,765
I just haven't had a whole lot of time
to think about life at UC Sunnydale.

25
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:44,923
- It's exciting, though, isn't it?
- Yeah!

26
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:49,606
- It's gonna be an adjustment.
- Yeah, it's, like, five miles away.

27
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,684
It's uncharted territory.

28
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:54,887
Giles said I have to be
Secret Identity Gal again.

29
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:58,249
- That makes sense.
- It's gonna be tough, though.

30
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,847
- With a roommate.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,527
I'm psyched about college. Definitely.

32
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:08,765
I just need to figure out how it's gonna work
with my extracurricular activities.

33
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:11,447
I just can't let it take the edge off my slaying.

34
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:14,604
I gotta stay sharp.

35
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:19,128
Is this guy ever gonna wake up?

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

37
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:26,923
 Sometimes

38
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:29,208
 At the back of my mind

39
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:34,687
Freshmen! We're doing this by folder colour!

40
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:39,251
If you're not holding on to a yellow folder,
you're in the wrong group.

41
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,528
You belong up by Weisman Hall.

42
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:48,448
They gotta hear us!
We're not gonna take it!

43
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:52,683
- What do we want?
- Booze!

44
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:55,367
- When do we want it?
- Now!

45
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:10,682
Rally tomorrow night.
Let the administration know how we feel.

46
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:12,365
Right.

47
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,411
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal saviour?

48
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:17,961
I meant to, and then I just got really busy.

49
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:22,288
Party Thursday at Alpha Delt.
Free Jell-O shots for freshmen women.

50
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:25,365
Do you guys know where... Weisman Hall is?

51
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:34,683
- Buffy! Hey!
- Oh, boy, am I glad to see you!

52
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:37,367
Isn't this cool? There's so much going on.

53
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:40,286
Yeah. Almost, one might say, too much.

54
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:44,924
I got all my courses... except for Modern
Poetry. I had to switch to Ethnomusicology.

55
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:49,052
But that's cool. West African drumming.
I think it's gonna change everything.

56
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,442
- Have you met your roommate yet?
- No.

57
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:55,412
- Me neither. I hope she's cool.
- I see you got ticketed, too.

58
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:59,850
Yes! I've heard about five different issues
and I'm angry about every one of them.

59
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,572
- What'd you get?
- Jell-O shots.

60
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:04,644
I didn't get Jell-O shots!

61
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,522
I'll trade you for a "Take Back the Night"?

62
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:11,925
Are we near Weisman Hall?
I still need to get my ID card.

63
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:16,211
I got mine this morning. The lines are really
long now. You should've gone early.

64
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:20,127
Well, I hope that I learn from
this experience and that I grow.

65
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:24,126
- I'm being annoying, aren't I?
- No. It's nice that you're excited.

66
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:27,762
It's just in high school, knowledge
was pretty much frowned upon.

67
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:32,847
You really had to work to learn anything. But
here, the energy, the collective intelligence,

68
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:39,406
it's like this force, this penetrating force,
and I can just feel my mind opening up.

69
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:45,045
And letting this place just thrust into
and spurt knowledge into...

70
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:49,322
That sentence ended up in a different place
than it started out in.

71
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:52,530
I'm with you, though.
I'm all for spurty knowledge.

72
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:56,492
It's just... It's a little overwhelming.
Don't you feel it?

73
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:00,885
Well, I'm... Ooh, boyfriend!
It's my on-campus boyfriend!

74
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:04,852
Oh no, I forgot to pick mine up.
The line's probably really long now, too.

75
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:07,970
- How are you?
- Good. It's a madhouse, a madhouse.

76
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:11,443
I know, I was just saying that to Willow.
It's so overwhelming.

77
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,331
- Don't you feel completely disoriented?
- Oz!

78
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:18,964
- Hey, Paul.
- Finally matriculating with us. Very cool!

79
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:21,965
- Tell me you're playing this week!
- Thursday, Alpha Delt.

80
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:24,442
- I have that one!
- I'm bringing the wrecking crew.

81
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:26,524
- Jell-O shots?
- Good.

82
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:29,002
Where do you get
the work-study applications?

83
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:31,243
Back of Richmond Hall,
next to the auditorium.

84
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,927
- Thanks. See ya, bro.
- Go get 'em.

85
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:38,922
Well, the band's played here a lot.
It's still all new.

86
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:41,811
I don't know what the hell's going on.
Hey, Doug!

87
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:46,125
Library... Ooh, library. Come on.

88
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:51,687
It's too bad Giles couldn't be
librarian here. Be convenient.

89
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:55,049
Well, he says he's enjoying
being a gentleman of leisure.

90
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:58,284
Gentleman of leisure?
Isn't that British for unemployed?

91
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:00,284
Uh-huh. He's a slacker now.

92
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:03,251
Speaking of slack,
have you heard from Xander?

93
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,167
Not for a while. He's still on his
cross-country see-America thing.

94
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:11,287
He said he wasn't coming back
until he had driven to all 50 states.

95
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:15,366
- Did you explain about Hawaii?
- Well, he seemed so determined.

96
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:20,048
Hope he gets back soon. It'd be fun
to have the whole gang back together.

97
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:23,125
Hang out in the... library.

98
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:26,045
Wow!

99
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:31,171
Oh, my gosh! Isn't this amazing?

100
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,644
It's... cosy.

101
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,565
You know, I never wanted to hurt
Giles's feelings, but, occult books aside,

102
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:44,044
our old library just didn't have
the greatest selection. But this?

103
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:50,051
Yeah, this is great, you know, if we ever need
a place for the Nuremberg rallies.

104
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,648
This is a real library.

105
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:56,928
See, we even have to whisper.
It's like a whole new world.

106
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,764
- Here.
- Thanks.

107
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:08,368
I can't wait till Mom gets the bill.
I hope it's a funny aneurysm.

108
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,444
"Introduction to Psychology."

109
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:14,082
- Oh, up there.
- I'll get 'em.

110
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:19,247
- This discriminates against short people.
- Oh, I think there's a protest next week.

111
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:25,924
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
- I'm OK. It's OK.

112
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:30,528
- Well, that was bracing.
- I'm so...

113
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:34,606
The books were just too high,
and then everything was bad.

114
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:37,044
Let me give you a hand.

115
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,445
Let's put a few of these down here.

116
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:46,367
So are you girls taking Intro Psych,
or do you just want me dead?

117
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:49,172
Uh-huh. I mean, the first one.

118
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:52,325
You'll have fun. Professor Walsh,
she's quite a character.

119
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:55,689
- You've taken it?
- I'm a TA. I'll be helping the professor out.

120
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:58,970
I've forgotten my manners
in all the concussion. I'm Riley.

121
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:02,443
- Willow. And this is my friend Buffy.
- Nice to meet you both.

122
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:03,761
I'm nice to meet.

123
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:07,289
Will we be studying operant conditioning
in the first semester?

124
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:10,171
I hear that's kind of
Professor Walsh's specialty.

125
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:13,290
Absolutely. You know her treatise
on Dietrich's work?

126
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:14,522
I know of it.

127
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:18,811
It's a fascinating read,
if you're into that sort of thing.

128
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:20,611
- They have it here.
- Oh, where?

129
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,891
I'll show you. I don't meet many freshmen
that know much about psychology.

130
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:29,603
- Well, it's fascinating.
- Yeah, you know, cos everyone's got a brain.

131
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,764
Or, almost everyone.

132
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:56,205
- Hi.
- Oh, hi! Are you Buffy?

133
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:58,848
- Yeah.
- Kathy.

134
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,572
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

135
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:03,211
Yeah!

136
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,932
So, it's, uh... it's a pretty nice room, huh?

137
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:16,211
Mmm! I was surprised, cos you hear
horror stories about freshmen housing.

138
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,924
- You took the right side.
- Yeah.

139
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:22,206
- But, you know, if you want it...
- No, no.

140
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:25,046
I just wanted to make sure
that's what you wanted.

141
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:29,525
- You excited for classes tomorrow?
- Painfully.

142
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:35,008
I bet there's gonna be a lot of parties to go to
this week, too. Not that I'm a crazy partyer.

143
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,529
And I'm not always this hyper, either.
I'm just excited.

144
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:40,205
Yeah.

145
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:41,726
Me too.

146
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:45,806
I am really glad they put me with
somebody cool. I can tell that you're cool.

147
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,689
I just know that this whole year
is gonna be super fun!

148
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:22,049
The point of this course is not
to critique popular American culture.

149
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:26,082
It is not to pick at it, or look down upon it.

150
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:29,085
And it is not to watch videos for credit.

151
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:33,964
- The point is to examine...
- Do you know if this class is full yet?

152
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:38,968
And there are two people talking at once,
and I know that one of them is me,

153
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:42,966
and the other is... a blonde girl.

154
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:47,288
You. Blonde girl. Stand up.

155
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:55,084
I'm very excited to hear what you have to say
that's worth interrupting my lecture for.

156
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,968
I was just asking if the class was still open.

157
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:06,442
If I could still sign up.

158
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:11,603
If your name isn't on this sheet,
then you are wasting everyone's time.

159
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:14,366
- Are you on the sheet?
- They told me that if I...

160
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:16,284
Do you understand?

161
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:21,208
You are sucking energy from everyone
in this room. They came here to learn.

162
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,291
Get out!

163
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:28,127
I didn't mean to... suck.

164
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,522
Leave!

165
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:32,604
Thank you.

166
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,527
If you're looking for psych, it's through here.

167
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:50,604
Oh, thanks.

168
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,366
- How's your head?
- Sorry?

169
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:55,011
Yesterday.

170
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,685
In the bookstore.

171
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:59,571
- You don't remember.
- Oh, no, sure, I remember you.

172
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,372
- You're Willow's friend.
- Yeah.

173
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:03,886
My head's fine.

174
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:08,569
Itjust stung for a bit and I lost most
of my basic motor functions. It's no biggie.

175
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,644
We're here.

176
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:14,485
- I'm sorry. I'm trying to remember your...
- Buffy.

177
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:18,202
- Buffy. Right. Have fun today, OK?
- Thanks.

178
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,170
You know, I was just wondering.

179
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:29,964
Professor Walsh isn't planning on yelling at
me and kicking me out of the class, is she?

180
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:32,886
- It's not in her lesson plan.
- Great!

181
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:42,841
- How was Pop Culture?
- I decided not to take it.

182
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,851
It seemed dull.

183
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:50,165
OK. This is Psych 105, Introduction
to Psychology. I am Professor Walsh.

184
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:54,970
Those who fall into my good graces
will come to know me as Maggie.

185
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:59,968
Those who don't will come to know me by
the name my TAs use and think I don't know:

186
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:02,442
the Evil Bitch Monster of Death.

187
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:09,081
Make no mistake, I run a hard class,
I talk fast and I expect you to keep up.

188
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,723
If you're looking to coast,
I recommend Geology 101.

189
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,088
That's where the football players are.

190
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:32,402
- Sorry.
- No, I wasn't looking.

191
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:35,087
Did you, uh, lose your way?

192
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:38,563
Me? No, no. I'm just going to Fischer Hall,

193
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:42,043
which I know is on the earth planet.

194
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:48,208
- Recently voted most pathetic. Uh-huh.
- Well, I'm lost, and I have a map. So...

195
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,090
Oh! I come in second.

196
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:53,087
- I'm Buffy, by the way.
- Eddie.

197
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:55,171
OK, so...

198
00:14:56,453 --> 00:15:00,207
- So that's Fischer Hall, right?
- OK, and this is Dunworth Building.

199
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:03,888
That's my dorm. It's just... it's us I can't find.

200
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:06,204
- Are we the blue part?
- No.

201
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,764
- Yes.
- So if I came from there,

202
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:12,846
then we would just wanna go
that way to the... bike path.

203
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:15,567
You sound very certain. I'm in.

204
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:22,843
Are you taking Psych 105
with Professor Walsh?

205
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:27,688
Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna try.
She's not afraid of the long words, huh?

206
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:31,368
She's pretty intense.
A lot of the courses are really tough.

207
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:35,082
I'm a little upset. I had it on good authority
that this was a party school.

208
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:37,448
I think it's supposed to get easier.

209
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,411
I still feel like carrying around
a security blanket.

210
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:43,485
Of Human Bondage. Have you ever read it?

211
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:48,208
Oh, I'm not really into porn.
I'm trying to cut way back.

212
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:52,366
No. There's no actual bondage,
it's just a novel.

213
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:56,446
I've read it, like, ten times.
I always keep it by my bed.

214
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:59,569
Security blanket.

215
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:03,931
I don't really have a security blanket.
Unless, of course, you count Mr Pointy.

216
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,571
Mr Pointy?

217
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:07,609
Oh. Bike path.

218
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:12,445
It's nice to know that I'm not the only
entirely confused person on this campus.

219
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:15,684
- I suspect there's a lot of us.
- I'll look for you in psych.

220
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:19,368
Yeah. We can help each other
figure out what they're talking about.

221
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:22,047
- OK.
- Maybe even make it through the year.

222
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,923
- Good night.
- Night.

223
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:42,205
I'm sorry. Did you lose your way?

224
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,606
- You looking for someone?
- Yeah.

225
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:30,446
You made a friend? Good for you!

226
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,524
Thanks, Mom.

227
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,171
Yeah, Eddie just took off.
Packed his stuff, left a note.

228
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:41,165
Happens sometimes.
People just can't handle it.

229
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:45,565
There's always a few kids who lose it
early in the first semester and just bail.

230
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:47,852
Weak ones, I guess.

231
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,605
Boring.

232
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:13,085
Boring.

233
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,325
Boring.

234
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,607
Boring... boring.

235
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:21,445
Boring.

236
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,044
Astonishingly boring. We...

237
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:27,651
We have to kill cooler people.
Will somebody remind me?

238
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,567
You were the one who said pick on
the weak ones. Thin the herd and all that.

239
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,006
Does this sweater make me look fat?

240
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,005
No, the fact that you're fat
makes you look fat.

241
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:40,971
That sweaterjust makes you look purple.

242
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:44,082
You're such a loser.

243
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:46,368
Hey, words can hurt like a fist.

244
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,969
Hey! Check it out!

245
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,772
Well? Do we have a Klimt?

246
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:56,251
- Yes!
- Big score for Klimt!

247
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:03,090
Monet still well in the lead, but look out
for Team Klimt, coming from behind.

248
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:07,605
Freshmen. Man, they're so predictable.

249
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:10,253
And you can never eatjust one.

250
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,291
- Yeah, I'm hungry!
- What a shock.

251
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:17,642
- We eat when I say we eat.
- Well, we could hit the tunnels...

252
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:20,293
We eat when I say we eat!

253
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:22,170
God, lighten up!

254
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:25,409
I think it's funny when you scream.

255
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:28,485
It's like... Whoa!

256
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:33,843
I gotta get me some better lackeys, I swear.
You guys are useless.

257
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:37,767
- I shouldn't take you on the hunt.
- Great! Let dead Eddie get your dinner!

258
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:39,844
That's pretty much the plan.

259
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:53,847
Giles?

260
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:57,926
Rupert, is this blue cheese
or is itjust cheese that's gone blue?

261
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,965
You're not Giles.

262
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:07,365
You know, the door was open, so I just...

263
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:11,447
- Giles does still live here, right?
- He does.

264
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:16,128
He appears. Rupert, you have a guest.

265
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:18,204
Buffy. Hello.

266
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,969
Is this a bad time?

267
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,566
No.

268
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:24,450
Oh, forgive me.

269
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:29,561
This is Olivia. She's, er, an old friend.
She's staying over for a few days.

270
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:33,646
Couldn't pass through sunny Cal
without looking up old Ripper.

271
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:39,205
Buffy's, um... was a student of mine.
And how is university?

272
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:42,968
Pretty much the same as high school,
in the sense of I need help.

273
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:45,044
Ah, help. Yes.

274
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:47,843
But this just looks like a bad time.

275
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:52,324
No, you guys talk. I'll just go slip into
something a little less comfortable.

276
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:57,208
So, trouble with...

277
00:20:57,293 --> 00:21:00,126
- studies?
- This is a bad time.

278
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:03,126
- You keep saying that.
- It looks pretty bad!

279
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:06,125
Someone had a little too much
free time on their hands.

280
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:09,171
- I'm not supposed to have a private life?
- No!

281
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:12,404
Because you're very, very old, and it's gross.

282
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:18,449
Well, before I succumb to the ravages of age,
why don't you tell me what brings you here?

283
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:22,807
- There's a student missing.
- Yes?

284
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:28,123
Eddie. He's supposed to have left school,
but... I just don't think he did.

285
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:31,171
I met him last night,
then I went back where we met,

286
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:34,211
and it looked like there had been a struggle.

287
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,329
- And?
- And we need to stop this!

288
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:38,369
Eddie's RA said kids disappear a lot.

289
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:41,047
There could be vampires
working the campus.

290
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:46,002
- We need research and charts and stuff.
- I still don't see where I fit in.

291
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:49,290
You haven't described anything
that you can't do yourself.

292
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:54,130
OK, remember before you became Hugh
Hefner, when you used to be a watcher?

293
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:59,606
Officially you no longer have a watcher.
Buffy, I'll always be here when you need me.

294
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:04,847
Your safety is more important than anything,
but you'll have to take care of yourself.

295
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:08,528
You're out of school and I can't
always be there to guide you.

296
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:12,967
- I'm sorry to bug you.
- Buffy...

297
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:17,849
Oh, no. I mean, yeah, you're... you're right.
I can handle this.

298
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,284
It's just I...

299
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:22,684
I'm on it.

300
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:25,573
I am here if you need me.

301
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,644
- She's gone?
- Yes.

302
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:31,923
- So, did you help her?
- I'm not sure.

303
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:42,606
How am I supposed to hunt in this mob?

304
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:45,366
Don't you people have homes?

305
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:51,845
Eddie?

306
00:22:57,253 --> 00:23:03,044
Eddie! Eddie, hey! Wait up. God, I was
worried something had happened to you.

307
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,125
And of course it has,
because you're a vampire.

308
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:09,607
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

309
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:23,484
The Slayer!

310
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:26,531
Wow. Um, I heard you might be coming here.

311
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:31,572
This is... I mean, what a challenge.
The Slayer.

312
00:23:31,653 --> 00:23:34,213
- And you are?
- I'm Sunday.

313
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,682
I'll be killing you here in a minute or so.

314
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:39,765
That threat gets more frightening
every time I hear it.

315
00:23:40,893 --> 00:23:45,921
Are we gonna fight? Or is there just
gonna be a monster sarcasm rally?

316
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:48,083
I'm in for a piece.

317
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:51,644
Everybody gets to play.

318
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:55,688
Guys, this... is totally... mine.

319
00:23:56,453 --> 00:23:58,842
OK, but you gotta share the eatin'.

320
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:04,485
Cos I'm thinking Slayer's blood's
gotta be - whoa! - like Thai stick.

321
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:07,726
Aren't people supposed
to get smarter in college?

322
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,566
I think you had misconceptions
about college.

323
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:14,692
Like anyone would be
caught dead wearing that.

324
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:33,488
Don't take this the wrong way, but...

325
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:36,244
you fight like a girl.

326
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:20,644
Freshmen!

327
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:10,165
No, no, no, no, no! The best part was
when you ragged on her clothes.

328
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:14,644
She was like "No! Not the ensemble!"

329
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:21,289
Those jeans? With the little patches?
She has no one to blame but herself.

330
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,204
I heard they're coming back.

331
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:26,490
Not if I kill every single person
who wears them.

332
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:29,849
You shoulda let us have a piece.
We could've finished her off.

333
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,766
She's not gonna last the night.
She's a done deal.

334
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:37,287
In fact, guys,

335
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:39,443
you're gonna hit the tunnels.

336
00:26:52,173 --> 00:26:53,765
Mom?

337
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,763
- Buffy.
- Hi.

338
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,845
- Honey, how are you?
- I'm OK.

339
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:05,401
How's college? Have you been fighting?

340
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:07,961
Oh, they started it.

341
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:10,362
Just as long as you're being careful.

342
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:13,251
I really didn't think
you'd show here for a while.

343
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:16,765
Oh, I didn't have classes today and...

344
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:20,528
everything's been so hectic
I figured it'd be nice to crash for...

345
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:23,566
Oh, well, yeah.

346
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:26,772
I didn't think you'd be back
for a couple of weeks.

347
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,572
But I didn't move anything.
It's still your room.

348
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:34,572
- You filled it with packing crates.
- Yeah, but I didn't move anything.

349
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,282
If it's still my room,
shouldn't I be able to fit in it?

350
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:42,571
Well, it's just for a couple of weeks
while we do inventory at the gallery.

351
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:45,690
I just really didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

352
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:47,764
Neither did I.

353
00:27:57,213 --> 00:27:59,204
Hello?

354
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,524
Hello?

355
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:51,525
 We are

356
00:28:56,773 --> 00:28:58,764
 Electricity

357
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:10,126
 Conducting sparks

358
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:17,688
 Shower with me

359
00:29:25,853 --> 00:29:29,402
 We made this about

360
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:38,202
 We made this about

361
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,604
 You and me

362
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:52,444
 You and me

363
00:30:11,053 --> 00:30:14,602
The whole world in front of her
and she comes back to this dive.

364
00:30:15,053 --> 00:30:17,044
- Xander!
- Hey, Buff.

365
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:19,203
- When did you get back?
- Couple days ago.

366
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:21,682
Freak of nature! Why didn't you call me?

367
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:25,368
You were starting the college adventure
and I didn't want to,

368
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:27,489
you know, help you move.

369
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:32,092
I missed you. How was your trip?
Is America nice? I hear it's nice.

370
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:35,605
There's some purple mountains majesty,
I have to say.

371
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:37,684
What'd you do? What'd you see?

372
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,204
- Well...
- Tell me!

373
00:30:41,053 --> 00:30:43,851
- Grand Canyon!
- You saw the Grand Canyon!

374
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:47,972
Well, I saw the movie Grand Canyon
on cable. Really lame.

375
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:53,209
Basically, I got as far as Oxnard
and the engine fell out of my car.

376
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:54,851
And that was literally.

377
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:59,563
So I washed dishes at the fabulous Ladies
Nightclub for about a month and a half

378
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:03,089
while I tried to pay for the repairs.
No one bothered me or...

379
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:06,449
even spoke to me until one of
the male strippers called in sick,

380
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:09,843
and no power on earth will make me
tell you the rest of that story.

381
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:13,608
Suffice to say I traded my car for one
that wasn't entirely made of rust,

382
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:17,766
came home to my loving parents,
where everything was exactly as it was,

383
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:21,323
except I sleep in the basement
and I have to pay rent.

384
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,722
- How's college?
- Male strippers.

385
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:26,088
No power on this earth.

386
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:27,652
OK.

387
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:31,965
- College is good.
- OK, once more with even less feeling.

388
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:35,648
No, really! I mean, Willow's in heaven and...

389
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:39,284
Oz has this really cool house
off-campus with the band.

390
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:44,128
And you're sitting here alone at the Bronze
looking like you have cancer of the puppy.

391
00:31:45,373 --> 00:31:47,364
It's just...

392
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:52,041
there was this vampire
and she took me down, and I just...

393
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:55,686
- I don't know how to stop her.
- Then where's the gang?

394
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:59,561
- Avengers assemble! Let's get it going!
- No, I don't wanna bug them.

395
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:03,407
I mean, they're just starting school
and they don't need this.

396
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:06,053
OK, Buff, what's the what here?

397
00:32:08,853 --> 00:32:10,844
It's just,

398
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,763
what if I can't cut it?

399
00:32:13,853 --> 00:32:16,367
Can't cut what? Slaying?

400
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:18,444
Slaying. Everything.

401
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:25,889
This is all about fear. It's understandable,
but you can't let it control you.

402
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:29,241
Fear leads to anger.

403
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:31,688
Anger leads to hate.

404
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:33,764
Hate leads to anger.

405
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:38,049
No, wait, hold on. Fear leads to hate.

406
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,124
Hate leads to the dark side.

407
00:32:40,973 --> 00:32:42,964
Hold on, no.

408
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:48,051
First you get the women,
then you get the money, then you...

409
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,124
OK, can we forget that?

410
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:54,448
Thanks for the Dadaist pep talk.
I feel much more abstract now.

411
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:56,728
The point is, you're Buffy.

412
00:32:57,293 --> 00:33:02,321
- Yeah. Maybe in high school I was Buffy.
- And now in college you're Betty Louise?

413
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:06,406
Yeah, I'm Betty Louise Plotnick
of East Cupcake, Illinois.

414
00:33:06,493 --> 00:33:08,484
I might as well be.

415
00:33:10,853 --> 00:33:12,844
Buffy,

416
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:16,490
I've gone through some
fairly dark times in my life,

417
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:21,852
faced some scary things. Among them the
kitchen at the fabulous Ladies Nightclub.

418
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:26,051
Let me tell you something.
When it's dark and I'm all alone,

419
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:29,091
and I'm scared or freaked out or whatever,

420
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,609
I always think "What would Buffy do?"

421
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,204
You're my hero.

422
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:43,084
OK, sometimes when it's dark and I'm
all alone, I think "What is Buffy wearing?"

423
00:33:43,173 --> 00:33:46,563
That'd be one of those things
you never ever tell me about?

424
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:48,644
It's a deal.

425
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:52,845
Let's put this bitch in the ground.
What do you say?

426
00:33:56,853 --> 00:33:58,844
I think...

427
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:01,484
I say thank you.

428
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,890
And nothing says thank you
like dollars in the waistband.

429
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:07,166
OK, what do we do first?

430
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:13,206
Kids disappearing every year.

431
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:17,411
Not too many. Just enough so that
everyone thinks they up and left.

432
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:22,692
I can't believe the vampires took your stuff.
Murder I expect, but petty larceny seems so...

433
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:23,967
petty.

434
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:28,046
They have to be keeping it somewhere.
On campus or at least nearby.

435
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,727
Hey, how far back do the disappearances go?

436
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:36,567
They weren't too common before '82.

437
00:34:36,853 --> 00:34:39,048
Magic number! Check this out.

438
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:45,607
"Psi Theta loses its charter.
Building to be closed for renovation."

439
00:34:45,693 --> 00:34:48,048
1982. Look at this.

440
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:52,763
"Former Psi Theta house lies dormant
while issues drag on before the city council."

441
00:34:52,853 --> 00:34:55,242
- We have a winner.
- Looks pretty cherry.

442
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,528
You up for a little reconnaissance?

443
00:34:58,373 --> 00:35:03,208
- Where we all sculpt and paint and stuff?
- No, that was the Renaissance.

444
00:35:03,293 --> 00:35:05,682
Oh. I've had a really long week.

445
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:08,164
Let's go look at the house.

446
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,764
Score!

447
00:35:30,173 --> 00:35:32,562
Oh! That's my skirt!

448
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:36,248
You're never gonna fit in it with
those hips! We have to kill them.

449
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:39,891
- We need weapons.
- I don't see my weapons trunk there.

450
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,362
It was right by my bed.

451
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:44,684
Mr Gordo?

452
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:50,645
Go to my room. If it's not there, try Willow's.

453
00:35:50,853 --> 00:35:54,129
I'll keep an eye... My diary?!

454
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:56,204
Uh-oh. Score.

455
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:59,284
I'll hurry.

456
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:08,171
Laugh all you want.
This time we play it my way.

457
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:10,130
And the rules are gonna be...

458
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,564
Say, don't I know you from...

459
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:28,930
beating the crap outta you?

460
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:31,604
I just thought I'd drop in.

461
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:34,924
Get it? Drop in?

462
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:38,284
Boy! Tough room.

463
00:36:38,453 --> 00:36:41,126
I must say, you've really got me now.
I mean,

464
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:46,571
this is a diabolical plan. Throw yourself at
my feet with a broken arm and no weapons?

465
00:36:46,653 --> 00:36:50,407
- How am I gonna get outta this one?
- You got a nice setup here.

466
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:53,246
- But you made one mistake.
- What was that?

467
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:58,245
I'm not actually positive, but statistically
speaking people usually make...

468
00:36:58,853 --> 00:37:02,209
- It seemed kinda weird.
- Weird's a pretty good word for it.

469
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:06,525
Buffy wouldn'tjust take off.
That's just not in her nature.

470
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:10,242
Except when she disappeared for
several months and changed her name,

471
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:14,372
but there were circumstances then.
There's no circumstances.

472
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:16,967
Does Buffy have a history
of emotional problems?

473
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:20,489
Cos on my request form I was specific
about a stable nonsmoker.

474
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:25,044
- I don't think this is her handwriting.
- I bet there were circumstances!

475
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:29,330
We've probably been so wrapped up
in our own petty lives that...

476
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,486
that we totally missed the circumstances.
We're bad friends!

477
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:36,963
- Well, let's think this through.
- How can you be so calm?

478
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:39,484
Long, arduous hours of practice.

479
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:43,009
Now either Buffy took off,
or she was robbed, or...

480
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:45,084
- It's a prank!
- Xander!

481
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:47,644
How are my guys?

482
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:53,283
- I don't know you, do I?
- No.

483
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:56,365
- This is very intrusive, isn't it?
- Little bit!

484
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:58,605
- Xander.
- Kathy.

485
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:01,852
- Do we hug?
- I think we're too manly.

486
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:03,924
- What's the prank?
- Prank?

487
00:38:04,013 --> 00:38:08,370
Oh, the room. Some friends of Buffy's
played a funny joke, and they took her stuff.

488
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:12,924
Now she wants us to help get it back from her
friends who sleep all day and have no tans.

489
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:17,206
- Oh! Those friends!
- They're funny guys.

490
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:23,365
They took the chest.
Well, let's go! Let's go to our friend.

491
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:26,047
- It's nice meeting you, Kathy.
- You, too!

492
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:28,886
- Let's go to Will's, get supplies.
- Is Buffy in danger?

493
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,441
She's in a holding pattern.
We've got some time.

494
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:42,286
Oh, and this. This is my favourite item.

495
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,844
You don't wanna touch that.

496
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,932
You know, this arm's not looking so good.

497
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:57,850
- It might have to come off.
- You wanna know the truth? I only need one.

498
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:13,083
This is starting to suck.

499
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:40,444
When you look back at this,
before you to turn to dust,

500
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:43,684
I think you'll find the mistake
was touching my stuff.

501
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:49,365
What about breaking your arm?

502
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:53,929
- How does that feel?
- Let me answer that with a head butt.

503
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:03,126
And for the record... the arm is hurt.

504
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:06,604
It's not broken.

505
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:12,932
Hey, Buff. Need a hand?

506
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:14,922
No, thanks.

507
00:40:18,213 --> 00:40:20,204
I'm good.

508
00:40:26,653 --> 00:40:30,407
So, all that other stuff in there?
That's gonna sit in there, right?

509
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:34,202
- No one owns it in the strictest sense.
- It seems wrong somehow.

510
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:36,602
- Dibs on the rowing machine.
- Buffy!

511
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:41,243
- Hi, Giles.
- What's with the arsenal?

512
00:40:41,653 --> 00:40:43,644
I've been awake all night.

513
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:48,443
I'm supposed to teach you self-reliance,
but I can't leave you out there to fight alone.

514
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:51,366
To hell with what's right.
I'm ready to back you up.

515
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:54,445
Let's find the evil and fight it together.

516
00:40:56,173 --> 00:40:58,971
Great! Thanks! We'll get right on that.

517
00:41:00,373 --> 00:41:02,967
- The evil is this way?
- My room is.

518
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:05,647
Giles, can you get this box on top?

519
00:41:06,773 --> 00:41:09,367
So, college not so scary after all, huh?

520
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:13,921
It's turning out to be a lot like high school,
which I can handle.

521
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:16,244
At least I know what to expect.

522
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:25,808
