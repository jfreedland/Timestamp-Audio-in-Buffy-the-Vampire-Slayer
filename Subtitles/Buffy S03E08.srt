1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:07,007
This is a nightmare. My world is spinning.

2
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:11,428
- It's not that bad, Willow. Really.
- 140, verbal?

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,597
I'm pathetic. Illiterate.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,267
I'm Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel.

5
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:21,271
And the fact that your 140, verbal,
resembles my combined score

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,941
in no way compromises
your position as the village idiot.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,111
I just... Where did I go wrong?

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,074
You did amazing, Willow. As usual.

9
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,785
- You guys get your scores?
- Cordelia!

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:39,664
Willow was very sad about her
academic failure. How did you do?

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,918
- This is not good.
- What's not good?

12
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:48,423
It may hurt my standing as campus stud
when people find out I'm dating a brain.

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,719
Please. I have some experience
in covering these things up.

14
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,055
I can see why you'd be upset.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,681
That was my sarcastic voice.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,976
- It sounds like your regular voice.
- I've been told that.

17
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,938
- We should celebrate.
- Like, the four of us?

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,900
A double date. It could have potential.

19
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,236
Buffy, hey! Did you get your SAT scores?

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,451
By the look on your face, I guess we'll be
manning the drive-thru window side by side.

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,122
They're just test scores, right?
What do they really mean, anyway?

22
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,211
1430! Buffy, you kicked ass!

23
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,174
OK, so academic achievement
gets me a little excited.

24
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,760
- Buff, that's amazing.
- Let me see that.

25
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,805
With those scores you can apply anywhere.

26
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,724
Buffy, this could change your whole future.

27
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,269
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Then why the sour puss?

28
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,897
I don't know. I guess... my future...

29
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,234
I never thought about it.
I wasn't even sure I'd have one.

30
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,488
I think this is great. Now you can
leave and never come back.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,284
I mean it in a positive way. Get out
of Sunnydale. It's a good thing.

32
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,621
What kind of moron would
want to come back here?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,055
Home... sweet... home.

35
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,033
# And more, much more than this

36
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:24,287
# I did it my way

37
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,583
Drusilla! I'm home!

38
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,901
Why did you do it, baby?
Why did you leave me?

39
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,406
We were happy here.

40
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,710
You stupid, worthless bitch!

41
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,715
Look what you've done to me.

42
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,302
Come on. It'll be fun.

43
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,557
I don't know. I thought we were gonna
do something, you know... classy?

44
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,768
What's classier than bowling?

45
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,271
Apart from everything ever? Let's see.

46
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,357
Oz and Willow are down.
You're the swing vote.

47
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,110
I guarantee fun.

48
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,782
- Hey, those are from the pier.
- Yeah. I just got 'em developed.

49
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,287
There's pictures. Of me. In your locker.

50
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,832
I never knew I was locker-door material.

51
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,962
Well, just barely. Besides, I look
really cute in those pictures.

52
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,090
Hey, so what's the verdict? Do we bowl?

53
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,970
- We bowl.
- Great. Bowling date. I'm on Oz's team.

54
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,474
Yeah? Well, prepare to be crushed.

55
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,517
Maybe we should practise.

56
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,145
They don't stand a chance. I'm really good.

57
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,608
Or I used to be, when they had
the inflatable things in the gutters.

58
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,363
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

59
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,741
- What's the occasion?
- Pretty much you are.

60
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,581
- It's a little Pez witch!
- It's kind of a theme present.

61
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,543
- Do you like it?
- I like... I more than like.

62
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,505
Oz, this is probably the sweetest...

63
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,259
We have to find a little Pez werewolf,
so little Pez witch can have a boyfriend.

64
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:48,390
I don't think they make a werewolf Pez. We
might have to settle for a wacky cartoon dog.

65
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,643
This is just so thoughtful.

66
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,105
Well, I think about you.

67
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,233
Oh, I don't have anything to give you.

68
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,778
Yeah, you do.

69
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,163
Buffy, this is remarkable.

70
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,875
So is this. Where is this
retreat thingy? The Yukon?

71
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,672
It's quite nearby. It's a clearing
at the top of Breakers Woods.

72
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,885
It's the site of some
fascinating druidic rituals.

73
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,639
But you're just going for a few days, right?

74
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,809
You're not gonna settle there
and grow crops or anything?

75
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:38,189
What? Oh, my gear? No, no, no,
this is basic necessities.

76
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,984
Giles. You pack like me.

77
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,906
Here. I suspect your mother will
want to... put it on the refrigerator.

78
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,244
Yeah. She saw these scores and
her head spun around and exploded.

79
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,372
I've been on the Hellmouth too long.

80
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,208
- That was metaphorical, yes?
- Yes.

81
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,586
She was happy.

82
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,673
She started with all this crazy talk
about me going to college.

83
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,092
Maybe someplace else.

84
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:10,555
I know. I said you were gonna have a goat.
Responsibilities. I know the drill.

85
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,351
- She may be right.
- Yeah, no, I figured you...

86
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,188
OK. Be kind. Rewind.

87
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:23,443
With scores like these, Buffy,
you could have a first-rate education.

88
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,282
I'm not suggesting that
you ignore your calling,

89
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,744
but you need to look to your future.

90
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:37,874
And with Faith here,
it may be that you can... move on.

91
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,670
For a time, at least.

92
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,545
Wow.

93
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,715
Well, let's discuss it when I get back.

94
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,386
In the meantime, I'd like you
to continue training.

95
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,846
And please don't do anything rash.

96
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,557
"Anything rash" meaning...?

97
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,268
Are you planning on seeing Angel?

98
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,314
Yes, actually. I am.

99
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,694
Look, but there's not
gonna be any rash. Anywhere.

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,032
OK, we're friends.
That's all either of us wants.

101
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,119
Nothing's gonna happen.

102
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,788
- Something's gonna happen.
- Like what?

103
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,375
It's a mistake. It's a terrible, fatal mistake.

104
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,293
- I see that now.
- It's just bowling.

105
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,340
It's bad bowling. It's a double date.
With all of us. They're gonna know.

106
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,761
- How are they gonna know?
- It's a very intimate situation.

107
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,474
It's all sexy with the smoke
and sweating and shoe rental.

108
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,853
- You're turned on by rented shoes?
- That's not the issue.

109
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,314
Let me ask you this. What are they
gonna know? That we're friends.

110
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,402
Old friends. Maybe we've had
one or two indiscretions, but that's past.

111
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:52,449
Look, we're just very good friends who like
to hang out. And can I kiss your ear lobe?

112
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,617
No. Well, OK.

113
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,703
No. Pez.

114
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,709
Maybe bowling might be
too much to handle. Man!

115
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:10,467
I wish I wasn't so attracted to you.
I wish we could make it all stop.

116
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,720
Any suggestions?

117
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,890
Carnegie Mellon has
a wonderful design curriculum.

118
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,478
And Brown University's history programme
is... You like history, right?

119
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,816
Could we talk about this another time?
All day it's been "Congratulations! Go away."

120
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,069
That's not it. It's just...

121
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,655
You belong at a good old-fashioned college
with keg parties and boys.

122
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,326
Not here with hellmouths and vampires.

123
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,661
Not really seeing the distinction.

124
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:43,583
You always talk about how you wish you
could lead a normal life. This is your chance.

125
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,379
Yeah, it's just not that simple.
I have responsibilities.

126
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,590
I know, but I spoke with
Mr Giles and he said...

127
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,844
That Faith can be Miss Sunnydale
in the Slayer Pageant. I know.

128
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,349
It's time to think about your future,
Buffy. About your whole life.

129
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,435
I mean, is there anything keeping you here?

130
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,754
Yeah, you.

131
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,299
You think I'm afraid of you?

132
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,098
We were happy.

133
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,267
You brainwashed her.

134
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,144
I could just...

135
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,986
Yeah, I'll show you who's a cool guy.

136
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,239
You're goin' down.

137
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,787
This is just too much.

138
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,541
Did you come in through the back?

139
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,960
Yeah. I need a curse.

140
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,338
A what?

141
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,424
A curse. You know, something nasty.

142
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,635
Boils. I want to give him boils.

143
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,389
All over his face. You know, dripping
pustules. Really go for the gusto here.

144
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,141
I'm hearing a lot of negative energy, and...

145
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:09,020
Leprosy. I want a spell
that makes his parts fall off.

146
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,065
We don't carry leprosy.

147
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,860
Would you excuse me a moment?

148
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,531
Blessed be. Anything
in particular I can help you find?

149
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:24,411
Yeah. It's all here on the list:
essence of rose thorn, canary feathers...

150
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,000
A love spell. Want that old lover
to come back to you?

151
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,004
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?
- No. I mean, yes.

152
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:39,384
I know how to do a love spell,
but this is more of an anti-love spell.

153
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,846
Yeah. Kind of a de-lusting.

154
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,140
The supplies are basically the same, right?

155
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:50,937
Basically. Although raven feathers tend to
breed a little more discontent than canary.

156
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,523
Let me just get some things.

157
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,280
That'll be $15.80 for the lot.

158
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,452
Thanks.

159
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,375
So, did you find a spell book?

160
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,170
Forget the book.

161
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,971
I just got a better idea.

162
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,901
Oh, look at that. Every time. Cuts to the left.

163
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,946
And it's not the carpet. It's me.

164
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,658
I swear, I would sell my soul
for a decent short game.

165
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,870
Of course, it's a little late for that.

166
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:56,043
I don't suppose I could offer your soul?
It would really help me on the green.

167
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,090
I'm just funnin'. So, we have
a Spike problem, do we?

168
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:06,512
He's been spotted back in town and there was
an incident at a magic shop in broad daylight.

169
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,516
- The police had a helluva time covering it up.
- Well, yes.

170
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,560
He was up to all sorts
of shenanigans last year.

171
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,355
We had a world of fun
trying to guess what he'd do next.

172
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,856
I remember.

173
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,777
But I guess we're past that now.

174
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,198
This year is too important to let
a loose cannon rock the boat.

175
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:30,244
Should I have Mr Trick send a...
committee to deal with this?

176
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,831
"Loose cannon rock the boat."
Is that a mixed metaphor?

177
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,378
Boats did have cannons.
And a loose one would cause it to rock.

178
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,507
Honestly. I don't know where
my mind goes these days.

179
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,344
Why don't you take care of that Spike
problem? A committee, like you said.

180
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,222
- As good as done.
- That's swell.

181
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,057
Fore!

182
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,358
- College, huh?
- Higher education.

183
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,528
Kind of an intense proposition.

184
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,697
Where do you wanna go?

185
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,117
I have no idea. My mom
is the one that got all these.

186
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,329
She's so excited, she
can't stop talking about it.

187
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:18,834
I had a really hard time coming up
with an alibi so I could come over here.

188
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,004
- She doesn't know about me?
- Big "no".

189
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,841
She's having enough trouble
with the slayer issue.

190
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,054
I don't think she's ready to
process the information that...

191
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,765
you and I are friends again.

192
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,018
Anyway, I think this college jones
is just a reaction to the slayer thing.

193
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:40,356
- She wants you to get out.
- Someplace a little less hellmouthy.

194
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,027
She has a point. You know?
But there are reasons to stay too.

195
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,738
What are they?

196
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,078
Oh, and there's my slayer duties, obviously.

197
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,165
What do you think I should do?

198
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,250
As a friend?

199
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,672
I think that you should leave.

200
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,174
And this is a good opportunity for you.

201
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,557
Yeah. It's not like there's
any great thing keeping me here.

202
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,358
Thanks for the advice. It's
another perspective to consider.

203
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,736
Where are you goin'?
You just got here. It's early.

204
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,616
Yeah, well, my mom starts worrying
a lot earlier these days.

205
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,035
I'll stop by soon.

206
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,169
Whoa! It smells like church in here.

207
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,755
No, wait. Evil church.

208
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,425
It's just chemistry stuff. An experiment.

209
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,136
So you said when you called.
Why do I have to be here?

210
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,222
It'll help you on the exam.
You're way behind.

211
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,685
But that's why you love me, right?
Academically dangerous.

212
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,812
Here, hold this.

213
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,690
A feather? And who will I be tickling?

214
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,572
OK. Bring mixture to a boil.

215
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,659
I assume this won't make us late
for our evening of bowling magic?

216
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:20,080
There's no magic! I mean... bowling, yeah.

217
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,125
Cordelia and Oz are gonna meet us here later.

218
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,461
Can we turn these lights on?

219
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,051
- Is that a spell book?
- No, no, no. Chemistry book.

220
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,805
Wait a minute. This is love-spell stuff.
You're doin' a love spell?

221
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,683
No, of course not! This is a purely scientific...

222
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,020
de-lusting spell.

223
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,065
For us. I thought it would
go better if you didn't know.

224
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:50,027
Are you nuts? Have you forgotten that
I tend to have bad luck with these spells?

225
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,905
But you said you wished
these feelings could go away.

226
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,743
I wished I was a fireman when we were kids,
but you didn't follow through on that.

227
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,872
I can't do this any more, Xander.
This whole "us" thing is...

228
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,252
Do you need to resort to the black arts
to keep our hormones in check?

229
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,880
At this point, I'm thinking no.

230
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:15,594
I'll get the lights. Clean this place up before
they get here and start asking questions.

231
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,846
Xander!

232
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,307
I need to borrow the little girl.

233
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,226
You don't mind, do you?

234
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,027
Threatening me? That's not nice.

235
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,155
We're all gonna be very best friends.

236
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,034
Xander!

237
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,747
A spell. For me.

238
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,585
- You're gonna do a spell for me.
- What kind of spell?

239
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,297
A love spell. Are you brain dead?

240
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,593
I'm gonna get what's mine.

241
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,096
What's mine.

242
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,016
I'll teach her to walk out on me.

243
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,606
- What are you starin' at?
- Nothin'.

244
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,151
You can do it, right?

245
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,695
You can make Dru love me
again. Make her crawl.

246
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,949
- I can try.
- What are you talking about, trying?

247
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,119
- You'll do it.
- Yes, I'll do it.

248
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,086
You lie to me and I'll shove this through
your face. Right through to your brain!

249
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,464
No, please, no.

250
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,221
She wouldn't even kill me.

251
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,436
She just left.

252
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,400
She didn't even care enough to
cut off my head, or set me on fire.

253
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,278
Is that too much to ask?

254
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,782
You know? Some little sign that she cared?

255
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,954
It was that truce with Buffy that did it.

256
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,249
Dru said I'd gone soft.

257
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,461
Wasn't "demon" enough for the likes of her.

258
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,133
I told her it didn't mean anything. I was
thinkin' of her the whole time. She didn't care.

259
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,595
So, we got to Brazil and she was...

260
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,015
she was just different.

261
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:31,605
I gave her everything. Beautiful jewels,
beautiful dresses with beautiful girls in them.

262
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,441
But nothin' made her happy.

263
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,069
And she would flirt.

264
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,281
I caught her on a bench,
makin' outwith the chaos demon.

265
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,534
Have you ever seen a chaos demon?

266
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,037
They're all slime and antlers.
They're disgusting.

267
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,586
She only did it to hurt me.

268
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:59,383
So I said "I am not
putting up with this any more."

269
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,177
And she said "Fine."

270
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,181
And I said "I've got an un-life, you know?"
And she said...

271
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,727
she said we could still be friends.

272
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,939
God, I'm so unhappy.

273
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,903
- There, there.
- I mean, friends. How could she be so cruel?

274
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,579
That smell.

275
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,332
Your neck.

276
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,587
I haven't had a woman in weeks.

277
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,380
No! No! Hold it.

278
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,884
- Well, unless you count that shopkeeper.
- No. No, hold on.

279
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,764
I'll do your spell for you
and I'll get you Drusilla back,

280
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:53,270
but there will be no "bottle in face" and
there will be no "having" of any kind with me.

281
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,731
All right?

282
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,737
All right.

283
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,158
Get started.

284
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,952
Now, I'm not a real witch, you know.

285
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,331
I don't know if this is gonna work right away.

286
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,084
Well, if at first you don't succeed,

287
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,796
I'll kill him and you try again.

288
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,219
This... isn't enough.

289
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,306
- What?
- Well, there are other ingredients.

290
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,102
And a book. I need a spell book. This isn't it.

291
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,854
You've got it, though. At home?

292
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,524
Not at home. I left it somewhere.

293
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,405
Where?

294
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,165
- Thank God. You are here.
- Not all of us have dates tonight.

295
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,709
Something's up.

296
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,882
We were supposed to meet in here.
I don't know what could have happened.

297
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,720
What is all this stuff?
I'm thinking Weird Science,

298
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,724
Was Willow messing with her magic
again? Maybe they disappeared.

299
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,601
Maybe she turned Xander
into something ishy.

300
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,313
- There was obviously a fight.
- I don't see any blood.

301
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,816
Yeah, either they were taken or they ran or...

302
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,487
- You're having too many "or"s. Pick one.
- I don't know. I need you to find Giles.

303
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,656
I'm gonna look for them.

304
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,826
- Where is Giles?
- He's at a retreat in Breakers Woods.

305
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,705
- I know the spot. But it's a 45-minute drive.
- So motor.

306
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,341
- Giles?
- Are you still working out?

307
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,968
No, Mom. Actually...

308
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,430
I was hoping that we could schedule
a college talk later tonight,

309
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:55,017
I admit I overreacted before.

310
00:23:55,476 --> 00:24:00,898
You don't have to go across the county.
I picked up brochures from nearby schools.

311
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,611
- That's great, Mom, but now's really not...
- Hello, Joyce.

312
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,704
So I'm strolling through the park looking
for a meal, and I happen to walk by,

313
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,041
and she's making out with the chaos demon.

314
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,044
So I said "You know, I don't
have to put up with this."

315
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,090
And she said "Fine." So I said
"Fine, do whatever you like."

316
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,010
I mean, I thought we were gonna make up.

317
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,305
Well, she sounds very unreasonable.

318
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,683
She is. She's out of her mind.

319
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,811
That's what I miss most about her.

320
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,064
Sometimes, even when two people
seem right for each other,

321
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,734
their lives take different paths.
Like when Buffy's father and I...

322
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:50,239
This is different. Our love
was eternal - literally.

323
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,660
You got any of those little marshmallows?

324
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,246
Let me look.

325
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,263
- Spike.
- Oh, my God. Get out of here.

326
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,557
Yeah. You're not invited.

327
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,768
- He'll kill us.
- Not while I breathe. Actually, I don't.

328
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:24,606
- Joyce, listen to me.
- Get out of this house or I will stake you.

329
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,109
You're a very bad man.

330
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,778
Joyce, you can't trust him. Invite me in.

331
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,824
- I'll cut your head off.
- You and what army?

332
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,368
That would be me.

333
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:40,039
Angel, why don't you come on in?

334
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,292
Oh, no.

335
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,086
- You shouldn't have come back.
- I do what I please.

336
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,714
OK, I'm confused again.

337
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,050
Willow!

338
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,470
- You took Willow.
- You do me now, you'll never find the witch.

339
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,221
- Willow's a witch?
- And Xander?

340
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,932
- Him too.
- Xander's a witch?

341
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,685
Where are they?

342
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,646
It doesn't work like that, peaches.

343
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,858
When did you become soul-having?
I thought you outgrew that.

344
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,695
Your friend will work magic for me.
When she does my spell, I'll let them go.

345
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:17,451
- You're not famous for keeping promises.
- You and your poof want to tag along, fine.

346
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,331
But you get in my way,
and you kill your friends.

347
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:37,805
What if they were kidnapped by drug lords?
They could be cutting off Xander's ear now.

348
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,849
Or other parts.

349
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:44,812
Hello?

350
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,776
It's Willow. She's nearby.

351
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,864
What? You can smell her?
She doesn't even wear perfume.

352
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,659
She's afraid.

353
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:03,831
Oh, my God. Is this some sort of residual
werewolf thing? This is very disturbing.

354
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,793
I really agree.

355
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,632
I just need a few supplies
and then I'll take you to...

356
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:21,015
- What's wrong? Not that I care.
- My head. I think I'm soberin' up. It's horrible.

357
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,101
Oh, God. I wish I was dead.

358
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,438
If you close your eyes and wish hard...

359
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,566
Buffy, we still need him to find the others.

360
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:35,237
Need him? He's probably just
got 'em locked up in the factory.

361
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,032
Hey, how thick do you think I am?

362
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,078
Fine. Could we just get this over with?

363
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,669
- Oh, God.
- Now what?

364
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,550
We killed a homeless man on this bench.

365
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,553
Me and Dru.

366
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,640
Those were good times.

367
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:12,775
You know, he begged for mercy
and that only made her bite harder.

368
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,072
I guess you had to be there.

369
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,371
Your work?

370
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,124
Here's a list.

371
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,379
Essence of violet, cloves. Angel?

372
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,255
Right.

373
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,549
A set of runic tablets.

374
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,843
Spike can get the rat's eyes.

375
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,222
I used to bring her rats.

376
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,476
- With the morning paper.
- More moping. That's gonna get her back.

377
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,062
The spell's gonna get her back.

378
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,857
- Lotta trouble for someone who doesn't care.
- Shut your gob.

379
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,735
- She really is just kind of fickle.
- Shut up!

380
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,287
What do you know?
It's your fault, the both of you!

381
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,998
She belongs with me.

382
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,252
I'm nothing without her.

383
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,088
That I'll have to agree with. You're pathetic.

384
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:19,091
You're not even a loser.
You're a shell of a loser.

385
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,219
Yeah? You're one to talk.

386
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,515
Meaning?

387
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,352
The last time I looked in on you two,
you were fightin' to the death.

388
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:34,189
Now you're back making eyes
at each other like nothin' happened.

389
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,401
- Makes me want to heave.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

390
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,738
- Oh, yeah. You're just "friends".
- That's right.

391
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,033
You're not friends.

392
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,036
You'll never be friends.

393
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,788
You'll be in love till it kills you both.

394
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,294
You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll
hate each other till it makes you quiver,

395
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,380
but you'll never be friends.

396
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:04,303
Love isn't brains, children. It's blood.
Blood screamin' inside you to work its will.

397
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,976
I may be love's bitch, but at least
I'm man enough to admit it.

398
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,403
Eye of rat.

399
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,588
Xander? Are you OK?

400
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,508
Dizzy.

401
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:46,095
Kinda nauseous too.

402
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,057
- Do I remember having a fight with Spike?
- You do.

403
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,105
I won, right?

404
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,982
- Kicked his ass?
- You were real brave.

405
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,361
- Do you need to barf?
- No, I'll be OK.

406
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,284
- Where are we?
- The factory. We're locked in the basement.

407
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,788
That burnt-out place
in the middle of nowhere?

408
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,667
- So we're in a scream-all-you-want scenario?
- Pretty much.

409
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:20,963
- Why didn't he just kill us?
- He wants me to do a love spell.

410
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,590
- What?
- Drusilla broke up with him.

411
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,761
Gee, and we'd all hoped those
crazy kids would make it work.

412
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:33,392
He's out of control. I mean, not that
he was Joe Restraint in the old days.

413
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,437
So what are our options?

414
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:41,025
Well, I figure either I refuse
to do the spell and he kills us,

415
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,278
or I do the spell and he kills us.

416
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,489
Give me a third option.

417
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:51,535
He's so drunk he forgets about us and we
starve to death. That's sort of the best one.

418
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:54,121
Will, we're not gonna die.

419
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,876
If he's so drunk, he'll get sloppy,
and then I'll make my move.

420
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:05,883
As long as my move doesn't involve
standing up or using my limbs, we'll be OK.

421
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,554
We're not supposed to.

422
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,766
Exemption for impending-death situation.

423
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,032
Oh, God.

424
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,825
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God. Oz.

425
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,954
We have to get outta here.

426
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,500
Cordy, I...

427
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,879
Cordelia!

428
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,135
I fell.

429
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,395
- OK, we got the stuff. Where are they?
- What's your hurry?

430
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,649
My hurry is my intense desire to get you
out of my life. You cause trouble.

431
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,402
I'll be out of your life
in a few hours. No trouble at all.

432
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,904
Hello, Spike.

433
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,288
No trouble at all.

434
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,420
Lenny. How have you been?

435
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:28,424
Better, since you left.
You should've stayed gone.

436
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,844
- Is that right?
- He was just leaving.

437
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:35,305
- Don't you start anything.
- This pissant used to work for me.

438
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,225
- We can't risk this.
- We don't have a choice.

439
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,602
You other two can walk away from this.

440
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,147
I die, your chums die.

441
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,733
Sorry, we're staying.

442
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,484
Not for long.

443
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,519
Go!

444
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,234
This should be a kick.

445
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,486
I violently dislike you.

446
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,342
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

447
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,680
Don't move, Cordy. Oz went to get help.

448
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,867
- We need to get outta here.
- Can we get to the roof?

449
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:15,507
Yeah, I heard you'd gone soft.
Sad to see it, man.

450
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,677
- Soft?
- Yeah, like baby food.

451
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,140
Well, then. Let's give baby a taste.

452
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,491
- I'm all right.
- You're not up to your full strength.

453
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,243
That window's about to go.

454
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,412
Buffy.

455
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:49,958
Baby like his supper?
Baby like his supper?

456
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,298
Why doesn't baby have a nap?

457
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:01,053
Spike, get down!

458
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,323
Now, that was fun.

459
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,412
Don't tell me that wasn't fun?

460
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:32,042
Oh, God. It's been so long since
I had a decent spot of violence.

461
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:36,046
It really puts things in perspective.

462
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,843
Oh, yeah. You two.
Just friends. No danger there.

463
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:46,765
- Could we just do the damn spell now?
- Sod that. Your friends are at the factory.

464
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,601
I'm really glad I came here, you know?

465
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:54,606
I've been all wrong-headed about this.
Weepin', crawlin', blamin' everybody else.

466
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:59,236
I want Dru back, I've just got to be
the man I was. The man she loved.

467
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:04,324
I'll do what I should have done in
the first place. Find her, wherever she is,

468
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,828
tie her up, torture her, till she likes me again.

469
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,794
Love's a funny thing.

470
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,721
Cordy?

471
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,599
Please hold on.

472
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,393
Xander?

473
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,898
I can't see you.

474
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,323
Cordy?

475
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,371
He created all things
in order that they might exist.

476
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:53,040
The generative forces
of this world are wholesome.

477
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,586
And there is no destructive poison in them.
For the dominion of Hades is not on earth.

478
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,255
For righteousness is immortal.

479
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:04,927
So, Cordelia's gonna be OK?

480
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:09,598
She lost a lot of blood.
None of her vitals were punctured.

481
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:12,893
Has she talked to Xander yet?

482
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:17,940
She wasn't allowed to have visitors
at first. He's going to see her today.

483
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,027
And Oz?

484
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,449
I never knew there was anything
inside me that could feel this bad.

485
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:34,498
For the longest time,
I didn't know what I wanted.

486
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,876
I wanted everything.

487
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,422
And now...

488
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:45,634
I just... I just want him to talk to me again.

489
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,013
Just give it some time.

490
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,932
And be prepared for some grovelling.

491
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,269
Oh, I'm ready. I'm all over grovelling.

492
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,647
Good. See, now, I hear sometimes it works.

493
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,073
Can I come in?

494
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,871
They wouldn't let me see you until now.

495
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,586
Those are flowers.

496
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:31,513
- Look, Cordy, I want you to know that...
- Xander?

497
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,601
Yeah.

498
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,979
Stay away from me.

499
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,982
I was wonderin' when you were comin'.

500
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,944
I'm not coming back.

501
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,158
We're not friends.

502
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:36,912
We never were.

503
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,499
And I can fool Giles.

504
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,460
And I can fool my friends.

505
00:41:43,836 --> 00:41:45,671
But I can't fool myself.

506
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:48,924
Or Spike, for some reason.

507
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:55,431
What I want from you, I can never have.

508
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:01,186
You don't need me
to take care of you any more.

509
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:04,815
- So I'm gonna go.
- I don't accept that.

510
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:09,570
- You have to.
- Look.

511
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:16,535
There's gotta be some way
we can still see each other.

512
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:18,829
There is.

513
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:24,376
Tell me that you don't love me.

514
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:55,384
# Each careful step

515
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:58,512
# Along the highway

516
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:02,433
# And more, much more than this

517
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:08,272
# I did it my way!

518
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:15,312
