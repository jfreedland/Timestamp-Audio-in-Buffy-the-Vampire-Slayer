1
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:03,635
In every generation, there is a Chosen One.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,725
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons and the forces of darkness.

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,894
She is the Slayer.

4
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:26,686
No.

5
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:31,590
Oh, great. A book.

6
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:40,433
Oh, I haven't gone through the new arrivals.
Put it in... that pile.

7
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:44,520
- Here, I'll get it.
- Oh. Thanks, Dave. Willow pile.

8
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:49,138
When I've examined it,
you can... er... skim it.

9
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:53,659
- "Scan" it, Rupert. That's "scan" it.
- Of course.

10
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:55,938
Oh, I know our ways are strange to you.
But soon...

11
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:59,287
you will join us in the 20th century,
with three whole years to spare!

12
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,383
Ms Calendar,

13
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:04,490
I'm sure your computer-science class is
fascinating. But I happen to believe

14
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:08,240
that one can survive in modern society
without being a slave to the...

15
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:12,126
- idiot box.
- That's TV. The idiot box is TV.

16
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:15,805
- This... is the good box.
- I still prefer a good book.

17
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:17,975
The printed page is obsolete.

18
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:22,020
Information isn't bound up any more.
It's an entity.

19
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:24,189
The only reality is virtual.

20
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:27,151
If you're not jacked in,
you're not alive.

21
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:33,783
Thank you, Fritz, for making us all
sound like crazy people.

22
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:38,289
Fritz comes on a little strong,
but he does have a point.

23
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:41,625
You know, for the last two years
more e-mail was sent than regular mail.

24
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,337
More digitized information went
across phone lines than conversations.

25
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:49,475
That is a fact that I regard
with genuine horror.

26
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,444
I'll bet it is.

27
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,696
Alright, guys, let's wrap it up for today.

28
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:56,082
I've just got a few more.
I'll hang for a bit.

29
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:57,326
Cool. Thanks.

30
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,786
Xander, you wanna stay and help me?

31
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:04,308
- Are you kidding?
- Yes. It was a joke I made up.

32
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:07,003
Willow, I love you but... bye!

33
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,643
- See you tomorrow!
- Buffy, wait up!

34
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,797
I'm just going to stay
and clean up a little.

35
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:13,211
I'll... I'll be back in the Middle Ages.

36
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:17,013
Did you ever leave?

37
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:57,482
<b>"I Robot... You Jane"</b>

38
00:05:57,517 --> 00:06:00,486
Willow! Willow, hey, wait up!

39
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:03,239
Oh, Buffy. I didn't even see you.

40
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:07,243
Or hear me! What was up last night?
I tried your line like a million times.

41
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:11,832
- Oh, I was... I was talking.
- Talking to...?

42
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:14,609
Okay, that's it, you have a secret,
and that's not allowed.

43
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:18,882
- Why not?
- 'Cause... there's a rule.

44
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,468
Well... I sort of met someone.

45
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:24,129
I knew it! This is so important!
When did you meet?

46
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:27,515
Last week, after we did
the scanning project in the library.

47
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,269
Does he go here? What's his name?
Have you kissed him? What's he like?

48
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:32,438
No. Malcolm. No. And very nice.

49
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:35,766
You are a thing of evil
for not telling me this right away!

50
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:38,320
Well, I wasn't sure
there was anything to tell.

51
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:41,472
But last night, oh! We talked all night.

52
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:46,265
It was amazing. He's so smart, Buffy,
and... and he's romantic,

53
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,198
and we agree about everything.

54
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:53,278
- What's he look like?
- I don't know.

55
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:04,864
Yes, I will. I promise.

56
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:10,413
So... you've been seeing a guy
and you don't know what he looks like.

57
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:13,217
OK, this is a puzzle.
No, wait, I'm good at these.

58
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:15,610
Does it involve
a midget and a block of ice?

59
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,560
- I met him on line.
- On line for what?

60
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,892
Oh!

61
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:25,028
Morning, kids.

62
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:30,852
- Buffy, are you supposed to be somewhere?
- No, I have a free.

63
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:34,631
Cool. But this is lab time,
so let's make it a nice, short visit, OK?

64
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,883
- Sure.
<i>- You have mail.</i>

65
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,304
It's him.

66
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:45,476
- He's so sweet!
- He's a sweetie.

67
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:49,481
What should I write back?

68
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:53,611
Willow, I think it's really great
that you have this cool pen pal, but...

69
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:56,390
don't you think you're kind of
rushing all into this?

70
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:59,492
- You know what I mean?
- "I'm thinking of you, too."

71
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:01,995
No. That's incredibly stupid.

72
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:07,325
Will, down, girl. Let's focus here, OK?
What do you actually know about this guy?

73
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,546
Oh, see? I knew you'd react like this.

74
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:15,000
Like what? I just wanna make sure
you're careful, that's all.

75
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,427
Buffy...

76
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,015
He could be different than you think.

77
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,094
His name is Malcolm Black. He's 18.

78
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:58,348
He lives is Elmwood, which is about
80 miles from here. And he likes me.

79
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,685
Short? Tall? Skinny? Fat?

80
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:03,688
Why does everything have to be about looks?

81
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:07,066
Not everything, but... some stuff is.

82
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,016
I mean, what if you guys
get really, really intense,

83
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:14,151
and then you find out that he...
has... a hairy back?

84
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:19,094
Well... No. He doesn't talk like
somebody who would have a hairy back.

85
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:24,460
And anyways, that stuff doesn't matter
when you really care about each other.

86
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,380
Maybe I'm not his ideal either.

87
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,176
Hey, I'm just trying to make sure
that he's good enough for you.

88
00:09:31,177 --> 00:09:33,884
I think it's great that you met someone.

89
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:36,473
Hey, Fritz.

90
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:39,930
I'm... looking at the logs.

91
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:42,772
You and Dave are clockin'
a scary amount of computer time.

92
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:46,392
- New project.
- Ooh! Will I be excited?

93
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:47,937
You'll die.

94
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:53,159
This isn't my report. "Nazi Germany
was a model of a well-ordered society"?!

95
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:56,370
I didn't write that! Who's been in my files?

96
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,835
- Guess who.
- Uh... Xander?

97
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,504
Yeah, but keep guessing anyway.

98
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,992
- Xander.
- Aw, I can't fool you.

99
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:10,639
You see right through my petty charade.
Are we going to the Bronze tonight?

100
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:13,907
Not me. I think
I'm gonna call it an early night.

101
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:17,342
Oh. Malcolm, right?
Yeah, I heard.

102
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:19,659
But you're gonna be missing out.
I'm planning to be witty.

103
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:22,450
I'm gonna make fun of
all the people who won't talk to me.

104
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:25,460
That's nice. Have a good time.

105
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:29,239
She certainly looks perky.

106
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:32,969
Yeah. Color in the cheeks,
bounce in the step.

107
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:36,580
I don't like it. It's not healthy.
So, are you going to the Bronze tonight?

108
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:39,616
Oh, probably not,
you probably have some vampire slaying

109
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:42,505
or some lame endeavor
like that, don't you?

110
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,674
Everyone deserts me.

111
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:47,969
- Check out the jealous man!
- What are you talking about?

112
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:50,138
- You're jealous.
- Of what?

113
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,645
Willow has a thang,
and Xander's left hanging.

114
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,084
Oh, that's meaningless drivel.
I'm not interested in Willow like that.

115
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:58,547
Yeah, but you got used to
being the Belle of the Ball.

116
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:01,320
No, it's just... this Malcolm guy?
What's his deal?

117
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:03,847
I mean, tell me
you're not slightly wigged.

118
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:07,465
OK, slightly. I mean, just
not knowing what he's really like.

119
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,497
Or who he really is. I mean,

120
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:12,695
sure, he says he's a high-school student,
but I can say I'm a high-school student.

121
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,055
- You are.
- OK, but I can also say that I'm

122
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:17,294
an elderly Dutch woman. Get me?

123
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:19,620
I mean, who's to say I'm not
if I'm in the elderly Dutch chat room?

124
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:22,090
I get your point.

125
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,009
I get your point.

126
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:29,563
Oh, this guy could be anybody.
He could be weird, or crazy, or old, or...

127
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:32,039
He could be a circus freak.
He's probably a circus freak!

128
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:34,607
Yeah. we read about it all the time.
Y'know, people meet on the 'Net,

129
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:37,387
they talk, they get together,
have dinner, a show...

130
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:39,093
Horrible ax murder.

131
00:11:39,128 --> 00:11:43,805
Willow, axe-murdered by a circus freak?
OK, OK, what do we do?

132
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,066
What are we doing? Xander!

133
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:49,010
You get me started!
We are totally overreacting.

134
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:51,566
But it's fun, isn't it?

135
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,543
I'm jacked in.

136
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,796
I'm jacked in.

137
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:02,051
I'm jacked in.

138
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:06,305
I'm jacked in.

139
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:16,441
Whoa. You're a little late, girl.

140
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,277
- I overslept.
- Till fifth period?

141
00:12:20,988 --> 00:12:23,532
- Talkin' to Malcolm last night?
- Yeah.

142
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:29,956
- What?
- Nothing.

143
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,626
You're having an expression.

144
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,046
I'm not.

145
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,883
But if I was, it'd be saying:
this just isn't like you.

146
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,428
Not like me to have a boyfriend?

147
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,056
He's boyfriendly?

148
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,602
I don't understand why
you don't want me to have this.

149
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,940
I mean, boys don't chase me around
all the time.

150
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:56,944
- I thought you'd be happy for me.
- I just want you to be sure.

151
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,196
To meet him face to face.

152
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:03,493
In daylight, in a crowded place,
with some friends.

153
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:07,324
You know, before
you become all... obsessive.

154
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:10,793
Malcolm and I really care
about each other.

155
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:15,256
Big deal if I blow off
a couple of classes.

156
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,301
I thought you said you overslept.

157
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:21,847
Malcolm said you wouldn't understand.

158
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:24,796
Malcolm was right.

159
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,278
Dave?

160
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,032
Hey there, Dave. Anybody home?

161
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,006
Oh, what do you want?

162
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:46,749
I wanted to ask you something
if you have a minute.

163
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,026
- What is it?
- Well, you're a computer geek...

164
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:53,214
genius...
and I sort of have a technical problem.

165
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,527
If I wanted to find out
something about someone,

166
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:59,554
if-if someone e-mailed me,
could I trace the letter?

167
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,268
Well, you could pull out
somebody's profile

168
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:04,599
based on their user name.

169
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:06,593
But they write
the profile themselves, right?

170
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:08,858
And so they could say
anything they wanted.

171
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:11,652
- True.
- Wow. I had knowledge.

172
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,115
Well, is there a way to find out exactly
where a letter - an e-letter - came from?

173
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,352
I mean, the actual
location of the computer?

174
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:23,206
That's a challenge.

175
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:25,276
'Cause, you see, Willow's got
this boyfriend, Malcolm,

176
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:27,788
- and to tell you the truth, I think...
- Leave Willow alone.

177
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:29,457
What do you mean?

178
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,738
That's none of your business.

179
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:37,038
- Dave, are you Malcolm?
- Of course not.

180
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,517
Dave, what's going on?

181
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:43,311
Look, I'll talk to you later, OK?

182
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:47,423
I've got work to do.

183
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,452
So do I.

184
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:58,369
I'm telling you, something is going on.
It's not just Willow.

185
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,960
Dave, Fritz... they're all wicked jumpy.

186
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:03,458
Those boys aren't
sparklingly normal as it is.

187
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:05,544
- Giles, trust me.
- I do.

188
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:07,963
I-I-I really don't know
how to advise you.

189
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:11,634
Things involving the computer
fill me with a childlike terror.

190
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,591
Now, if it were a nice ogre or some such
I'd be more in my element.

191
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:21,253
I suppose you could "tail" Dave.
See if he's up to something.

192
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:25,599
Follow Dave? What, in dark glasses
and a trench coat? Please.

193
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,809
I can work this out myself.

194
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:29,344
She's too close. What do I do?

195
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:37,812
Party.

196
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,014
Whatever Dave is into, it's large.

197
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,899
- What was the name of this place?
- It said CRD.

198
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:51,143
But, I couldn't get close enough
to see what it was.

199
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,845
Calax Research and Development.
It's a computer research lab.

200
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,734
Third largest employer in Sunnydale
till it closed down last year.

201
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:00,067
What, I can't have information sometimes?

202
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:02,564
It's just somewhat unprecedented.

203
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:06,885
Well, my uncle used to work there...
in a floor-sweeping capacity.

204
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,971
- But it closed?
- Uh-huh.

205
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:10,800
Looked pretty functional
from where I stood

206
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:12,677
I don't have a clue
what they were doing.

207
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:15,087
And what do they need Dave for?

208
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:19,341
Something about computers, right?
I mean, he is off-the-chart smart.

209
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,861
We still don't know an enormous amount.

210
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:24,780
Whatever is going on there
may be on the up and up.

211
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:26,958
No, if CRD opened,
it would've been on the news.

212
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,976
Besides, I can just tell
something's wrong.

213
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:32,998
- My spider sense is tingling.
- Your... spider sense?

214
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:35,664
Pop-culture reference. Sorry.

215
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:37,502
Yes, well, ahem,
I think we're still at a standstill.

216
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:40,714
- Short of breaking into the place...
- Breaking in. This is the plan.

217
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:42,967
- I'm free tonight.
- Tonight it is.

218
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:46,255
A moment, please, of quiet reflection.

219
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,182
I did not suggest
that you illegally enter the...

220
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:54,118
data into the file so the book will be
listed by title as well as author.

221
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:57,693
I just came by to check
your new data base,

222
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:00,402
make sure your
cross reference table isn't glitching.

223
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:02,475
'Cause I'm guessing
you haven't gone anywhere near it.

224
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:05,430
No, I'm still sorting through
the chaos you left behind you.

225
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:07,307
Hmm.

226
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:11,081
You here again? You kids
really dig the library, don't you?

227
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:12,516
We're literary.

228
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:15,252
To read...
makes our speaking English good.

229
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,324
- We'll be going now.
- We-we...

230
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:19,423
will continue this conversation
at another time.

231
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,675
I think, we're done.

232
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:23,470
- "Makes our speaking English is good"?
- I panicked, OK?

233
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:28,225
I've never felt this way
about anyone before, Willow.

234
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,687
I know what you mean.

235
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,899
I feel like you know me
better than anyone.

236
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,321
- I do.
- Do you think we should... meet?

237
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:43,492
I think we should, soon.

238
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:46,370
I'm nervous.

239
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:49,248
I'm not. Isn't that strange?

240
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:51,959
That's what Buffy doesn't understand.

241
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:55,672
How comfortable you can make me feel.

242
00:18:58,008 --> 00:18:59,682
Buffy just makes trouble.

243
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:03,751
That's why she got
kicked out of her old school.

244
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:08,936
How did you know that?

245
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,856
It's on her permanent record.

246
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,319
You must have mentioned it.

247
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:22,284
I guess.

248
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:25,288
Let's not worry about her any more.

249
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:29,042
I have to sign off.
I'll talk to you later.

250
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,836
Don't.

251
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,803
- You're a snob.
- I am no such thing.

252
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:41,972
Oh, you are a big snob.

253
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:44,010
You, you think that
knowledge should be kept

254
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:46,303
in these carefully guarded
repositories where only

255
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:49,533
- a handful of white guys can get at it.
- Nonsense!

256
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:52,049
I simply don't adhere
to a knee-jerk assumption...

257
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:54,328
that because something is new,
it's better.

258
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:58,491
This isn't a fad, Rupert.
We are creating a new society here.

259
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:01,486
A society in which human interaction
is all but obsolete?

260
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:04,439
In which people can be
completely manipulated by technology?

261
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:08,872
Well, well... Thank you, I'll pass.

262
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:13,424
Well, I think you'll be very happy here
with your musty old books.

263
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,226
These musty old books
have a great deal more to say than

264
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:20,627
any of your... fabulous web pages.

265
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:25,285
This one doesn't have
a whole lot more to say.

266
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,341
What is it? Like a diary?

267
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:32,611
How odd.

268
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:36,074
I... haven't... looked through
all the volumes yet and I didn't...

269
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,838
What is it?

270
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,708
Er, nothing.

271
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:48,671
A diary, yes.
I imagine that's what it is.

272
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,574
Well, it's been so nice talking to you.

273
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:56,213
- We were fighting.
- Must do it again sometime.

274
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:58,388
Bye now.

275
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,601
I checked the computer,
and there's nothing

276
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:04,355
in his file about
being allergic to penicillin!

277
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,515
- Buffy.
- Dave.

278
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,841
- How are you doin'?
- OK.

279
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:12,753
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. I haven't
been getting much sleep lately, y'know?

280
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:14,436
Don't sweat it.

281
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,162
- Willow was looking for you.
- Good. I need to talk to her.

282
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:19,913
Do you know where she is?

283
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:23,830
She said she'd be in the girls' locker room.

284
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,456
Great.

285
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:27,442
Thanks.

286
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:36,098
Will?

287
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,732
Willow?

288
00:21:53,408 --> 00:21:56,120
Will? Are you taking a shower?

289
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,835
I guess not.

290
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:11,762
This is how droughts get started.

291
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:16,810
Buffy! Get out!

292
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:43,086
I can't do it!
I'm not gonna do it.

293
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:45,091
But you promised.

294
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:48,219
Buffy isn't a threat to you!

295
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:50,388
It's not worth it.

296
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:55,841
The project is almost complete.
You won't have to do it again.

297
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,273
I can't.

298
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:02,049
I've shown you a new world, Dave.

299
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:05,535
Knowledge, power...
I can give you everything.

300
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,309
- All I want is your love.
- No.

301
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:13,749
This isn't right. None of it is.

302
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,503
I'm sorry. I've been a terrible person.

303
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:23,215
I'm a coward and
I can't go on living like this.

304
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,047
Forgive me, Mom and Dad.

305
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:29,931
At least now I'll have some peace.

306
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:31,933
Remember me.

307
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:34,847
Love, Dave.

308
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:43,321
- I'm gonna kill Dave!
- He tried to warn me.

309
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,391
Warn you that he set you up?

310
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:46,717
Is she gonna be OK?

311
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,314
She was only grounded
for a moment. Still...

312
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:52,297
If you'd been anyone but the Slayer...

313
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:56,642
Tell me the truth. How's my hair?

314
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:59,956
It's great. It's your best hair ever.

315
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:01,716
Oh. Yes.

316
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:06,422
I just... I don't understand
what would make Dave do a thing like that.

317
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:09,716
I think perhaps I do.

318
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:16,207
Does this look familiar to either of you?

319
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,609
Yeah, sure.

320
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:19,986
- It looks like a book.
- I knew that one.

321
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:24,884
In the Dark Ages, the souls of demons
were sometimes trapped in certain volumes.

322
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:27,775
They remained locked
within the book, harmless,

323
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:31,053
unless the pages were read aloud.

324
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:34,837
Unless I'm mistaken,
this is Moloch, the Corrupter.

325
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:37,005
A very deadly and seductive demon.

326
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,193
He draws people to him with promises
of love, power, knowledge.

327
00:24:41,228 --> 00:24:44,263
- Preys on impressionable minds.
- Like Dave's.

328
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:46,850
Dave and who knows how many others.

329
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:51,812
- And Moloch is inside that book?
- Not any more.

330
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:54,892
- You released Moloch?
- Way to go!

331
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,579
I didn't read it!

332
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,364
That dreadful Calendar woman
found it and it was already blank.

333
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,037
OK, so a powerful demon with horns

334
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:05,370
is walking around Sunnydale,
and nobody's noticed?

335
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:07,956
I-if he's so big and strong,
why bother with Dave?

336
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:09,800
Why didn't he just attack Buffy himself?

337
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,282
I don't know.

338
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:14,287
And I don't know who could've read
that book. It wasn't even in English.

339
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:16,598
Where was it?

340
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,567
Uh, in a pile with others
that were, um, uh, scanned.

341
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:25,017
That released the demon?

342
00:25:25,052 --> 00:25:28,228
No, he's not out here. He's in there.

343
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:31,076
The scanner read the book.

344
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:33,622
It brought Moloch out as

345
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,900
information to be absorbed.

346
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,304
He's gone binary on us.

347
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:42,435
OK, for those of us
in our studio audience who are me,

348
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,873
you guys are saying
that Moloch is in this computer?

349
00:25:45,908 --> 00:25:49,293
And in every computer
connected to it by a modem.

350
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:52,963
- He's everywhere.
- What are we gonna do?

351
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:55,630
Willow scanned him into her file.
It may be...

352
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:59,429
a futile gesture,
but I suggest we delete it.

353
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:02,327
Solid.

354
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:06,251
Don't get too close.

355
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:08,648
OK.

356
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:10,316
OK.

357
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:15,781
So which file do you think it is?

358
00:26:15,816 --> 00:26:17,622
Willow?

359
00:26:20,577 --> 00:26:24,821
That's... probably it, right?
I'll just... delete the whole thing.

360
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:34,212
Stay away from Willow!
It is none of your business!

361
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,963
So that's what Malcolm looks like.

362
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,436
- So much for "Delete file".
- This is very bad.

363
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:46,982
Are we overreacting?
He's in a computer. What can he do?

364
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:50,874
You mean, besides convince
a perfectly nice kid to try and kill me?

365
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,486
I don't know. How about mess up
all the medical equipment in the world?

366
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:56,736
Randomize traffic signals.

367
00:26:56,771 --> 00:26:59,066
Access launch codes for nuclear missiles?

368
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,177
Destroy the world's economy.

369
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:04,067
I think I pretty much capped it
with that nuclear missile thing.

370
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:06,094
Right. Yours was best.

371
00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:08,442
OK, he's a threat.
I'm on board with that now.

372
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:10,750
But what can we do about it?

373
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:13,055
I think the first thing we do
is find Willow.

374
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,872
She's probably talking to him right now.
God, that creeps me out!

375
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:20,283
- What does he want with Willow?
- Let's never find out.

376
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:23,063
OK. I'm gonna check the computer lab...

377
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:25,698
and you guys... call her home.

378
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:41,875
Willow?

379
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:11,574
- No answer.
- Damn it.

380
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:14,545
Well, it wasn't busy either,
so she's not on-line.

381
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:18,916
- She's not home.
- What did you find?

382
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,939
- Willow isn't...?
- Dave.

383
00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:24,755
- He's dead.
- How?

384
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,467
Well, it looks like suicide.

385
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:29,720
With a little help from my friends?

386
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:33,056
I'd guess Fritz.
Or the other zomboids from CRD.

387
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:36,648
OK. You and I are going to Willow's house.

388
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:39,230
Giles, you need to come up with a way
to get Moloch out of the Net.

389
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:43,443
I, I have records of the ceremonies, but,
but that's for a creature of the flesh.

390
00:28:43,478 --> 00:28:46,363
This could be something
completely different.

391
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:49,188
Then get Ms Calendar.
Maybe she can help you.

392
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:51,062
Well, even if she could,
how am I gonna convince her

393
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,670
that there's a demon on the Internet?

394
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:55,289
OK, fine, then you can stay here
and come up with a better plan.

395
00:28:55,324 --> 00:28:56,958
Come on.

396
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,309
Mom?

397
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:15,394
Dad?

398
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,744
You have mail.

399
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:57,733
You have mail.

400
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:08,829
Dad, did you forget your keys again?

401
00:30:21,592 --> 00:30:24,262
No more waiting.

402
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,184
<i>A spokesman for the archbishop
denied the allegations,</i>

403
00:30:27,185 --> 00:30:29,727
<i>blaming computer error
for the apparent financial discrepancy.</i>

404
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,729
Binding ritual...

405
00:30:31,812 --> 00:30:34,755
<i>In Washington D.C., the FBI today reported
that all of its serial killer profiles</i>

406
00:30:34,756 --> 00:30:36,693
<i>have been mysteriously downloaded
from its central computer.</i>

407
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:40,572
- I got your message. What's so urgent?
- Thank you for coming.

408
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:43,287
Er... I need your help.

409
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:49,832
But before that, I need you to believe
something that... you may not want to.

410
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:56,054
Er, there's...
Something's got into the... inside, erm...

411
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:59,701
There's a demon in the Internet.

412
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,970
I know.

413
00:31:08,644 --> 00:31:10,354
Willow?

414
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,316
This isn't good.

415
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:16,152
Willow?

416
00:31:17,237 --> 00:31:19,323
Willow?

417
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:24,161
OK, any thoughts?

418
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,199
"No more waiting. I need you to see me"?

419
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,168
See him how? Where?

420
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:32,487
- What about CRD?
- The research place?

421
00:31:32,522 --> 00:31:35,832
- I'm guessing that's Moloch Central.
- I'm guessing that's our best lead.

422
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:38,835
Let's just hope Giles can back us up.

423
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:44,767
You already know? How exactly is that?

424
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,854
Come on.
There have been portents for days.

425
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,732
Power surges, on-line shutdowns...

426
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:53,661
You should see the bones I've been casting.

427
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:55,689
I knew this would happen sooner or later.

428
00:31:55,724 --> 00:32:00,068
I mean, it's probably a, a mischief demon,
y'know, like Kelkor, or...

429
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:02,337
It's Moloch.

430
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:06,232
The Corrupter? Oh, boy.

431
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:11,780
- I should have remembered.
- You don't seem exactly surprised.

432
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:13,169
Who are you?

433
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,060
I teach computer science
at a local high school.

434
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:18,839
A profession that hardly
lends itself to the casting of bones.

435
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:20,820
Wrong and wrong, snobby.

436
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:25,145
You think the realm of the mystical
is limited to ancient texts and relics?

437
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,936
That bad old science
made the magic go away?

438
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:32,222
The divine exists in cyberspace,
same as out here.

439
00:32:32,257 --> 00:32:34,472
Are you a witch?

440
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:36,593
I don't have that kind of power.

441
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:40,412
"Techno pagan" is the term.

442
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,706
There are more of us than you think.

443
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:46,626
Well, er... you can definitely help me.

444
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:53,634
What's in cyberspace at the moment
is less than divine.

445
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:57,264
I have the binding rituals at hand,
but I'm completely out of my idiom.

446
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,433
Well, I can help - I think.

447
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:02,811
I hope. I mean, this is my first real...

448
00:33:02,895 --> 00:33:04,688
D-d'you know how he got in?

449
00:33:04,772 --> 00:33:08,409
He was...
"scanned" is the term, I believe.

450
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,942
And you want him back in the book.

451
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:16,151
- Buffy?
- Yeah.

452
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:18,202
- Willow?
- Not at home.

453
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:19,972
Looks like she was taken somewhere.

454
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:22,495
- Where are you?
- CRD.

455
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,077
Whatever Moloch wants Willow for
is probably in there.

456
00:33:25,112 --> 00:33:28,090
Ms. Calendar and I are, uh,
working to get Moloch offline.

457
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,897
Here's a tip: hurry.

458
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,036
Welcome, my love.

459
00:33:56,071 --> 00:34:00,080
I can't tell you how good it is to see you

460
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:07,440
with my own two eyes.

461
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:17,718
- Willow.
- Malcolm.

462
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,378
This world is so new, so exciting.

463
00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:29,282
I can see all of it.

464
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:31,576
Everything flows through me.

465
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,250
I know the secrets of your kings,

466
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:37,333
but nothing compares
to having form again.

467
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:41,377
To be able to walk. To touch.

468
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,133
To kill.

469
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,886
- Back way?
- Back way.

470
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:12,913
Here they come.

471
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:18,977
The first thing we have to do
is form the Circle of Kayless.

472
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:20,576
- Right?
- Form a circle?

473
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:23,841
But there's only two of us.
It's really more of a line.

474
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:27,291
You're not getting it, Rupert.
We have to form the circle inside.

475
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,578
I'm putting out a flash.
I just hope enough of my group responds.

476
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:31,476
Won't Moloch just shut you down?

477
00:35:31,511 --> 00:35:33,969
Well, I'm betting he won't figure out
what we're doing until it's too late.

478
00:35:34,004 --> 00:35:36,427
Hoping and betting,
that's what we've got.

479
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:40,002
Wanna throw in praying? Be my guest.

480
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:43,238
I don't understand.
What do you want from me?

481
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:45,657
I want to give you the world.

482
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:49,525
- Why?
- You created me.

483
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,300
I brought these humans together
to build me a body.

484
00:35:52,335 --> 00:35:54,241
But you gave me life.

485
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:57,643
Took me out of the book that held me.

486
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:01,378
- I want to repay you.
- By lying to me?

487
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:05,093
By pretending to be a person?

488
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:08,527
Pretending you loved me?

489
00:36:08,562 --> 00:36:10,186
I do.

490
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,525
Buffy!

491
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:21,892
- It's her.
- Yeah. Who's the other guy?

492
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:28,663
Don't you see? I can give you everything.

493
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:31,217
I can control the world.

494
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:36,045
Right now a man in Beijing is transferring
money to a Swiss bank account

495
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,258
for a contract on his mother's life.

496
00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:41,143
Good for him.

497
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:50,604
- I can't bust it. It's heavy steel.
- Then let's find another way in.

498
00:36:57,819 --> 00:36:59,864
What's goin' on?

499
00:36:59,947 --> 00:37:02,575
The building security system
is computerized.

500
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:04,285
Whoops.

501
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,666
Almost there.

502
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,838
Couldn't you just stop Moloch
by entering some computer virus?

503
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:16,924
You've seen way too many movies.

504
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:19,427
OK, we're up.

505
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:22,597
- You read, I type. Ready?
- I am.

506
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:26,726
By the power of the divine,

507
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:29,772
by the essence of the word,

508
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:31,532
I command you.

509
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:45,038
- Let me leave.
- But I love you.

510
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:46,732
Don't say that.

511
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,585
That's a joke. You don't love anything.

512
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:51,246
You are mine.

513
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:54,298
I'm not yours. I'm never gonna be yours.

514
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:56,467
Never.

515
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:02,399
Pity.

516
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:05,085
By the power of the Circle of Kayless,

517
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,479
I command you.

518
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,083
Kayless with a K.

519
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:19,493
I'll miss you.

520
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:24,457
Demon, come!!!

521
00:38:28,085 --> 00:38:29,671
I command you!

522
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:37,053
Ow! The guy's made of metal.

523
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,396
No! I won't go back!

524
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:49,568
Demon, come!

525
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:52,029
Whoa!

526
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,537
Hey! I got to hit someone!

527
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:24,981
He's out of the Net.

528
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:27,150
He's bound.

529
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,377
He's not in the book.

530
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:47,297
He's not in the book.

531
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:50,135
Where is he?

532
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:04,233
- Let's go this way.
- Wait!

533
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:23,880
I was omnipotent. I was everything!
Now I'm trapped in this shell.

534
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,801
Malcolm!

535
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,221
Remember me - your girlfriend?

536
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,515
I think it's time we break up!

537
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,559
But maybe we can still be friends!

538
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:49,449
This body is all I have left,
but it's enough to crush you.

539
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:53,579
Take your best shot.

540
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:29,493
Well, look who's here.

541
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:32,831
Welcome to my world. You scared?

542
00:41:33,498 --> 00:41:36,835
I'm... remaining calm, thank you.

543
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,190
I just wanted to return this.

544
00:41:40,225 --> 00:41:43,768
I found it among the new books
and naturally I thought of you.

545
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:45,845
Cool. Thanks.

546
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:49,348
Uh, well, I'll, I'll see you anon.

547
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:52,477
Can't get out of here
fast enough, can you?

548
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:57,557
Truthfully, I'm even less anxious
to be around computers than I used to be.

549
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:02,572
Well, it was your book that started
all the trouble, not a computer.

550
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:08,327
Honestly, what is it about them
that bothers you so much?

551
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:09,954
The smell.

552
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:12,416
Computers don't smell, Rupert.

553
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:14,585
I know.

554
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:18,922
Smell is the most powerful
trigger to the memory there is.

555
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:24,846
A certain flower or a whiff of smoke
can bring up experiences long forgotten.

556
00:42:26,764 --> 00:42:28,850
Books smell

557
00:42:28,933 --> 00:42:31,020
musty and rich.

558
00:42:32,062 --> 00:42:35,591
The knowledge gained from a computer is...

559
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:38,235
It has no... no texture, no context.

560
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,406
It's there and then it's gone.

561
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:44,660
If it's to last, then-then
the getting of knowledge should be...

562
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:46,665
tangible.
It should be...

563
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,604
smelly.

564
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:56,298
Well, you really are
an old-fashioned boy, aren't you?

565
00:42:56,333 --> 00:43:00,123
Well, I-I don't dangle a corkscrew
from my ear.

566
00:43:00,635 --> 00:43:03,851
That's not where I dangle it.

567
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:12,941
Are we going to the Bronze tonight?
We three?

568
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:15,109
It'll be fun.

569
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,278
Yeah, Willow. Fun?

570
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:19,739
Remember fun? That thing where you smile?

571
00:43:19,823 --> 00:43:22,701
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.
I'm just thinking about...

572
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:24,009
Malcolm?

573
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,131
Malcolm... Moloch...
Whatever he's called.

574
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:31,169
The one boy that's really liked me
and he's a demon robot.

575
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:33,300
What does that say about me?

576
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:36,259
It doesn't say anything about you.

577
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:39,154
I mean, I thought I was really falling...

578
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:42,781
Hey, did you forget? The one boy I've
had the hots for since I've moved here...

579
00:43:42,816 --> 00:43:44,267
turned out to be a vampire.

580
00:43:44,302 --> 00:43:47,812
Right. And the teacher I had a crush on?
Giant praying mantis?

581
00:43:48,396 --> 00:43:50,171
That's true.

582
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,070
- That's life on the Hellmouth.
- Let's face it.

583
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:55,737
None of us are ever gonna have
a happy, normal relationship.

584
00:43:56,071 --> 00:43:57,948
- We're doomed.
- Yeah.
