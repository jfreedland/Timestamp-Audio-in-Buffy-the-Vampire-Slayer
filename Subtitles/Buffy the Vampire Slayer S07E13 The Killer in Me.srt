<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:06,106
The First. That's what it wants.

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:10,503
To erase all the slayers-in-training
and their watchers along with their methods.

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:12,547
<i>(Willow) Buffy, he's been feeding...</i>

5
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:15,862
He really didn't know what he'd done.
lt wasn't in his control.

6
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:21,423
lt's a trigger. lt's a brainwashing term.
lt's how the military makes sleeper agents.

7
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:22,990
- Amy.
- Can l come in?

8
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:26,381
lf you really are my friend,
you better stay away from me.

9
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:29,110
- Agent Finn, my implant?
- The implant works.

10
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:33,343
<i>Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature</i>
<i>without intense neurological pain.</i>

11
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:35,183
Aargh!

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,221
You think you can just do that to me?

13
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:42,589
Tara?

14
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,861
Somebody! Help!

15
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:49,831
- You wanna do the sleeping arrangements?
- OK.

16
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:52,789
You, uh... better not hog the covers.

17
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:02,062
- Are you sure you'll all be all right?
- You'll only be gone for two days.

18
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:05,905
- l think we've managed a bit longer than that.
- Right.

19
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:11,187
Oh, Dawn, Vi's left her notebook on the
mantelpiece. Would you run it out to the car?

20
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,023
Sure.

21
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,308
Smack her head with it.
Remind her not to leave it lying around.

22
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,621
On it.

23
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,703
l'm just a bit twitchy
about leaving you alone again here

24
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:25,784
while things are...
in such a state of flux.

25
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:29,181
l know. But you should go.
This trip is important for the girls

26
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:32,343
to understand the source of their power
and know how to use it.

27
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,389
l don't think they appreciate
the gravity of our undertaking.

28
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:39,749
lt's frightening, and it's difficult.
And then, apparently someone told them

29
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:44,188
that the vision quest consists of me driving
them to the desert, doing the hokey pokey

30
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:49,903
until a spooky Rasta-mama slayer arrives
and speaks to them in riddles.

31
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:55,310
That's not exactly how l put it, l...
Hey, how's Kennedy?

32
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:58,269
Still fluey.
Bummed about missing the field trip.

33
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:03,425
She says she wants you to meditate extra
hard for her and bring her back some s'mores.

34
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:07,299
Ah, yes, s'mores. l'm going to end up
singing campfire songs aren't l?

35
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,109
Oh, yeah.

36
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:11,785
- Giles, you might wanna get out there.
- God, what?

37
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:15,068
Molly and Rona are fighting over
who gets to drive the first leg.

38
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:18,188
Bet you wish you renewed
that California driver's licence.

39
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,741
Rona won. You should probably
let Molly out of the trunk.

40
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:26,268
l never actually realised
just how compact Molly really is.

41
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:29,741
- Please be safe while l'm away.
- You too.

- Hey.

44
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:44,668
Giles is off... on the retreat.

45
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:48,107
- Give us all a chance for a breather, eh?
- From Giles?

46
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:52,981
From the constant pitter-patter
of clomping teenage girlie feet.

47
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:56,507
- l have no idea what you're talking about.
- Come on.

48
00:02:56,591 --> 00:03:00,789
No, l enjoy my responsibility
as mentor, role model, life guide...

49
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:04,944
Oh, my God, l cannot believe l have my
bathroom all to myself for two whole days.

50
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:08,785
lt's like a bloody war zone up there,
and not in a good way.

51
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:14,264
- Seen the kitchen since they've been here?
- l'm just tryin' to stay out of their way.

52
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,501
l noticed.

53
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:20,069
This is better. Believe me, it's safer.

54
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:25,428
OK. But you've been fine.
ln close contact with the girls.

55
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,264
Yeah. With you by my side, yeah.

56
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:30,819
You wouldn't let me hurt one of them.

57
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:36,144
And that's the way it's gonna be until we're
sure the First is done making me its bitch.

58
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:39,428
Either we're together, or l'm on the leash.

59
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,264
We just need to make sure
the trigger's deactivated.

60
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:45,741
We've got a couple of days,
lack of pitter-patter and all.

Buffy.

62
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:51,783
What?

63
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:53,862
- Ow.
- Ow?

What's wrong? Spike, what is going on?

67
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:05,105
The chip. God. God.

68
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,501
Why would...?

69
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:10,149
No!

70
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:15,030

<i>(Willow)</i> Hey. How is he?

72
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:20,950
Oh, in the "goes" part of "comes and goes".

73
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:25,260
There seems to be a definite lack
of screaming. That has to be good.

74
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,421
You'd think.

75
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,706
- That for the other patient?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,227
Thought l'd bring her some tea,
help her feel better.

77
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,983
Mm-hm?

78
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,344
- lt's just tea.

00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,031
how much do you know about the chip?

81
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,227
Spike's chip?

82
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:51,586
l remember trying to dig up stuff back then,

83
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:56,187
but, you know, it turns out when a secret
government agency studies vampires

84
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:59,468
and puts chips in their brains
that keep them from hurting people,

85
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:02,782
they don't really build websites. Why?

86
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:06,866
Even with the chip Spike was able
to hurt people when he was brainwashed.

87
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:10,341
Yeah, but he was
under the control of the First.

88
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:15,789
- Maybe something's wrong with it.
- The chip is misfiring all on its own, then.

89
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,862
Well, this will be fun.

90
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:21,227
Remember when things
used to be nice and boring?

91
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:22,903
No.

92
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:27,060
Have fun... delivering the tea.

93
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:31,382
OK, not when you make it
sound all dirty like that.

94
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:35,182
lt's just tea.

00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:37,904

Boots?

98
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,470
Hey.

99
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:50,703
For someone who's sick, you look
surprisingly robust and casual dressy.

100
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,544
Well, the lighting in here is good.

101
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,668
- Maybe it's just...
- You were never sick.

102
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,104
No.

103
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:01,183
- l was never sick.
- Oh, you are so busted.

104
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:06,743
- Xander's gonna have to drive you to...
- Willow, chill. There's a reason l didn't go.

105
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,789
l have a thing. A separate thing.

106
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:12,146
- What?
- Something's coming down.

107
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,621

- This is a mission?
- Oh. Yeah.

110
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:33,381
And the little paper umbrellas
are a signal for what?

111
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,149
- We're not on a mission, are we?
- Hey, trust me.

112
00:07:37,231 --> 00:07:40,143
l told you. l have a thing.

113
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:45,027
Come on, come on.
Just hang out with me a little.

114
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:49,506
You're sexy when you pout.

115
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:53,664
Why do you do that?

116
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:56,466
To get you to stay.

117
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:03,542
All right, l'll stay for one drink,
then l'm going home.

118
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:06,304
OK. One drink. l can work with that.

119
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:12,786
Let's start with the easy stuff.
How long have you known?

120
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:16,625
- That you were gay.
- Wait. That's easy?

121
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:20,624
And, what, you just assume that l'm gay?

122
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:24,507
- l mean, presume much?
- OK, sorry.

123
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:26,982
How long have you enjoyed sex with women?

124
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,106
Hey!

125
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:34,466
What, you think you have some sort
of special lesbidar or something?

126
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:38,749
OK, you know there's
a better word for that, right?

127
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:44,700
You really haven't been getting
out there much, have you?

128
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,863
Well, l just...

129
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:51,263
Can you always tell
just by looking at someone?

130
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:52,579
No.

131
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:55,868
No, of course not.
That wouldn't be any fun.

132
00:08:55,951 --> 00:09:00,627
The fun part is the process
of getting to know a girl. lt's like...

133
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:04,499
lt's like flirting in code.
lt's using body language

134
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,503
and laughing at the rightjokes and...

135
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:11,871
and looking into her eyes...

136
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,341
and knowing she's still whispering to you,

137
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:18,229
even when she's not sayin' a word.

138
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:22,705
And that sense that...
if you can just touch her,

139
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,467
just once...

140
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:29,066
everything will be OK... for both of you.

141
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,787
That's how you can tell.

142
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:38,150
Or if she's really hot, you just get her drunk,
see if she comes on to you.

143
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,190
Three years ago. That's when l knew.

144
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:48,548
And it wasn't women, it was woman.

145
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,701
Just one.

146
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,021
Lucky woman.

<i>(Spike)</i> Popped another blood vessel, l think.

00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,988
There's gotta be a reason
why the chip is going all wonky.

149
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:08,380
Maybe it's related to the trigger.

150
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:11,668
Or maybe it has something to do
with the new soul.

151
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:14,549
Or maybe l wasn't meant to last this long.

152

One more thing you and l
have in common, eh, pet?

- Do your parents know?
- Yeah.

00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:56,185
My mom was all proud like l was
making some political statement.

162
00:10:56,271 --> 00:11:00,469
Then the statement mojo wore off
and l was just gay.

163
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,625
She hardly ever even met Tara.

164
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:06,589

Yes, Agent Finn, Riley.

169
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:28,061
Tell him we're having a problem
with Spike's chip.

170
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,506
No, his chip.

171
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:31,785
Spike.

172
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:35,466
- Listen, pet?
- No, no, Finn is his last name.

173
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,779
Yeah.

174
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:40,705
Well, did he used to work there
and maybe he got transferred?

175
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,065
- Oh!
- Oh.

176
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:46,349
ls this actually a flower shop,
or is this one of those things

177
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:49,741
where l'm supposed to play along
to show l know it's secret ops?

178
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:52,550
Maybe l shouldn't have said that. Um...

179
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:53,984
OK.

180
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,789
Right. Uh...

181
00:11:55,871 --> 00:12:00,501
Well, if some guy named Finn
shows up to buy flowers...

182
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:02,582
Yeah. Thanks.

183
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:08,707
Wrong number. Or a giant
government conspiracy, one or the...

184
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:10,340
Spike?

185
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,265
This one seemed easier than the others.

186
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:17,945
See? Probably just gonna fade...

187
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,148
Aargh!

188
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:24,302
lt was <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

189
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:27,940
l saw that, and l knew l wanted
to sweep Scarlett off her feet.

190
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,180
You were five.

191
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:32,661
Well, l'm not saying the sweeping
would have been easy.

192
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:38,900
- What?
- l just...

193
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:42,305
l still don't get it.

194
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:47,025
Why you like me.
l mean, you don't even know me.

195
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:50,550
Have you seen you?

196
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:54,180
And we like the same things.
ltalian, skate punk,

197
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,626
Robert Parker mysteries, fighting evil...

198
00:12:56,711 --> 00:13:00,704
l don't like any of that stuff.
Except the fighting-evil part.

199
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:04,386
But, even then, l'd prefer a nice foot massage.

200
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:05,586
OK.

201
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:12,065
l dig the way you turn off the <i>Moulin Rouge!</i>
DVD at chapter 32 so it has a happy ending.

202
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:16,907
l like the way you speak. lt's interesting.

203
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:21,229
And your freckles...

204
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,029
lickable.

205
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,822
l'm not so into the magic stuff.

206
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,506
lt seems like fairy-tale crap to me,
but if it matters to you...

207
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:33,424
You care about it, so it's cool.

208
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:41,189
Well, this is my stop.

209
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:44,143
So...

210
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:48,142
glad we talked.

211
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:50,584
Yes.

212
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:55,142
- Kinda cleared the air, huh?
- Yeah, totally. Air cleared. Check.

213
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:01,708
You know, in the spirit of air clearing...

214
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,860
Yeah?

215
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:05,749
l feel like l need to be honest
about something.

216
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:08,026
- ls something wrong?
- No.

217
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:09,783
No.

218
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:11,862
lt's just...

219
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:18,342
l think you should... know...

220
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,579
<i>(Warren)</i> Well, that was nice.

221
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:50,663
Are you OK?

222
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:56,383
l'm not used to literally knocking girls off of
their feet with just the power of my own lips.

223
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,860
- OK, you gonna pick that up, or...?
- l don't...

224
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:04,227
- What are you?
- ls this a freckle thing, cos...

225
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:10,220
Oh, God! Oh, God.

226
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:17,745
- What is that?
- lt's the man that l killed.

227
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:20,140
<i>(Kennedy)</i> OK, hold up a sec.

228
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:23,828
- Guys.
- Get Buffy. The First is back.

229
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,983
- l'm not the First.
- We're not interested in your evil lies.

230
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:30,666
No, guys, it's me. <i>(Warren's voice)</i>
l'm me. l'm Willow. Guys, come on.

231
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:34,744
- Ask Kennedy, she was there.
- l don't know. l'm not sure.

232
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:38,387
We were up in Willow's room and we were...

233
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:43,226
- No, you're back.
- No, l'm not. lt's not... l'm not it.

234
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:45,302
- Listen to me...
- No more listening.

235
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:49,907
l know who you are now. l know what you
made me do. Your promises of happy fields

236
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,108
and dancing schnauzers
and being demigods won't work on me.

237
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:55,546
- Buffy!
- The Bringers are probably coming.

238
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:59,021
- l'm not the First.
- You made me do things l can't take back.

239
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:03,389
- l'm not the First.
- What the hell is going on in here?

240
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:04,699
- Ow!
- Buffy...

241
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,588
- Wait.
- But if he's the First...

242
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,150
- l'm not.
- You're not.

243
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:09,903
l know.

244
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:12,221
Oh, my God. You're back.

245
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,949
Hey, bad touching!

246
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:17,228
- Aargh!
- Everyone please stop it, it's me.

247
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:21,110
- lt's Willow.
- l'm Willow.

248
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:25,945
- Are you sure?
- There are other stories from kindergarten.

249
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:30,183
Non-yellow-crayon stories in which
you don't come out in such a good light.

250
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:34,105
An incident involving Aquaman underoos.
You want me to start talkin'?

251
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:37,263
- Hey, Willow!
- What happened?

252
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:41,788
l don't know. We were... there,
and then l looked like him.

253
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:46,661
- Oh, like a glamour.
- Maybe, but l probably brought it on myself.

254
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:50,141
- What makes you think that?
- lt wouldn't be the first time.

255
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:53,701
l have a history with my subconscious
making things go kerfloofey.

256
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:57,306
Remember the wacky "l can't see you,
you can't see me" spell?

257
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,949
Guys!

258
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,386
- lt's so real.
- Yeah, all too aware.

259
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:06,147
Say you did do this to yourself. Why would
your subconscious turn you into Warren?

260
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:09,985
Obviously because l feel bad...
about killing him.

261
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:14,629
Look, we'll deal. We'll get help.

262
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:17,748
- No, l can handle this.
- On your own? Why?

263
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:21,904
l did it. l'll fix it. l don't want you
seeing me this way, anyway.

264
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:24,346
lt's kind of a little late for that.

265
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:26,786
Seriously, l'm not posing any big threat.

266
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:29,704
Looks like you've got your hands full already.

267
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:34,581
l'll go, l'll handle it, l'll fix it.
l'll be back before you even know l'm gone.

268
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:37,344
<i>(Warren's voice)</i> Promise.

269
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:39,862
Spike?

270
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,662
- Buffy.
- l'm right here.

271
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,584
- The chip fired again.
- l kinda figured.

272
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,703
Maybe they'll call back.
Maybe they'll send help.

273
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,351
Maybe we can't wait.

274
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:03,267
- Oh!
- OK.

275
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:06,149
No one will ever accuse you
of being too butch.

276
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:08,825
- Kennedy, go home.
- Come on.

277
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:11,903
l mean... you turned into a guy.

278
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:17,145
lf you take a step back, seriously, there's
a certain element of humour here, right?

279
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,665
Well, a really, really big step.

280
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:23,505
l killed him. lt's hard to see the chuckles.

281
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:29,909
- So you got a plan?
- Yeah, gonna get some help reversing it.

282
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:33,142
- l thought you were gonna try it.
- l did. lt didn't work.

283
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:36,780
- Something's blocking me.
- All the more reason for me to go with you.

284
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:41,706
Plus, l was there with you when it happened.
Let me come to try to help too.

285
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,909
- l really think l'm fine with the handling.
- By yourself? Why?

286
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,459
l'm the one that killed him.

287
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:54,503
- lt's hard to understand.
- Given.

288
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,185
How about l just tag along anyway?
Keep you company.

289
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:00,424
- l'm taking that as a yes.
- Fine. Come.

290
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:03,309
But try not to get in the way.

291
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:08,430
- You know where you're going?
- To see some old friends of mine.

292
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:11,787
Been a while, but maybe they can help.

293
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:16,709
Are you sure you still wanna go back
in this place with me?

294
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,385
Uh, nothing good on TV tonight.

295
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,907
- Here we are.
- Yup, here we are.

296
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,268
- You think the stuff's still good?
- l don't know.

297
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:38,707
Worked pretty good when
the lnitiative held me captive here.

298
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:44,102
Every time l'd get a little rambunctious,
the chip'd kick in,

299
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,910
and l'd feel like my head was gonna explode.

300
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:52,384
They'd dope me up, and everything
would be all daffodils and teddy bears.

301
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:57,829
- For a couple of hours anyway.
- Maybe we should search for files and stuff.

302
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:01,506
Find out everything we can
about the chip. Shelf life.

303
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:04,424
l'll take whatever l can get.

304
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:06,502
- Ready?
- Yeah.

305
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:25,825
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- l'll get it.

306
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:30,825
Supposed to get a call when the <i>League</i>
<i>of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i> comes in.

307
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:33,630
- See if you can get two?
- Summers residence.

308
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:37,260
This is Andrew speaking.
How can l help you?

309
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:39,819
Loser.

310
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:43,868
Hey, do we know
some British guy named Robson?

311
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:52,146
He was attacked,
this... Robson guy in England.

312
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,590
And Giles was there helpin' him.

313
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:00,707
- And there was a Bringer.
- Xander...

314
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,750
Robson blacked out, but the last thing
he remembers is Giles's head...

315
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,743
about to get familiar
with a Bringer's very sharp axe.

316
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:10,664
- Oh, my God!
- Giles never mentioned any of this.

317
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:14,107
Robson said by the time he came to...

318
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,989
there was no Giles.

319
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:22,907
- So, what are we saying?
- Maybe Giles just didn't want to talk about it.

320
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:27,303
Or maybe he didn't make it.
Look, l'm not saying it's a happy scenario,

321
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:30,781
but we're dealing with the Big Bad
that can be any dead person.

322
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:33,180
To infiltrate the inner circle of the Slayer...

323
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:36,707
You become the one person she trusts
more than anybody else.

324
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:40,670
- But there's no way that we can know.
- Actually, that's not true.

325
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:44,187
The First can't take corporeal form,
so it can't touch anything.

326
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:48,708
Well, it's not like Giles
hasn't touched anything, right?

327
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:57,507
Has anyone seen Giles
touch anything since he got back?

328
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:01,029
Hold anything?

329
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:05,020
Has anybody hugged him?

330
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:08,100
Think very hard.

331
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:14,751
- Where're you...?
- The desert, to find Giles.

332
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:17,629
Oh, good. Let me just get
some tapes for the car.

333
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,271
- <i>(Xander)</i> You're not coming.
- What? Why?

334
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:22,706
Cos l used to be evil?

335
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,703
No, cos you're annoying,
but that's a good reason too.

336
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:30,581
Wait, l... Don't leave me here all alone.
l keep getting attacked in this house.

337
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:33,060
- Actually...
- What if this is part of the plan?

338
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:37,110
Drive you guys away so it can have
its way with me? Ever think of that?

339
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:41,345
- l'll risk it.
- OK, well, if you leave me here alone,

340
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:44,662
l'll do something evil, like...

341
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:48,983
burning something
or... gluing things together.

342
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:55,944
For crying out loud, Harris, let's just take him.
At least we can keep an eye on him.

343
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,700
- Xander.
- l know, they're out there all alone.

344
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,782
All of 'em.

345
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:21,827
<i>(Vaughne)</i> lnstil us, oh, great one,

346
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:24,584
with peace, with strength,

347
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:27,301
with compassion,

348
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:29,541
with hope.

349
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:32,668
The path we seek is yours.

350
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:35,345
Keep us on that path.

351
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:39,026
OK, wow, this is new.

352
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:42,501
Um, hi, we're...

353
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:45,469
Oh, hey. l'm sorry. Willow.

354
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,065
We actually met when l was a freshman.

355
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:50,745
And also not a boy.

356
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:54,980
- This is Kennedy.
- Hey.

357
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,146
- You're Willow?
- Yeah.

358
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:02,671
Wow, look at you guys.

359
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:06,585
Campus Wiccans. l guess you
got past the whole bake-sale phase.

360
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:09,469
No, we still do that too.
Second Tuesday of every month.

361
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:14,750
l'm sorry, l'm kind of having a hard time
with the whole guy event thing.

362
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:16,184
<i>(girl)</i> Um...

363
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:19,069
lt's actually her. l can tell.

364
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,147
l know her.

365
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:25,222
OK. Whoa!

366
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:28,986
Um, OK, here's the thing. Hi.

367
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:32,669
Here's the thing.
l'll just get this out of the way.

368
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:38,303
l'm sorta screwed up, but l mean, you already
knew that because you lived it. Gotcha.

369
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:44,626
- But she's doing so much better now. Amy...
- lt's OK, Vaughne, l wanna do this.

370
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:48,021
lt took me a long time to really see myself.

371
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:52,384
But l did. Because that's the crazy thing
about hitting rock bottom,

372
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:56,350
you get to relive all
the crappy things that you did.

373
00:24:56,431 --> 00:25:02,267
l wanted to come find you and tell you that l
was here working on things with these guys.

374
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:06,060
That they're good. And that l was sorry.

375
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:11,308
But you're here. Looking like...

376
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,061
Wow! How did this happen?

377
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:18,224
That's what we're here to find out.
lf we're done with all the group hugging.

378
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:23,465
l got hit with this, like, glamour thing,
and l can't seem to shake it myself.

379
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:27,669
l was hoping that someone here
might be able to help.

380
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:32,905
Yeah, the thing is we're more about healing
spirits and nurturing our life force here.

381
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,470
Oh.

382
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:38,223
But we'll try.

383
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:42,664
- <i>(Amy)</i> Her spirit's true...
- What if she can't handle this?

384
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:46,426
- You have a better idea?
- Give back the form the soul requires.

385
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,389
- See that the balance is put right.
- Argh!

386
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:54,300
- lt didn't work?
- No it didn't, you dumb bitch!

387
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:55,983
Willow!

388
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:59,783
- You slapped me!
- No, l didn't.

389
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:02,222
lt wasn't me.

390
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,630
lt was Warren.

391
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:16,585
Willow.

392
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:18,104
Willow!

393
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:21,467
- OK, you're upset.
- Upset? Upset?

394
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:24,304
Are you just tuning in?
Did you not see that?

395
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:26,063
l'm turning into him.

396
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,143
lt's not a trick, it's not a glamour.
l'm becoming him.

397
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:31,904
A murderous, misogynist man.

398
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:37,224
l mean, do you understand what he did?
What l could do? l killed him for a reason.

399
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:39,620
Getting angry isn't helping. We can try...

400
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:44,831
You understand nothing about magic. And in
case you haven't noticed, our date - it's over.

401
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:46,310
Willow!

402
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:50,422
Willow, wait!

403
00:26:57,831 --> 00:26:59,822
<i>(Buffy)</i> Be careful.

404
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:04,707
Oh, God.

405
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,782
They just left 'em.

406
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:12,909
<i>(Spike)</i> They just sealed the place off.

407
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:15,903
Left everything as it was.

408
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:26,384
- <i>(Buffy)</i> l'm thinkin' brief stay.
- Yeah, you're not wrong.

409
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:37,540
l think l can get us
to the med lab, find the drug.

410
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,023
<i>(creaking)</i>

411
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,820
OK, l'll go. R.

412
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:18,061
- Ghost is hard to play by yourself.
- How long since they left?

413
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:19,789
A few hours.

414
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:26,150
lf it is the First, and l'm not saying it is,
what are we expecting to find?

415
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:29,509
He didn't bring 'em out there to meditate.

416
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:35,063
Kinda makes you grateful you weren't
a potential after all, doesn't it? Safer.

417
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:39,030
- Yeah, well, not so fast with the big "phew".
- He might know we're coming.

418
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:42,308
Which means we're too late
and heading to the middle of nowhere.

419
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:46,589
- With no slayer, no powerful witch...
- Just a teenager, a powerless former demon,

420
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:49,310
and two big geeks.

421
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,704
OK, licence-plate game, maybe?

422
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:19,869
Look at me. Crying like a little girl.

423
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:33,702
<i>(creaking)</i>

424
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:38,550
- <i>(Spike)</i> You hear that?
- <i>(Buffy)</i> Yep.

425
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:45,066
Think something survived?

426
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:48,548
Sounds like.

427
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:52,389
- <i>(Spike)</i> You see where?
- <i>(Buffy)</i> No.

428
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:55,668
But it sounded like
it was coming from over there.

429
00:29:56,031 --> 00:30:00,229
- Whatever it is, it's not...
- <i>(creaking and growling)</i>

430
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:15,030
<i>(growling)</i>

431
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,108
<i>(Spike)</i> Buffy!

432
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,308
- Where'd they go?
- They took off.

433
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,144
lt was a little too creepy, even for us.

434
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:36,145
You're really worried about her.

435
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:41,784
Look, she's gonna be fine, really.

436
00:30:41,871 --> 00:30:45,068
She's good at this. She's strong.

437
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:47,585
And she's dealt with a lot worse.

438
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:53,029
Long before she went out and found herself
a big old potential-slayer bodyguard, OK?

439
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:55,671
Just have a little faith in her.

440
00:30:55,751 --> 00:31:00,108
- l never said l was a potential slayer.
- Oh. No, l think you did.

441
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:04,389
- When you first got here, you told us that...
- No, l didn't.

442
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,225
How did you know who l was?

443
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,503
Oops.

So, same model as last time.

How'd that work out for you?

452
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:49,665
You'd be amazed.

453
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:04,825
- <i>(Andrew)</i> Aargh!
- <i>(Xander)</i> Touch him. Touch him.

454
00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:07,061
- Oh, l feel him. l feel him.
- Me too.

455
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:09,301
- Me too.
- Good. We all feel each other.

456
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:14,590
lncluding some of us who don't know each
other well enough to take such liberties.

457
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:19,381
l assume there is a perfectly reasonable
and not-at-all-insane explanation, yes?

458
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:23,544
- We thought you were non-corporeal evil.
- We can't remember you touching anything.

459
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:25,667
We had to make sure you were OK.

460
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:27,184
Oh.

461
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:28,386
Ah.

462
00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:33,226
That's very... Yes, that's very sweet.
Now wait a minute. You thought...

463
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:39,147
You think l'm evil if l bring a group of girls
on a camping trip and <i>don't</i> touch them?

464
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,303
Spike?

465

<i>(growling)</i>

- Are you still with us?
- Yeah.

469
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:26,426
Well, that guy was...

470
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:30,699
- ..just the beginning.
- What's happening?

471
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:35,706
Miss Summers. Agent Finn reported that you
tried to contact him earlier today.

472
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:38,749
l knew it. Government conspiracy.

473
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:43,426
He indicated you might need our assistance.

474
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:47,902
We're to provide you anything
you need to help assface here.

475
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:52,103
Those were his exact words, ma'am.

476
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:08,543
<i>(soldier)</i> Med team tells me
they took a look at the chip.

You were right. lt's degraded.

478
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:15,790
Leave it as it is much longer,
it'll be fatal to him.

OK. So, how long t...

Now, ma'am.

481
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:26,824
Right, of course. Um... What do we do next?

482
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:30,104
Agent Finn said it was your call, ma'am.

483

My... What was my call?

484
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:37,746
All decisions regarding Hostile 17

And that's magic crazy talk for what?

- l got that part.

00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:29,982
That's rich.

498
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:34,830
That must've been some kiss.

499
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:38,381
- You must be good.
- Answer me.

500
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:42,865
The hex lets the victim's subconscious
pick the form of their punishment.

501
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:45,909
Always better than anything
l can come up with. Elegant.

502
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:49,461
- Undo it. Let her out.
- OK.

503
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:51,667
Oh, wait, l forgot. No.

504
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:55,983
Why would you do this to her?
You really hate her that much?

505
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,550
<i>(sighs)</i>

506
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,986
This is not about hate.

507
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:02,426
lt's about power.

508
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:05,981
Willow always had the power,
long before she knew what to do with it.

509
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:08,710
Just came so easy for her.

510
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:13,307
The rest of us? We had to work
twice as hard to be half as good.

511
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,590
But no one cares about how hard you work.

512
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:19,822
They just care about cute, sweet Willow.

513
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,902
They don't know how weak she is.

514
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:27,141
She gave in to evil,
and stuff worse than l can even imagine.

515
00:36:27,231 --> 00:36:31,429
She almost destroyed the world.
And yet everyone keeps on loving her?

516
00:36:31,511 --> 00:36:36,221
So what's wrong with having a little fun,
huh? Taking her down a peg or two?

517
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:39,269
Fun? She's disappearing.

518
00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:43,583
Fading away in that creep,
and you think it's fun?

519
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:47,789
lt was just a game.
lt's not my fault if she's losing herself.

520
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:51,181
- l'm gonna stop you now, you know.
- Hey.

521
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:55,742
l'm not the bad guy here.
But l wonder where he'd be right about now.

522
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:03,940
Well, that was a hell of a thing.

523
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:09,784
Think you can just do that to me?
That l'd let you get away with it?

524
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,783
Do? Get away with...?

525
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,587
OK.

526
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:19,630
- Let's not get excited.
- lt's too late for that. This is what l am.

527
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:23,226
l made it happen, and l'll make it stop.

528
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:25,428
Willow.

529
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:29,265
- What did you make happen?
- You were there, bitch! You saw it!

530
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,662
l killed her.

531
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:36,744
- You mean him.
- Her, him... You know what l mean.

532
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:39,140
But you said "her".

533
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:42,583
No. That was Warren.

534
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:46,107
No, no, it wasn't. You said l was there.

535
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:52,222
- Who did you kill, Willow?
- lt was your fault, slut.

536
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,302
You tricked me.

537
00:37:55,431 --> 00:37:57,945
Got me to forget.

538
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,221
- Tara.
- Shut up!

539
00:38:01,311 --> 00:38:04,269
Shut up! You do not get to say her name.

540
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:08,070
Offering it up to whoever's there.

541
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:11,425
Tricking me into kissing you.

542
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:17,069
l didn't... l didn't mean...
What l'm saying... l...

543
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:19,870
l can't make... Kennedy...

544
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:24,463
l can't hold on. He's winning.

545
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:26,384
No.

546
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,065
l'm being punished.

547
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:33,030
l kissed you just for a second,
but it was enough.

548
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:37,189
l let her go. l didn't mean to.

549
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:39,466
- Kissing me didn't mean...
- No.

550
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:43,665
She was never gone. She was with me.

551
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:48,902
We should have been forever.

552
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:52,461
And l... l let her be dead.

553
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:58,070
She's really dead. And l killed her.

554
00:38:58,471 --> 00:39:01,065
Willow, no.

555
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:03,949
Please, baby, l'm so sorry.

556
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:07,983
Come back. l'm sorry. l'm sorry, come back!

557
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:15,659
Willow, l don't think you did anything wrong.

558
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:21,061
This is just magic. And l think
l'm figuring the whole magic thing out.

559
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:25,984
- lt's just like fairy tales.
- What are you doing?

560
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:28,665
Bringing you back to life.

561
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:50,224
Hm.

562
00:39:51,111 --> 00:39:53,102
l <i>am</i> good.

563
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:56,781
lt's me?

564
00:39:56,871 --> 00:39:59,829
l'm back? Oh, God.

565
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:04,065
Are you all right?

566
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:09,500
l have no idea.

567
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:17,427
l'm so tired.

568
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:19,103
Yeah.

569
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:22,825
l'll make you some tea.
