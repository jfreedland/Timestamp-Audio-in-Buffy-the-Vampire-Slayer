1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,718
- Previously:
- I love you.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,829
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,157
Here lies the warrior of the people.
Let her cross over!

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,238
I think I was in Heaven.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,353
I was torn out of there by my friends.
They can never know.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,075
We can't ignore this behaviour.
Something needs to be done.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,077
I'm glad you're here to take care of it.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,077
We're getting married.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,952
Willow, you're using too much magic.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,152
- Can we not do this now?
- Forget it ever happened.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,679
Forget.

13
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,029
Every single night, the same arrangement

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,594
I go out and fight the fight

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,075
Still I always feel the strange estrangement

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,668
Nothing here is real, nothing here is right

17
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,995
I've been making shows of trading blows

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,190
Just hoping no one knows

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,312
That I've been going through the motions

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,874
Walking through the part

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,120
Nothing seems to penetrate my heart

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,595
I was always brave, and kind of righteous

23
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,154
Now I find I'm wavering

24
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,748
Crawl out of your grave,
You'll find this fight just

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,872
- Doesn't mean a thing
- She ain't got that swing

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,395
Thanks for noticing

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,559
She does pretty well with fiends from Hell,
but lately we can tell

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,229
- That she's just going through the motions
- Going through the motions

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,476
Faking it somehow

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,116
She's not even half the girl she... Ow!

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,315
Will I stay this way for ever?

32
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,954
Sleepwalk through my life's endeavour?

33
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,435
- How can I repay...
- Whatever

34
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,518
I don't want to be

35
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,908
Going through the motions

36
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,429
Losing all my drive

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,710
I can't even see

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,308
If this is really me

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,796
And I just want to be

40
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,836
Alive

41
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,755
- Good morning, Buffy!
- Did Dawn get off to school all right?

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,599
What? Oh, yeah. I think so.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,389
Respect the cruller. And tame the doughnut!

44
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,476
That's still funny, sweetie.

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,273
So, uh, no research?

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,233
Nothing goin' on? Monsters or whatnot?

47
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,316
Good. Good.

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,396
So, did anybody...

49
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,593
last night, you know, did anybody...

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,676
burst into song?

51
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,636
Merciful Zeus!

52
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,672
- We thought it was just us!
- I had my guitar at the hotel...

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,872
- We were talking, then it was like...
- You were in a musical.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,152
That explains the huge backing orchestra
and the dancing room-service chaps.

55
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,477
- We argued, then it rhymed...
- An entire verse about couscous.

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,070
- It was very disturbing.
- What did you sing about?

57
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,715
I don't remember.
But it seemed perfectly normal.

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,877
But disturbing. Not natural.
Do you think it'll happen again?

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,672
We should look into it.

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,394
- With the books.
- Do we have any books on this?

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,115
We break it down. Look at the factors
before it happens again. I for one...

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,595
I've got a theory
That it's a demon

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,109
A dancing demon
No, something isn't right there

64
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,708
I've got a theory
Some kid is dreaming

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,195
And we're all stuck inside
his wacky Broadway nightmare

66
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,235
I've got a theory we should work this out

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,718
It's getting eerie
What's this cheery singing all about?

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,989
It could be witches!
Some evil witches

69
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,190
Which is ridiculous
cos witches they were persecuted

70
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,756
Wicca good and love the Earth
and women power and I'll be over here

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,394
I've got a theory
It could be bunnies

72
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,551
- I've got a...
- Bunnies aren't just cute

73
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,911
Like everybody supposes

74
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,398
They got them hoppy legs
and twitchy little noses

75
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,795
And what's with all the carrots?

76
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,869
What do they need
such good eyesight for anyway?

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,955
Bunnies!

78
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,197
Bunnies! It must be bunnies!

79
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,074
- Or maybe midgets
- I've got a theory we should work this fast

80
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,956
Because it clearly
could get serious before it's passed

81
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,276
I've got a theory
It doesn't matter

82
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,397
What can't we face if we're together?

83
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,799
What's in this place that we can't weather?

84
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,275
Apocalypse?

85
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,630
We've all been there

86
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,716
The same old trips

87
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,798
Why should we care?

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,878
What can't we do if we get in it?

89
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,108
We'll work it through within a minute

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,310
We have to try

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,715
We'll pay the price

92
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,156
It's do or die

93
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,590
Hey, I've died twice

94
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,430
- What can't we face if we're together?
- What can't we face?

95
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,189
- What's in this place that we can't weather?
- If we're together

96
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,949
There's nothing we can't face

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,114
Except for bunnies

98
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,598
- See, OK, that was disturbing.
- I thought it was neat.

99
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,951
So what is it? What's causing it?

100
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,435
I thought it didn't matter.

101
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,313
Well, I'm not quaking
in my stylish-yet-affordable boots,

102
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,874
but there's something unnatural going on.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,879
And that doesn't usually lead
to hugs and puppies.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,629
Well, is it just us?
I mean, is it only happening to us?

105
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,796
Cos that would probably mean a spell.

106
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,918
They got

107
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,235
the mustard

108
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,276
- out!
- They got the mustard out!

109
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,956
It's not just us.

110
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,035
Oh, my God. You will never believe
what happened at school today.

111
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,709
Everybody started singing and dancing?

112
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,990
I gave birth to a pterodactyl.

113
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,236
Oh, my God. Did it sing?

114
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,395
- So you guys too, huh?
- So what'd you sing about?

115
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,798
Math.

116
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,117
That's right! The volume. The text.

117
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,276
What text?

118
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,073
- The volumey... text.
- You know.

119
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,714
The mmummrfugh report.

120
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,558
The what now?

121
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,593
There's a few volumes at the house
about mystical chants, bacchanals.

122
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,790
- Might be relevant.
- Yeah, we could...

123
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,879
I'm a hair's breadth from investigating
bunnies, so I'm open to anything.

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,356
Great. We'll check it out
and we'll give you a call.

125
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,392
Yeah, this could blow
the whole thing wide open.

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,916
Do we have any books at all at home?

127
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,918
Who wants to be cooped up
on a day like this?

128
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,478
The sun is shining, there's songs going on,
those guys are checking you out...

129
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,319
What? What are they looking at?

130
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,149
- The hotness of you, doofus.
- Those boys really thought I was hot?

131
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,872
Entirely.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,275
Oh, my God. I'm cured!

133
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,675
I want the boys!

134
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,679
Do I have to fight to keep you?
Cos I'm not large with the butch.

135
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,360
I'm just not used to that.

136
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,471
They were really looking at me?

137
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,717
And you can't imagine what they see in you?

138
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,354
I know exactly what they see in me.

139
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,072
You.

140
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,829
I lived my life in shadow

141
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,111
Never the sun on my face

142
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,836
It didn't seem so sad though

143
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,077
I figured that was my place

144
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,236
Now I'm bathed in light

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,072
Something just isn't right

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,719
I'm under your spell

147
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,911
How else could it be

148
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,679
Anyone would notice me?

149
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,792
It's magic, I can tell

150
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,717
How you've set me free

151
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,832
Brought me out so easily

152
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,636
I saw a world enchanted

153
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,911
Spirits and charms in the air

154
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,676
I always took for granted

155
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,997
I was the only one there

156
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,831
But your power shone

157
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,628
Brighter than any I've known

158
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,558
I'm under your spell

159
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,636
Nothing I can do

160
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,433
You just took my soul with you

161
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,597
You worked your charms so well

162
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,597
Finally, I knew

163
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,029
Everything I dreamed was true

164
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,110
You make me believe

165
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,749
The moon to the tide

166
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,476
I can feel you inside

167
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,754
I'm under your spell

168
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,950
Surging like the sea

169
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,640
Go to you so helplessly

170
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,877
I break with every swell

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,752
Lost in ecstasy

172
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,189
Spread beneath my willow tree

173
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,311
You make me

174
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,594
Complete

175
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,234
You make me complete

176
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,035
You make me complete

177
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,509
You make me...

178
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,269
- I bet they're not even working.
- Who now?

179
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,076
Willow and Tara. You see the way they were
with each other? The get-a-roominess?

180
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,350
I bet they're...

181
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,514
Singing. They're probably singing right now.

182
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,870
I'm sure they're making every effort.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,433
- Oh, yeah.
- Xander.

184
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,518
Buffy, it's OK. I do know about this stuff.

185
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,309
- Besides, it's all kinda romantic.
- No, it's not.

186
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,309
Come on! Songs, dancing around.
What's gonna be wrong with that?

187
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,990
That's entertainment.

188
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,475
You want some breakfast, baby?

189
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,559
- You don't have to go to work?
- Nah, I shut the crew down for the day.

190
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,593
My guys start dancing around me,
I don't know if I can deal.

191
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,678
It's a flab thing. So, waffles?

192
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,078
Will you still make me waffles
when we're married?

193
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,558
No, I'll only make them for myself, but
by California law you will own half of them.

194
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,598
Hey, how about omelettes?
I could do an omelette...

195
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,030
This man that I plan to entangle

196
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,515
Isn't he fine?

197
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,757
My claim to fame
was to maim and to mangle

198
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,952
Vengeance was mine

199
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,277
But I'm out of the biz

200
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,631
The name I made, I'll trade for his

201
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,672
The only trouble is...

202
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,715
I'll never tell

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,518
She is the one
She's such wonderful fun

204
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,631
Such passion and grace

205
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,999
Warm in the night
when I'm right in her tight

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,680
Embrace, tight embrace

207
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,677
I'll never let her go

208
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,872
The love we've known can only grow

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,355
There's just one thing that...

210
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,835
No, I'll never tell

211
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,269
Cos there's nothing to tell

212
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,678
- He snores
- She wheezes

213
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,472
Say "housework" and he freezes

214
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,797
She eats these skeezy cheeses
that I can't describe

215
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,276
- I talk, he breezes
- She doesn't know what pleases

216
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,358
His penis got diseases
from a Chumash tribe

217
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,316
The vibe gets kind of scary

218
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,556
- Like she thinks I'm ordinary
- Like it's all just temporary

219
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,036
- Like her toes are kind of hairy
- But it's all very well

220
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,594
Cos God knows, I'll never tell

221
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,631
When things get rough, he
Just hides behind his Buffy

222
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,230
Now look, he's getting huffy
cos he knows that I know

223
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,557
She clings, she's needy
She's also really greedy

224
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,193
- She nev...
- His eyes are beady

225
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,231
This is my verse! Hello!
She...

226
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,715
Look at me! I'm dancing crazy!

227
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,510
You know...

228
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,394
- You're quite the charmer
- My knight in armour

229
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,557
You're the cutest of the Scoobies
With your lips as red as rubies

230
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,638
And your firm yet supple... tight embrace!

231
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,271
- He's swell
- She's sweller

232
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,879
He'll always be my fella

233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,197
That's why I'll never tell her
that I'm petrified

234
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,235
I've read this tale
There's wedding, then betrayal

235
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,511
I know that come the day
I'll want to run and hide

236
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,029
I lied

237
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,357
I said it's easy

238
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,553
I've tried

239
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,593
But there's these fears I can't quell

240
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,792
Is she looking for a pot of gold?

241
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,117
Will I look good when I've gotten old?

242
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,437
Will our lives become too stressful
if I'm never that successful?

243
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,552
When I get so worn and wrinkly
that I look like David Brinkley

244
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,033
- Am I crazy?
- Am I dreaming?

245
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,559
Am I marrying a demon?

246
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,752
We could really raise the beam in
making marriage a hell

247
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,553
So, thank God, I'll never tell

248
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,433
I swear that I'll never tell

249
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,796
My lips are sealed

250
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,036
I take the Fifth

251
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,594
Nothin' to see, move it along

252
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,750
I'll never tell

253
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,358
- It's a nightmare. It's a plague.
- It's like we were being watched.

254
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,838
- I didn't wanna say things but they came out.
- Like a wall was missing from our apartment.

255
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,712
- My toes are not hairy!
- My eyes are not beady!

256
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,400
- You gotta stop it.
- I am looking into some leads...

257
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,494
Of course, our number is a retro pastiche...

258
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:18,389
that's never going to be
a breakaway pop hit.

259
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,832
- Gimme an axe. Show me where to point it.
- As ever, it's not quite that simple.

260
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,669
- But I have learned some disturbing things...
- ...put that pad away

261
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,439
I'm asking you, please no

262
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,632
It isn't right, it isn't fair

263
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,638
There was no parking anywhere

264
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,150
I think that hydrant wasn't there

265
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,953
Why can't you let it go?

266
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,471
- I think I've paid more than my share...
- Somebody set people on fire? That's nuts!

267
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,639
I don't know. One more verse of our ditty
and I'd have been looking for a gas can.

268
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,309
Well, clearly emotions are running high.
But as far as I can tell

269
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,399
these people burnt up from the inside,
spontaneously combusted.

270
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,877
I've only seen the one. I examined the body
while the police were taking witness arias.

271
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,073
But we're sure the things are related, the
singing and dancing and burning and dying.

272
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,194
We're not sure of much. Buffy's looking
for leads at the local demon haunts.

273
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,269
At least, in theory she is,
but she doesn't seem to...

274
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,030
She's easing back into it. We pulled her
out of an untold Hell dimension.

275
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,119
Ergo the weirdness.
The important thing is to be there for her.

276
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,033
I'm helping her as much as I can, but...

277
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,230
The sun sets and she appears.

278
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,150
- Come to serenade me?
- So you know what's going on.

279
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,953
I've seen some damn funny things
the last two days.

280
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,392
A 600-pound Chirago demon making like
Yma Sumac, that one will stay with you.

281
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,512
I remain immune, happy to say.

282
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,039
Drink?

283
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,230
A world of no.

284
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,876
So any idea what's causing this?

285
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,836
Oh. So that's all. You've just come
to pump me for information.

286
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,394
What else would I wanna pump you for?

287
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,795
I really just said that, didn't I?

288
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,357
Yeah, well, don't wanna
bore you with the small talk.

289
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,079
Don't know a thing.

290
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,320
- What's up? You're all bad-moody.
- It's nothing. Glad you could stop by.

291
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,119
- It's nothing!
- What?

292
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,120
I died

293
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,834
So many years ago

294
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,119
But you can make me feel

295
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,674
Like it isn't so

296
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,916
And why you come to be with me

297
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,039
I think I finally know

298
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,396
You're scared
Ashamed of what you feel

299
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,674
And you can't tell the ones you love

300
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,268
You know they couldn't deal

301
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,789
Whisper in a dead man's ear

302
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,595
It doesn't make it real

303
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,232
That's great
But I don't wanna play

304
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,190
Cos bein' with you touches me

305
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,675
More than I can say

306
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,109
But since I'm only dead to you

307
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,391
I'm saying stay away

308
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,672
And let me rest in peace

309
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,756
Let me rest in peace

310
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,916
Let me get some sleep

311
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,474
Let me take my love and bury it

312
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,670
In a hole six foot deep

313
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,079
I can lay my body down
but I can't find my sweet release

314
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,079
So let me rest in peace

315
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,113
You know

316
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,959
You got a willing slave

317
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,230
And you just love to play the thought

318
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,396
That you might misbehave

319
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,397
But till you do I'm tellin' you

320
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,796
Stop visitin' my grave

321
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,799
And let me rest in peace

322
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,629
I know I should go

323
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,632
But I follow you like a man possessed

324
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,038
There's a traitor here beneath my breast

325
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,438
And it hurts me more
than you've ever guessed

326
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,758
If my heart could beat
it would break my chest

327
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,158
But I can see you're unimpressed

328
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,157
So leave me be

329
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,589
And let me rest in peace

330
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,711
Let me get some sleep

331
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,195
Let me take my love and bury it

332
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,515
In a hole six foot deep

333
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,158
I can lay my body down
but I can't find my sweet release

334
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,078
Let me rest in peace.

335
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,633
Why won't you

336
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,550
Let me rest in peace?

337
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,273
So you're not staying then?

338
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,118
- Lot of homework?
- Math.

339
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,152
It seemed cool
when we were singing about it.

340
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,750
Willow said they have a lead
on the whole musical-extravaganza evil.

341
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,634
This demon that can be summoned,
some sort of lord of the dance.

342
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,910
But not the scary one. Just a demon.

343
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,638
- Do they know who summoned it?
- They don't even know its name.

344
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,036
But Willow will find out.
She's a brainy type.

345
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,678
- I'm glad you guys made up.
- What?

346
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,598
That fight you guys had
about magic and stuff?

347
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,917
It gives me belly rumblings
when you guys fight.

348
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,235
Dawn, Willow and I never fought about...

349
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,635
It's OK. It's just...

350
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,470
You guys are so great together.
I just hate it when you...

351
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,831
But that was the only fight
I've seen you guys have anyway.

352
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,235
But I'm still glad it's over.

353
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,838
Dawn, I...

354
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,635
There's something I need at the shop.
Will you be OK for a little while?

355
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,912
Yes. The 15-year-old can spend
half an hour alone in her locked house.

356
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,190
I won't be gone long.

357
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,392
Does anybody even notice?

358
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,917
Does anybody even care?

359
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,318
Why'd you run away?

360
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,115
Don't you like my style?

361
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,031
Why don't you come and play?

362
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,912
I guarantee a

363
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,555
Great big smile

364
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,036
I come from the imagination

365
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,438
And I'm here strictly by your invocation

366
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,391
So whaddaya say?

367
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,273
Why don't we dance awhile?

368
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,151
I'm the heart of swing

369
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,829
I'm the twist and shout

370
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,671
When you gotta sing

371
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,189
When you gotta

372
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,880
Let it out

373
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,675
You call me and I come a-runnin'

374
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,234
I turn the music on

375
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,078
I bring the fun in

376
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,872
Now we're partyin'

377
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,959
That's what it's all about

378
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,876
Cos I know

379
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,629
What you feel, girl

380
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,958
I know

381
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,632
Just what you feel, girl

382
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,317
So you're, like, a good demon?
Bringin' the fun in?

383
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,953
All these melodies

384
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,834
They go on too long

385
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,757
Then that energy

386
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,189
Starts to come on

387
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,073
Way too strong

388
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,273
All those hearts laid open, that must sting

389
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,995
Plus some customers just start combusting

390
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,231
That's the penalty

391
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,557
When life is but a song

392
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,230
You brought me down
and doomed this town

393
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,716
So when we blow this scene

394
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,513
Back we will go to my kingdom below

395
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,269
And you will be my queen

396
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,517
Cos I know what you feel, girl

397
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,076
No, you see, you and me
wouldn't be very regal

398
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,079
I'll make it real, girl

399
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,273
What I mean, I'm fifteen
So this queen thing's illegal

400
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,029
I can bring whole cities to ruin

401
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,675
And still have time to get a soft-shoe in

402
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,793
Well, that's great, but I'm late
and I'd hate to delay her

403
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,435
Something's cookin', I'm at the griddle

404
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,110
I bought Nero his very first fiddle

405
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,279
She'll get pissed if I'm missed
See, my sister's the Slayer

406
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,789
The Slayer?

407
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,830
Find her. Tell her... tell her everything.

408
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,590
Just get her here.
I wanna see the Slayer burn.

409
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,150
Now we're partyin'

410
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,239
That's what it's all about

411
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,752
Good. Good.

412
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,316
I feel like I should bow, or...
have honour, or something.

413
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,513
It may seem hokey but we need precision
and concentration as much as power.

414
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,677
- We're not sure what we're facing.
- Oh, you'll figure it out.

415
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,078
I'm worried this session's gonna turn into
some training montage from an '80s movie.

416
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Well, if we hear any
inspirational power chords,

417
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:06,718
we'll just lie down until they go away.

418
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,753
Anyway, I don't think we need
to work that much on your strength.

419
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,633
Yeah, I'm pretty spry for a corpse.

420
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,635
Have you spoken to Dawn
about that incident at Hallowe'en?

421
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,436
I thought you took care of that.

422
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,078
- Right.
- What would I do without you?

423
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,548
OK. I'm ready.

424
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,237
You're not ready for the world outside

425
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,195
You keep pretending, but you just can't hide

426
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,835
I know I said that I'd be
standing by your side

427
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,315
But I...

428
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,598
Your path's unbeaten and it's all uphill

429
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,711
And you can meet it, but you never will

430
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,913
And I'm the reason
that you're standing still

431
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,235
But I...

432
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,194
I wish I could say the right words

433
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,958
To lead you through this land

434
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,868
Wish I could play the father

435
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,831
And take you by the hand

436
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,758
Wish I could stay here

437
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,273
But now I understand

438
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,834
I'm standing

439
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,269
In the way

440
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,471
The cries around you, you don't hear at all

441
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,316
Cos you know I'm here to take that call

442
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,269
So you just lie there
when you should be standing tall

443
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,709
But I...

444
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,753
I wish I could lay your arms down

445
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,711
And let you rest at last

446
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,389
Wish I could slay your demons

447
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,397
But now that time has passed

448
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,035
Wish I could stay here

449
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,799
Your stalwart, standing fast

450
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,559
But I'm standing

451
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,399
In the way

452
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,557
I'm just standing

453
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,399
In the way

454
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,670
Did you just say something?

455
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,795
I'm under your spell

456
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,309
God, how can this be?

457
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,830
Playing with my memory

458
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,794
You know I've been through hell

459
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,309
Willow, don't you see?

460
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,432
There'll be nothing left of me

461
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,869
You made me

462
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,518
- Believe
- Believe me, I don't wanna go

463
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,036
And it'll grieve me cos I love you so

464
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,199
But we both know

465
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,711
- Wish I could say the right words
- Wish I could trust that it was

466
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,354
- To lead you through this land
- Just this once, but I must do

467
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,189
- Wish I could play the father
- What I must. I can't adjust to this

468
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,880
- And take you by the hand
- Disgust, we're done and I just

469
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,755
Wish I could stay

470
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,992
Wish I could stay

471
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,758
Wish I could stay

472
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,509
Wish I could

473
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,918
Stay

474
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,595
Lookie lookie what I found.

475
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,915
- Is this the demon guy?
- Tara!

476
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,238
Works for him. Has a nice little
story for the Slayer, don't you?

477
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,194
Come on, then. Sing.

478
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,394
My master has the Slayer's sister at the
Bronze because she summoned him.

479
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,830
At midnight he's going to take her
to the underworld to be his queen.

480
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,757
What does he want?

481
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,518
Her.

482
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,313
If that's all you've got to say, then I'm...

483
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,158
Strong.

484
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,555
Someday he'll be a real boy.

485
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,069
So, Dawn's in trouble.

486
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,272
- Must be Tuesday.
- I just left her for a few minutes.

487
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,631
It's not your fault. So what's the plan?

488
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,194
- Plan, schman. Let's mount up.
- No.

489
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,438
Dawn had the wrong idea
in summoning this creature, but...

490
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,712
I've seen some of these underworld
child-bride deals and they never end well.

491
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,310
- Well, maybe once.
- We're not just gonna stay here?

492
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,998
Yes, we are.

493
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,556
Buffy's going alone.

494
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,674
- Don't be a stupid git. There is no...
- If I want your opinion, Spike, I'll...

495
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,552
I'll never want your opinion.

496
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,513
- A little confusion spell could...
- No!

497
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,393
I mean, I don't think it'll help.

498
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,080
Forget them, Slayer. I got your back.

499
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,796
I thought you wanted me to stay away
from you. Isn't that what you sang?

500
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,876
Spike sing a wittle song?

501
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,595
- Was it a pop hit or more of a book number?
- Let it go, sweetie.

502
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,789
Fine. I hope you dance till you burn.

503
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,070
You and the little bit.

504
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,112
You're really not coming?

505
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,231
It's up to you, Buffy.

506
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,238
- What do you expect me to do?
- Your best.

507
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,757
I touch the fire

508
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,440
And it freezes me

509
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,676
I look into it and it's black

510
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,591
Why can't I feel?

511
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,917
My skin should crack and peel

512
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,998
I want the fire back

513
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,916
Now through the smoke, she calls to me

514
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,589
To make my way across the flame

515
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,233
To save the day

516
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,750
Or maybe melt away

517
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,393
I guess it's all the same

518
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,196
So I will walk through the fire

519
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,238
Cos where else can I turn?

520
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,278
I will walk through the fire

521
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,992
And let it...

522
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,995
The torch I bear is scorchin' me

523
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,191
And Buffy's laughin', I've no doubt

524
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,158
I hope she fries

525
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,158
I'm free if that bitch dies!

526
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,919
I'd better help her out

527
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,716
Cos she is drawn to the fire

528
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,071
- Some people never learn
- She will never learn

529
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,637
And she will walk through the fire

530
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,988
And let it...

531
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,591
Will this do a thing to change her?
Am I leaving Dawn in danger?

532
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,156
Is my slayer too far gone to care?

533
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,390
What if Buffy can't defeat it?

534
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,715
Beady-Eyes is right, we're needed!

535
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,116
Or we could just sit around and glare

536
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,711
We'll see it through
It's what we're always here to do

537
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,197
So we will walk through the fire

538
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,917
So one by one, they turn from me

539
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,477
- I guess my friends can't face the cold
- What can't we face

540
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,037
- Why I froze, not one among them knows
- If we're together?

541
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,118
And never can be told

542
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,549
- She came from the grave much graver
- So one by one

543
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,875
- First he'll kill her, then I'll save her
- They come to me

544
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,278
- Everything is turning out so dark
- The distant redness as their guide

545
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,595
- No, I'll save her, then I'll kill her
- That single flame

546
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,790
- I think this line's mostly filler
- Ain't what they had in mind

547
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,596
- What's it going to take to strike a spark?
- It's what they have inside

548
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,917
- These endless days are ending in a blaze
- She will come

549
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,999
- And we are caught in the fire
- To me!

550
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,118
The point of no return

551
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,631
So we will walk through the fire

552
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,988
And let it

553
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,918
Burn

554
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,794
Let it burn

555
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,838
Let it burn

556
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,916
Let it burn!

557
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,916
Showtime.

558
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,119
- I love a good entrance.
- How are you with death scenes?

559
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,277
You got a name?

560
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,391
I've got a hundred.

561
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,432
I ought to know, if you're
gonna be my brother-in-law.

562
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,630
Buffy, I swear I didn't do it.

563
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,194
Don't worry. You're not going anywhere.

564
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,112
- I am.
- What?

565
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,117
Deal's this. I can't kill you,
you take me to Hellsville in her place.

566
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,073
- What if I kill you?
- Trust me. Won't help.

567
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,353
- That's gloomy.
- That's life.

568
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,872
Come, now, is that really what you feel?

569
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,833
Isn't life a miraculous thing?

570
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,629
I think you already know.

571
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,035
Life's a show
And we all play our parts

572
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,994
And when the music starts

573
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,351
We open up our hearts

574
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,555
It's all right
if some things come out wrong

575
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,150
We'll sing a happy song

576
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,639
And you can sing along

577
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,637
Where there's life there's hope

578
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,478
Every day's a gift

579
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,192
Wishes can come true

580
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,151
Whistle while you work

581
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,554
So hard, all day

582
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,229
To be like other girls

583
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,555
To fit in in this glittering world

584
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,670
Don't give me songs

585
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,271
- She needs backup. Anya, Tara.
- Don't give me songs

586
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,074
Give me something to sing about

587
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,558
I need something to sing about

588
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,674
Life's a song
you don't get to rehearse

589
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,110
And every single verse

590
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,950
Can make it that much worse

591
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,114
Still my friends
don't know why I ignore

592
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,630
The million things or more

593
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,833
I should be dancing for

594
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,951
All the joy life sends

595
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,752
Family and friends

596
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,711
All the twists and bends

597
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,512
Knowing that it ends

598
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,914
Well that depends

599
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,508
On if they let you go

600
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,915
On if they know enough to know

601
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,958
That when you've bowed

602
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,316
You leave the crowd

603
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,950
There was no pain

604
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,117
No fear, no doubt

605
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,595
Till they pulled me out

606
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,075
Of Heaven

607
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,635
So that's my refrain

608
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,392
I live in Hell

609
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,875
Cos I've been expelled

610
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,230
From Heaven

611
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,750
I think I was in Heaven

612
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,550
So give me something to sing about

613
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,790
Please give me something...

614
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,634
Life's not a song

615
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,916
Life isn't bliss

616
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,600
Life is just this

617
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,518
It's living

618
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,428
You'll get along

619
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,635
The pain that you feel

620
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,149
You only can heal

621
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,113
By living

622
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,876
You have to go on living

623
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,709
So one of us is living

624
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,153
The hardest thing in this world
is to live in it.

625
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,905
Now that was a show-stopping number.

626
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:37,270
Not quite the fireworks
that I was looking for...

627
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,152
Get out of here.

628
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,953
Mm, I smell power.

629
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,992
I guess the little missus and I
should be on our way.

630
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,076
That's never gonna happen.

631
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,715
I don't make the rules. She summoned me.

632
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,593
I so did not. He keeps saying that.

633
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,954
You have my talisman on, sweet thing.

634
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,038
Oh, but, no, I...

635
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,314
This... at the Magic Box, on the floor.
I was cleaning, and I forgot...

636
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,319
- But I didn't summon anything.
- Well, now, that's a twist.

637
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,676
If it was in the shop,
then one of us probably...

638
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,917
- Xander?
- Well, I didn't know what was gonna happen.

639
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,918
I just thought there were
gonna be dances and songs.

640
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,759
I just wanted to make sure we'd work out.

641
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,870
Get a happy ending.

642
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,560
I think everything worked out just fine.

643
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,793
Does this mean that I have to...

644
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,472
be your queen?

645
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,795
It's tempting.

646
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,230
But I think we'll waive
that clause just this once.

647
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,434
Big smiles, everyone!

648
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,551
You beat the bad guy.

649
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,357
What a lot of fun

650
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,678
You guys have been real swell

651
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,991
And there's not a one

652
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,634
Who can say this

653
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,673
Ended well

654
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,675
All those secrets you've been concealing

655
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,315
Say you're happy now

656
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,556
Once more, with feeling

657
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,557
Now I gotta run

658
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,636
See you all

659
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:30,277
In Hell!

660
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,310
Where do we go

661
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,396
From here?

662
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,750
Where do we go

663
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,838
From here?

664
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,550
The battle's done and we kind of won

665
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,036
So we sound our victory cheer

666
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,916
Where do we go

667
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,395
From here?

668
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,157
Why is the path

669
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,430
Unclear?

670
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,117
When we know home

671
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,879
Is near?

672
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,392
Understand we'll go hand in hand

673
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,512
But we'll walk alone in fear

674
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,993
Tell me

675
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,236
Where do we go

676
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,715
From here?

677
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,117
When does "The End"

678
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,674
Appear?

679
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,313
- Bugger this.
- When do the trumpets cheer?

680
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,112
The curtains close on a kiss, God knows

681
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,198
We can tell the end is near...

682
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,789
You should go back inside.

683
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,549
Finish the big group sing.
Get your kum ba ya-yas out.

684
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,796
I don't want to.

685
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,435
The day you suss out what you do want,
there'll probably be a parade.

686
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,028
76 bloody trombones.

687
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,994
- Spike...
- Look, you don't have to say anything.

688
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:29,069
I touch the fire and it freezes me

689
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,035
- I died so many years ago
- I look into it and it's black

690
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:42,356
- This isn't real, but I just want to feel
- But you can make me feel

691
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,589
Where do we go from here?

692
