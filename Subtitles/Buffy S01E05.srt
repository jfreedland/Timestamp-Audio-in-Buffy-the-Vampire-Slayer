1
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:16,797
We haven't been properly introduced.

2
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:19,550
I'm Buffy, and you're... history!

3
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,627
Poor technique. Prioritising, sub-par.

4
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:28,218
Execution was adequate,

5
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,931
but a bit too... bloody for my taste.

6
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:35,235
Giles, don't mention it. It was my pleasure
to make the world safe for humanity again.

7
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,696
I'm not saying that
your methods are without merit.

8
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:39,933
It's... You're spending
too much time and energy.

9
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:43,243
It should simply be
plunge and move on, plunge and...

10
00:00:43,278 --> 00:00:45,458
Hello.

11
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:52,533
Oh, that's great!

12
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:55,710
I kill 'em, you fence their stuff.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,357
- What is it?
- I don't know.

14
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,102
- But it bothers you.
- Yes. I...

15
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:04,183
I thought this vampire
was just on a random kill,

16
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:07,202
- but it may be something else.
- Something big?

17
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:10,508
 Yes. I'd best consult my books.

18
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:16,157
"And there will be a time of crisis."

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,951
"Of worlds hanging in the balance."

20
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:21,121
"And in this time shall come...

21
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:24,207
..the Anointed."

22
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,794
"The Master's great warrior."

23
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,964
"And the Slayer will not know him,

24
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,300
will not stop him,

25
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:36,221
and he will lead her into Hell."

26
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,390
"As it is written,

27
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,560
so shall it be."

28
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:44,189
"Five will die,

29
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:48,819
and from their ashes
the Anointed shall rise."

30
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:54,242
"The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him

31
00:01:54,326 --> 00:02:00,248
and usher him to his immortal destiny."

32
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:02,418
"As it is written,

33
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:04,587
so shall it be."

34
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:09,258
And one of the Brethren
shall go out hunting

35
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:12,110
the night before and get himself killed,

36
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:16,059
because he couldn't wait
to finish his job before he ate.

37
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:18,478
Oh, wait.

38
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:23,317
That's not written anywhere.

39
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:29,324
The Anointed will be
my greatest weapon against the Slayer.

40
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,618
If you fail to bring him to me,

41
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:35,080
if you allow that girl to stop you...

42
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,465
Here endeth the lesson.

43
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:44,910
That symbol on the ring.

44
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:48,080
I believe it's the rune for fidelity but...

45
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:52,126
it doesn't connect with any
of the sects that I've studied.

46
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,381
What about this? On the inside
it's a sun and three stars.

47
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:59,351
- Haven't we seen that somewhere?
- Let me see.

48
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:05,225
No, I don't think this represents any...

49
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:08,427
Wait. It's right here. "Sun and three stars."

50
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:12,862
Ugh. Check these guys out.
I told you it looked familiar.

51
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:17,314
"By the Order of Aurelius." Yes, you're right.

52
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:21,541
Ooh! Two points for the Slayer
while the Watcher has yet to score.

53
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:26,995
Oh. Owen. Hi.

54
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,410
- What do you want?
- A book?

55
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:34,046
See, this is a school and we have students

56
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:36,437
and they check out books
and then they learn things.

57
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:38,721
I was beginning to suspect that was a myth.

58
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:42,375
I lost my Emily... Dickinson.

59
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,188
It's dumb but... I like her around.
Kind of a security blanket.

60
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:49,943
I have something like that.
Well, it's an actual blanket.

61
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:53,071
And I don't really
carry it around any more.

62
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:56,534
So! Emily Dickens, huh? She's great.

63
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:58,703
- Dickinson.
- She's good also.

64
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,539
Poetry.

65
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:04,751
I didn't think I'd find you here.

66
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,755
- Why not?
- I didn't mean...

67
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,885
I mean... I think you can read.

68
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:13,845
Oh, thanks.

69
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:16,097
But... you don't seem bookwormy.

70
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,542
The type of person to lock themselves

71
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:24,023
in a dark room with a lot of
musty, old books.

72
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:27,194
Oh, and I've offended you.

73
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:29,321
No!

74
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:33,242
No, I'm just surprised
you gave any thought to what I'm like.

75
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:35,411
You shouldn't be.

76
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,458
Oh, well, I love books.

77
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,252
I mean, I really love books.

78
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:45,130
- What's this?
- Oh... Not this one.

79
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:47,300
This one she doesn't love.

80
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:49,302
Oh! Emily Dickinson.

81
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:53,557
- We're both fans.
- Yes. She's quite a good poet.

82
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:55,976
I mean, for a...

83
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,562
- A girl?
- For an American.

84
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:00,732
I'll see you in math

85
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:03,318
if I open my eyes at some point.

86
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:05,487
Cool.

87
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:10,368
The Order of Aurelius
is a very old and venerated sect.

88
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:12,912
If they're here, it's for a good reason.

89
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:16,125
- That was Owen.
- Yes, I remember.

90
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:20,922
Do you have any more copies
of Emily Dickinson? I need one.

91
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,769
Buffy, while the mere fact of you
wanting to check out a book

92
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,600
would be grounds for a national holiday,

93
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:30,736
I think we should focus
on the problem at hand.

94
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,935
Right. I'm sorry. You're right.

95
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,105
Vampires.

96
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:39,339
Oh. Does this outfit make me look fat?

97
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:42,947
Owen Thurman was talking to you?

98
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,866
It's all true.

99
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:47,034
Wow! He hardly talks to anyone.

100
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:49,204
He's solitary, mysterious.

101
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:52,666
He can brood for 40 minutes straight.
I've clocked him.

102
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,835
He was so nice, it was eerie.

103
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,590
- What did you guys have to talk about?
- Emily Dickinson.

104
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,758
He reads Emily Dickinson?

105
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:03,428
He's sensitive, yet manly.

106
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:06,325
But wait. You've never even read her.

107
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,476
You vixen!

108
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:11,340
Has anybody given any thought
to what this green stuff is?

109
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:13,940
I'm avoiding the subject.

110
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,275
I think it's kale.
Or possibly string cheese.

111
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:19,684
So, Buffy, how'd the slaying go last night?

112
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:21,367
Xander!

113
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:23,535
I mean... how'd the laying go?

114
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:28,081
- No, I don't mean that either.
- It went fine, thank you.

115
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:30,793
There's some new hoity-toity
vampire sect in town.

116
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:32,374
That's bad.

117
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,774
Hey, they're bringing in
much-needed tourist dollars.

118
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:37,343
Ooh. Look at Mr Excitement.

119
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:39,678
Owen. He's all alone.

120
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,765
Maybe somebody should sit with him.

121
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,060
Mm, just to be polite.

122
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,188
Good luck.

123
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:53,540
OK, what just happened?

124
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:54,946
Look! An empty seat.

125
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,535
- Let me get that.
- Thanks.

126
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:03,478
Boy, Cordelia's hips are wider than I thought.

127
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:05,542
At least you don't have to eat
your Soylent Green.

128
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:10,338
Owen, a bunch of us are loitering
at the Bronze tonight. You there?

129
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:13,133
- Who else's going?
- Well, I'm gonna be there.

130
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:16,637
- Who else?
- You mean besides me?

131
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:19,975
- Buffy, what about you?
- What?

132
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:21,726
No, no, no.

133
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,937
She, uh... She doesn't like fun.

134
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:26,919
How about we meet there at eight?

135
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:30,553
Yeah. Eight.

136
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,847
There.

137
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:36,910
It's not a big deal. It's just
a bunch of people getting together.

138
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:39,079
- It's a very big deal!
- It's not.

139
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,146
It is! Tell her.

140
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:44,823
- I'm afraid it's very big.
- Thank you.

141
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,963
Wait. What are you talking about?

142
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:49,300
- What are you talking about?
- Boys.

143
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:52,495
Yes, well, I'm talking about trouble.
A violent and disturbing

144
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:55,358
- prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
- The Order of Aurelius.

145
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:57,713
You were spot-on about the connection.

146
00:08:57,748 --> 00:09:00,697
I've looked at the writings of Aurelius himself.

147
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:04,030
He prophesied that the brethren of
his order would come to the Master and...

148
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:05,563
bring him the Anointed.

149
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:08,196
- Who's that?
- Well, I don't know exactly. A warrior.

150
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,032
But it says "He will rise
from the ashes of the five...

151
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:15,320
..on the evening of the 1,000th day
after the advent of Septus."

152
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,023
Well we'll be ready, whenever it is.

153
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,337
- Which is tonight.
- Tonight, OK.

154
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:23,024
- Not OK! It can't be tonight!
- My calculations are precise.

155
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,628
They're bad calculations! Bad!

156
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:28,829
- Buffy has a really important date.
- Owen.

157
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:30,897
All right.
I'll just jump in my time machine,

158
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:33,021
go back to the 12th century
and ask the vampires to

159
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:36,477
postpone their ancient prophecy for a few
days while you take in dinner and a show.

160
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:39,275
OK, at this point you're abusing sarcasm.

161
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,946
Buffy, this is no ordinary vampire.

162
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,522
We have to stop him
before he reaches the Master.

163
00:09:44,557 --> 00:09:47,028
But... cute guy!

164
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:49,443
Teenager! Postpubescent fantasies!

165
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:52,106
Those will just have to be put on hold.

166
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:56,417
The Dark Forces are aligning against us,
and we have a chance to beat them back.

167
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:58,878
Tonight we go into battle.

168
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:08,265
- Perhaps I miscalculated.
- I'm thinking yes.

169
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:17,233
Well, you know what they say: 90 percent
of the vampire-slaying game is-is waiting.

170
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:23,115
- You couldn't have told me 90 percent ago?
- We've certainly waited here long enough.

171
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:26,786
Besides, there aren't any fresh graves.
Who's gonna rise?

172
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:29,873
Apparently no one, tonight.

173
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:33,210
Then I can bail? I can go
to the Bronze and find Owen?

174
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:35,921
Very well. Follow your hormones if you want.

175
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:39,233
But I assume I don't have to
warn you about the...

176
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:41,939
hazards of becoming
personally involved with someone 

177
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,381
who's unaware of your unique condition.

178
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:48,644
- Yeah, yeah, I read the back of the box.
- If your identity as a slayer is revealed,

179
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,648
it could put you and all those
around you in grave danger.

180
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:58,018
Well, in that case, I won't wear my button
that says "I'm A Slayer. Ask Me How."

181
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,510
Good night.

182
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:10,294
"Five shall die, and from their ashes
the Anointed shall rise."

183
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:13,190
I was sure it was tonight.

184
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,196
I went on an airplane.

185
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,450
A pale horse emerged
with Death as its rider.

186
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:40,598
You will be judged.

187
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,910
You will be judged.

188
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,890
<b><i>(# Rotten Apple by Three Day Wheely)</b></i>

189
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:53,015
<i># ...is real</i>

190
00:11:55,308 --> 00:12:03,673
<i># Then you wake up shouting

191
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:06,586

00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:13,024

00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:22,164

00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:29,339

199
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:46,613
That day's gonna bring fire.

200
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:49,199
Fire comin' down. Judgment.

201
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,579
Don't think you're ready.
Ready to look upon him.

202
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:57,416
If there's sin in there,
there's sin all around. It's a liquid.

203
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:01,254
On that day there won't be anybody
tellin' us what to do

204
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:04,007
or why we're doin' it.

205
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,926
You can't prepare.

206
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:09,555
- On that day...
- You gotta sit down.

207
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,516
OK?

208
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:16,355
Are you willing to stand
with the righteous?

209
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:40,298
Is everyone OK?

210
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:58,111
Are you all right?

211
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,451
Can you move?

212
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:30,692
- So you just went home?
- What was I supposed to do?

213
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:33,589
Say to Owen: "Sorry, I was late.
I was sitting in a cemetery

214
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,734
with a librarian waiting
for a vampire to rise

215
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,865
so I could prevent an evil prophecy
from coming to pass"?

216
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,284
Or... flat tyre?

217
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:44,010
I can't take this any more.
I feel like everyone is staring at me.

218
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:46,200
The big, hideous, dateless monster.

219
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:48,105
What? Yeah, that's right, I have no life.

220
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:52,907
C'mon, nothin' to see here, pal.
Move it along!

221
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:56,262
You're acting a little overly, aren't you?
I mean, you could have any guy in school.

222
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:59,613
He's not "any guy". He's more... Oweny.

223
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,323
Sure, he's got a certain Owenosity,
but... that's not hard to find.

224
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,755
I mean, a lot of guys read.

225
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,844
I can read.

226
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:13,030
- Hey, Buffy.
- Owen.

227
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,763
Oh, look. It's Owen.

228
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:19,173
Buffy and Owen. And Xander. That'd be me.

229
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,492
- Where were you last night?
- Oh.

230
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:27,416
Well, um, my watch broke and
we don't have any... clocks in our house

231
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:30,290
so I didn't know what time it was
or even what day it was.

232
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:32,954
I thought I was the only one
that happened to.

233
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:35,683
How about we try it again for tonight?

234
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:38,686
I'll even lend you my watch.

235
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:44,274
Tonight? You and me?

236
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:48,445
Well, we could invite the Chess Club
 but... they drink and start fights.

237
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:55,467
Oh, no, it's just... Well, I sort of heard
that... you and Cordelia were somewhat...

238
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:57,972
all over each other. A little.

239
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:01,983
I danced with her a couple of times.
She's... kinda grabby.

240
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:06,299
Well, let's see.
If I rearrange that and I push that to

241
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,217
Sure! Tonight'll work.

242
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,888
- Great. I'll pick you up at seven?
- Um...

243
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:15,267
- Seven.
- That's when the little hand's there.

244
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,854
Oh. Between the six and the eight.

245
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:21,441
I'll see you then.

246
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:27,406
Tonight. Isn't that so...

247
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:30,160
- What?
- Me and Owen.

248
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:36,082
Yeah. "So" it is.

249
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:40,504
It sure is "so".

250
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:49,806
- Hey! How's it goin'?
- All right.

251
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,897
That's great. I see we're still
workin' on that Anointed One problem.

252
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:56,377
That'll probably take you a few days,
right? I mean, that's one obscure prophecy.

253
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:58,005
Yes. Well, there are
quite a few interpretations.

254
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,424
So, tonight's lookin' pretty slow, right?
Probably best to relax and regroup.

255
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:08,278
No big disasters coming. That is so good!
I will see you tomorrow, then. Bye!

256
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:12,089
She is the strangest girl.

257
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,419
You have done well.

258
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:18,005
Everything is in place.

259
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,509
When this night's work is done,

260
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:22,970
I will have a mighty ally.

261
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:29,554
I'll be one step closer to freeing myself
from this... mystical prison.

262
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:36,426
I've been trapped down here so long,
I've nearly forgotten

263
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:38,919
what it's like on the surface.

264
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:42,834
Well, there'll be time enough to remember

265
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,019
when I rule it.

266
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:49,051
If she tries to stop you,

267
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:50,501
kill her.

268
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:55,990
Give your own lives,
but do not fail to bring the Anointed.

269
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,790
I know you won't disappoint me.

270
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:02,265
Bug.

271
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:06,227
- Pick.
- OK.

272
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:08,772
Do I want to appear shy, coy and naive

273
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:12,026
or unrestrained, insatiable and aggressive?

274
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:14,182
You know, Owen is a little homespun.

275
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:17,490
He probably doesn't like
that overly assertive look.

276
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:19,993
Oh, hey. Here's something.

277
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:23,414
A nice, comfy overcoat and a ski cap.

278
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:26,125
The earflaps'll bring out your eyes.

279
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:31,641
Maybe I should mix-and-match.
OK, guy's opinion.

280
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:35,004
Which do you think Owen will like better?
The red or the peach?

281
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,890
Oh, you mean for kissing you and then
telling all his friends how easy you are

282
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:42,686
so the whole school loses respect for you
and then talks behind your back?

283
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,737
- The red's fine.
- Thanks. I'll go with the peach.

284
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:50,468
Here. Put this on.

285
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:54,115
You're not botherin' me.

286
00:18:56,945 --> 00:18:59,664
- So where is he taking you?
- Oh, I don't know.

287
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,832
Where do you suppose
young kids go on dates these days?

288
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:06,255
Well, I read somewhere once
that sometimes they go to movies.

289
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,715
Movies? Interesting.

290
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,513
And I saw on TV once
a bunch of people our age went to a party.

291
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:17,935
Wow! I never knew being a teenager
was so full of possibilities.

292
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:24,609
That's Owen.

293
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:28,572
- That's Giles.
- We need to talk.

294
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,159
Buffy's not home.

295
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:32,803
My calculations may not've been
as far off as I thought.

296
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:35,797
"Five die in van accident"?

297
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:38,906
"Out of the ashes of five
shall rise the one"

298
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:41,380
That's the prophecy. Five people have died!

299
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,779
In a car crash.

300
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,058
I know it doesn't quite follow,
but-but it's worth investigating. Look!

301
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:47,481
"Among the dead was Andrew Borba,

302
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:49,733
whom the police sought for questioning
in a double murder."

303
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:52,056
He may be the Anointed One.

304
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,494
The bodies were taken to
Sunnydale Funeral Home. We can...

305
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:59,084
- Giles, why do you want to hurt me?
- I beg your pardon?

306
00:19:59,119 --> 00:19:59,900
Hey.

307
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,820
Uh... Hi.

308
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,632
- You have a date?
- Yes, but...

309
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,867
I'll return those
overdue books by tomorrow.

310
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:11,628
- You're not getting off that easily.
- Man, you really care about your work!

311
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:14,482
Uh... Owen?

312
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:17,214
Yeah, a couple of things about tonight.

313
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:20,751
Another date?
Don't you ever do anything else?

314
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,843
This is the first date! There's never been a date.

315
00:20:22,844 --> 00:20:24,652
OK? This is my maiden voyage!

316
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,638
What, she doesn't like to dance?

317
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:29,224
Well, it's a little too late
to do anything about that.

318
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,684
Uh, you should probably know
that Buffy doesn't like to be kissed.

319
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:34,344
- Actually she doesn't like to be touched.
- Xander...

320
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:36,249
As a matter of fact,
don't even look at her.

321
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:38,309
- We don't even know if this is anything.
- No, we don't.

322
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,311
- And I haven't had a day off for a while.
- True.

323
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:43,115
And a cranky slayer is a careless slayer.

324
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,702
Buffy, maintaining
a normal social life as a slayer

325
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:49,164
is problematic at best.

326
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,328
This is the '90s -
the 1990s, in point of fact -

327
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:57,737
and I can do both. Clark Kent
has a job. I just wanna go on a date.

328
00:20:57,772 --> 00:21:00,093
Well, I suppose it was a fairly slim lead.

329
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:03,347
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I won't go far, OK?

330
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,959
If the apocalypse comes, beep me.

331
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,185
- Is everything cool?
- All set.

332
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:11,139
Yes, and you'll face
a pretty hefty fine in the morning.

333
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:13,351
Well, bye. Don't wait up.

334
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:16,779
Is something going on?

335
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:18,741
Probably not, no. I...

336
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:22,135
I suppose I'll just...
go to the funeral home in case.

337
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,739
Just see if anything comes up.

338
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:26,707

I wish it was just bad.

340
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,224
We should go along.

341
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:33,114
Yeah, you're right.

342
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:36,870
I don't trust that Owen guy.
It's the eyes. They're crazy.

343
00:21:36,905 --> 00:21:40,306
Xander, we should go with Giles.
He could get in trouble.

Oh, he's gone! He's gonna be all right.

345

The thing about Emily Dickinson I love
is that she's just so incredibly morbid.

351
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:16,597

And a lot about bees, for some reason.

354

Did she have a tragic
and romantic life with a lot of bees?

355
00:22:25,523 --> 00:22:28,402
Quiet. Kind of sequestered and uneventful.

356
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:33,074

I don't get out much.

- I don't get that.

were seeing each other.

Oh, yeah. Well, We knew
it would happen eventually.

442

443
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:11,404
And you guys are thinking double...?

444

445
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:17,653
And you're here because of work?

446
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:20,010
Hey, maybe we should all
go somewhere together.

447
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:24,150
Gee, that's so nice of you to ask, but Owen
and I were, well, sort of... Owen and I.

Do you think we could all sneak in?

452
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:38,704

They seemed to be having fun.

- D'you want to bail on me?
- No! No, no.

a really, really good time

463
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:13,624
and will come back. I promise.

464

no guards, so we don't get in trouble.

474

Two more of the Brethren
came in here. They came after me.

479
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:56,134
But I was more than a match for them.

480
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,303
- Meaning...?
- I hid.

481
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:02,850
But this chap was good enough
to bunk with me till they went away.

482
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:06,729
But were they here after you,
or was it that prophecy thing?

483

That's what we have to find out.

484
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:11,606
I don't know what these...
Brethren mean to do exactly.

485
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,959
Find the Anointed?
Or-or give him something, perhaps?

486
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,432
It's all very vague.
And the Anointed may be long gone.

487
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:20,767
- But he may not be.
- We must find out.

488
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:23,920
OK. I just need to get Owen and
the others out of harm's way first.

489
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:29,069
- Owen? You brought a date?
- I didn't bring him. He came.

490
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:31,436
Buffy, when I said you could
slay vampires and have a social life,

491
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:33,654
- I didn't mean at the same time.
- I know.

492
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:36,055
- I'll get rid of him.
- You can't make him go out there alone.

493
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,099
We don't know where the Brethren are.

494
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:40,268
- I'll just...
- No! No, Giles.

495
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:43,397
If he sees you, he's gonna have more
questions than he already does right now.

496
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,566
I'll... take care of it.

497
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:52,198

- It is.

498

- And we'll be leaving?
- We're not done lookin' around yet.

499
00:32:54,568 --> 00:32:59,707
No, he's right. So let's find a nice,
safe, fun room to look around in.

500
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,628
We tried the office here but it's locked.

I have to go to the bathroom.

or something, just be really quiet.

And barricade the door.

508
00:33:46,094 --> 00:33:48,227
- Eugh. Parts.
- Keep looking.

509
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,468
He must be here somewhere.

510
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:00,777
What are you guys doin'?

511
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,946
Uh, just in case.

512
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:18,073
Oh, my.

513
00:34:31,729 --> 00:34:34,148
- Nothing.
- The Anointed must be gone.

514
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,694
I guess.

515
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:41,866
I mean, this is where they keep
all the dead bodies, right?

516
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,745
I read a lot about death, but

517
00:34:45,828 --> 00:34:48,957
I've never really seen a dead body before.

518
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:55,383
Do they usually move?

519
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,570
I have been judged.

520
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:24,956
What's goin' on?

521
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,341
Oh, no.

522
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,844
He is risen in me!

523
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:39,014
He fills my head with song!

524
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:41,141
Pork and beans.

525
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:44,311
- Pork and beans!
- Gimme that!

526
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:46,272
I can smell you.

527
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:50,694
You're the chaff, unblessed.

528
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:54,865
I'll suck the blood from your hearts.
He says I may!

529
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:57,910
- He's in there!
- Go! Get out!

530
00:35:57,993 --> 00:35:59,746
She'll be OK. Come on.

531
00:36:15,514 --> 00:36:17,599
I think he's coming this way.

532
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,525
Oh, God, this is too much!

533
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,423
- What have you got?
- What?

534
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,656
- What did you bring? D'you've a stake?
- Oh, uh...

535
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,216
- Thank you.
- What should I do?

536
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:39,708
Buffy!

537
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:42,503
Somebody's gotta help Buffy.

538
00:36:42,587 --> 00:36:44,756
Owen!

539
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:47,885
They told me about you
while I was sleeping.

540
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:50,137
Why does he hurt me?

541
00:36:59,355 --> 00:37:00,815
Buffy?

542
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:02,985
No!

543
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:19,754
Did you see that?

544
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,507
He tried to bite me! What a sissy!

545
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:26,136
No!

546
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,805
Dead!

547
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:33,103
He was found wanting.

548
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,235
You killed my date!

549
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:03,846
- Buffy, Owen's...
- Just give her a sec.

550
00:38:05,974 --> 00:38:08,059
You killed my date!

551
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:12,732
Your turn!

552
00:38:26,414 --> 00:38:29,667
Does anyone have an aspirin, or sixty?

553
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:33,255
Owen.

554
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:36,008
What happened to that guy?

555
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:37,134
Oh.

556
00:38:37,855 --> 00:38:39,838
We scared him away.

557
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:42,390
- Oh, good. 'Cause, y'know, I would've...
- I know.

558
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:45,143
Here.

559
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:53,152
I'm sure this isn't exactly
what you had in mind for our first date.

560
00:38:53,235 --> 00:38:54,946
Yeah.

561
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,366
I was hoping maybe
we'd finish up at Ben & Jerry's.

562
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:05,014
- We still could.
- No. I think I'll just walk home.

563
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:10,380
Uh... Which way is home?

564
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,841
I'll get you there.

565
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:15,996
No. I'll go it alone.

566
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:18,431
We'll make sure he gets home safely.

567
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,150
- Buffy, if I might...
- Don't.

568
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:33,824
<b><i>(# Let the Sun Fall Down by Kim Richey)</b></i>

569
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:36,786
Did Owen say anything about me
on the way home?

570
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:39,580
You mean specifically about you?

571
00:39:39,664 --> 00:39:43,210
Or generally in the area in the ballpark.

572
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:46,004
- Any sort of indication?
- Well, in that case, no.

573
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:49,466
But he was pretty incoherent
so we might have missed it.

574
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,053
- You think?
- No.

575
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:54,556
I knew it. I totally blew it last night.

576
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,935
No, see, what you need is a guy who
already knows your deepest, darkest secrets

577
00:39:58,018 --> 00:40:00,271
and still says, 'Hey! I like that girl!'

578
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:02,440
- Someone like...
- Owen.

579
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,195
Well, this is our stop.

580
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:11,784
Hi.

581
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,578
Hi.

582
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,960
This is going well.

583
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:24,089
I don't really know how to say this but

584
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:26,968
- about last night...
- You don't even have to.

585
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:30,180
- I'm sure you were pretty freaked out.
- Totally.

586
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:33,517
And I was wondering
when I could see you again.

587
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:39,483
That was my hopeful ear.
Could you repeat that?

588
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:42,736
I think you're the coolest.

589
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:45,907
- Really?
- Last night was incredible.

590
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:50,442
I never thought nearly getting killed
would make me feel so... alive!

591
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:52,831
So that's why you want to be with me?

592
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:56,877
Absolutely. When can we do
something like that again?

593
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,417
- Something like...?
- Like...

594
00:40:59,452 --> 00:41:02,045
Walk downtown at three in the morning,
and pick a fight in a bar.

595
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,262
- How about tonight?
- Tonight would... be...

596
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:09,517
not a workable thing. Did I just say that?

597
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,061
Tomorrow then?
I'm free any night this week.

598
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:14,523
I'm not.

599
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:18,860
Please don't take this personally.
It's not you. It's me.

600
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:22,031
Right. It's you.

601
00:41:22,115 --> 00:41:26,285
And I was kinda hoping
that maybe you and I could still be...

602
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:28,247
I get it.

603
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,249
You just wanna be friends.

604
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:32,209
That'd be nice.

605
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:33,710
Friends.

606
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:36,923
Yeah.

607
00:41:37,006 --> 00:41:38,500
Great.

608
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:42,409
<i># The world will keep on turning</i>

609
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:45,615
<i># It'll all be there</i>

610
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:49,081
<i># come morning</i>
- Yeah. Great.

611
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:54,555
<i># So tonight...</i>

612
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,164
<i># Let the sun fall down</i>

613
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:02,879
<i># all around you</i>
- I was ten years old when my...

614
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,978
father told me
I was destined to be a watcher.

615
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:11,087
He was one, and his mother before him,
and I was to be next.

616
00:42:11,171 --> 00:42:13,168
Were you thrilled beyond all measure?

617
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:15,275
No, I had very definite plans
about my future.

618
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,762
I was going to be a fighter pilot.

619
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:19,604
Or possibly a grocer.

620
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:23,379
But my father...
gave me a very tiresome speech

621
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,939
about... responsibility and sacrifice.

622
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:29,107
Sacrifice, huh?

623
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:32,862
He seems like a nice lad.

624
00:42:33,571 --> 00:42:35,239
Yeah.

625
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,327
But he wants to be Danger Man.

626
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:45,543
You, Xander, Willow... You guys...
You guys know the score. You're careful.

627
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:49,589
Two days in my world
and Owen really would get himself killed.

628
00:42:49,672 --> 00:42:52,676
Or I'd get him killed.

629
00:42:54,303 --> 00:42:56,472
Or someone else.

630
00:42:56,555 --> 00:42:59,392
I went to the funeral home
of my own free will.

631
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,561
- I should have been there.
- Buffy...

632
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,439
- I blew it.
- I have volumes of lore,

633
00:43:04,523 --> 00:43:07,652
of prophecies, of predictions.

634
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:10,279
But I don't have an instruction manual.

635
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:12,488
We feel our way as we go along.

636
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:18,837
And, I must say,
as a slayer, you're doing...

637
00:43:18,914 --> 00:43:21,501
pretty well.

638
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:26,247
Well, at least I did stop
that prophecy thing from coming true.

639
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:28,426
You did, handily.

640
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:30,594
No more Anointed One.

641
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:33,864
And I would imagine the Master,
wherever he is,

642
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:37,113
is having a fairly bad day himself.

643
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:42,692
"And in this time will come the Anointed,

644
00:43:43,693 --> 00:43:46,404
and the Slayer will not know him."

645
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:49,741
"She will not stop him."

646
00:43:50,742 --> 00:43:53,495
"And he will lead her

647
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,665
into Hell."

648
00:43:59,377 --> 00:44:01,463
Welcome, my friend.
