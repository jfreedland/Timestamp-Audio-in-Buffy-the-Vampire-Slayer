2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,735
- Hey.
- Hello, Faith.

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,969
..trying to turn girls into an army.

4
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:11,210
They're potential slayers, just like we were.

5
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:12,334
Call me Caleb.

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,212
- Argh!
<i>- (Buffy)</i> Xander!

7
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:21,132
l'm not saying it's a happy scenario,
but we're dealing with the Big Bad

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:22,891
that can be any dead person it wants.

9
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,856
The bad guys always go where the power is.

10
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:27,294
They're protecting something
at the vineyard.

11
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:30,337
You realise what will happen
if the Slayer and her girls get it?

12
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:31,852
They won't.

13
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:34,976
We have to be together on this.
So l need you to leave.

14
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:37,050
Now, l'm your boss.

15
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:40,336
There's only one thing
l've ever been sure of: you.

16
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:41,647
You're the one, Buffy.

17
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,970
Heard you got something of mine.

18
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:50,656
Those of you who are coming with me
to the arsenal, you know who you are.

19
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:52,297
Let's do this thing.

20
00:00:58,019 --> 00:00:59,452
Get down!

<i>- (door smashes open)</i>
<i>- (Caleb)</i> So...

23
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:13,608
you found it. Not impressed.

24
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,611
Cos the question now, is can you pry it
from solid rock before l come over there...

25
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,370
Darn.

26
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,730
Before you go hurting yourself
with that thing,

27
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,970
why don't you do yourself a courtesy
and hand it over now?

28
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:31,653
Yeah? You want it?

29
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,534
You don't even know what you got there.

30
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,735
l know you're backing away.

31
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:48,375
You think wielding some two-sided doodad's
gonna make a difference?

32
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,450
Let her go, Caleb.

33
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,734
l said let her go.

34
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,936
l let her go,
she slices me open with that thing.

35
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,328
No, she doesn't.

36
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,616
She hasn't got time. She has friends.

37
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,894
And her friends are in trouble.

38
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,776
Faith go boom.

39
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:09,568
- l'm not lettin' her out with that thing.
- Sure you are.

40
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:14,255
Then you'll come back for it later.
When she's got her back turned.

41
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,173
Hey! Hey, Faith? Anybody?

42
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:40,975
- ls anybody here?
<i>- (coughing)</i>

43
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,050
<i>(potential)</i> Me!

44
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,893
- ls anybody else alive?
<i>- (rattling)</i>

45
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,608
- Hello? Anyone?
- Yeah! l'm...

46
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:55,488
l'm here!

47
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,856
- Who else we got?
- Don't know.

48
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,658
- You OK?
- l think my arm is broken.

49
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,777
l guess l'm lucky.

50
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:18,653
- Where's Faith?
- Don't know.

51
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:23,133
- We should get out of here. They could...
- Find her!

52
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:28,289
Oh, God, is she alive?
We gotta get her outta here.

53
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,735
- Which way is out?
- We don't know how many of us are still...

54
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:34,014
<i>- (distant growl)</i>
- ..alive.

55
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,057
- What was that?
- Could've been grinding metal...

56
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,336
- No, it was one of them.
- That's not possible.

57
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,250
- How'd it get in here?
- Plans?

58
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:44,136
<i>(Kennedy)</i> Run.

59
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:53,050
- lt's blocked!
- Oh, my God!

60
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:58,338
- l told you this wasn't the way!
- Up and over. Wounded first!

61
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,693
<i>(girls scream)</i>

62
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:33,895
Group together. Form a circle.

63
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,177
Nobody panic. lt's all of us, one of him.

64
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,568
We can take one of these things.

65
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,377
lt was pretty amazing.
A whole grocery store just abandoned.

66
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:50,372
Food lying around. The produce
was on its way to funky town, but...

67
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,450
Oh. Jaffa Cakes!

68
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,096
The apples still look pretty good,
so check those out.

69
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:58,170
<i>(door opens)</i>

70
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:02,213
- Did you find Buffy?
- No.

71
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:06,258
But, you did that spell
with the little lights? The locator?

72
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,649
- lt crapped out on us though.
- No, it didn't, exactly.

73
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:14,813
ltjust took us to an empty house.
She must have moved on already.

74
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:17,971
l'm afraid we have slightly worse news here.

75
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:21,574
Faith hasn't returned with the other girls.
Something's wrong.

76
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:26,779
l've been here, keeping morale up.
Because that's important.

77
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:29,657
- We have to go to her.
- Guess so.

78
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:34,608
Yes. l'll stay here,
and keep working on that morale thing.

79
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:40,414
<i>- (growling)</i>
- Remember the training.

80
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,490
Everybody, get ready!

81
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,811
Aargh!

82
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,852
- There's another one!
- Move! Move! Move! Up and over!

83
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,930
Not that one! That one!

84
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,570
<i>(girls scream)</i>

85
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,976
Weapons! Over there!

86
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,650
<i>(ripping sounds)</i>

87
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,573
<i>(crash)</i>

88
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:52,495
Get the wounded. We're leaving.

89
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:57,448
- Are there more?
- There's always more. Let's move.

90
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,776
<i>(moaning)</i>

91
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:05,851
Will, come here. She's losing a lot of blood.

92
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:08,496
Got it.

93
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:13,212
- The room upstairs is ready.
- l hope we're in time.

94
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:17,053
- ls she OK? ls she gonna be OK?
- l'm sure she'll be fine. Right?

95
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,334
- Careful!
- Just mind her head.

96
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,617
- l'll be up in a second.
- You guys heal fast, right? You slayers?

97
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,374
- Yeah.
- So... she'll be OK?

98
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:30,732
- l don't know.
- What's with the axe thing?

99
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,372
- l took it from Caleb. lt might be important.
- Let's hope.

100
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,816
l think we got punished.

101
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:41,450
- What?
- We...

102
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:45,895
- We followed her. And it was...
- lt didn't work out.

103
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,774
lt was a trap. lt's not her fault.
That could've just as easily happened to me.

104
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,975
So are you... are you, like, back?

105
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,974
l don't know. l guess l'm not leaving.

106
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,849
- So we got a plan now, or anything?
- Yeah, there's a plan. Get ready. Time's up.

107
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,370
l still think we got punished.

108
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:14,090
- ls she breathing OK?
- Still unconscious, though.

109
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,650
We've still got work to do.

110
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,210
lt's maybe some kind of scythe.

111
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,371
The only sure thing is
it made Caleb back off in a hurry.

112
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,973
So it's true. Scythe matters.

113
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:34,008
And, ignoring that, l'd just like to point out
this is really quite ingenious.

114
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,977
Kills strong bodies three ways.

115
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,937
And you say you sense something
when you hold it?

116
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,579
Not much, but it's strong.

117
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,651
And l knew it belonged to me. l just knew it.

118
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,970
ln addition to being ancient,
it's clearly mystical.

119
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:52,449
Yeah, l figured that out
when l King Arthured it out of the stone.

120
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:56,214
So maybe it's like
some kinda traditional Slayer weapon.

121
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:02,169
l can't imagine how something like this
could exist without my having heard of it.

122
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:06,172
The good guys are not traditionally
known for their communication skills.

123
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:09,651
Right.

124
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:14,688
Any chance that it might be something
other than a tool for killing things?

125
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:19,853
The First's guys clearly wanted it out of
that stone. lt's notjust a tool. lt's important.

126
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:23,534
We need to find out whatever we can.
Who made it, when, why?

127
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:26,497
Does it have a name?
l don't know, a credit report?

128
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:29,252
- Just find out fast.
- We'll start immediately.

129
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,695
Don't worry.
We'll find out everything there is to know.

130
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,807
Good, because right now,
that thing's all we got goin' for us.

131
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:44,492
l liked the real bandages better.
These bed sheets are awfully festive.

132
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:48,208
Yeah. They're gonna look like
mortally wounded Easter baskets.

133
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,290
- What?
- Oh...

134
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:56,096
Hey! We're supposed to use that
to sterilise wounds. Mr Giles said.

135
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:59,649
- Come on, what does it really matter?
- Hmm. Good point.

136
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,611
Giles knows his single-malt antiseptics.

137
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:08,534
- Everything's horrible.
- Yep.

138
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:12,692
Many of these girls will die.
Slaughterhouse is what it is.

139
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,656
What?

140
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,133
Trying to talk will just kill you sooner.

141
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,450
We need supplies,
and notjust bandages and junk.

142
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,134
These girls need stitches and painkillers.

143
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:29,937
Yeah, well, l could use a cookie,
but l'm not making reckless wishes.

144
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,089
No, no. We can do it.

145
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,058
The hospital. lt's gotta be
all abandoned like the grocery store.

146
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:39,017
Supplies just lying around for the taking.

147
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:44,216
l'm going in.

148
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,413
- You are?
- And you're coming with me.

149
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:51,573
- l am?
- l think you should drive cos...

150
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:54,537
that Scotch made me a little dizzy.

151
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,969
OK. l'll get Kennedy to watch the girls.
She's tough.

152
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,369
- lmminent death won't bother her.
- What?

153
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,291
<i>- (Buffy)</i> You got it?
- Wait. l'm not to the ''got it'' place yet.

154
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,372
- l'm still in the ''you're kidding'' area.
- You know it's for the good.

155
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:16,408
l don't. Buffy, do you get that?
lf l do this, that's it for me for this fight.

156
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:21,619
- l feel like you're putting me out to pasture.
- Of course l'm not putting you out to pasture.

157
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,214
- What does that even mean?
- Well, you know, it's like...

158
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:29,770
when a cow gets old and loses an eye,
or its ability to be milked,

159
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:34,535
the farmer takes it and puts it
in a different pasture so it won't have to...

160
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:37,213
fight... with the priest.

161
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:40,689
l don't need you to protect me.

162
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:42,850
l'm not.

163
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:46,011
l got hurt, but l'm not done. l can still fight.

164
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,091
l know. That's why l need you to do this.

165
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:54,132
Xander, l need someone that
l can count on no matter what happens.

166
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:59,330
l just always thought that l would...
that l would be there with you.

167
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,409
- You know, for the end.
- Hey!

168
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,218
- Well, not that this is the end.
- Thanks a lot.

169
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:08,974
No, no, no, no. By the end, l meant...

170
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,610
heroic in an uplifting way.
See, l'm still optimistic.

171
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:17,453
You're just thrown off a little
by this gritty-looking eye patch.

172
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,928
l know what you meant.

173
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,738
l should be at your side. That's all l'm saying.

174
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,734
You will be.

175
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:29,698
You're my strength, Xander.
You're the reason l made it this far.

176
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,770
l trust you with my life.
So l need you to do this for me.

177
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,051
OK.

178
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:45,176
Also you can't shoot a bow and arrow,
and when you pick up a sword,

179
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,693
- l worry you'll break one of our lamps.
- Hey!

180
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,452
Don't look at me. You said l'm gonna die.

181
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:54,976
l never said you were gonna die.
l implied that you were. lt's totally different.

182
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,856
Yeah, OK. Sure.

183
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:00,090
Besides, l'll just bring you back to life.
That's what l do.

184
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:06,415
Before the vineyard was a vineyard, it was
a monastery. Could've been put there then.

185
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:09,377
Monks messing with powers
they don't understand.

186
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:12,769
No, it's older than that. lt's pre-Christian.

187
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:18,138
OK. l found reference to stories the monks
used to tell about something older.

188
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:21,256
- Like, some kind of pagan temple?
- Native American?

189
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:24,137
No. l don't know. Urgh!

190
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,336
OK, maybe we're just
going about this the wrong way.

191
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:30,491
Maybe we should research
the weapon itself. Like... Look:

192
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,448
maybe it's the Axe of Dekeron,
said to have been forged in hell itself,

193
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:40,533
lost since the Children's Crusade,
where it was said to have killed...

194
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:43,975
Oh. Children. Hope that's not it.

195
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:50,737
l have reference to the Sword of Moskva,
the Reaper of the Tigris...

196
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:56,098
How are we supposed to narrow this down?
The illustrations are never clear enough.

197
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:00,969
Oh, damn. We're running out of time.
We really haven't got anything useful.

198
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:13,527
Do you sense the power
that Buffy spoke about?

199
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:19,053
Gotta say no. Must be a slayer thing.

200
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:24,294
Tapping into magics might help with that.

201
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:29,575
Maybe. But, l mean,
if Caleb is scared of this thing,

202
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:34,047
it must be pretty dangerous.
And tapping into that?

203
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:40,369
Willow, you could do it
without endangering yourself.

204
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,292
lf l tried something big, l'd change.

205
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:48,772
And then it's all black hair
and veins and lightning bolts.

206
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,536
l can hardly do a locator spell
without getting dark roots.

207
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,087
And if it was necessary?

208
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:57,977
Honestly? l don't know.

209
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,098
All right. Do what you can.

210
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:10,295
That's all any of us can do.

211
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:12,370
l guess so.

212
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:15,854
Man, none of these sound right.

213
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:19,978
Here's one that's just ''M'' question mark.
What the heck is that?

214
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:22,050
Let me see.

215
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:30,092
lt's not a question mark. lt's the lnternational
Phonetics Alphabet symbol for glottal stop.

216
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,977
- A whoey?
- A sort of gulpy noise.

217
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,653
l'm remembering something here.

218
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:43,008
Hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs stand for
sets of consonants, as you know.

219
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:44,691
Yes, absolutely.

220
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,692
''M'' plus glottal stop
is represented by a picture

221
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:53,409
that's commonly thought
to symbolise a sickle or a scythe.

222
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:57,572
lt's in thousands of carvings,
from Egypt throughout the ancient world.

223
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:00,253
Carvings like you'd have on a pagan temple?

224
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:03,696
Go back.

225
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,657
See what else we can find out
about this temple.

226
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,734
The scythe is a symbol of death.

227
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,617
Let's see where these pagans
buried their dead.

228
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,611
Xander, my crossbow is not out here.

229
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,851
l told you, l don't leave crossbows
around all willy-nilly.

230
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,692
Not since that time
with Miss Kitty Fantastico.

231
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,851
Did you know l have to take
a driving test every year now?

232
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:30,453
- Because you're old?
- No, because of my eye.

233
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:34,691
lt's a whole state law. They don't trust
my depth perception any more.

234
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:36,371
That sucks.

235
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,691
You know what's even worse?

236
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:43,091
All those stupid ''it's all fun and games
until someone loses an eye'' jokes.

237
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:46,967
''Hey, Xander,
so no more fun and games, huh?''

238
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:52,289
- Giles was just having fun with you.
- That's not the point. lt's an obvious joke.

239
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:55,769
- lt'd be like someone calling me a Cyclops.
- Oh!

240
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:58,657
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

241
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,568
<i>(clears throat)</i> OK, so not that funny.

242
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,448
l mean, give me some
''eye of the beholder'' jokes, you know?

243
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:10,451
Or some ''eye for an eye'' jokes.

244
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,532
Or maybe even a postmodern
<i>l, Claudius</i>joke, you know?

245
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:17,417
- lt's about standards, Dawnie.
- l know.

246
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,768
Hey, just be creative.

247
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:26,091
Everyone's still kind of on guard around you.
But before you know it...

248
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,568
<i>(muffled screams)</i>

249
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,255
<i>(groan)</i>

250
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:55,727
Not that l care personally, but you are
wasting a lot of robust, full-bodied Merlot.

251
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:58,777
Why did you let her go?
You know l can take her in a fight.

252
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:01,896
- We'll get her. Calm down.
- l'm calm.

253
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:04,095
You should see me when l get angry.

254
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,172
She's powerful right now. And you're weak.

255
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:10,853
You know, all of a sudden,
l'm getting less calm.

256
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:14,056
Face it. Your strength is waning.

257
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:18,530
lt has been quite some time
since we've... merged.

258
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:22,810
Maybe you're right.

259
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,570
OK, let's do it.

260
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:30,170
Boy, you sure know how to romance a girl.

261
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:35,333
No flowers, no dinner, no tour of the rectory.
Just, ''OK, l'm ready. Let's do it!''

262
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:38,934
- Help me. My knees are weak.
- Watch what you say now.

263
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:41,658
You sound like her.
This is a sacred experience for me.

264
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:44,128
And for me as well.

265
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:48,132
When this is all over,
and our armies spring forth,

266
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:50,733
and our will sweeps the world,

267
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:55,574
l will be able to enter every man,
woman and child on this earth,

268
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,935
-just as l enter you.
- Are you trying to make me jealous?

269
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:01,249
l'm trying to make you a god.

270
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:11,093
l am thy humble servant.

271
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,133
<i>(demonic voice)</i> And l am ready to serve thee.

272
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:34,691
<i>- (Buffy)</i> You feel it too, don't you?
- Damn.

273
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:40,090
And damn, that's something.

274
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,410
- l know.
- lt's old.

275
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:48,331
lt's strong, and it feels like... like it's mine.

276
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,810
l guess that means it's yours.

277
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,178
lt belongs to the Slayer.

278
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,569
Slayer-in-charge, which, l'm guessing, is you.

279
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:08,053
l honestly don't know.

280
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:11,176
- Does it matter?
- lt never mattered to me.

281
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:14,569
Somebody has to lead.
Let's vote for Chao-Ahn.

282
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:17,696
Hard to lead people into a deathtrap
if you don't speak English.

283
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,130
lt wasn't your fault.

284
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:23,772
- Really not looking for forgiveness.
- You're not?

285
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,929
What do you want me to say? l blew it.

286
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:31,252
You didn't. People die. You lead them
into battle, they're gonna die.

287
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,570
lt doesn't matter how ready you are
or how smart you are.

288
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:39,050
War is about death. Needless, stupid death.

289
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,057
So, here's the laugh riot.

290
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,215
My whole life l've been a loner.

291
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:49,939
- That's funny? Did l miss something?
- l'm trying...

292
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:52,328
Sorry. Sorry. Go.

293
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:57,015
No ties, no buddies, no relationships
that lasted longer than...

294
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:01,778
Well, Robin lasted pretty long.
Boy's got stamina.

295
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,534
Principal Wood? And you? And in my...

296
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:09,931
- Don't tell me you two got wriggly.
- No. No. No, no. We're just good friends.

297
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,011
Or mortal enemies,
depending on which day of the...

298
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,891
- Was that the funny part?
- OK, the point.

299
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:20,133
Me, by myself all the time.

300
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:25,247
And looking at you, everything you have,
and l don't know, jealous.

301
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:27,136
Then there l am.

302
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:30,768
Everybody's looking to me,
trusting me to lead them, and...

303
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:33,612
l've never felt so alone in my entire life.

304
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:36,131
Yeah.

305
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:40,818
And that's you every day, isn't it?

306
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,738
l love my friends.
l'm very grateful for them.

307
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,414
But that's the price. Being a slayer.

308
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,848
There's only supposed to be one.

309
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:59,453
Maybe that's why
you and l can never get along.

310
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:03,327
- We're not supposed to exist together.
- Also you went evil and killed people.

311
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:05,769
Good point. Also a factor.

312
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:09,570
But you're right.

313
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:12,451
l mean, l...

314
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,530
l guess everyone's alone.

315
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:20,408
But being a slayer?
There's a burden we can't share.

316
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,694
And no one else can feel it.

317
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:27,413
Thank God we're hot chicks
with superpowers.

318
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:29,376
- Takes the edge off.
- Comforting.

319
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:30,528
Mm-hm.

320
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:37,849
Honey, you're home.

321
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:39,816
Yeah.

322
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:42,618
And you did it. Fulfilled your mission.

323
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:46,738
Found the Holy Grail, or the Holy Hand
Grenade, or whatever the hell that is.

324
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:49,811
Right now we're going with scythe. You like?

325
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:54,768
Pointy and wooden is not exactly the look
l wanna know better, but it does have flair.

326
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,408
l can see why a girl
would ditch a fella for one of these.

327
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,969
l'm sorry about that.

328
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:08,257
lt doesn't matter.
You're back in the bosom. All's forgiven.

329
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:11,817
And... last night...

330
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:13,776
was just a glitch.

331
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:19,058
A bit of cold comfort from the cellar dweller.
Just don't make a thing out of it.

332
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:26,209
- Great. l have work to do.
- Oh, yeah. Another solo mission, of course.

333
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,609
- Yeah, it is.
- That's fine. You don't have to get shirty.

334
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:32,771
l'm not shirty. And what is shirty?
That's not even a word.

335
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:36,090
All right. All right.
Big secret mission. lt's fine.

336
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,377
lt's not a secret. Well, l mean, it is,
but that's the point of the mission.

337
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,529
Find out the secret.

338
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:46,931
This thing was forged by...
l don't even know. l mean, something about...

339
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,136
a tomb on unconsecrated ground.
That's what l have to do.

340
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:54,292
l need to find out what this is
and why l have it.

341
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,857
And that's the thing the preacher man
was so anxious to keep out of your mitts?

342
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,167
That it is.

343
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:05,458
Well, maybe l'll swing by the vineyard
when you go, make sure he's sitting tight.

344
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,928
- Great.
- OK.

345
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:16,771
- You're a dope.
- l'm a what?

346
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:19,657
You're a dope.
And a bonehead. And you're shirty.

347
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:23,129
- Have you gone completely carrot-top?
- Do you see this?

348
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:25,449
This may actually help me fight my war.

349
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:30,738
This might be the key to everything.
And l'm holding it because of you.

350
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:33,333
Because of the strength
that you gave me last night.

351
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,935
l am tired of defensiveness and weird,
mixed signals. l have Faith for that.

352
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:42,448
Let's get to the truth, OK? l don't know
how you felt about last night, but...

353
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,131
Terrified.

354
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,251
Of what?

355
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,850
Last night was...

356
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:02,655
God, l'm such a jerk. l can't do this.

357
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,138
Spike?

358
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:08,453
lt was the best night of my life.

359
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:16,772
lf you poke fun at me, you bloody well
better use that, cos l couldn't bear it.

360
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:20,135
- lt may not mean that much to you, but...
- l just told you it did.

361
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:25,056
Yeah. l hear you say it, but...

362
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:31,968
l've lived for sodding ever, Buffy.
l've done everything.

363
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:35,335
l've done things with you l can't spell, but...

364
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:37,410
l've never...

365
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,650
been close...

366
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:44,816
to anyone. Least of all you.

367
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,850
Till last night.

368
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:55,847
All l did was... hold you, watch you sleep.

369
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:00,328
And it was the best night of my life.

370
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:05,373
So, yeah. l'm...

371
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:08,571
terrified.

372
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:11,970
You don't have to be.

373
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:20,011
- Were you there with me?
- l was.

374
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:23,370
What does that mean?

375
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:29,932
l don't know.
Does it have to mean something?

376
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,211
No.

377
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:34,690
Not right now.

378
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:38,169
- Maybe when...
- No, let's just leave it.

379
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:43,371
- OK.
- We'll go be heroes.

380
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,570
Ooh, this one has oxygen tanks.

381
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:56,447
Useful if the attacker was big,
then we could shove one down their throat

382
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:59,975
and blow 'em up like Roy Scheider did
with that shark in <i>Jaws.</i>

383
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,449
- What?
- You are the perfect woman.

384
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:07,609
l've often thought so. Wanna rob?

385
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,690
Let's rob.

386
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:15,251
Cool. Gauze and alcohol...

387
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:19,487
tape and, oh, sutures,
if we wanna get stitchy with it.

388
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:23,652
Oh, and there's a box of ointment here.
l used one of these on a rash once.

389
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:24,967
Oh. Show me.

390
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:29,211
lt's healed up, but it was red and crusty
with these little itchy places.

391
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:34,134
Show me the box of ointments, you freak,
and get cotton packing for the big wounds.

392
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,937
lt's gonna be bad, isn't it?

393
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,651
Yeah.

394
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:49,849
So how come you're here?
l mean, you could just go, right?

395
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:53,767
- Yeah. l did once before.
- Before what?

396
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:58,250
Well, there was this other apocalypse,
this one time, and...

397
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:00,690
l took off.

398
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,334
But this time, l don't know.

399
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,650
Well, what's different?

400
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:10,296
l guess l was kinda new
to being around humans before.

401
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:14,049
But now l've seen a lot more,
gotten to know people.

402
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:16,733
Seen what they're capable of, and...

403
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:23,372
l guess l just realised
how amazingly screwed-up they all are.

404
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:27,247
l mean really, really screwed-up
in a monumental fashion.

405
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,253
Oh.

406
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:34,572
And they have no purpose that unites them,
so they blunder through life until they die.

407
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:39,608
Which they know is coming, yet every single
one of them is surprised when it happens.

408
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:42,691
They're incapable of thinking
beyond the moment.

409
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,771
They kill each other, which is clearly insane.

410
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,010
And yet, here's the thing.

411
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:55,411
When it's something
that really matters, they fight.

412
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:59,412
l mean, they're lame morons
for fighting, but they do.

413
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:02,171
They never...

414
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:06,096
They never quit.

415
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:12,938
So l guess l will keep fighting, too.

416
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:16,657
That was kind of beautiful.

417
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:20,414
- You... you love humans.
- l do not!

418
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:24,014
Yes, you do. You <i>love</i> them.

419
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:27,614
Stop it! l don't love them!
And l'll kill you, if you tell anybody.

420
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:29,690
l won't tell anybody.

421
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:34,133
- l won't get a chance to, anyway.
- l don't know, you might survive.

422
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:36,210
No, <i>you</i> might survive.

423
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:41,134
You can handle a weapon, and
you've been in this world for 1,000 years.

424
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:42,811
l'm not so...

425
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:45,930
l don't think l'll be OK.

426
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:48,856
l'm cool with it.

427
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:56,375
l think l'd like to finish out as one of those
lame humans trying to do what's right.

428
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,531
Yeah.

429
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:04,293
So... wheelchair fight?

430
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:06,970
<i>(Indian cries)</i>

431
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:08,578
Ow!

432
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:11,289
Ow!

433
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,250
<i>(door smashes open)</i>

434
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:13,450
<i>(woman)</i> l'd forgotten.

435
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:18,930
l'd forgotten how young you would be.

436
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:23,414
Comes from the waiting. Mind plays tricks.

437
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:27,733
l see you've found our weapon.

438
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:31,931
- Who are you?
- One of many.

439
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,850
Well... time was...

440
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:40,779
- Now l'm alone in the world.
- So what are you? Some kind of ghost?

441
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:45,374
Nope. l'm as real as you are.

442
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:49,930
Just... well, let me put it this way.

443
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:52,931
l look good for my age.

444
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:55,328
l've been waiting.

445
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:05,369
You pulled it out of the rock.

446
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:08,451
l was one of those who put it in there.

447
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:13,612
- What is it?
- A weapon. A scythe.

448
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,656
Forged in secrecy for one like you who...

449
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:21,213
l'm sorry, what's your name?

450
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:25,495
- Buffy.
- No, really.

451
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:34,657
We forged it in secrecy and kept it
hidden from the Shadow Men, who...

452
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:37,537
Yeah, met those guys.
Didn't really care for 'em.

453
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:40,292
Ah, yes. Then you know.

454
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:45,499
And they became the watchers.
And the watchers watched the slayers.

455
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:47,809
But <i>we</i> were watching them.

456
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,336
Oh! So you're like...

457
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:54,371
- What are you?
- Guardians.

458
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:57,656
Women who want to help and protect you.

459
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:02,577
We forged this centuries ago,
halfway around the world.

460
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:04,775
Hence the Luxor casino theme.

461
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:08,169
Forged there, it was put to use right here.

462
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:13,537
To kill the last pure demon
that walked upon the earth.

463
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,452
The rest were already driven under.

464
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:19,770
And then there were men here,
and then there were monks.

465
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:23,568
And then there was a town,
and now there was you.

466
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,968
And the scythe remained hidden.

467
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:31,170
l don't understand. How is it possible
that we didn't know any of this?

468
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:35,775
We hid, too. We had to until now.

469
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:41,297
- We're the last surprise.
- Does this mean l can win?

470
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,768
That is really up to you.

471
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:48,531
This is a powerful weapon.

472
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:55,808
- Yeah.
- But you already have weapons.

473
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,172
Oh?

474
00:34:58,259 --> 00:35:02,730
Use it wisely and perhaps
you can beat back the rising dark.

475
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:09,450
One way or another,
it can only mean an end is truly near.

476
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:17,932
l'm sorry, l didn't catch that last part.
Did she say the end is near or here?

477
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:35,937
Hey, Dawn. Dawn, you awake?

478
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:40,337
What happened?

479
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:48,175
- l thought you might say that.
- l meant to say what the hell happened?

480
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:52,889
- lt was chloroform.
- Colour-forms... what?

481
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:54,571
Chloroform.

482
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,974
Are you still loopy?

483
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:02,655
Sorry about that.
Someone knocked me out with chloroform.

484
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:08,298
Xander, where are we going?

485
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:12,258
- What's going on? Talk to me.
- Away.

486
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,530
- What's this?
- Just open it.

487
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,578
<i>(Buffy) ''Dearest Dawn,</i>
<i>Don't be angry with Xander.''</i>

You're not slipping out of this fight, girl.
Can't you see? You can't stop me.

493
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:26,327
l can just keep going back for more.

494
00:37:26,419 --> 00:37:28,410
lt's like being reborn.

495
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:13,934
Now l gave you ample warning.

496
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:16,579
Told you not to interfere.

497
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:18,854
But you chose not to heed.

498
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,570
l was kinda hoping it'd go this way.

499
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:38,378
<i>(man)</i> Hey!

500
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,252
- l was never much for preachers.
- Angel.

- You look good.
- You look timely.

502
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:59,896
- And also good.
- Heard maybe you needed a hand.

503
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:06,697
lt's one of those things
you have to finish yourself.

504
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,576
Really kinda is.

505
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,614
You are so gonna lose.

506
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:37,929
God, l miss watching this.

507
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,210
<i>(maniacal laughter)</i>

That bitch.
