1
00:00:02,693 --> 00:00:05,651
- Riley.
- I know you got a lot on your mind.

2
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:08,770
If you decide you wanna let me
in on any of it, you let me know.

3
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:11,413
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

4
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:15,532
Buffy's like nobody else in the world.
But she doesn't love me.

5
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,842
Buffy, I love you.

6
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:25,370
- Oh, God, no.
- Your mother has a brain tumour.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,074

8
00:00:58,293 --> 00:01:00,409
Just me. Sorry.

9
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:04,411
- Can I get you anything?
- No. Thank you.

10
00:01:05,253 --> 00:01:07,483
- Riley?
- No, I'm fine.

11
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:17,048
- What time is it?
- There's a clock behind you, Will.

12
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:21,003
I know, but there's a watch
right above your hand.

13
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:25,123
That can't be right.

14
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:38,925
I can't stand this. What's taking so long?

15
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:41,811
- It doesn't mean anything.
- You think?

16
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:48,771
I'd worry more if she was out of surgery
quickly. Might mean they couldn't do much.

17
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:14,482
- OK, your mom's in recovery.
- What happened? Is she all right?

18
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:19,488
It was possible to see the tumour completely,
which means I was able to get all of it.

19
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:24,169
So, barring complications in recovery,
I think your mother's going to be fine.

20
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,881
We're still going to have to
watch her carefully,

21
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,726
and have her back in here
for some follow-up testing,

22
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:34,523
but overall I'd consider
the procedure a complete success.

23
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,447
My goodness, Doctor, thank you so much.

24
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:47,127
Believe me, it's my pleasure.

25
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,604
Sorry. Sorry.

26
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:56,052
When I was younger, I used to
put my chopsticks in my mouth like this,

27
00:03:56,133 --> 00:04:00,604
and Buffy would chase me around the house
yelling "I'm the Slayer, I'm going to get you."

28
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:04,322
That's disturbing. You're emotionally
scarred and will end up badly.

29
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:07,246
It was great. She didn't
actually stake me in the heart.

30
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,212
Buffy's pretty cool like that.
So, what do you wanna do now, Dawnster?

31
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:15,730
Keep in mind I won't chase you because I'm
old and stuffed full of moo goo gai starch.

32
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:18,566
We could play that game again -
Life. That was fun.

33
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:20,962
For you. You always win.

34
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:27,007
Well, we can make a wager this time. You can
give me real money. That would be different.

35
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:30,722
And after we teach her how to gamble,
maybe we can all get drunk.

36
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,611
The bar wouldn't serve her,
but we could buy something.

37
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:38,050
- Strawberry schnapps tastes like ice cream.
- OK. How's about a movie?

38
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:43,332
In a theatre. I hear it's like watching a video
with a bunch of strangers and a sticky floor.

39
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:46,405
- That one looks sad.
- The chimp playing hockey?

40
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:50,122
- Is that based on the Chekhov?
- There's a chimp playing hockey?

41
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:52,966
No, the other one.
I don't wanna see a sad movie.

42
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:56,090
We have to see the chimp playing hockey.
That's hilarious.

43
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:00,849
The ice is so slippery, and monkeys
are all irrational. We have to see this.

44
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:05,927
You pick, Dawn. This is your night.
We are celebrating your mom's good news.

45
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,292
Go monkey. Choose monkey.

46
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:11,807
It's OK. You don't have to
make a big deal for me.

47
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:15,249
I'm only sleeping over here
so Buffy and Riley can boink.

48
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:20,282
No, that's not... that's not it at all.
They just need time to... be tender.

49
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:21,965
Relax.

50
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:25,162
He's not very convincing, is he?

51
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:31,287
"Alone time" means "Get Dawn out of the
house so we can have loud, obnoxious sex."

52
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:34,488
Oh, does that mean we can't?

53
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:46,083
- Can we put this song on repeat?
- Whatever you want.

54
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:49,562
Can we put the whole night on repeat?

55
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,325
Absolutely.

56
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:53,005
Good.

57
00:05:54,853 --> 00:06:00,007
I can't believe how relaxed I feel.
It's like all the tension's just left my body.

58
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:04,485
Already? Cos I had that
scheduled for a little later on.

59
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:09,606
Scheduled? Are you planning
on seducing me, Mr Finn?

60
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:13,125
Always.

61
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:23,652
I want tonight to be special for you.

62
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:27,683
It's more than special. It's perfect.

63
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:33,244
I'm glad. You deserve it
after everything you've been through.

64
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:37,123
Well, it's nothing compared to
what my mom had to deal with.

65
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:41,126
But it was a lot. And you were incredible.

66
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:46,570
Not really. Just covering
for the weepy chicken within.

67
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:51,927
Don't sell yourself short. You stayed strong
throughout. You never even cried.

68
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,528
Oh, I cried.

69
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:58,492
I cried so hard, I didn't think
I was gonna be able to stop.

70
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:08,562
That's all in the past now.

71
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:12,842
Mom's out of the woods,
and I'm here with you.

72
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,082
That's all that matters.

73
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:34,604
I don't know, Buffy.
I think I'd look like I had a cat on my head.

74
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:39,050
- But a very well-groomed cat.
- I think maybe I'll stick with a scarf.

75
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:42,921
Come on. Wigs are fun. We could
get you a whole bunch of different ones.

76
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:47,529
You know, you could be, like,
Sixties Mom, Action Mom, French Maid Mom.

77
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:50,764
I must be getting better,
cos you're makin' fun of me.

78
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:53,925
Well, you know.
Got a lot of time to make up for.

79
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:59,169
You have more important things to make up.
I know you've been missing a lot of school.

80
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:02,484
I may have to take a few incompletes,
but I'll finish the semester.

81
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:06,885
Well, what about slaying and your friends?
I want you to have your life back.

82
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:11,366
Right now I'd rather be here, styling
your beautiful, new, plastic dream hair.

83
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:14,684
Fair enough, but you don't
have to keep me company all night.

84
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:18,686
Go out, have fun, get Riley
to take you to a movie or something.

85
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:23,403
- I gave Riley the day off.
- I don't think he thinks of you as a chore.

86
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,125
I know that.

87
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:30,923
I told him to make other plans because
I wanted to have you all to myself, OK?

88
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:33,481
Besides, I can see him any time.

89
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:39,161
And I'm sure he'll come over later
lookin' for a little... Bible study.

90
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:44,484
Well, good. I mean, just as long as the two
of you are spending some quality time

91
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:46,962
with... the Lord.

92
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:49,408
We are. Absolutely.

93
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,452
- What've we got?
- Belize. Last transmission.

94
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,001
- Infrared scans say they're...
- Breeding.

95
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:58,368
They won't stay in that village for long.

96
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:02,810
Looks like we got ourselves a hot spot.
Tell the men to get ready.

97
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:05,361
What about Riley? Agent Finn.

98
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:10,365
Sir, if we go in for a sweep and drop,
he's definitely a guy we want.

99
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:13,408
Let's bring him on board.

100
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:15,688
It might take a little convincing.

101
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:20,407
Why? What's he got here
in Sunnydale that's so special?

102
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:27,087
- Riley?
- It's me.

103
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:34,165
Every time you show up like this,
you risk all of your parts. You know that?

104
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:37,006
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have a good reason.

105
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:41,006
As usual, I'm here to help you, and I...
Are you naked under there?

106
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:43,323
- Get out.
- No, I'm serious.

107
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:47,804
- Not about the naked part...
- Get out or I will drop you out headfirst.

108
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:52,691
I wanna show you something.

109
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:55,412
- What?
- You need to see this.

110
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:00,690
But we need to move
if we want to get there in time.

111
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:07,443
Oh, please. Like I give a bloody damn.

112
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:48,288
Don't start slayin'.
This isn't what we're here for.

113
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:12,125
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just havin' a little look, mate. Keep it down.

114
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,689
You can't go up there.

115
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,848
I said, keep it down.

116
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:51,285
Harder.

117
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:13,012
Buffy.

118
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:20,843
- Buffy.
- We only came here cos we care about you.

119
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:23,684
You need help.

120
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,642
I thought you should know.

121
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:06,406
Was that the Slayer? What the hell
are you doin' bringin' the Slayer here?

122
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:09,485
- Back off. I didn't know.
- Nobody'll risk comin' here now.

123
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:11,643
I said, back off.

124
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,688
Get out.

125
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:06,241
I need to talk to you.

126
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,483
I'm not in a talkin' mood.

127
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:10,643
Then listen.

128
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,963
Riley, just give the man a chance.

129
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:16,170
If you don't like what you hear,
we'll be on our way.

130
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:20,045
- Talk fast.
- We have a Code One in Belize.

131
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:25,002
A demon tribe is taking apart missionaries
in the rainforest down there.

132
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:29,851
- You're tellin' me this because...?
- We're goin' to terminate their operation.

133
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,128
We want you to join us.

134
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:39,045
- I'm a civilian.
- You're a soldier.

135
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:42,762
- I quit the government long ago.
- We're not government. We're army.

136
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:44,924
Just like you.

137
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:50,088
It's not the Initiative, Finn.
We don't do experiments.

138
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:54,644
None of us give a damn what makes
monsters tick. We just stop 'em.

139
00:16:57,213 --> 00:17:00,762
- What do you need me for?
- I think you can handle yourself.

140
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,128
And I always need bodies.

141
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:07,249
I'm not gonna lie to you. It's the real deal.

142
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,083
High risk, low pay, and seriously messy.

143
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:15,687
We ship out for Central America
tomorrow, midnight.

144
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:19,163
Now, maybe civilian life
is workin' out for you...

145
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:22,844
and maybe not.

146
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:27,043
Midnight, tomorrow. The decision's yours.

147
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:38,765
And so it begins.

148
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:44,246
No longer a victim of crass holiday
commercialisation, I'm a purveyor of it.

149
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,562
Who ordered more chickens' feet?
The ones we have aren't moving at all.

150
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,372
That's what happens
when you cut them off the chicken.

151
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:58,844
I'm serious. Maybe we could
do a holiday promotion.

152
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,326
- One free with every purchase.
- Oh, yeah. Dear holiday memories.

153
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:07,242
Merry tykes by the fire, enjoying
their new Christmas chicken feet.

154
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,849
Aw, holding them tight as they fall asleep.
Painting their little toenails.

155
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:16,729
That's very humorous.
Make fun of the ex-demon.

156
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:22,725
I can just hear you in private. "I dislike Anya.
She's newly human and strangely literal."

157
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:27,329
What? I don't say that.
No one says that. No one talks that way.

158
00:18:27,413 --> 00:18:31,452
There's nothing wrong with my idea.
I've been very good for this store.

159
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:37,052
If not for me, Giles would be a terrified old
man staring at a tax bill and wetting himself.

160
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:42,412
- I say, that's an exaggeration.
- Anya, you've helped a lot, but I have, too.

161
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,848
I forgot about the vigorous sitting around.

162
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:49,723
Anya, you can back off a little. You get paid.
Willow's doin' this on her own time.

163
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:54,648
I'm sorry. Thank you for making time in your
busy life to come and get in the way of mine.

164
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,042
- Anya, play nice.
- You know, fine.

165
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:03,003
Take her side instead of mine, even though
I sleep with you and feed you and bathe you.

166
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:08,571
- She bathes you?
- Only in an erotic, Penthousey way,

167
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:11,770
not in a sponge-bathy, geriatric sort...

168
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:14,083
Please. Stop, I beg of you.

169
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:22,689
I need to find out everything I can
about a vamp nest downtown.

170
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:26,083
- A nest? What sort of...
- There were people there.

171
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:30,246
It looked like they were
paying vampires to bite them.

172
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:33,567
Now I know what to give
the person who has everything.

173
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:36,850
- Who'd pay to get bitten?
- That's been going on for centuries.

174
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:41,485
Humans hire vampires to feed off them.
They, you know, get off on the rush.

175
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:46,249
And the danger. The hazards of the
underworld can be addictive to some people.

176
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:50,326
- Why don't the vampires kill them?
- They get cash, hot and cold running blood,

177
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:53,803
and they don't leave corpses behind
so they don't get hunted.

178
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:58,523
But still, it can be terribly dangerous
for humans. People can die accidentally,

179
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:02,447
or meet a vampire who only pretends
to play by the house rules.

180
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,922
You knew about this and you didn't tell me?

181
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:09,643
I haven't seen it since my Ripper days.
I had no idea it was going on in Sunnydale.

182
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,805
Well, it is. And I'm gonna stop it.

183
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:19,687
Buffy, even if I had known about this,
I might not have told you right now.

184
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:23,527
- What? Why?
- It's not where your efforts are best spent.

185
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:28,733
Perhaps you should focus on a less
ambiguous evil. Glory, for instance?

186
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,362
You said people are dying.

187
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:34,763
They're willing victims.
People deserve your help who aren't.

188
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:39,005
Vampires are vampires.
And my job description is pretty clear.

189
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:41,892
- Are you coming with me or not?
- What's the rush?

190
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:47,127
If we're goin' into a nest, maybe we should
come up with a strategy, wait for Riley.

191
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,807
Back me up or not.

192
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:51,884
I'm going.

193
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:56,447
Anya, will you mind the store?

194
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:03,173
Have a nice day. Don't get killed.

195
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:08,928
I don't understand. This place
was doing serious business last night.

196
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:13,643
I guess everybody jumped ship once the
word got out that the Slayer found their crib.

197
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:18,204
- I apologise for the use of the word "crib".
- You think they'll set up shop again in town?

198
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:21,763
It's hard to say.
I'm sure they'll lie low for a bit.

199
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:24,925
There's gotta be a way to find these creeps.

200
00:21:25,013 --> 00:21:28,767
- Don't worry, you'll find 'em.
- Yeah. You'll get them next time, champ.

201
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:52,967
What took you? Takes a while
to get to full strength after a good bite.

202
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:55,203
Hey! Let's be reasonable about this.

203
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,523
You may have noticed, Spike,

204
00:21:57,613 --> 00:21:59,843
I left reasonable about three exits back.

205
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:04,085
Look, I'm not the one who got you
into this. Don't kill the messenger.

206
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,807
Why the hell not?

207
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,645
Bloody hell! Oh, God!

208
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:24,732
Plastic woodgrain. Looks real, doesn't it?

209
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:30,003
Don't think I don't know
what's goin' on with you, Spike.

210
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:34,362
Stay away from her,
or we'll do this for real next time.

211
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,252
Oh, man. You're really under it, aren't you?

212
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:47,526
What?

213
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,286
Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey.

214
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,089
Because you are.

215
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,448
Well... yeah.

216
00:22:57,373 --> 00:22:59,523
But that's not your problem.

217
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:03,242
Even if I wasn't in the picture,
you'll never hold onto her.

218
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:07,365
- Bloody hell!
- Maybe I didn't almost kill you enough.

219
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:12,242
Come on. You're not the
long-haul guy and you know it.

220
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,688
- Shut up.
- You know it.

221
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:19,563
Or else you wouldn't be getting
suckjobs from two-bit vampire trulls.

222
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:32,690
The girl needs some monster in her man,
and that's not in your nature.

223
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,122
No matter how low you try to go.

224
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:52,684
You actually think you got a shot with her?

225
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:54,764
No, I don't.

226
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:58,803
A fella's gotta try, though.
Gotta do what he can.

227
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,009
If you touched her,

228
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,248
you know I'd kill you for real.

229
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:10,406
If I had this chip outta my head,
I'd have killed you long ago.

230
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:13,202
Ain't love grand.

231
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:25,731
Sometimes I envy you so much, it chokes me.

232
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:32,285
And sometimes I think I got the better deal.

233
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:39,211
To be that close to her and not have her.

234
00:24:40,053 --> 00:24:43,443
To be all alone even when you're holdin' her.

235
00:24:44,253 --> 00:24:47,450
Feelin' her, feelin' her beneath you.

236
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:50,684
Surrounding you. The scent.

237
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,722
No, you got the better deal.

238
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:05,964
I'm the lucky guy.

239
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:08,647
Yeah.

240
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:13,844
I'm the guy.

241
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:39,491
- How long has she been in there?
- A while now.

242
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:43,202
Seems pretty gung ho about it, too.
Didn't even stop to say hello.

243
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:47,764
When we went to deal with that vampire nest,
she got all Rambo and torched the place.

244
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:52,483
- Something really bad is going on with her.
- I don't know. Maybe you're overreacting.

245
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:55,167
Who hasn't done stuff
like that from time to time?

246
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,290
I made a guy spontaneously combust.
He set his village on fire.

247
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:03,367
Can you stop being scary for a minute
and listen to what I'm tryin' to tell you?

248
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:06,727
- She in there?
- She's training.

249
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:12,201
Would you guys mind clearin' out?
I need a minute alone with her.

250
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:16,851
After-hours hanky-panky
in the training room, huh?

251
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:20,289
- Xander and I could tell you some stories!
- Not now. Let's go.

252
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:23,445
- There's a thing with the vaulting horse...
- Anya.

253
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,728
What? You started it.

254
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:30,329
In your world, OK. But here, this isn't the time
for tales of Anya and Xander's Sex Capades.

255
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:36,964
Well, maybe we can go home
and, you know, have 'em.

256
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:41,410
Actually, I've got some stuff to take care of.

257
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:50,928
- We need to talk.
- I'm not ready to talk to you yet.

258
00:26:55,453 --> 00:26:57,250
Too bad.

259
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:01,729
I'm serious. Unless you wanna fight.

260
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:05,648
So let's fight. We need
to have this out, Buffy. Right now.

261
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:12,201
And say what? "What were you thinking?
How long have you been lying to me?"

262
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,330
Nothing you say right now
is gonna make this better.

263
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:19,485
I realise that. I don't expect...

264
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:23,772
I just need you to hear me out.

265
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:26,845
Fine. Get your hand off of me.

266
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:48,363
I think... when this thing started,
it was just some stupid, immature game.

267
00:27:48,853 --> 00:27:51,048
To get even after you let Dracula bite you.

268
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:53,363
- I did not let Dracula...
- I know.

269
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:56,365
On some level I know that.

270
00:27:56,453 --> 00:27:58,762
But I was still spun.

271
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:03,210
I don't know... I wanted to know what you felt.

272
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:07,525
I wanted to know why Dracula and Angel
have so much power over you.

273
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:09,649
You so don't get it.

274
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:13,248
I wanted to get it, Buffy. I wanted to get you.

275
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:19,090
So this is my fault? "Hey, gee, Buffy's so
mysterious, I think I'll go out and almost die."

276
00:28:19,173 --> 00:28:22,370
"I think I'll go and let some other..."

277
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:27,243
This isn't your fault. It's mine. And I feel
like hell for what I've put you through.

278
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,324
But it's just...

279
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:34,247
- These girls...
- Vampires. Killers.

280
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:40,129
They made me feel something. Something
I didn't even know I was missing until...

281
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,408
I can't. I can't hear this.

282
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:44,884
You need to hear this.

283
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,328
Fine. Fine.

284
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,768
Tell me about your whores.

285
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:53,209
Tell me what on earth
they were giving you that I can't.

286
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:56,882
They needed me.

287
00:28:56,973 --> 00:28:59,533
They needed your money.
It wasn't about you.

288
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:04,209
No. On some basic level
it was about me. My blood, my body.

289
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:13,209
When they bit me, it was beyond passion.

290
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:18,210
They wanted to devour me, all of me.

291
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:20,329
Why are you telling me this?

292
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:24,326
It wasn't real. I know. It was just physical.

293
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:28,442
But the fact that I craved it,

294
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,286
that I kept going back,

295
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:37,087
even if it was fleeting, they made me feel
like they had such... hunger for me.

296
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:41,731
And I don't make you feel that way?

297
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:49,405
How on earth can you compare me to that?

298
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:52,326
How can you say you understand
what those vampires feel?

299
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:56,884
You weren't a passion to them,
you were a snack. A willing, idiotic snack.

300
00:29:56,973 --> 00:30:01,125
I know exactly what they feel when they
bite me. I feel it every time we're together.

301
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:05,331
It's like the whole world falls away,
and all there is is you.

302
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:08,806
And you think that I don't
feel the same way about you?

303
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:12,408
- How dare you tell me what I feel?
- You keep me at a distance, Buffy.

304
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:15,690
You didn't even call me when
your mom went into the hospital.

305
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,445
Oh, I'm sorry.

306
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:21,492
I'm sorry that I couldn't take care of you
when I thought my mother was dying.

307
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:24,531
It's about me taking care of you.

308
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:29,089
It's about letting me in, so you don't
have to be on top all the time.

309
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:32,563
But I do. That's part of what being a slayer is.

310
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:37,285
And that's what this is really about, isn't it?

311
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:41,161
You can't handle the fact
that I'm stronger than you.

312
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:46,444
- It's hard sometimes, yeah. But that's not it.
- Then what?

313
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:49,093
What else do you want from me, Riley?

314
00:30:49,173 --> 00:30:53,530
I've given you everything that I have.
I've given you my heart, my body and soul.

315
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:58,164
You say that, but I don't feel it.
I just don't feel it.

316
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:01,488
Well, whose fault is that?

317
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:08,089
Because I'm telling you, this is it.
This is me. This is the package.

318
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:13,888
And if it's so deficient that
you need to get your kicks elsewhere,

319
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:16,362
then we really have a problem.

320
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:31,285
They want me back, Buffy. The military.

321
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:36,486
It's deep undercover.
No contact with civilians.

322
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:42,653
Transport's leavin' tonight.

323
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:46,729
Tonight?

324
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:50,892
When were you gonna tell me about this?

325
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:54,248
I'm tellin' you now.

326
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:59,366
- Are you going?
- I don't know.

327
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:04,085
- If we can't work this out...
- Then what?

328
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:07,923
This is goodbye?

329
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:13,722
You are unbelievable.

330
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:16,962
- You're giving me an ultimatum?
- No, I'm not.

331
00:32:17,053 --> 00:32:20,090
Yes, you are. You expect me
to get over it now or you're gone.

332
00:32:20,173 --> 00:32:22,687
- That's not what I meant.
- I have heard enough.

333
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:26,209
- I will not take the blame for this.
- I'm not asking you to.

334
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:28,887
- Let go of me.
- Or what? You'll hit me?

335
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:32,929
Go ahead.

336
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:35,529
Come on, do it.

337
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:40,003
- Get outta my way.
- I'm serious, Buffy, hit me.

338
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:42,084
Hit me.

339
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,524
I'm leaving, Buffy.

340
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:58,411
Unless you give me a reason to stay,
I'm leavin' tonight.

341
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:26,010
The pyro act was a bad idea, Slayer.

342
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:29,606
- Felt pretty good to me.
- I'm not runnin'.

343
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:32,413
And you're not shuttin' me down.

344
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:36,764
In fact...

345
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:40,765
you're not gonna make it through the night.

346
00:33:47,773 --> 00:33:49,764
Walk away.

347
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:52,249
I'm serious.

348
00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:56,533
Don't do this. Not now.

349
00:34:42,493 --> 00:34:46,452
So, how'd that work out for ya?
Make you feel better?

350
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,649
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you might need to talk.

351
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:55,523
Then I saw the skirmish. I was gonna lend a
hand, but I noticed you grew a few extra ones.

352
00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:57,683
Go home, Xander.

353
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:00,972
Buffy.

354
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:03,248
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

355
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,882
Something's up.
You're actin' like a crazy person.

356
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:29,325
Take this, for instance. You don't wanna deal,
so you hide? Not very slayerlike.

357
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:32,485
Just leave me alone.
You have no idea what's going on.

358
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:35,924
No? Good. So you and Riley
aren't imploding?

359
00:35:38,213 --> 00:35:42,411
Doesn't take a genius. What I can't figure out
is how you never saw it coming.

360
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:44,563
What? Who told you?

361
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:49,488
Nobody told me anything, Buffy.
It was right in front of my Xander face.

362
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:54,488
- The guy would do anything for you.
- The guy got himself bit by a vampire.

363
00:35:54,573 --> 00:36:00,250
He lied to me. He ran around behind my back
and almost got himself killed.

364
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:05,763
And now he tells me that he's leaving with
some covert military operation at midnight

365
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:08,572
unless I convince him not to.

366
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:13,681
Now tell me that you understand.
Because I sure as hell don't.

367
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:16,203
You gonna let him go?

368
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:19,202
- It's not my decision to make.
- Of course it is.

369
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:22,444
- Well, it's not fair.
- Who cares if it's fair?

370
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:27,404
In about 20 minutes, Riley's
gonna disappear, maybe for ever,

371
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:31,281
- unless you do something to stop him.
- What am I supposed to do?

372
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:33,489
Beg him to stay?

373
00:36:33,573 --> 00:36:38,693
- Why wouldn't you? To keep Riley here...
- I don't even know who he is any more.

374
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:41,765
I mean, I thought he was... dependable.

375
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:45,846
- Dependable? What is he, State Farm?
- You know what I mean.

376
00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:48,882
Yeah. I think you mean convenient.

377
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:53,771
You took it for granted he'd show up when
you wanted, and take off when you didn't.

378
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:57,289
Look who has Anya following him
around like a lovesick puppy.

379
00:36:57,373 --> 00:37:00,763
- Oh boy, is this not about me.
- Is she more than a convenience?

380
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:03,492
Cos that would kinda be a surprise.

381
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:07,725
- If you don't wanna hear this, I'll shut up.
- Good, cos I don't.

382
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:12,968
I lied. See, what I think, you got burned
with Angel, and then Riley shows up.

383
00:37:13,053 --> 00:37:17,524
- I know the story, Xander.
- But you missed the point.

384
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,808
You shut down, Buffy.

385
00:37:19,893 --> 00:37:22,726
And you've been treating Riley
like the rebound guy,

386
00:37:22,813 --> 00:37:26,362
when he's the one that
comes along once in a lifetime.

387
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:30,446
He's never held back with you.
He's risked everything.

388
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:35,084
And you're about to let him fly
because you don't like ultimatums?

389
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:39,485
If he's not the guy, if what he needs
from you just isn't there,

390
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:41,370
let him go.

391
00:37:41,453 --> 00:37:44,286
Break his heart, and make it a clean break.

392
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:49,807
But if you really think you can love this guy -

393
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,886
I'm talkin' scary, messy,
no-emotions-barred need -

394
00:37:55,253 --> 00:38:00,407
if you're ready for that, then
think about what you're about to lose.

395
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:12,365
Xander...

396
00:38:13,253 --> 00:38:14,845
Run.

397
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:33,645
Riley! Riley!

398
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,005
Riley!

399
00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:33,923
I gotta say something.
Cos I don't think I've made it clear.

400
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,923
I'm in love with you.

401
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:41,881
Powerfully, painfully in love.

402
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:45,962
The things you do,

403
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,372
the way you think, the way you move.

404
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:53,925
I get excited every time I'm about to see you.

405
00:40:56,493 --> 00:40:59,929
You make me feel like
I've never felt before in my life.

406
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:02,004
Like a man.

407
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:09,012
I just thought you might wanna know.

408
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:29,812
