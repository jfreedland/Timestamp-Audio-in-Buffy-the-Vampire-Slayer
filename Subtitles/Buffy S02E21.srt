1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:06,522
Here's the thing. There's
moments in your life that make you,

2
00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:08,826
that set the course of
who you're gonna be.

3
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,866
Sometimes they're little... subtle moments,

4
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:14,241
sometimes... they're not.

5
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:16,672
I'll show you what I mean.

6
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:22,776
We'll be back when we've found
a bit more cash money!

7
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:25,210
Keep the girls warm!

8
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:29,168
Let's go.

9
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:33,736
Come on. We'll sneak in
and take some of me father's silver.

10
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:38,158
He'll never miss it.
He eats with his hands, the pig!

11
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:43,849
Why don't you rest right here?

12
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,799
So... I'd ask myself,

13
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,018
"What's a lady of your station
doing alone in an alley...

14
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:10,570
with a reputation that this one has?"

15
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:15,144
Maybe she's lonely.

16
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:18,522
In that case,
I'd offer myself as escort,

17
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:23,233
to protect you from harm
and to while away the dull hours.

18
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:26,986
- You're very gracious.
- It's often been said.

19
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:30,308
Are you certain
you're up to the challenge?

20
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:33,486
Milady, you'll find...

21
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:36,439
that, with the exception
of an honest day's work,

22
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:40,170
there's no challenge
I'm not prepared to face.

23
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,728
Oh,

24
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:45,398
but you're a pretty thing.

25
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:49,008
- Where are you from?
- Around.

26
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:51,228
Everywhere.

27
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:53,999
I never been anywhere myself.

28
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:56,360
I always wanted to see the world, but...

29
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:58,068
I could show you.

30
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,998
- Could you, then?
- Things you've never seen.

31
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,836
Never even heard of.

32
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:06,145
- Sounds excitin'.
- It is.

33
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,850
And frightening.

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,645
I'm not afraid. Show me.

35
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:15,217
Show me your world.

36
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:18,354
Close your eyes.

37
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,433
Nice try.

38
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:17,075
I want you to get a message
to Angel for me.

39
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,327
Tell him I'm done waiting.
I'm taking the fight to him.

40
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:23,523
You got that?
Need me to write it down for you?

41
00:03:28,638 --> 00:03:30,974
All right, I'll tell him myself.

42
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:41,226
I'm good. Don't worry about me.

43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,168
You know you don't have to
patrol with me.

44
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:47,096
I had that guy under control
until he resorted to fisticuffs.

45
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:51,348
Oh! What is that, um...
Five vampires in three nights?

46
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,988
Yep, but no Angel.

47
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:57,019
Are you, uh, really that anxious
to come up against him?

48
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:00,283
- I want it over with.
- I hear that.

49
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:04,409
Oh, we'd better go. I haven't even
started studying for finals yet.

50
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:08,272
Oh, yeah! Finals!
Why didn't you let me die?

51
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:12,084
Ah, look on the bright side.
It'll all be over soon.

52
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:14,838
Yes, my love.

53
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,932
It will.

54
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:19,497
<b>"Becoming. Part 1"</b>

55
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:34,680
Careful now! Concentrate in this area.

56
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:37,386
There you go.

57
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:39,481
Hello?

58
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:42,257
- Rupert Giles?
- Yes.

59
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,552
Doug Perren. Thanks for comin'.

60
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,712
Oh, not at all.
I was flattered to be asked.

61
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,065
I spoke with Lou Tabor
at the Washington Institute

62
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,645
and he told me we had
the best authority on obscure relics

63
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:53,355
- right here in Sunnydale.
- Oh...

64
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,302
He may have, uh, exaggerated a little.

65
00:05:57,046 --> 00:05:59,815
- Ah, this is the...
- This is our baby.

66
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,652
Construction workers
dug it up outside of town.

67
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:04,891
Don't have a clue what it is.

68
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,341
Any ideas?

69
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,607
A few... None I'd care to share
until I can verify.

70
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,902
You have, uh, carbon dated it?

71
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:16,092
The results'll be back
in a couple of days.

72
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:19,079
I'll go out on a limb and say "old"!

73
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:22,373
Um, yes, it, it certainly...

74
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:25,464
predates any, uh...
settlements we've read about.

75
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:28,854
- Um... May I?
- Yeah, sure.

76
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,831
I assume you've, uh...
you haven't tried to open it?

77
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:41,630
Open it?

78
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:45,148
I'll be damned!
I figured it was solid.

79
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:49,952
- What do you think is in there?
- I don't know.

80
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,381
Well, I guess we won't know
until we open it up.

81
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:55,878
Yes, but... could I ask, um...

82
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:58,409
Would, would you wait? I'd, uh...

83
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,314
I'd like to work
on translating the text.

84
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,767
It-it-it might give us
an indication of...

85
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,279
what we'll find inside.

86
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:08,525
- You don't wanna be surprised?
- As a rule, no.

87
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,199
All right. You're the expert.

88
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:13,612
But I'm pretty damn curious, though.

89
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:15,678
Yes.

90
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:18,765
Yes, so am I.

91
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:25,664
- "Tell Angel I'm gonna kill him."
- "No, wait. I'm gonna kill you!"

92
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,749
"Die! Die! Die!"

93
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:33,113
"Mother?"

94
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,479
- Is that it?
- That's it.

95
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:37,408
Scene?

96
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,300
That's exactly how it happened.

97
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:43,434
I thought it was riveting. Uh, I was
a little unclear about some of the themes.

98
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:46,673
The theme is, Angel's too much of
a coward to take me on face to face.

99
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,370
And the other theme was 'Buy American',
but it, uh, got kind of buried.

100
00:07:50,582 --> 00:07:52,633
Do you think you're ready
to fight Angel?

101
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,691
I wish people would stop
asking me that.

102
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:57,604
Yes, I'm ready.
I'm also willing and able.

103
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:59,955
It's the one test
I might actually pass.

104
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:02,848
Don't say that!
You're gonna pass everything.

105
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:05,675
I will get you through this semester
if I have to sweat blood.

106
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:08,650
Do you think you're likely to?
'Cause I'd like to be elsewhere.

107
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:12,569
- It was only metaphor blood.
- I think you'd sweat cute blood.

108
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:15,489
Sixth period, after my computer class,

109
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,960
- we'll rock on chemistry.
- Ready to rock.

110
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:20,001
Boy, Willow, you've really got
the teaching bug.

111
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,367
Taking over computer class,
tutoring...

112
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,934
I love it, I really do.

113
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:26,900
I think it's great to do that before
you go out and fail in the real world.

114
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,486
That way you're not falling back on
something. You're falling...

115
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:31,274
well, forward.

116
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:36,285
And almost 65% of that was actual
compliment. Is that a personal best?

117
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,504
Gee, Xander, what are you gonna teach
when you fail in life?

118
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,353
Advanced loser-being?

119
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:43,124
I will teach...

120
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:46,553
- ze language of love.
- Don't! You have fish hands!

121
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:48,122
- Come! Let me caress! Let me in!
- Stop it!

122
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:50,661
- No! Don't!
- That's enough of that!

123
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:54,029
And you!
Are we having a chair shortage?

124
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:58,109
I didn't read anything about...
Oh. I get it.

125
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:01,124
These public displays of affection
are not acceptable in my school.

126
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,991
This isn't an orgy, people.
It's a classroom.

127
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:06,270
Yeah! Where they teach lunch.

128
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:08,911
Just give me a reason
to kick you out, Summers.

129
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:11,612
Just give me a reason.

130
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,283
How about because you're
a tiny, impotent Nazi

131
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:19,235
with a bug up his butt
the size of an emu?

132
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:21,362
- Sums it up.
- Don't you think?

133
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:24,159
Do you wanna come by
my house tonight and study, too?

134
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:26,254
Maybe. I do have to patrol.

135
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:30,343
Again? Do you really expect
Angel to turn up tonight?

136
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:34,733
No, I don't expect him to.
But that's usually when he does.

137
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:10,605
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

138
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,447
It's been two days
since my last confession.

139
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:18,057
Father?

140
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,670
That's not very long.

141
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:23,325
Oh, Father, I'm so afraid.

142
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:26,173
The Lord is very forgiving.

143
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:30,600
- Tell me your sins.
- I had...

144
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:32,862
I've been seeing again, Father.

145
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:36,573
Yesterday, the men were going
to work in the mine.

146
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:39,890
I had... a terrible fright.

147
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:44,444
My stomach all tied up
and I saw this 'orrible crash.

148
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:48,999
My mummy said to keep my peace,
it didn't mean nothin'.

149
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:53,449
But this morning...
They had a cave-in.

150
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:57,117
- Two men died.
- Go on.

151
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:05,285
Me mum says... I'm cursed.

152
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,773
My seeing things is
an affront to the Lord.

153
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:12,238
That only He's supposed to
see anything before it 'appens.

154
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,385
But I don't mean to, Father, I swear!

155
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:17,777
I swear!

156
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,640
I try to be pure in His sight.

157
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,184
- I don't want to be an evil thing.
- Oh, hush, child.

158
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:29,593
The Lord has a plan for all creatures.

159
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,608
Even a devil child like you.

160
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:36,423
- A devil?
- Yes, you're a spawn of Satan.

161
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:39,070
All the Hail Marys in the world
aren't going to help.

162
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:43,095
The Lord will use you
and smite you down. He's like that.

163
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,611
- What can I do?
- Fulfill his plan, child.

164
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:48,577
Be evil. Just give in.

165
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:51,577
No! I want to be good.

166
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:54,748
- I want to be pure.
- We all do, at first.

167
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,704
The world doesn't work that way.

168
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:00,495
Father... I beg you...

169
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:05,337
Please, please help me!

170
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,214
Very well.

171
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:10,239
Ten Our Fathers
and an Act of Contrition.

172
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,616
Does that sound good?

173
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:15,716
Yes!

174
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:19,456
Yes, Father, thank you.

175
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:22,424
The pleasure was mine.

176
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:26,407
- And, my child...
- Yes?

177
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:31,610
God is watching you.

178
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:41,821
Nice walk, pet?

179
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,820
I met an old man.

180
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:48,552
Didn't like him.
He got stuck in my teeth.

181
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:55,297
But then, the moon started...
whispering to me...

182
00:12:56,522 --> 00:12:59,974
all sorts of dreadful things.

183
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,533
- What did it say?
- Oh, look who's awake!

184
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:05,886
What did the moon tell you?

185
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,646
Did you have a vision?

186
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:12,262
- Is something coming?
- Oh, yeah!

187
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,951
Something terrible. Pss, pss, pss.

188
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:19,977
- Where?
- At the museum.

189
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:23,816
A tomb... with a surprise inside.

190
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:27,080
You can see all that in your head?

191
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:30,675
No, you ninny.
She read it in the morning paper.

192
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,360
- Oh, my!
- That's what's been whispering to me.

193
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:43,605
- Sssh!
- Oh, yeah.

194
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:45,994
Don't worry, though.

195
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,797
Soon it'll stop.

196
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:51,975
Soon it'll scream.

197
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,593
Waah! This doesn't make any sense!

198
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,637
Well, sure, it does. See...

199
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:09,405
- Oh, no, this doesn't make any sense.
- It's senseless!

200
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,858
It is, but at least you know that,
so you're learning.

201
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:15,762
Yay me! It doesn't matter, anyway.
I mean...

202
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,956
when in the real world
am I ever gonna need

203
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,849
chemistry or history,
or math, or the English language?

204
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:24,925
- OK, I see your problem.
- I'm a moron?

205
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,182
Will you stop that?

206
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:30,471
You're not stupid.
You've just had a lot on your mind.

207
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:32,317
You can learn this real easily,

208
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:36,246
but if you're just gonna give up,
then don't waste my time.

209
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:40,592
- Wow! You are a good teacher.
- OK, look at this.

210
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,210
A covalent bond, which means
these two atoms are linked by...

211
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:48,359
Oh! Hold that thought.

212
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:56,318
- OK, I'm Learn Girl.
- OK, so see here...

213
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:59,467
- Déja vu.
- Really?

214
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:01,048
Yeah.

215
00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:04,886
I have this... perfect memory
of the... pencil and...

216
00:15:09,014 --> 00:15:10,849
Oh, hey...

217
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:14,621
You dropped this.

218
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:16,249
It's not mine.

219
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:18,930
It might be something
of Miss Calendar's.

220
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:23,132
This feels kinda morbid.

221
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:26,310
I've gone through
most of her files already.

222
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,534
Does that make it less morbid
or you really morbid?

223
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,289
I had to. To teach her class.

224
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,519
Relax, Will.
I was making with the funny.

225
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:42,501
- Does that say "restoration"?
- It's one of her spells, I think.

226
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,145
Ms. Calendar wasn't
a practicing witch,

227
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:46,631
- but she did dabble...
- Willow!

228
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:49,461
Oh, boy!

229
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:52,029
Oh, boy!

230
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,997
Oh, boy!

231
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:24,384
<i>(Neither dead, nor of the living)</i>

232
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:29,973
<i>(I invoke you, spirit of the passing.)</i>

233
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:36,217
<i>(Return to the body
what distinguishes Man from the beast!)</i>

234
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:43,489
<i>(So it shall be.)</i>

235
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:48,667
<i>(Restore this one!)</i>

236
00:16:56,698 --> 00:16:59,215
It hurts, yes?

237
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:02,456
Good. It will hurt more.

238
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,041
- Where am I?
- You don't remember...

239
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:08,919
everything you've done for 100 years.

240
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,637
In a moment, you will.

241
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,584
The face of everyone you killed...

242
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,143
Our daughter's face...

243
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:19,231
They will haunt you

244
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:22,525
and you will know
what true suffering is.

245
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,098
Killed?

246
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:26,341
I d-, I don't...

247
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,513
No...

248
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,588
No.

249
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:37,576
No, no.

250
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:45,834
- What are you saying?
- The curse.

251
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,098
This is it.

252
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:53,086
Looks like Miss Calendar was trying
to replicate the original curse.

253
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:55,671
To restore Angel's soul again.

254
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,525
- She said it couldn't be done.
- Well, she tried anyway.

255
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:02,899
- And it looks like it might've worked.
- So he killed her...

256
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:07,093
before she could tell anyone about it.
What a prince, huh?

257
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:11,300
This is good, right?
I mean, we can curse him again.

258
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,320
Um... W-well, this, um...

259
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:17,134
certainly points the way.
But the ritual itself...

260
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:21,005
requires a greater knowledge
of the black arts than I can claim.

261
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,152
Well, I've been going
through her files and...

262
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:27,131
and researching the black arts for fun,

263
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:31,359
or educational fun,
and I may be able to work this.

264
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:36,619
W-W-Willow, channeling...
such potent magics through yourself...

265
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,433
It could... open a door
you may not be able to close.

266
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,112
I don't want you putting yourself
in any danger, Will.

267
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:45,546
And I don't want danger.
Big "no" to danger,

268
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:48,222
but I may be
the best person to do this.

269
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,762
Hi! For those of you
who've just tuned in,

270
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,231
everyone here is a crazy person.

271
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:56,788
So this spell might
restore Angel's humanity?

272
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,034
Well, here's an interesting angle.

273
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:02,005
- Who cares?
- I care.

274
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,584
Is that right?

275
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,006
Let's not lose
our perspective here, Xander.

276
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:10,278
- I'm Perspective Guy. Angel's a killer.
- Xander...

277
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,825
- It's not that simple.
- What? All is forgiven?

278
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:16,817
- I can't believe you, people!
- Xander has a point.

279
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,728
You know, just for once,
I wish you'd support me!

280
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:20,895
And I realize right now that you were,
and I'm embarrassed,

281
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:24,944
so I'm gonna get back to the point,
which is that Angel needs to die!

282
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:27,768
Curing Angel seems to have been
Jenny's last wish.

283
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,403
- Yeah? Well, Jenny's dead!
- Don't you ever...

284
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:31,175
- Can't you hear what I'm saying?!
- Stop it!

285
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,075
Stop it! Stop it!

286
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,093
What do you wanna do?

287
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:49,034
I don't know.

288
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:51,707
What happened to Angel
wasn't his fault.

289
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,007
Yeah, but
what happened to Ms. Calendar is.

290
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,568
You can paint this any way you want.

291
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:59,928
But the way I see it is that you wanna
forget all about Ms. Calendar's murder

292
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:02,578
so you can get your boyfriend back.

293
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:24,163
Hello?

294
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,651
I'll have one of these to go.

295
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:52,575
Dru?

296
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,053
Save me some.

297
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:01,373
Well, I'll do a couple of sweeps,
and then I'll stop by.

298
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:05,748
Yeah,
Xander was pretty much being a...

299
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:08,764
Willow!
Where did you learn that word?

300
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,798
My God!
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

301
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,317
I don't know.

302
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:20,776
I don't know what I wanna... do.

303
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:35,151
I'll... I'll see you in a little while, OK?

304
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:10,118
You know, polite people call before they
jump out of the bushes and attack you.

305
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:12,234
Just wanted to test your reflexes.

306
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:15,261
How about testing my face-punching?
'Cause I think you'll find it's improved.

307
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:20,316
I was on my way to your house,
saw you walking, couldn't help myself.

308
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:25,865
Which begs the question, and don't think
I'm not glad to see you, but...

309
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:28,246
why are you here?
Oh, wait. No, let me guess.

310
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:33,011
Your watcher informed you that a very
dark power is about to rise in Sunnydale.

311
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,967
- That's about it.
- Great.

312
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:37,273
So, you have any idea
what this dark power is?

313
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,033
It's a big rock.

314
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:55,353
Can't wait to tell my friends.
They don't have a rock this big.

315
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:58,350
Spike, boy,
you never did learn your history.

316
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,294
Let's have a lesson, then.

317
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:04,250
Acathla the demon came forth
to swallow the world.

318
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:07,902
He was killed by a virtuous knight
who pierced the demon's heart

319
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,944
before he could draw a breath
to perform the act.

320
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:15,649
Acathla turned to stone,
as demons sometimes do,

321
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:21,538
and was buried where neither man
nor demon would want to look.

322
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,147
Unless, of course,
they're putting up low-rent housing.

323
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,406
Boys...

324
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:33,891
He fills my head!

325
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,896
I can't 'ear anything else.

326
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,589
Let me guess.

327
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,619
- Someone pulls out the sword...
- Someone worthy.

328
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:44,348
The demon wakes up,
and wackiness ensues.

329
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:46,294
He will swallow the world.

330
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,446
And every creature
living on this planet will go to Hell.

331
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,402
My friends...

332
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:00,121
We're about to make history...

333
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,179
end.

334
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:09,579
I've been on the phone to the museum.

335
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:11,795
The artifact in question is missing

336
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,649
and the curator has been murdered.

337
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:15,235
Vampires.

338
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:17,912
And you're sure
this was the tomb of Alfalfa?

339
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:20,332
Acathla. And yes,

340
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:23,912
the information provided
by Kendra's watcher seems conclusive.

341
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:28,546
OK. Somebody explain the whole
"he will suck the world into Hell" thing.

342
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,532
Because that's the part
I'm not loving.

343
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:36,232
Well, the, uh, the Demon Universe exists
in a dimension separate from our own.

344
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:40,409
With one breath, Acathla will create
a vortex, a kind of um...

345
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:45,014
whirlpool that will pull everything
on Earth into that dimension,

346
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:50,542
where any non-demon life
will suffer horrible and...

347
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:52,192
eternal torment.

348
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:55,963
So that would be the literal
kind of "sucked into Hell"?

349
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,008
Neat!

350
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,770
Willow, I think
you should try the curse.

351
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,499
I tend to side with
your friend Xander on this one.

352
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,098
Angel should be eliminated.

353
00:25:08,124 --> 00:25:11,060
Oh, I'll fight him.
I'll kill him if I have to.

354
00:25:11,152 --> 00:25:14,672
But if I don't get there in time,
or if I lose,

355
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,588
- then Willow might be our only hope.
- I don't wanna be our only hope.

356
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,972
I-I crumble under pressure.
Let's have another hope.

357
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:23,823
We have.

358
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:27,290
Blessed by the knight
who first slew the demon.

359
00:25:27,324 --> 00:25:31,742
If all else fails, this might stop it.

360
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:35,750
- I tink.
- Ooh. May I? May I?

361
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:40,047
Thank you. Well, I-let's, uh,
hope all else doesn't fail.

362
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:43,363
Um, how close are you to
figuring out the ritual of the curse?

363
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,252
I need about a day.

364
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:46,936
And...

365
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:49,655
an orb of Thesulah, whatever that is.

366
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,921
A spirit vault for...
rituals of the undead. I've got one.

367
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,429
I've been using it as a paperweight.

368
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:58,925
This means I can't help you study
for tomorrow's final.

369
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,281
Ah, I'll wing it.

370
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:03,436
Of course, if we go to Hell by then,
I won't have to take 'em!

371
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:06,268
Or maybe I'll be taking them for ever.

372
00:26:06,613 --> 00:26:09,106
Angel has a ritual of his own
to perform before he can

373
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:12,025
remove the sword and awaken Acathla.

374
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:15,656
With any luck,
it should take some time.

375
00:26:21,323 --> 00:26:23,158
Spike?

376
00:26:25,702 --> 00:26:29,811
Spike, my sweet,
the fun's about to begin.

377
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:42,552
I will drink.

378
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:45,238
The blood will wash in me,

379
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:49,365
over me, and I will be cleansed.

380
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:52,678
I will be worthy to free Acathla.

381
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,746
Bear witness...

382
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,669
as I ascend,

383
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:04,234
as I become

384
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,605
everything that I am.

385
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:22,998
Everything that I have done,

386
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:25,854
has led me here.

387
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,497
God, are you disgusting!

388
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:22,316
This is really an unforgettable smell.

389
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,137
This is the stench of death
you're givin' off here.

390
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:29,182
And the look says, uh...
"Crazy Homeless Guy". It's not good.

391
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,806
- Get away from me!
- What are you gonna do? Bite me?

392
00:28:32,954 --> 00:28:35,544
Horrors! A vampire!

393
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:40,729
Ah, but you wouldn't bite me
on account of your poor, tortured soul.

394
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:45,071
It's so sad - a vampire with a soul.
So poignant.

395
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:48,534
- Who are you?
- Let's take a walk.

396
00:28:52,974 --> 00:28:55,818
What are you eating?
Like, a rat once a month?

397
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:59,379
Hey!
Look, you're skin and bones here!

398
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,442
Butcher shops are throwing away
more blood in a day than you could stand.

399
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:05,823
Good blood. If you lived in the world
a little bit, you'd know that.

400
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:07,845
I wanna know who you are.

401
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:09,821
- And I wanna know who you are.
- You already do.

402
00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:12,452
Not yet. But I'm lookin' to find out.

403
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:15,729
'Cause you could go either way here.

404
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:20,117
- I don't understand you...
- Nobody understands me. That's my curse.

405
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:23,037
Dog me. Mustard.

406
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,925
- My name's Whistler.
- There you go.

407
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,677
Thanks.
Anyway, lately it is.

408
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:33,361
You're not a vampire?

409
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,687
A demon. Technically.
I mean, I'm not a bad guy.

410
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:41,207
Not all demons are dedicated
to the destruction of all life.

411
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,949
What do you mean, I can go either way?

412
00:29:43,024 --> 00:29:46,996
I mean that you can become an even more
useless rodent than you already are...

413
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:49,718
or you can become someone.
A person.

414
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:53,183
- Someone to be counted.
- I just want to be left alone.

415
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:56,230
Well, yeah, you've been left alone
for, what, ninety years already.

416
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:59,820
And what a package you are.
The Stink Guy!

417
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:03,786
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to see something.

418
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,577
We'd have to leave now.

419
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:12,540
You see, and then you tell me
what you wanna do.

420
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:15,364
Where is it?

421
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,453
So I'm like, 'Dad, do you want me
to go to the dance

422
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:45,270
in an outfit I've already worn?
Why do you hate me?'

423
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:47,212
Is Tyler taking you?

424
00:30:47,238 --> 00:30:50,478
Where were you when I got over Tyler?
He's of the past.

425
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:52,842
Tyler would have to crawl
on his hands and knees

426
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,434
to get me to go to the dance with him.

427
00:30:54,446 --> 00:30:56,998
Which, actually, he's supposed to do
after practice, so I'm gonna wait.

428
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:58,754
OK. See you later. Bye.

429
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:02,305
- Call me. Call me. Call me.
- I will.

430
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,525
Buffy Summers?

431
00:31:15,617 --> 00:31:18,628
- Yeah. Hi! What?
- I need to speak with you.

432
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:22,451
You're not from Bullock's, are you?
'Cause I meant to pay for that lipstick.

433
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:25,562
There isn't much time.
You must come with me.

434
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:27,611
Your destiny awaits.

435
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:31,315
I don't have a destiny.
I'm destiny-free, really.

436
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:33,199
Yes, you have.

437
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:35,612
You are the Chosen One.

438
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:38,119
You alone can stop them.

439
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:40,588
- Who?
- The vampires.

440
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:44,688
Huh?

441
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:53,954
Oh, God.

442
00:31:58,385 --> 00:31:59,985
Oh!

443
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,924
Oh! Oh, not the heart!

444
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,076
You see?

445
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,867
You see your power?

446
00:32:28,189 --> 00:32:30,440
- Why didn't you call?
- I'm sorry.

447
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:33,083
I-I didn't know it was so late.

448
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:37,142
- Tyler and I... were talking...
- That boy is irresponsible.

449
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:40,117
No, Mom, it's not his fault.

450
00:32:40,702 --> 00:32:43,641
You know we worry, that's all.

451
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:47,005
Dinner's in ten minutes.

452
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:48,893
Yeah.

453
00:32:56,968 --> 00:32:59,547
- Did she say where she was?
- She was with Tyler.

454
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:01,742
I don't want her seeing him
anymore, period!

455
00:33:01,764 --> 00:33:04,238
- You're overreacting, dear.
- Don't do that!

456
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:07,383
- Don't talk to me like I'm a kid!
- I don't. Just forget it.

457
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:10,024
Just because you can't discipline her,
I have to be the ogre.

458
00:33:10,106 --> 00:33:14,576
I am not having this conversation
again, all right?

459
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,313
She's gonna have it tough,
that slayer.

460
00:33:20,351 --> 00:33:22,470
She's just a kid.

461
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:25,523
The world's full of big, bad things.

462
00:33:28,116 --> 00:33:30,265
I wanna help her.

463
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:33,678
I want...

464
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:39,489
I wanna become someone.

465
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:41,388
God, jeez, look at you.

466
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:44,849
She must be prettier
than the last slayer.

467
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:47,386
This isn't gonna be easy.

468
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,899
The more you live in this world,

469
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:53,003
the more you see
how apart from it you really are.

470
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,692
This is dangerous work.

471
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:57,585
Right now you couldn't go
three rounds with a fruit fly!

472
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,345
I wanna learn from you.

473
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:04,732
All right.

474
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:07,614
But I don't wanna dress like you.

475
00:34:07,664 --> 00:34:11,292
Again, you're annoying me.
You're lucky we need you on our side.

476
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:14,996
I have strayed.

477
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:17,098
I have been lost.

478
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,024
But Acathla redeems me.

479
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:21,630
With this act...

480
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:25,851
we will be free.

481
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,372
<i># Someone wasn't worthy</i>

482
00:34:46,655 --> 00:34:48,156
Dammit!

483
00:34:48,204 --> 00:34:51,841
This is so... disappointing.

484
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:57,822
There must be something I missed.
The incantations, the blood! I don't know!

485
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,627
What are we going to do?

486
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:03,626
What we always do
in a time of trouble.

487
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,520
Turn to an old friend.

488
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:08,934
We'll have our Armageddon, I swear!

489
00:35:38,254 --> 00:35:41,154
Tonight, sundown,

490
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:43,141
- at the graveyard.
- Excuse me?

491
00:35:43,356 --> 00:35:45,135
You will come to him.

492
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:48,878
You will come to him or more will die!
Tonight!

493
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:51,973
His hour is at hand!

494
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:59,455
She said more would die.
I have to go!

495
00:35:59,526 --> 00:36:01,726
- Then I should go with you.
- No!

496
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:04,334
I need you here, just in case.

497
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:06,373
I can take care of myself.

498
00:36:06,408 --> 00:36:08,908
And look,
as long as Angel's fighting me,

499
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,805
then he can't do this end-of-the-world
ritual thingy, and that's a good.

500
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:13,826
Willow, what do you think?

501
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:17,166
- I just want to cross-check...
- We don't have time.

502
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,987
If this is gonna work,
it has to work now.

503
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:23,964
OK. Then I need maybe half an hour
once we're all set up.

504
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:26,281
Which means
you just have to hold Angel off.

505
00:36:26,306 --> 00:36:27,916
Don't let him close on you.

506
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:32,070
If the curse succeeds, you'll...
You'll know.

507
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,527
Why don't you just wait here
to find out if it worked?

508
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:37,113
See if he phones you.

509
00:36:37,138 --> 00:36:39,807
I can't risk him killing
any more people.

510
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,416
I'd better go.

511
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,006
Be careful.

512
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:46,517
- I will.
- Here!

513
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:52,503
In case the curse does not succeed,
this is my lucky stake.

514
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:55,605
I've killed many vampires with it.

515
00:36:55,832 --> 00:36:58,348
I call it Mr. Pointy.

516
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,633
- You named your stake?
- Yes.

517
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,023
Remind me to get you a stuffed animal.

518
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:11,404
Thanks.

519
00:37:11,473 --> 00:37:13,308
Watch your back.

520
00:37:25,637 --> 00:37:29,480
Hello, lover.
I wasn't sure you'd come.

521
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:34,083
After your immolation-o-gram?
Come on, I had to show.

522
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,499
Shouldn't you be out
destroying the world right now?

523
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:38,783
Pulling a sword out of Al Franken
or whatever his name is?

524
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:41,772
There's time enough.
I wanted to say goodbye first.

525
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:45,212
You are the one thing in this dimension
I will miss.

526
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:48,467
This is a beautiful moment we're having.
Can we please fight?

527
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:51,179
I didn't come here to fight.

528
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:54,137
- No?
- Gosh, I was hoping

529
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:55,958
we can get back together.

530
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:58,706
What do you think?
Do we have a shot?

531
00:37:58,895 --> 00:38:01,367
All right! We'll fight.

532
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:14,851
"Quod perditum est, invenietur,"

533
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:18,348
"Not dead, nor not of the living. "

534
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:21,480
"Spirits of the interregnum, I call. "

535
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:31,259
Come on, Willow!

536
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:34,294
"Let him know
the pain of humanity, Gods. "

537
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:38,538
"Reach your wizened hands to me.
Give me the sword. "

538
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:42,873
Get out! Go!

539
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:24,314
Go!

540
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:51,758
Jeez, is it me
or is your heart not in this?

541
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,408
Maybe I'll just go home
destroy the world.

542
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:57,281
Well, I think Mr. Pointy'll
have something to say about that.

543
00:39:57,374 --> 00:39:59,771
Come on, let's finish this.

544
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:01,950
You and me.

545
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:06,378
You never learn, do you?
This wasn't about you.

546
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:08,752
This was never about you.

547
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:13,985
And you fall for it every single time!

548
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:35,597
Enough!

549
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:09,873
Look at me, dearie.

550
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:17,139
Be... in my eyes.

551
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:22,549
Be in me.

552
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:48,088
Night-night.

553
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:52,722
Let's get what we came for, dears.

554
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:22,224
Bottom line is,
even if you see 'em comin...

555
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:25,064
you're not ready for the big moments.

556
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:28,632
No one asks for their life to change,
not really.

557
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:31,587
But it does.

558
00:42:56,494 --> 00:42:59,355
So what are we? Helpless? Puppets?

559
00:42:59,392 --> 00:43:03,919
No. The big moments are gonna come,
you can't help that.

560
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:06,295
It's what you do afterwards
that counts.

561
00:43:06,604 --> 00:43:09,713
That's when you find out who you are.

562
00:43:15,252 --> 00:43:16,949
Freeze!

563
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:21,685
You'll see what I mean.
