1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,232
- Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
- Anya! What's wrong with you?

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,751
First you give me this beautiful ring,
and then I can't wear it in public.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,836
- Don't you wanna get married?
- Yes.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,236
Come on, Tara! I am so old
enough to do research.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,352
You do research now? Want a cappuccino
and pack of cigarettes to go with it?

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,109
- Why should I care about any of this?
- Because they'll take you away!

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,838
If I can't make you go to school,

8
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:31,713
then I won't be found fit
to be your legal guardian.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,478
Since you've been back,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,720
you haven't exactly been big with
the whole range-of-human-emotions thing.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,673
I know you'll never love me,
but you treat me like a man.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,033
Everything on this table's half off.
Buy one eyeball, get the second one free!

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,628
Arr! Careful, me mateys!

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,710
These be fireflies spat from
a volcano off the coast of Katmandu.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,670
You're not a real pirate! Real pirates
live on boats and don't look stupid!

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,429
Ha-ha! Oh, a salty swabby!

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,518
Maybe you be fishing
for the taste... of me hook!

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,714
Hello, Ahab. A little help, please?

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
Arr, and help ye shall have.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,919
- So what are you supposed to be?
- An angel.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,930
Oh. Shouldn't you have wings?

22
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:32,397
No. This is a special kind of angel,
called a Charlie.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,479
We don't have wings. We just skate around
with perfect hair, fighting crime.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,165
Where's your costume?

25
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:40,309
Like I'm six years old? Halloween's so lame.

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,113
But you get to dress up and play games.

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,710
Xander's gonna teach me a new one -
Shiver Me Timbers. Ever play?

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,071
Dawn, Willow could use
some help in Magical Texts.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,519
I'm all over it.

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,237
- And you? Ever play Shiver Me Timbers?
- Not really much for the timber.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,397
I'm just saying,
you might rethink the stereotype

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,795
before someone turns you into a toad.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,076
And why don't you try
removin' that broomstick from your...

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,315
Dawn.

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,908
Hey. Don't stop
the invective on account of me.

36
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,477
If I see one more idiot that thinks witches
are all hairy moles and rotten teeth...

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,830
Excuse me, do you have any candy corn?

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,236
Oh, look at you!
You are just the cutest thing!

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,862
But I thought you said...

40
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,480
I know. But look, with the hat and the wart.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,273
Let's go fill your tummy up
with sugary nibblets, OK?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,636
Buffy.

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,119
We're running low on mandrake root.
Check the basement.

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,630
Don't blame me if we have
this conversation over, and over,

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,231
and over,

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,555
and over, and over.

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,553
Bell. Neck. Look into it.

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,993
- Come with a nice leather collar, does it?
- What are you doing, lurking down here?

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,590
Came through the tunnels.
Runnin' low on burba weed.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,319
Stir it in with the blood,
makes it all hot and spicy.

52
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,674
What? I was gonna pay for it.

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,835
I mean, no, I was gonna nick it,
cos that's what I do.

54
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,594
I go where I please and I take what I want.

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,234
I thought you'd had it
with Customer Disservice.

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,793
One-time deal to help out.

57
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,119
And I mean straight time, no
loop-de-loop mummy-hand repeat-o-vision.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,118
Where's the mandrake root?

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,471
Only three to a jar.

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,556
Tend to go a bit wonky
if you cram them too close.

61
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,272
Thanks.

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,073
Feel like a bit of a rough-and-tumble?

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,237
- What?
- Me... you.

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,757
Patrolling? Hello?

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,396
Oh. Uh, I should stay.

66
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,914
Maybe tomorrow.

67
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,353
It's not like I don't already have plans.
Great Pumpkin's on in 20.

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,439
So much easier to talk to
when he wanted to kill me.

69
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,476
Go help Giles.

70
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,872
- What happened to Xander?
- He kept poking me with his hook.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,389
I sent him to Charmed Objects.
With any luck...

72
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,149
he'll end up in an alternative dimension
inhabited by a 50-foot Giles

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,635
that squishes annoying TV pirates.

74
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,753
- We've got a ton of bagging to do here.
- Spike had a really good idea.

75
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,270
- Maybe I should patrol.
- You've patrolled every night this week.

76
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,915
Besides, it's Halloween,
the one time that supernatural threats

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,952
give it a well-deserved rest. As should you.

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,756
What about costumes that take over your
personality? Or Irish fear-demony thingies?

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,959
If anything calamitous happens,
history suggests it'll happen to one of us.

80
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,278
Right, exactly. So I should patrol
to avoid any of that... And I'm bagging.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,437
Give you something... special this year.

82
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,436
Come again.

83
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,677
In a zillion years.

84
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,799
Store go boom.

85
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,159
That was the most incredible
thing I have ever experienced.

86
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,315
Except for that.
What you all did for me tonight.

87
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,551
The heaps of money you helped me...

88
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,069
Us acquire. All I can say is,
I hope we make as much tomorrow.

89
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,754
- Tomorrow?
- Post-holiday clearance.

90
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,838
The cornerstone of retail.

91
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,438
Brooms all round, then.

92
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,190
Or I could whip up a jaunty self-cleaning
incantation. It'll be like Fantasia.

93
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,392
And we all know how splendidly
that turned out for Mickey.

94
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,353
I think I'm a little more adept
than a cartoon mouse.

95
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,755
And you have more fingers. Which is good,

96
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,431
cos then there's no need to wear those
big white gloves to overcompensate.

97
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,391
If you had a real peg leg,
you wouldn't just have a lame costume.

98
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,824
You'd actually be lame, which is different.

99
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,354
You do this every night?

100
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,473
Every time I close out the cash register.
The dance of capitalist superiority.

101
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,835
I'm gonna marry that girl.

102
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,918
What?! She's 15 and my sister,
so don't even...

103
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,558
Hey, everybody. Can I, uh...?

104
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,715
There's something Anya and I...
wanna tell you.

105
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,958
Now?

106
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,072
Now.

107
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,748
- We're getting married.
- Oh, my God!

108
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,032
Congratulations!

109
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,311
That... that's... Wow!

110
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,076
It's a big wow.

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,959
I thought you were waiting
for the right moment.

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,956
I did.

113
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,035
Here, have some money!

114
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,429
Did you know about this?

115
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,996
No. Not unless I blocked it
from my memory.

116
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,079
Much as I will Xander's
vigorous use of his tongue.

117
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,279
Is that why you clean your glasses?
So you don't have to see what we're doing?

118
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,391
Tell no one.

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,309
Giles, this is...

120
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,513
We have to do something.

121
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,176
He said he couldn't imagine
the rest of his life without me.

122
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,677
Then he gave me this.

123
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,048
Which I'll be paying
for the rest of my life.

124
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,298
- Can I try that?
- Oh, absolutely not.

125
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,789
Where I come from, this sort of thing
requires much in the way of libation.

126
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,957
- God save the Queen!
- Sorry we couldn't do the big fancy.

127
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,118
- You caught us with our parties down.
- That's OK.

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,995
This is the first premarital celebration.
There'll be lots more. With gifts.

129
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,554
Maybe we'll even decorate for the next one.

130
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,035
Why wait?

131
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,109
This is so much better than the way
it usually looks. Thank you.

132
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,869
The grocery store's still open.
We could've bought decorations.

133
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,233
Why bother? These are perfect. And extra
biodegradable-y. In a couple of hours, poof!

134
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,633
No, they're great. It's just...

135
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,558
Why use magic when
you can do something naturally?

136
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,309
Well, you can fight monsters naturally,
with sticks and stones.

137
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,112
Don't recommend it, though.

138
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,795
- It's different.
- How?

139
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,512
Because you're protecting people.
Keeping them from being hurt.

140
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,869
Which makes them happy,
like pretty decorations made Anya happy.

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,718
That's not the point, Will.

142
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,593
- Why are you being like this?
- This isn't about me.

143
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,395
This is so about you. You're always
coming down on me for doing magic

144
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,080
that couldn't harm a fly.
What's your problem?

145
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,916
Willow, I wish that you would stop
and think about what you're...

146
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,558
Sorry. Just checking on the chips.

147
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,274
It's OK. We're done.

148
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,310
You're getting married! You!

149
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,398
- Me. Choking.
- Sorry.

150
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,071
I can't believe it. It seems like only
yesterday you had to pay a girl to date you.

151
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,351
Like I'd ever pay. Define "date".

152
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,993
I was only gone for three months.
How many other things have changed?

153
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,759
- I got a tattoo.
- What?!

154
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,348
Which is why we told her no.

155
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,358
- Just a little one?
- Over my dead body.

156
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,358
The kind that doesn't come back.

157
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,879
Fine.

158
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,312
Congratulations.

159
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,194
You're very lucky. Finding a guy like him.

160
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,479
Not as lucky as me.

161
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,032
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Oh! Tomorrow?

162
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,958
Yeah. I'm sleeping over at Janice's.
Remember?

163
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,915
- That's tonight?
- No. It's on the other Halloween.

164
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,079
Come on, you said I could.

165
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,039
Well, I know I did. It's just,
you know, with Xander's party...

166
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,069
We're good. But you have to get us
extra gifts for our reception.

167
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,519
Yes, please.

168
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,796
- I don't know. Giles?
- It's really not up to me.

169
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,193
Come on. It's four blocks away.
I'll walk straight over.

170
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,629
Not like I'm gonna be roaming the streets.

171
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,948
Please?

172
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,912
Hello?

173
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,190
- Perve.
- Sorry. I thought...

174
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,678
Hey, Summers. Did you get over the wall OK?

175
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,430
Yeah. My sister thinks
I'm staying at your house.

176
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,869
The Mominator thinks I'm staying at yours.

177
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,117
Can't believe they fell for that one.
Like, own a TV!

178
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,470
So where are we meeting?

179
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,593
The park. That's where all the monsters
gather on Halloween.

180
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,231
Hoo-hoo! To infinity and...

181
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,636
Nice shot.

182
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,473
Hey, baby.

183
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,876
- What took you so long?
- Had to stop for crimes and misdemeanours.

184
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,514
Zack, this is my friend Dawn
I told you about.

185
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,631
Hello.

186
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,795
Hey. Justin.

187
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,674
I know. I've seen you around
at a couple of parties.

188
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,429
I've seen you, too.

189
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,833
Hey, we'll catch you guys later.

190
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,917
Alone at last.

191
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,716
So, what do you guys wanna do?

192
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,712
Yeah! Three points!

193
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,515
- Witches don't really look like that.
- You got a lot of witch friends?

194
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,758
No. I mean, from stuff
that I've read... and stuff.

195
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,509
Some are supposed to be really pretty.
Don't get them mad...

196
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,198
New target. Come on.

197
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,952
So?

198
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,473
He's OK.

199
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,435
"Ho-hum" OK? Or like "Oh, my God,
I think I'm gonna pee my pants" OK?

200
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,312
Pee.

201
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,830
So what's the verdict, captain?
Little Justin in love?

202
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,791
I don't know.

203
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,310
- She's cute.
- Congratulations for having eyeballs.

204
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,035
What about, you know, going all the way?

205
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,676
Do you think that... that the moon
and the stars look lovely tonight?

206
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,357
Hey, you think after this juvie crap we can
do something else? I'm getting kinda bored.

207
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,519
Just one more.

208
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,153
Anya is a wonderful
former vengeance demon.

209
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,070
I'm sure you'll spend many years of...
non-hell-dimensional bliss.

210
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,678
Is she moving in with you?

211
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,030
With your combined incomes, you might
think about a down payment on a house.

212
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,310
- Like the kind you live in?
- No rush.

213
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,512
I'm sure you've plenty
to think about with the wedding.

214
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,155
You've got the rest of your lives
to plan the rest of your life.

215
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,077
Yeah. Yeah.

216
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,390
No way. You know who lives there?

217
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,988
- Old man Kaltenbach.
- Crusty old bastard.

218
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,079
- Isn't he supposed to be mental?
- Total loony tunes.

219
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,037
Pumpkins. Very dangerous.

220
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,120
- You go first.
- Huh, screw that!

221
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,915
Show us how brave you are.
Let's see those cute little girlie guts.

222
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,234
Lay off, man.

223
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,112
- I'll do it.
- Go, Dawn.

224
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,312
Look, you don't have to do this.

225
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,159
It's OK. I want to.

226
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,435
Shouldn't oughta mess with those.
Sometimes they bite.

227
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,598
- Get away from her.
- Don't make me go kung fu on you, man.

228
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,353
Come on inside, kids.
Got something special for ya.

229
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,715
Daddy's got a treat.

230
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,433
Cool.

231
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,199
No, no, no. We are so not going in there.

232
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,629
Dawn, tell them.

233
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,110
- Dude, where'd you get the cool toys?
- Used to design 'em, back in '58.

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,798
Nothing would give me more pleasure

235
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,913
than to see a child's face light up
when he'd open one of mine

236
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,600
on a Christmas or a birthday.

237
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,358
I was good.

238
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,914
Jeepers, I was the best.

239
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,154
And then that thing happened.

240
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:22,037
One little mistake... and they took it
all away from me. They...

241
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,599
They took my toys.

242
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,273
Time for the treats!
Who wants to help Daddy in the kitchen?

243
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,597
How about you, Sally?

244
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,589
Sally's not much for the cooking.
Why don't I give you a hand?

245
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,950
Hands are good.

246
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,038
Always use more hands.

247
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,469
More hands.

248
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,313
I say we get the funk out of here before
Satan Claus stuffs us up the chimney.

249
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,558
And miss the big treat?
That would break the old guy's little heart.

250
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,309
- Assuming it's still beating.
- We should get Justin and go.

251
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,070
Come on, the dude's 1,000 years old. What's
he gonna do? Drown us in his drool cup?

252
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,273
Hey. Where's its head?

253
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,472
Boo.

254
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,799
What the hell was that?

255
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,832
Justin?

256
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,792
Justin?

257
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,949
Let's go.

258
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,594
- What happened?
- I swiped his wallet. Come on.

259
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,313
Oh, my God.

260
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,874
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

261
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,638
Dude, that guy was rank!

262
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,311
Bet a spritz of Dawn'll wash that right out.
So what do you think? Lunchables?

263
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,876
Or should we go all the way and turn 'em?

264
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,516
I was thinking maybe a June wedding.

265
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,679
But they always had the highest
percentage of calls for vengeance.

266
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,678
So as soon as possible.
Mortal life being so short,

267
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,793
we gotta cram in as much marital bliss
as we can before we wither and die.

268
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,199
There's just so much to consider. Planning
the wedding, new cars, house and babies.

269
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,633
You have to plan for babies, or they'll just
run roughshod over your entire existence.

270
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,275
Yeah. You gotta know what
to call 'em before they hit college.

271
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,989
Rupert is an exceptionally strong name.

272
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,150
If we want our progeny to eat paste
and have their lunch money stolen.

273
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,631
All that matters is that they're happy.
Everything else is thick gravy goodness.

274
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,795
I know. I mean, I am the luckiest
ex-demon in the world.

275
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,469
To find the one person in all dimensions
that I was meant to be with,

276
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,195
and have everything
work out exactly as I dreamed.

277
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,995
I mean, how often does
the universe allow that to happen?

278
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,712
Air. Sweet mother oxygen.

279
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,956
You OK?

280
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,514
Yeah. I just...

281
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,117
It's just that I didn't think
it would be so much.

282
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,516
But this is good.

283
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,395
I mean, this is love and celebration
and moving forward.

284
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,279
Anya's right. This is the way
life's supposed to work out.

285
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,195
Right. Deep pools of ooey delight.

286
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,395
- I'm wallowing, not drowning.
- Definite wallow action.

287
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,390
OK. So, once more into the breach?

288
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,590
Oh, I think my breeches
are wearing a little thin.

289
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,995
I'll take Spike up on that offer to patrol.

290
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,079
Gotta be something out there
cruisin' for a smack-down.

291
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,195
So, you're what? A sophomore?

292
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,232
- I wish.
- Ah! Freshman.

293
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,909
Yep. Way down there
at the bottom of the rung.

294
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,749
Actually, kinda under those rubber feet
that keep the ladder steady.

295
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,075
Hey, those are important.

296
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,670
Here. Spoils of war. You earned it.

297
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,793
- I did?
- Yeah, for keeping me steady.

298
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,833
- And so begins your life of crime.
- Hm. You're a little late.

299
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,793
- I steal all the time.
- Really?

300
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,198
Totally. I haven't paid
for lipstick since... forever.

301
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,198
Oh, be still my heart. Cute and bad.

302
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,198
Yeah. Bad to the bone.

303
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,880
More like frozen. Here.

304
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,832
- Thanks.
- My pleasure, Ms Summers.

305
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,036
Hey. Where's Zack?

306
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,673
- He went to get the car.
- You guys got a car?

307
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,875
Thanks for the ride.

308
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,197
- I'm losing her pulse.
- Let's get her in!

309
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,638
Summers residence.

310
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,716
Oh, Mrs Penshaw.

311
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,829
No, Dawn said she was staying
the night at your house.

312
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,636
Yes, I realise that now. But I don't
believe that you called to check...

313
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,194
No, all right. Let's just, um...

314
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,754
OK, if I hear anything, I'll let you know.

315
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,431
Hey! We were just getting our dance on.

316
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,712
It was Janice's mother on the telephone.
Janice said she was staying here.

317
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,594
Ahh. They're dipping into the classics.
You gotta respect that.

318
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,998
- Is Buffy still outside?
- No. She went to go find Spike to patrol.

319
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,271
It's always nice to be kept
in the loop. Um...

320
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,359
Xander, Anya, stay here in case Mrs Penshaw
calls. Willow, Tara, check downtown.

321
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,678
I'll swing by Spike's.
See if I can catch Buffy.

322
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,675
Don't do nothin' I would, dude.

323
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,632
You're it.

324
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,314
I love it when they run.

325
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,793
So.

326
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,392
Yeah.

327
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,396
It's cold.

328
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,431
You OK? You want this back?

329
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,757
Nah. Cold doesn't really bother me.

330
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,910
What are you? Superman?

331
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,468
No.

332
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,831
But I do have a few special powers.

333
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,673
Hey, um, does this work?

334
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,513
You gotta turn the ignition.

335
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,792
I love this one.

336
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,878
Yeah. Another thing we have in common.

337
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,552
- You're shaking.
- It's cold.

338
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,717
You wanna go?

339
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,518
No. It's just, um...
What are you expect...?

340
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,955
I just wanna taste you.

341
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,229
Shiver me timbers.

342
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,712
What?

343
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,554
Um, nothing. Just...

344
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,234
- Wow.
- Oh, my God. That was your first.

345
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,516
What? No!

346
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,791
It was. That was your first kiss.

347
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,751
I've been kissed before.

348
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,997
I kiss all the time.
Not that I'm a kiss slut.

349
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,557
Just, you know, with the lips
and the pressing together and stuff?

350
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,272
Hey, expert here.

351
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,197
OK. OK, it was my first kiss.

352
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,791
I know, I know. I suck. My lips are dry,
and my tongue's all horrible and sticky.

353
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,357
And I'm pretty sure I drooled on you,
so just please tell me how awful it was.

354
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,076
It was perfect.

355
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,559
Do they know they're brother and sister?

356
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,636
Do you think she's here?

357
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,432
What?

358
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,393
Do you think Dawn might have come here?

359
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,988
It's where I'd be
if I were 15 and on the lam.

360
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,788
Really?

361
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,196
Well, not me at 15, cos "Hello, spaz".

362
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,117
- You?
- Yeah.

363
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,109
Hard to believe such a hot mama-yama
came from humble, geek-infested roots.

364
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,391
Infested roots? Trying to turn me on?

365
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,875
I have to try now?

366
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,675
Come on, let's look over here.

367
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,552
Do you see her?

368
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,830
No, there's too many people.

369
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,397
- Maybe we could ask Security to...
- No. That'll take too long.

370
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,719
One among many. Many fade to one.

371
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,071
- What are you doing? Will!
- I'm just gonna clear the crowd.

372
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,349
How?

373
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,996
I'll just shift everyone who isn't a 15-year
old girl into an alternate dimension.

374
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,075
What?

375
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,355
It'll be for a fraction of a second.
They won't even notice.

376
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,994
Will, no, you can't!

377
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,793
- Why?
- What if something went wrong?

378
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,792
- Well, it won't!
- But what would Giles say?

379
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,999
- Are you taking his side now?
- This isn't about sides.

380
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,634
You two have been
talking about me behind my back.

381
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,752
- No! God!
- You know how that makes me feel?

382
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,557
You are using too much magic.

383
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,831
What do you want me to do?
Just sit back and keep my mouth shut?

384
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,791
That'd be a good start.

385
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,196
If I didn't love you so damn much, I would!

386
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,032
Tara!

387
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,319
Sorry.

388
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,351
It's OK.

389
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,835
Long as it's not bleeding.

390
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,670
Justin, could we...?

391
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,076
It's just...

392
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,916
God, you are so beautiful.

393
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,793
Get your gear together. We need to...

394
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,073
Spike?

395
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,238
You know, in civilised cultures,
that's called trespassing.

396
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,353
Good thing you're uncivilised.
We got trouble.

397
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,632
- Giles found you?
- Giles? No. Was he looking for me?

398
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,752
- Yeah. It's Dawn.
- Dawn? What happened?

399
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,474
It's OK. Giles was here earlier,
looking for you.

400
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,991
Dawn and a little friend pulled a Houdini.
Up to a bit of candy-corn mischief.

401
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,317
Wait. She's out there,
running around by herself?

402
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,271
Kids these days, eh?

403
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,032
I did a sweep of the tunnels.
Giles is poking about the cemetery.

404
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,038
- We have to find her.
- I don't think she's in there.

405
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,038
Mist.

406
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,037
Cemetery.

407
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,037
Halloween.

408
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,116
Should end well.

409
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,473
Bloody brilliant.

410
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,478
Dawn!

411
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,076
- Dawn, are you all right? Janice?
- He bit me. That jerk bit me!

412
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,316
Like you weren't askin' for it.

413
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,876
- I feel certain she wasn't.
- What do you know about it, grandpa?

414
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,956
Quite a bit, actually.

415
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,436
Dude, that sucks.

416
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,190
Dawn? Where's Dawn?

417
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,238
- Get off me!
- Dawn, wait! Wait!

418
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,474
I thought we could hang out, or something.

419
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,591
- Hang out?!
- Yeah.

420
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,679
I mean, you're not like other girls.
You're different.

421
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,078
There's something special about you.
I knew it the first time I saw you.

422
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,593
I just wanna be close to you.

423
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,076
It's OK. It'll only hurt for a second.

424
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,840
I bet you say that to all the girls.

425
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,518
Giles?

426
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,031
You have a choice, son. We can do this
the easy way, or we can do this the hard...

427
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,869
What were my choices again?

428
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,070
So, this a private game
or can anyone join in?

429
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,236
Dawn, are you...?

430
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,235
Were you parking, with a vamp?

431
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,435
I didn't know he was dead!

432
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,437
- Living dead.
- Shut up!

433
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,949
- How could you not know?
- I just met him!

434
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,992
So you were parking in the woods
with a boy you just met?

435
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,511
- We've seen each other at parties.
- Shut up. I don't believe you.

436
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,279
Oh, like you've never fallen for a vampire?

437
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,278
- That was different.
- It always is when it's you.

438
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,709
Excuse me! Can we fight now?

439
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,795
Didn't anyone come here to just make out?

440
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,231
Ah, that's sweet. You run.

441
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,551
You scream.

442
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,033
Die, Slayer!

443
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,191
Your sister's the Slayer? I totally get it!
I knew there was something about you.

444
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,032
Giles!

445
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,072
What is your malfunction, man?!

446
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,916
It's Halloween, you nit.
We take the night off. Those are the rules.

447
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,113
Me and mine don't follow
no stinkin' rules. We're rebels.

448
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,074
No. I'm a rebel. You're an idiot.

449
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,672
Give the lot of us a bad name.

450
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,035
Trick or treat.

451
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,954
Give me somethin' good to eat.

452
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,114
I thought you really liked me.

453
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,432
I do.

454
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,915
And you like me, too.

455
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,356
I do.

456
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,712
- Sorry about the party.
- Nah, don't worry about it.

457
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,229
It gave me more time
to plan the bridal shower.

458
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,794
Where do we order muscular male strippers?

459
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,830
Anya!

460
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,916
I'm kidding. Jeez.

461
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,029
I guess I should bugger off. Somethin' about
big bads not venturing far on Halloween.

462
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,231
Good fight.

463
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,956
So, big monster bashing?
Sorry we missed it.

464
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,548
As long as Dawn's all right.

465
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,639
- Yeah, that's what's...
- I think I'm gonna turn in. Good night.

466
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,149
Tara?

467
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,556
Tara.

468
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,474
- How's your face?
- Oh, still ruggedly handsome.

469
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,114
Grandpa indeed.

470
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,671
She's taking it pretty hard.

471
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,598
It's not surprising.
We can't ignore this behaviour.

472
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,792
Something needs to be done
before it spins out of control.

473
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,117
You're right. I'm glad
you're here to take care of it.

474
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,800
Don't be too hard on her. OK?

475
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,795
We need to have a conversation.

476
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,111
Is this the part where you tell me
you're not angry? Just disappointed?

477
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,915
Pretty much. Except for
the bit about not being angry.

478
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,477
I'm sorry. OK?

479
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,269
- It's not that easy.
- What do you want me to do?

480
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,593
Reverse time and take it back?
Cos I could probably...

481
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,790
- Joke. I don't think I could really...
- Can we not do this now?

482
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,439
- I'm tired.
- OK.

483
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,673
Let's just forget it ever happened.

484
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,875
Forget.

485
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,075
Ooh. Your feet are cold.

486
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,675
Better warm me up.

487
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,958
This is how every day should always end.

488
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,038
And start. And all the stuff in the middle.

489
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,513
So, uh, you're not mad?

490
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,276
About what?
