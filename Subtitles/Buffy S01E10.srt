1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,041
In every generation, there is a Chosen One.

2
00:00:03,124 --> 00:00:08,339
She alone will stand against the vampires,
the demons, and the forces of darkness.

3
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:10,508
She is the Slayer.

4
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:42,905
No! No!

5
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:45,783
- No!
- Yes.

6
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:48,161
It's time to get up for school.

7
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:50,997
- Mom?
- Are you all right?

8
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,290
No.

9
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:53,792
Yeah.

10
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,962
Yeah. I'm... I'm fine.

11
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:00,508
School!

12
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:02,135
Great!

13
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,222
- You wanna go to school?
- Sure. Why not?

14
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:09,435
OK! Good day to buy that lottery ticket.

15
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:12,188
I spoke with your father.

16
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:16,192
- He is coming, right?
- You're on for this weekend.

17
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:18,362
Good.

18
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:24,077
- So do you see your dad a lot?
- Not a whole lot. He's still in LA.

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,289
He only comes down
for weekends sometimes.

20
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:30,083
When did they get divorced?

21
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:35,298
Well, it wasn't finalised till last year
but they were separated before that.

22
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:37,300
It must have been harsh.

23
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:40,220
Yeah. That's the word you're looking for.

24
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:44,266
I mean, they were really good about it
around me, anyway, but... still...

25
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,020
My parents don't even bicker.

26
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:51,844
Sometimes they glare.
Do you know why your folks split up?

27
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,243
I didn't ask.
They just... stopped getting along.

28
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:58,782
I'm sure I was a really big help though,
with all the slaying and everything.

29
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:01,203
I was in so much trouble. I was a big mess.

30
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:03,914
I'm sure that didn't
have anything to do with him leaving.

31
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:05,457
No.

32
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,128
And he still comes down on weekends.

33
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:10,922
Sometimes.

34
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:19,056
Hello! Doofus! You're in my light.

35
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,266
Wendell, what is wrong with you?

36
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,471
Don't you know she is
the centre of the universe

37
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:26,512
and the rest of us merely
revolve around her?

38
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:29,359
Why don't you revolve yourselves
out of my light?

39
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:37,452
- Uh... Wendell was in Cordelia's light.
- I'm so ashamed.

40
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:40,038
Why is she so Evita-like?

41
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,175
- I think it's the hair.
- It weighs heavy on the cerebral cortex.

42
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,121
- Hey guys, was there any homework?
- We're doing active listening today.

43
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:50,299
Cool! What's active listening?

44
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:54,471
- That would be the homework.
- Chapter five. "Active Listening."

45
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:58,267
Where you put on your big ears
and really focus on the other person?

46
00:03:58,302 --> 00:04:00,812
Ms Tishler demonstrated it yesterday.

47
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:02,188
With you.

48
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:08,070
- She was wearing that tight sweater.
- Oh! The midnight-blue angora!

49
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:11,443
- See, I was listening.
- All right! Take your seats.

50
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:13,603
In a moment
we will choose partners

51
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:17,231
and practise what we read about
in chapter five.

52
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,641
Good, Xander, that's the spirit.

53
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,711
Before we do, let's review.

54
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:26,540
Isaacson's research led him to conclude
that one of our most fundamental needs,

55
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:29,836
after food and shelter, is to be heard.

56
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:32,998
Wendell, would you read
the first two paragraphs on page 78,

57
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:36,226
where Isaacson describes
the rapid improvement

58
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:39,547
active listening brought
to some special-needs clients.

59
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:44,064
Help!

60
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:49,808
Please! Get 'em off of me!

61
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:53,596
Help! Help! Get 'em off of me!

62
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,550
Help me! Ah! Please, help me!

63
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:59,320
- Please, help me...
- Sorry about that.

64
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:52,639
<b>"Nightmares"</b>

65
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:55,692
Fear is a wonderful thing!

66
00:05:56,234 --> 00:06:00,739
It is the most powerful force
in the human world.

67
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:03,158
Not love,

68
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:04,995
not hate.

69
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,163
Fear!

70
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:10,834
When you were a mortal boy,
what did you fear?

71
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,004
Monsters.

72
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:17,967
We are defined by the things we fear.

73
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,053
This symbol,

74
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,848
these two planks of wood,

75
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:26,102
it confounds me.

76
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:29,507
Suffuses me with mortal dread.

77
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,109
But fear is in the mind.

78
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:39,325
Like pain

79
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:43,292
it can be controlled.

80
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:48,961
If I can face my fear,

81
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:53,116
it cannot master me.

82
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,408
Something is happening above.

83
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:59,287
Something new.
A powerful, psychic force.

84
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:01,633
- Do you feel it?
- I feel change.

85
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:05,341
Change? Yes.

86
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:10,823
For the worse.

87
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,262
- You're awfully quiet this morning.
- I didn't sleep well.

88
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:37,266
I'll say! I came in to check on you twice.
You were yelling in your sleep.

89
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,603
- Do you know what you were dreaming?
- Not really.

90
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:43,398
Oh, no, my bag! I packed it for
the weekend and I forgot it.

91
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:45,922
You and your dad can
swing by the house and get your bag.

92
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,805
It's not an international crisis.

93
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,477
OK. Yeah, I just... meant to bring it.
He's picking me up here, right? At 3.30?

94
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:55,704
Honey, are you worried
your father isn't gonna show?

95
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:57,872
No.

96
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:00,000
Not really. Should I be?

97
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:04,371
Of course not! I just...
I know it's a hard situation...

98
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,216
You just have to remember
that your father adores you.

99
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,011
No more than I do, by the way.

100
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:10,554
Goodbye.

101
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,723
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.

102
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:22,734
- Oh, Buffy! We've been looking for you.
- We have?

103
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:25,529
Oh, about the spiders.
Did you talk to Giles about...

104
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,489
Oh, the spiders!

105
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,618
Willow's been kind of...
What's the word I'm looking for?

106
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:34,414
- Insane about what happened yesterday.
- I don't like spiders, OK?

107
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:37,709
Their furry bodies and their sticky webs.

108
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,296
What do they need
all those legs for, anyway?

109
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,742
I'll tell you.

110
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:45,844
For crawling across your face
in the middle of the night. Ew!

111
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,304
How do they not ruffle you?

112
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:49,403
I'm sorry! I'm unruffled by spiders.

113
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,434
Now, if a bunch of Nazis
crawled all over my face...

114
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:54,979
- It was pretty intense.
- Thank you.

115
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:57,618
Well, the Hellmouth,
the center of mystical convergence,

116
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,634
supernatural monsters: been there.

117
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:02,359
- A little blasé there, aren't you?
- I'm not worried.

118
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:07,243
If there's something bad out there,
we'll find, you'll slay, we'll party.

119
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:09,537
Thanks for having confidence in me.

120
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:11,331
You da man, Buff.

121
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:13,998
OK, but we're still caring
about the spiders here.

122
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,209
Let's not forget the spiders.

123
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:18,089
Well, Giles said he was gonna look it up.

124
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:21,462
- Giles?
- Maybe he's in the faculty room.

125
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,766
Hey, Giles? Wakey, wakey!

126
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:32,230
I was, uh, in the stacks. I got lost.

127
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:35,054
Did you find any theories on spiders
coming outta books?

128
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:37,948
Big... hairy... crawly...

129
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,698
It's funny if you're me.

130
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:44,786
I couldn't find anything...
particularly illuminating.

131
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:48,832
Um... I think perhaps you'd best
have a chat with Wendell himself.

132
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:52,363
OK. If he can still talk.

133
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:01,930
Hey, Wendell. How are you?

134
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:04,099
Huh?

135
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:06,268
Are you OK?

136
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:10,023
Good talking to you, man.

137
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:11,733
Do you guys want something?

138
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:14,252
We just thought you might wanna
talk about what happened.

139
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:17,633
You know, yesterday, with the spiders?

140
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:20,367
I don't know what to say about that.

141
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,430
There's nothing to say.
You saw 200 insects.

142
00:10:22,431 --> 00:10:23,580
You gonzoed. Anybody would have.

143
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,583
They're not insects. They're arachnids.

144
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,712
- From the Middle East?
- Spiders are arachnids.

145
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,764
They have eight legs.
Insects only have six.

146
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,327
Why does everyone make that mistake?

147
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,597
Don't know.

148
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,975
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

149
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:47,398
- When?
- Lots of times.

150
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:50,361
Ew! You must hate spiders more than I do.

151
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:54,281
I don't hate spiders. I love 'em!

152
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:57,117
They hate me.

153
00:10:57,534 --> 00:11:00,889
- I hope you studied for the history test.
- What history test?

154
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:03,125
The one we're having
in fourth period right now.

155
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,372
There's a history test?
Nobody told me there's a history test!

156
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:10,549
I haven't... I... OK.
I will catch up with you guys later.

157
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:17,432
- What do you mean, you love spiders?
- It is platonic, right?

158
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:23,331
I had the best collection
in the tri-county area.

159
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:27,319
Browns and tarantulas and black widows.

160
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,989
Then my folks shipped me off
to wilderness camp.

161
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:34,118
All my brother had to do
was maintain their habitats.

162
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:37,414
Instead he left their heat lamp on
for a week.

163
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,525
When I came home they were all dead.

164
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:43,577
That's when the nightmares started.

165
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:46,382
- The nightmares?
- It's always the same.

166
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:48,384
I'm sitting in the classroom.

167
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:53,056
The teacher asks me to read something.
I open up my book and there they are.

168
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,767
They're comin' after me.

169
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:58,203
God! Can you blame them
after what I did?

170
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:00,306
And that's how it happens, every time?

171
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:04,305
Yesterday, in class, I thought
I'd just nodded off again.

172
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,282
But then everyone else
started screaming, too.

173
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:13,538
You don't know where class is, do you?

174
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:18,001
Hardly a shocker. You've cut history
just about every time we've had it.

175
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:21,547
Well, I was there the first day... I think.

176
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,175
It's in here.

177
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:26,578
I haven't been to class,
I haven't read any of the assignments.

178
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,885
How am I gonna pass this test?

179
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,603
Blind luck?

180
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:09,351
At least I know my name.

181
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:55,090
Well, they both got detention,

182
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:58,065
which is completely unfair
since Shawn started it.

183
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,263
Anyway,
it means we can't do the movie.

184
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,246
I'm gonna take a... break.

185
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,962
You shouldn't go in there.

186
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,512
Lucky 19.

187
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,114
I think they said room 3016.

188
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:14,786
- Do you know the girl?
- To say hi to. Laura's nice enough.

189
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:19,457
- Nobody saw who attacked her?
- I was rather hoping that Laura did.

190
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:30,429
- Hi, Laura.
- Hi.

191
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,431
I hope we're not intruding.

192
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:36,393
That's OK. I don't wanna be left alone.

193
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:41,065
You understand we're anxious
to make sure this doesn't happen again.

194
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,571
Can you tell us what happened?

195
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,533
I was in the basement.

196
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,203
I went down for a smoke.

197
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:56,666
There was... someone there.

198
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:00,921
Someone you knew?

199
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:06,428
I've never seen anything like it.

200
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:11,767
It?

201
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:15,188
Can you describe it?

202
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:23,322
Hey, that's OK. Don't worry about it.

203
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:26,803
Yes, you-you... you just rest now.

204
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:29,319
- You know, but... if...
- Hi, Laura.

205
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,832
you remember anything...
you can tell us.

206
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,001
Even if it may seem weird.

207
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:38,224
She needs her rest now.

208
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:43,053
Lucky 19.

209
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,098
I'm sorry?

210
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,684
It's what he said right before...

211
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,813
He said "Lucky 19".

212
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:55,233
That's weird, right?

213
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,402
Yes. Yes, it is.

214
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,948
Feel better.

215
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:03,534
Take care.

216
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:08,240
- Doctor, is she gonna be all right?
- You family?

217
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:11,738
- Friends.
- She'll recover.

218
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:15,715
She's got a couple of shattered bones,
a little internal bleeding.

219
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,092
- She got off pretty easy.
- Easy?

220
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:22,848
- Have you looked up the word lately?
- Well, the first one's still in a coma.

221
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:25,892
- First what?
- First victim.

222
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:28,619
They found him a week ago.

223
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,554
Exact same M.O. as the girl,
only he's in worse shape.

224
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,445
If he doesn't wake up soon...

225
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:37,531
Somebody's gotta stop this guy.

226
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:39,116
Somebody will.

227
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,162
Listen. I'm not afraid of him.

228
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:45,081
Hey, if he wants to fight,
then I'm takin' him down.

229
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,476
I'm not backin' off of this.
This is about honour! I'll break his neck!

230
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:52,882
I'm just saying, Wendell had a dream
and then that exact thing happened.

231
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:56,470
Which is a fair wiggins, I admit,
but do you think that ties in with Laura?

232
00:17:56,553 --> 00:18:00,432
I don't know. Maybe she dreamed
about getting beat up.

233
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:03,435
We should ask Buffy when
she gets back from the hospital.

234
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,980
Oh, here's my little baby!

235
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:09,108
- Mom, what are you doin' here?
- How's my little pookie?

236
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:12,321
Mom, don't kiss me in front of the guys!
It's embarrassing!

237
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:15,240
You cute little rascal...

238
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:17,052
It must be a coincidence.

239
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:20,772
Wendell finds a spider's nest. We all wig
because he dreamt about spiders.

240
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:22,402
So it may not be connected.

241
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:26,201
If there is a connection,
it doesn't sound like anything...

242
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,547
What?

243
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,301
Xander! What happened to your...

244
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:36,123
I don't know...
I was, uh... dressed a minute ago!

245
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:39,226
It's a dream.
It's gotta be a dream.

246
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:42,438
Ow! Wake up! Ow! Gotta wake up!

247
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:50,197
This can't be happening.
This can't be...

248
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,116
What's the word?

249
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,161
Oh, um... I've got
back issues of the... papers.

250
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:57,622
Um, I'm t-trying to do some research.

251
00:18:57,706 --> 00:19:00,458
- Did you find anything?
- I don't know.

252
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:03,713
You don't know
if you didn't find anything?

253
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:07,216
- I'm having a problem.
- What is it?

254
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:10,137
I can't read.

255
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,056
What do you mean?
You can read three languages.

256
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,934
Five, actually... on a normal day.

257
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:19,230
The words here don't make any sense.

258
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:21,399
It's gibberish!

259
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:25,029
- That's him.
- Who?

260
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:27,781
The kid I've been seeing around school.

261
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:30,569
"Twelve-year-old Billy Palmer was found
beaten and unconscious"

262
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,722
"after his Kiddie League game Saturday."

263
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:36,082
"Doctors describe
his condition as critical."

264
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,251
When was this published?

265
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:40,421
Last week.

266
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:44,383
It says he's in a coma in intensive care.
This is the boy from the hospital!

267
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,471
The first victim?
You've seen him around the school?

268
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,422
Yeah, first when
the spiders got Wendell, and,

269
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,475
and then when I didn't know a thing
on the history test.

270
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,188
I thought it was weird seeing
this kid around, but I forgot about it.

271
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:58,232
The boy's been in a coma for a week.
How can this be possible?

272
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:03,879
What am I? Knowledge girl now?
Explanations are your terrain.

273
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:07,545
Uh, well, um,
there's astral projection, uh...

274
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:10,757
the theory that while one sleeps
one has another body, a-an astral body,

275
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,632
which can... travel through time and space.

276
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,710
Billy's in a coma.
That's like sleep, right?

277
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:19,590
In a manner of speaking. Although one
doesn't always awake from a coma.

278
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:22,343
Could I be seeing Billy's asteroid body?

279
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:24,971
Astral body. And I don't know.

280
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:28,892
As usual, one doesn't have an inordinate
amount of information to work with.

281
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:31,724
Lucky 19.

282
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:37,525
There you are!
I've been looking everywhere.

283
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,946
- Why aren't you in class?
- Dad, what are you doing here?

284
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:43,553
You're not supposed to pick me up
until after school. Is something wrong?

285
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,704
Well, I... I need to talk to you.

286
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:50,041
- Something is wrong. Is it Mom?
- No, no, it's not your mother. She's fine.

287
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,671
Can I speak with you for a moment?
Privately?

288
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,840
Sure. Yeah.

289
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,591
Oh! I'm sorry.

290
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,803
Dad, this is Mr Giles, the librarian.

291
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:02,139
This is my dad, Hank Summers.

292
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:04,307
- My pleasure.
- Likewise.

293
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,476
I'll be back.

294
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:22,162
I came early because there's
something I needed to tell you.

295
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:25,971
About your mother. Why we split up.

296
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:26,958
Well, you always told me it was because...

297
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:31,130
Uh, I know we always said it was
because we'd just grown too far apart.

298
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:34,091
Yeah. Isn't that true?

299
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:36,803
Come on, honey. Let's... Let's sit down.

300
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:41,767
You're old enough now to know the truth.

301
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:46,965
- Was there someone else?
- No. No, it was nothing like that.

302
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,901
- Then what was it?
- It was you.

303
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:52,154
Me?

304
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:54,865
Having you. Raising you,
seeing you every day.

305
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:57,743
Do you have any idea what that's like?

306
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:59,120
What?

307
00:21:59,204 --> 00:22:02,999
Gosh, you don't even see what's
right in front of your face, do you?

308
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:07,922
Oh, well, big surprise there,
all you ever think about is yourself.

309
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:09,298
You get in trouble.

310
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:13,804
You embarrass us with all the crazy stunts
you pull, and do I have to go on?

311
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:15,931
No. Please don't.

312
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:20,060
You're sullen and... rude and...

313
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:23,648
you're not nearly as bright
as I thought you were gonna be.

314
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,662
Hey, Buffy, let's be honest.
Could you stand to live

315
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:31,323
in the same house
with a daughter like that?

316
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:33,283
Why are you saying all these things?

317
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,285
Because they're true.

318
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:39,582
I think that's the least
we owe one another.

319
00:22:39,617 --> 00:22:43,187
You know, I don't think it's...
very mature, getting blubbery

320
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:45,965
when I'm just trying to be honest.

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,115
Speaking of which,

322
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,513
I don't really get anything
out of these weekends with you.

323
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:56,268
So... what do you say
we just don't do them any more?

324
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:07,836
I sure thought you'd turn out differently.

325
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:27,596
Red alert! Where's Buffy?

326
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,182
She... she just stepped out.
Her father came by.

327
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:33,810
He-he needed to talk to her.
W... where are your other clothes?

328
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:36,773
Oh, don't I wish
I had the answer to that question.

329
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:39,984
Xander kind of found himself
in front of our class

330
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,154
not wearing much of anything.

331
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:45,616
- Except my underwear!
- Yeah! It was really...

332
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:48,937
- bad. It was a bad thing.
- Bad thing?

333
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:51,366
I was naked.
"Bad thing" doesn't cover it.

334
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:52,738
Everyone staring?

335
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:56,172
I would hate to have everyone
paying attention to me like that.

336
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:59,256
With nudity!
It 's a total nightmare.

337
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:02,718
Well, yes, Xander! It's your nightmare!

338
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:05,847
Except the part with me waking up
going "It's all a dream".

339
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:08,600
- It happened.
- Like it happened to Wendell.

340
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:12,480
That thing with the spiders?
Wendell had a recurring dream about that.

341
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:18,156
I dreamt that I-I got lost in the stacks
and I... I couldn't rec...

342
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,572
Of course!

343
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:23,951
- Um... Our dreams are coming true?
- Dreams?

344
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,752
That would be
a musical comedy version of this.

345
00:24:25,753 --> 00:24:27,430
Nightmares, our,
our nightmares are coming true.

346
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,041
- So why is this happening?
- Billy.

347
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:34,714
Well, that explanation was
shorter than usual. It's Billy!

348
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:37,633
- Who's Billy?
- He's a boy in the local hospital.

349
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:40,178
He was beaten. He's in a coma.

350
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:44,057
Somehow I think he's crossed over
from the nightmare world he's trapped in.

351
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:46,727
And he brought the
nightmare world with him?

352
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,398
- Thanks a bunch, Billy.
- How could he do that?

353
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,475
Things like that are easier
when you live on a Hellmouth.

354
00:24:52,476 --> 00:24:55,320
Well, um... we have to stop it.

355
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:56,947
And soon.

356
00:24:57,031 --> 00:25:01,526
Or else everyone in Sunnydale's gonna
be facing their own worst nightmares.

357
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,879
I don't understand!
This can't be happening.

358
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:12,465
I was just at the salon!

359
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:17,429
Oh, my God!

360
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,873
Billy?

361
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,105
Are you Billy Palmer?

362
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:04,273
I'm Billy.

363
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:07,151
Why are you here?

364
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:16,413
Did something bad
happen to you after your game?

365
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:18,415
Something bad?

366
00:26:22,043 --> 00:26:24,547
I... I don't remember.

367
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,260
Do you remember playing baseball?

368
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:31,722
Uh huh. Yeah.

369
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:35,350
I play second base.

370
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:38,813
Are you Lucky 19?

371
00:26:42,442 --> 00:26:44,527
That's what he calls me.

372
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,738
Who?

373
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:51,118
The ugly man. He wants to kill me.
And he hurt that girl.

374
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:53,788
- Why does he want to kill you, Billy?
- He's...

375
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:56,666
- Billy, it's okay! What? Just tell me.
- He's here!

376
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,857
Buffy doesn't know this is happening.
And given the sort of thing

377
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:38,232
that she tends to dream about,
it's imperative that we find her.

378
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:40,557
Probably faster
if we split up to look for her.

379
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,322
Good idea.

380
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:45,032
Faster, but...

381
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:47,132
not really safer.

382
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,526
- Billy!
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.

383
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:58,862
- Who is he?
- He's the ugly man.

384
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,289
He's too strong. I can't fight him.

385
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,991
We have to find my friends.
They can help us.

386
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:05,327
- We have to hide.
- No, he'll find us!

387
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:07,736
Yes, but we have to hide.
That's how it happens.

388
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:10,800
We hide and then he comes.

389
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:17,216
No! What are you doin'? No!

390
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:20,344
You don't understand! I don't wanna go!

391
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,057
I'm not even on the chess team!
I swear I'm not!

392
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:26,810
- Willow!
- No!

393
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:32,567
Willow!

394
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:35,738
Buffy?

395
00:28:39,074 --> 00:28:41,160
Hello?

396
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,207
Buffy?

397
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,846
I'm not afraid.

398
00:28:58,513 --> 00:29:01,475
You'd think I'd be afraid,

399
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:04,061
but I'm not.

400
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,056
All right!

401
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:43,898
Someone else's loss
is my chocolatey goodness.

402
00:29:58,081 --> 00:30:00,792
This is my lucky day!

403
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:13,640
I was sure this led to the library.

404
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:21,524
They're just playing.
What is it? What's bothering you?

405
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:24,944
Baseball. When you lose, it's bad.

406
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:28,407
Did you lose your game last week?

407
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,993
It was my fault.

408
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:33,872
Why was it your fault?

409
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:37,083
I missed a ball
when I should've caught it.

410
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:40,421
You missed one ball
and the whole game was your fault?

411
00:30:40,504 --> 00:30:42,125
What, you were the only one playing?

412
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:44,985
There wasn't eight other people
on your team?

413
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,638
He said it was my fault.

414
00:30:48,673 --> 00:30:51,481
Who said?

415
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,326
Billy, did he hurt you after the game?

416
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:55,313
Can we go another way
to find your friends?

417
00:30:55,348 --> 00:30:58,441
Sure. OK. OK.

418
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,526
We can go round the cafeteria.

419
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:04,073
Bad idea.

420
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:08,285
This way! Come on!

421
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,131
What just happened?

422
00:31:19,215 --> 00:31:23,094
- Is this where your friends are?
- No, it's not.

423
00:31:23,177 --> 00:31:25,931
Man, I thought you weren't gonna show!

424
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:29,726
Aldo is beside himself.

425
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:32,316
Ladies and Gentlemen,
we are proud to present

426
00:31:32,317 --> 00:31:34,382
two of the world's greatest singers!

427
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,232
I hope you're warmed up.

428
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:40,014
It's an ugly crowd out there tonight.
All the reviewers showed up.

429
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:44,576
All the way from Firenze, Italy,
the one and only Aldo Gianfranco!

430
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,249
And all the way from Sunnydale, California,
the world's finest soprano,

431
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:51,918
Willow Rosenberg!

432
00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:56,966
But I... I didn't learn the words.

433
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:46,272
My turn?

434
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:00,663
I love these bars!

435
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:04,375
A Chocolate Hurricane

436
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:05,919
is the best!

437
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:09,840
I haven't had one of these since my...

438
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,968
..sixth...

439
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:16,890
..birthday.

440
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:36,704
I don't see the ugly man.

441
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:41,317
I also don't know where the sun
and the rest of the world went.

442
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:46,298
Look at this.
I guess they're gonna bury somebody.

443
00:33:46,382 --> 00:33:48,509
I wonder who died.

444
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:50,492
Nobody died!

445
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:53,987
What's the fun of burying someone
if they're already dead?

446
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:59,076
- You.
- So, this is the Slayer.

447
00:34:00,022 --> 00:34:03,443
You're prettier than the last one.

448
00:34:03,526 --> 00:34:06,488
This isn't real. You can't be free.

449
00:34:06,572 --> 00:34:09,450
You still don't understand, do you?

450
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:13,163
I am free because you fear it.

451
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:17,792
Because you fear it,
the world is crumbling.

452
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:20,588
Your nightmares are made flesh.

453
00:34:20,671 --> 00:34:23,507
You have little Billy to thank for that.

454
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:32,642
- This is a dream.
- A dream is a wish your heart makes.

455
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:35,480
This is real life.

456
00:34:37,815 --> 00:34:41,444
Come on, Slayer. What are you afraid of?

457
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:48,660
- No!
- How about being buried alive?

458
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:50,497
Please, no! Don't!

459
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,373
Please, no! Don't!

460
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,168
Don't! Somebody help me! Please, no!

461
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:59,423
Please, no! Help me! Don't! Help me!

462
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:09,351
- Did you find Buffy?
- I had to sing. Very bad. To sing.

463
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:11,436
Come on. Let's find the others.

464
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,816
- What happened to you?
- Remember my sixth birthday party?

465
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:19,154
Oh, yeah. When the clown chased you
and you got so scared that you...

466
00:35:20,155 --> 00:35:21,698
Oh...

467
00:35:26,412 --> 00:35:28,998
No sign of Buffy?

468
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,583
You were a lousy clown!
Your balloon animals were pathetic.

469
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,010
Everyone can make a giraffe!

470
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:59,158
I feel good. I feel liberated.

471
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,369
You seem to be the only one.
Things are getting worse.

472
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,331
In a few hours reality will fold completely
into the realm of nightmares.

473
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:06,463
What do we do?

474
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,168
The only thing I can think of
is to try and wake Billy.

475
00:36:08,203 --> 00:36:09,991
- Uh, no. We can't leave without Buffy.
- Agreed.

476
00:36:10,026 --> 00:36:13,249
But who knows where
she might have gone?

477
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:17,721
Excuse me. When did they put
a cemetery in across the street?

478
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:21,909
And when did they make it night over there?

479
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:31,211
Whose nightmare is this?

480
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:33,988
It's mine.

481
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:46,518
I failed...

482
00:36:47,263 --> 00:36:51,640
in my duty to protect you.

483
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:55,889
I should've been more... cautious.

484
00:36:55,972 --> 00:36:59,748
Taken more time to train you.

485
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:03,966
But you were so gifted.

486
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:09,249
And the evil was so great.

487
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:15,077
I'm sorry.

488
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:28,592
Buffy?

489
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:35,314
- I thought I was dead!
- Buffy, your face!

490
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:41,858
Oh, God.

491
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:50,075
- Buffy...
- Don't look at me!

492
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,418
You never told me
you dreamt of becoming a vampire.

493
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:01,422
This isn't a dream.

494
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:04,592
No. No, it's not.

495
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:07,219
But there's a chance
that we can make it go away.

496
00:38:07,303 --> 00:38:11,016
This all comes from Billy.
If we can only wake him up,

497
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,062
I believe that the nightmares will stop

498
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:16,835
and reality will shift back into place,
but we must do it now!

499
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:20,079
I need you to hold together
long enough to help us.

500
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,179
Can you do that?

501
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:33,356
Yeah. I think I can.

502
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:36,419
Thank you.

503
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:42,868
Well, we'd better hurry...
'cause I'm getting hungry.

504
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:46,306
That is, uh... a joke, right?

505
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:48,639
Are you sure everything
will go back once he's awake?

506
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,419
Oh, uh, positive.

507
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:53,064
Well, how do we wake Billy up?
What if we can't?

508
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:56,567
Willow, do shut up.

509
00:39:02,491 --> 00:39:05,118
Doctor! Is the boy, Billy, still here?

510
00:39:05,202 --> 00:39:07,288
My hands...

511
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:15,297
What now?

512
00:39:16,465 --> 00:39:18,551
Billy!

513
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,638
- Billy!
- That won't work.

514
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:28,478
Billy. Uh... Billy, you have to wake up.

515
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:30,940
No. I told her. I have to hide.

516
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:34,360
- Why? From what?
- From him.

517
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:41,827
- Oh, man. What do we do?
- I think I know.

518
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:50,044
Whatever it is, it better be soon.

519
00:39:50,128 --> 00:39:52,423
Glad you showed up.

520
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,176
You see, I'm having a really bad day.

521
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:58,555
- Lucky 19!
- Scary!

522
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:03,768
I'll tell you something, though.
There are a lot scarier things than you.

523
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:10,526
And I'm one of them.

524
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,950
Is he dead?

525
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,702
Come here, Billy.

526
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,834
- I... I don't...
- You have to do the rest.

527
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,931
What are they doing?

528
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:15,725
I get it.

529
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:22,984
No more hiding.

530
00:41:47,553 --> 00:41:50,182
Hey, he's waking up.

531
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,940
I had the strangest dream.

532
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:01,277
You were in it... and you.

533
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:05,365
Who are you people?

534
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:08,285
Let's get a doctor.

535
00:42:08,368 --> 00:42:11,164
Oh... Billy's got company.

536
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:13,791
I-I-I'm his Kiddie League coach.

537
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:19,423
I come by here every day, just hoping
against hope that he's gonna wake up soon.

538
00:42:19,507 --> 00:42:22,134
He's, uh... my lucky 19.

539
00:42:23,052 --> 00:42:25,514
So, um... how is he?

540
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:33,356
He's awake.

541
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,859
What?

542
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:39,341
You blamed him for losing the game.

543
00:42:39,342 --> 00:42:40,342
So you caught up with him
afterwards, didn't you?

544
00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:47,157
- What are you talkin' about?
- You said it was my fault that we lost.

545
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:50,972
It wasn't my fault.

546
00:42:50,973 --> 00:42:53,717
There's eight other players on the team.

547
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:56,485
You know that.

548
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,223
Nice going.

549
00:43:08,813 --> 00:43:11,691
I just can't believe a Kiddie League coach
would do something like that.

550
00:43:11,774 --> 00:43:13,855
Well, you obviously
haven't played Kiddie League.

551
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:15,931
I'm surprised it wasn't one of the parents.

552
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:19,616
I'm just glad he's behind bars
where he belongs.

553
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,570
But that was kinda heroic, Xander.
Grabbing him and all.

554
00:43:22,605 --> 00:43:25,237
Well, I just did what
anybody else would've.

555
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:26,816
I mean, if you wanna label it heroic...

556
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:28,626
Hi!

557
00:43:31,672 --> 00:43:34,592
Have a killer weekend, guys!

558
00:43:36,177 --> 00:43:39,973
Hi, sweetheart.
Oh, it's so good to see you!

559
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:44,002
- How was your day?
- Oh, you know. Usual.

560
00:43:44,037 --> 00:43:46,564
- Personal question?
- Yeah, shoot.

561
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:48,874
When Buffy was a vampire,

562
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:52,781
you weren't still, like,
attracted to her, were you?

563
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:57,334
Willow, how can you...
I mean, that's really bent! She was...

564
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,336
grotesque!

565
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,940
Still dug her, huh?

566
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,775
I'm sick. I need help.

567
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,094
Don't I know it!
