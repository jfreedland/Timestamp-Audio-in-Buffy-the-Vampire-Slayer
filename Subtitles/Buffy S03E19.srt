1
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:04,961
All right, you can
open them up now.

2
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:09,864
Fab. What's the occasion?

3
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:13,165
Faith, as if I need a reason
to show you my affection...

4
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:16,729
or appreciation for running
a small errand at the airport.

5
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:18,172
Airport?

6
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:20,005
What's next?

7
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:21,874
You gonna want me to help
a buddy of yours move a sofa?

8
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:23,971
This isn't a free ride,
young lady.

9
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:26,016
You know,
I'm beginning to think...

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,210
that somebody's getting
a little spoiled.

11
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:29,274
Maybe I should
take this back.

12
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:31,184
Sorry...

13
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:33,314
sir.

14
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,790
That's my girl.

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,656
Another cookie?

16
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:41,958
Now... a package is
arriving tomorrow night...

17
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:43,590
from Central America.

18
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,134
Something... and I can't
stress this enough...

19
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:48,228
something crucially important
to my ascension.

20
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:49,329
Without it...

21
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:52,342
well, what would
tollhouse cookies be...

22
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,342
without the chocolate chips?

23
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:55,504
A pretty darn
big disappointment...

24
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,513
I can tell you.
Ha ha ha.

25
00:00:57,581 --> 00:00:58,980
Open your present.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

27
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:09,691
There.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,490
That look on your face
is my reward.

29
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:15,191
This is a thing
of beauty, Boss.

30
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:16,494
Cost a pretty penny.

31
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,868
So, you just
take good care of it.

32
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:23,133
You be careful...

33
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:25,573
not to put somebody's
eye out with that thing.

34
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:28,578
Till I tell you to.

35
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:31,706
Got any particular
eyes in mind?

36
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:40,647
Sorry, honey.

37
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:42,385
That's OK.

38
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,268
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

39
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:58,831
Unless, of course,
you're me.

40
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,536
That was bracing.

41
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,909
Wanna do another sweep?

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,141
It's what I live for.
Sad to say.

43
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:06,513
Too tired?

44
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,551
No.

45
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:09,085
It's just...

46
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:14,022
do you get the feeling
that we're kind of in a rut?

47
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:16,489
Rut?

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,585
You never take me
anyplace new.

49
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:22,223
What about that
fire-demon nest...

50
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,029
in the cave by the beach?

51
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:28,003
Thought that was
a nice change of pace.

52
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:29,505
So this is our future?

53
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:31,473
I mean, this is how we're
gonna spend our nights...

54
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,567
when I'm 50 and you're...

55
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:35,771
the same age you are now?

56
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:36,938
[Growling]

57
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:39,949
Let's just get you to 50.

58
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,541
Liking that plan.

59
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:44,216
Buffy?

60
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,815
When were you
going to tell me?

61
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,360
All right, busted.

62
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:50,895
I didn't think
you'd miss them.

63
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:55,024
You were accepted to
Northwestern University?

64
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,092
Honey,
I'm so proud of you.

65
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:59,296
That's wonderful.

66
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,397
Right, it's wonderful.

67
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,601
Hmm. I mean,
it's not cheap...

68
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,268
but, uh, I know
we can make it work...

69
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,971
if your father pitches in.

70
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,140
Not that Northwestern
is your only option.

71
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,184
It's a great school, though.

72
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,151
I am so proud of you.

73
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,586
You said that before.

74
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:18,088
And will again soon.

75
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,454
Mom, you know that I can't...

76
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,825
I... I just can't decide
on a school right now.

77
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,865
I mean, I want to sleep on it,
you know, mull it over.

78
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:30,333
Raise them up my inner flagpole,
see which one I salute.

79
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,563
I know, sweetheart.

80
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:34,504
I'm just so pleased
you have so many choices.

81
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,200
Ooh, you know what?

82
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,142
Your aunt Arlene
and her family...

83
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,508
are in Illinois.

84
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,672
I've got to call
and tell them.

85
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:46,608
Oh, Buffy...

86
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:48,482
I know.
You're proud of me.

87
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,784
Don't forget to put my earrings
back in my dresser...

88
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:52,824
before you go out.

89
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,354
Arlene?

90
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,329
Hi. It's Joyce.

91
00:04:58,397 --> 00:04:59,921
How you doin'?

92
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,162
You are never gonna believe
where Buffy got accepted to school.

93
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,831
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

94
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,703
OK, what's in the bag?

95
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:09,706
My lunch.

96
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:11,640
Is that the new
drug lingo?

97
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,200
No. It's my lunch.

98
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,843
Sit up straight.

99
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,958
Sounds like your mom's
in a state of denial.

100
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,391
More like a continent.

101
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,952
She just has to realize
that I can't go away.

102
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,227
Well, maybe not now,
but soon, maybe.

103
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,464
Or maybe I, too,
hail from denial land.

104
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:39,970
Faith's turn to the
dark side of the force...

105
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,506
pretty much put
the proverbial kibosh...

106
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,041
on any away plans
for me.

107
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,133
U.C. Sunnydale.
At least I got in.

108
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,372
But you... I can't believe
you got into Oxford.

109
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,175
It's pretty exciting.

110
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,840
There's some
deep academia there.

111
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,178
That's where
they make Gileses!

112
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,709
I know. I could learn
and have scones.

113
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,346
Although I don't know
how I feel...

114
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,857
about going to school
in a foreign country.

115
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,257
Everything in life
is foreign territory.

116
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,923
Kerouac. He's my teacher.

117
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,228
The open road... my school.

118
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,200
Making the open Dumpster
your cafeteria?

119
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,827
Go ahead, mock me.

120
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,030
I think she just did.

121
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,300
We bohemian,
anti-establishment types...

122
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,432
have always been persecuted.

123
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,101
Sure. You're all so weird.

124
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,667
I think it's neat...

125
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:22,543
you doing the backpack,
trail mix, happy wanderer thing.

126
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,675
I'm aware it scores kinda high
on the hokey meter.

127
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:26,775
But I think
it'll be good for me...

128
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:27,978
help me to find myself.

129
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,578
And help us to lose you.
Everyone's a winner.

130
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:34,615
Well, look who just popped open
a fresh can of venom.

131
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,888
Hey, did you hear about Willow
getting into Oxnard?

132
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:38,361
- Oxford.
- And M.I.T.

133
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,954
And Yale and
every other college...

134
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:40,964
on the face of the planet...

135
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,432
as in your face
I rub it.

136
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,992
Oxford. Whoopee.

137
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,506
4 years in tea bag central.
Sounds thrilling.

138
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,475
And M.I.T. is a Clearasil ad
with housing.

139
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,806
And Yale is
a dumping ground...

140
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:54,140
for those who didn't
get into Harvard.

141
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,475
I got into Harvard.

142
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,709
Any clue on what college
you might be attending...

143
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,944
so we can start calculating
minimum safe distance?

144
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,486
None of your business.

145
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,317
Certainly nowhere near
you losers.

146
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,789
You guys, don't forget to
breathe between insults.

147
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,224
I'm sorry, Buffy.
This conversation is reserved...

148
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,455
for those who actually
have a future.

149
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,022
Angry young woman.

150
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,364
Oh, Buffy, she was
just being Cordelia.

151
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,301
Only more so.

152
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,838
Don't pay
any attention to her.

153
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:22,373
Xander: She's definitely
got a chip goin'.

154
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,238
Maybe if you didn't
goad her so much.

155
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,141
I can't help it.
It's my nature.

156
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,441
Maybe you need
a better nature.

157
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,205
I don't understand.

158
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,478
I don't think I can
talk any slower, Wes.

159
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:34,484
I want to leave.

160
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:35,713
What, now?

161
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,416
No, not now.
After I graduate.

162
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,422
College?

163
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,550
But... you're a slayer.

164
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,993
Yeah. I'm also a person.

165
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,554
You can't just define me
by my slayerness.

166
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,260
That's... something-ism.

167
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,135
Buffy, I know we've talked
about you going away.

168
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,900
I got into Northwestern.

169
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,465
That's wonderful news.
Good for you.

170
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:02,207
All right, everyone. Monsters,
demons, world in peril.

171
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,442
I'll betcha they have
all that stuff in Illinois.

172
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:05,847
You cannot leave Sunnydale!

173
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,014
With the power invested in me
by the Council, I forbid it.

174
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,855
Oh, yes, that should
settle it.

175
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,188
With Faith gone bad...

176
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,558
and the mayor's ascension
coming up...

177
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,858
I know it's complicated.

178
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,865
I'm aware that my graduation...

179
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,060
may be, among other things,
posthumous...

180
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,569
but what if I
stop the ascension?

181
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,627
What if I capture Faith?

182
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:27,797
I very much
hope you will.

183
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,636
If I do that, then all
you guys have to do...

184
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,541
is keep the run-of-the-mill unholy
forces at bay through midterms...

185
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:33,873
and I'll be back in time
for homecoming...

186
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,574
and every school break
after that.

187
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,182
Can we at least
think about it?

188
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:41,947
Perhaps if circumstances
were different...

189
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,012
- I'll make them different.
- What?

190
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,990
I'm tired of waiting for Mayor McSleaze
to make his move...

191
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,026
while we sit on
our hands...

192
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:49,424
counting down
to ascension day.

193
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,826
Let's take
the fight to him.

194
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,227
No.

195
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:54,458
No! Much too reckless.

196
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,831
We're at a distinct
disadvantage.

197
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,870
We don't know anything
about the mayor's ascension.

198
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:00,905
She's right.
Time's running out.

199
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,406
We need to take
the offensive.

200
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:03,771
What's your plan?

201
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,173
I gotta have a plan?
Really?

202
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,238
I can't just be
proactive with pep?

203
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:13,478
You want to take the fight to them,
I suggest the first step...

204
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,383
would be to find out
exactly what they're up to.

205
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,615
Oh. I actually
knew that.

206
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,385
I thought you meant
a more specific plan...

207
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,925
you know,
with maps and stuff.

208
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,520
Great. We'll find out
what they're up to.

209
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,496
He in the car?

210
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,706
I'll take you to him.

211
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:05,638
I'll take you to him.

212
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,146
The mayor was supposed to be
here in person with the money.

213
00:10:13,415 --> 00:10:15,679
Well, the price just went up.

214
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,479
I don't like surprises.

215
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,814
[Whistling, Thud]

216
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:29,823
Surprise.

217
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:48,746
You killed him.

218
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:51,183
What are you, the narrator?
Get the keys to the cuffs.

219
00:10:57,726 --> 00:10:58,988
Nothin'.

220
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:01,927
[Drops Bow]

221
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:05,965
That won't
cut through steel.

222
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:09,560
No, but it'll
cut through bone.

223
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:58,577
Hey-ho. There it is.
Ha ha ha ha.

224
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:00,814
Uh, what happened
to the courier?

225
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,151
I was supposed
to pay him.

226
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,919
Huh. I made him an offer
he couldn't survive.

227
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:11,497
You are one heck of
a girl, you know that?

228
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:14,535
I mean, geez, the initiative,
the... the skill.

229
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:16,627
Go on. Go on.

230
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:17,966
I will.

231
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,939
I'll tell you, if Buff...

232
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:21,270
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

233
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:23,902
If Buffy Summers
walked in here...

234
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:25,536
and said she wanted
to switch to our side...

235
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:27,638
I'd say,
"No, thanks, sister.

236
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:29,979
I got all the slayer one man
could ever need." Ha ha.

237
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,050
What?

238
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:34,554
Nothing.

239
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:38,490
Oh, it's 'cause I used
the "B" word, huh?

240
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,891
Don't tell me
you're still sore...

241
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:42,293
about that whole
Angel-Buffy thing.

242
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:45,958
No, I'm over it.
She can have him.

243
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,558
Better believe she can.

244
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,569
She deserves
that poor excuse...

245
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,195
for a creature
of the night.

246
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:54,503
You, on the other hand,
can do better.

247
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:59,571
Don't do that.

248
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,779
[Clattering]

249
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,563
So, what's in the box?

250
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,135
The Box of Gavrok.

251
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:25,172
It houses some great
demonic energy or something...

252
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,834
which His Honor needs to
chow down on come "A" day.

253
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:29,774
Wesley: What's that?

254
00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:31,675
Maps and stuff.

255
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:35,182
Plans for city hall. They were in
the Water and Power mainframe.

256
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,717
The box is being
kept under guard...

257
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:38,752
in a conference room
on the top floor.

258
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,549
There.

259
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:42,351
Unfortunately, that's all I
could get out of my informant...

260
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:43,685
before his
aggressive tendencies...

261
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,692
forced me to introduce him
to Mr. Pointy.

262
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,557
Well, now, here's what
I think we should do.

263
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,620
I figure we can enter
through the skylight.

264
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:50,686
I'll take Angel with me.

265
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:51,754
Agreed.

266
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,765
There's a fire ladder...

267
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,597
on the east side
of the building here.

268
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,728
Yes, fine. But we still
need to consider...

269
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:59,398
It won't be enough to simply
have possession of the box.

270
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:00,873
Right. We have
to destroy it.

271
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:02,375
Not just physically,
ritually.

272
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,240
With some down-and-dirty
black magic.

273
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:07,543
Hang on. We don't know what
such a ritual would require.

274
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,105
I think the "Breath
of the Entropics..."

275
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:11,550
is standard for
this sort of thing.

276
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,450
Fairly simple recipe.
Xander.

277
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,955
I know.
I'm ingredient-gettin' guy.

278
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:18,322
All right, stop!

279
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:21,260
I demand everyone
stop this instant.

280
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:23,263
I'm in charge here...

281
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:26,994
and I say this is all
moving much too fast.

282
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:29,434
We need time to fully
analyze the situation

283
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:31,369
and devise a proper
and strategic stratagem.

284
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,067
Wes, hop on the train
or get off the tracks.

285
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:35,939
The mayor will
most assuredly...

286
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,446
have supernatural safeguards
protecting the box.

287
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:43,783
Oh, we all forgot
about that, did we?

288
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,216
Looks like a job
for Wiccan girl.

289
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:47,220
What do you say, Wil?
Big-time danger.

290
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:49,483
Hey, I eat danger
for breakfast.

291
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:52,720
But, oddly enough, she panics
in the face of breakfast foods.

292
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,421
Let's get to work.

293
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:24,585
I have a theory.
Your snide remarks earlier?

294
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,685
I'm guessing grapes
a little on the sour side.

295
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,889
Didn't get into
any schools, did ya?

296
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,397
The grades were there...

297
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:34,026
but, ooh, if it weren't
for that pesky interview.

298
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:35,126
10 minutes with you...

299
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:36,135
and the admissions
department...

300
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:37,398
decided that
they'd already reached...

301
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:39,906
their mean-spirited
superficial-princess quotas.

302
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:42,340
And once again...

303
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,275
the gold medal in
the being-wrong event...

304
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:47,371
goes to Xander "I'm As Stupid
As I Look" Harris.

305
00:15:50,218 --> 00:15:51,913
Read 'em and weep,
creep...

306
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:54,420
U.S.C., Colorado State...

307
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:57,856
Duke and Columbia.

308
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,694
Wow. These are,
uh, great colleges.

309
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:05,198
I'm guessing
they must have seen...

310
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:08,565
a different side
of your father's money.

311
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:09,568
Go away.

312
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,468
Sure. If you'll excuse me...

313
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,632
I have to go back to helping
to save some lives.

314
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,973
Carry on. I know that you have
some important accessorizing to do.

315
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:34,425
Now, remember...

316
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,725
If anything
should go awry...

317
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:38,425
Wesley and I will
create a diversion.

318
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,898
Let's synchronize
our watches.

319
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,992
I have 214...

320
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:45,599
Yes, typical.

321
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,573
Maybe we could just
count 1-1,000, 2-1,000.

322
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:49,701
Be careful, all of you.

323
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,445
Tea?

324
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:10,758
You got the goods?

325
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:11,890
Yeah.

326
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,018
Essence of toad.

327
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:14,178
Essence of toad.

328
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:16,687
Twice-blessed sage.

329
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:19,019
Maybe that's the toad.

330
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:21,150
Well, we better be sure.
Destroying this box...

331
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:22,818
is supposed to be
a pretty delicate operation.

332
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:25,328
Then they shouldn't leave it
in the hands of the lay people.

333
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:27,695
Well, Wil laid it out
for us pretty well.

334
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:31,297
Wow, she even drew
helpful diagrams.

335
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,564
That's the pedestal.

336
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:33,866
And the ingredients.

337
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:34,871
And us.

338
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,101
See, there's you,
there's me.

339
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:38,540
Well, how can you tell
which is which?

340
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,601
I mean, they both kind of
look stick figurey to me.

341
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,273
Well, this one's me.
See the little guitar?

342
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:44,713
Oh, gotcha.

343
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:46,751
Yeah. Nobody
like my Wil.

344
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:48,786
No, sir, there is not.

345
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:54,985
OK... toad me.

346
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:23,218
Thanks.

351
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:57,181
Oh, yeah. I'm bad.

352
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:58,517
4 stars, Wil.

353
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,285

00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:04,953
You're not my elder.

533
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:07,252
I got a lot
of years on you.

534
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,518
Yeah, and that's just
one of the things...

535
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:11,117
you're gonna have to
deal with.

536
00:31:11,194 --> 00:31:12,388
You're immortal.
She's not.

537
00:31:12,462 --> 00:31:13,827
It's not easy.

538
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:15,694
I married my Edna Mae in '03...

539
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:18,064
and I was with her
right until the end.

540
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:20,000
Not a pretty picture.

541
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:23,603
Wrinkled and senile...

542
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:26,871
and cursing me
for my youth.

543
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:30,038
Wasn't our happiest time.

544
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:31,671
And let's forget the fact...

545
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:34,917
that any moment of true
happiness will turn you evil.

546
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,347
[Snickers]

547
00:31:36,418 --> 00:31:38,545
I mean, come on,
what kind of a life...

548
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:39,918
can you offer her?

549
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:42,787
I don't see a lot of Sunday
picnics in the offing.

550
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:44,849
I see skulking
in the shadows...

551
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:45,894
hiding from the sun.

552
00:31:45,961 --> 00:31:47,826
She's a blossoming
young girl...

553
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:49,888
and you want to keep her from
the life she should have...

554
00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:52,433
till it's passed her by.
And by God...

555
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,696
I think that's
a little selfish.

556
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:58,930
Is that what you
came back from hell for?

557
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:02,068
Is that your
greater purpose?

558
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:09,208
Make the trade.

559
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:26,801
Well, that went
as smoothly...

560
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:28,359
Nobody moves!

561
00:32:36,478 --> 00:32:39,777
I knew you kids
were up to something.

562
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:40,815
Snyder, get out of here.

563
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:42,612
You're not giving orders,
young lady.

564
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,619
I suppose you're
going to tell me...

565
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:47,383
I won't find drugs
in this box.

566
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:51,318
Wait!

567
00:32:51,393 --> 00:32:53,020
Principal Snyder...

568
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,059
I think we have
a problem.

569
00:32:56,131 --> 00:32:59,532
Mr. Mayor,
I had no idea you...

570
00:33:00,703 --> 00:33:03,467
I'm terribly sorry.

571
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:04,597
No, it's I who
should apologize.

572
00:33:04,673 --> 00:33:06,231
I mean, coming down here
at night.

573
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:08,799
What must you be thinking?
But you see...

574
00:33:08,877 --> 00:33:12,142
I just needed to...
Uh, no, don't do that!

575
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:15,676
Aah!

576
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:17,616
Aah!

Aah!

578
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:24,853
Aaaahhhh!

579
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:40,774
Oh, God.

580
00:33:40,843 --> 00:33:42,572
Where'd it go?

581
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,135
Get that door open!

582
00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:45,305

583
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,973

out of here.

where it went.

00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:57,385

588
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:22,174
I wouldn't
leave that open.

No!

in there?

all of you...

601
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,594
why couldn't you be dealing
drugs like normal people?

602
00:36:06,054 --> 00:36:07,578
Well, that went
swimmingly.

603
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,491
We did all right.

604
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:19,925
So Faith was like,
"I'm gonna beat you up,"

605
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:21,560
and I'm all,
"I'm not afraid of you."

606
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,730
And then she had the knife,
which was less fun.

607
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,603
And then, oh,
I... I told her...

608
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:27,539
"You made your choice.
Buffy was your friend."

00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:29,600
Yes. This is
fascinating...

610

but just to get
back to the point.

611
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:35,509
You actually had your hands
on the Books of Ascension?

Volumes 1 through 5.

613
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:40,051
Is there anything that you
can remember about them...

00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:42,317
that could be of use to us?
Anything at all?

615
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:46,157
Well, I was in a hurry...

616
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:48,958
and what I did read
was kind of involved.

Oh.

619
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:56,430
Actually, there were a few pages
that were kind of interesting...

620
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,439
but I didn't have a chance
to read them fully.

621

make of them.

00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:52,752
As in I'm never
getting out of here.

634
00:37:52,828 --> 00:37:56,320
I kept thinking if I
stopped the mayor or...

635
00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:58,923
but I was
kidding myself.

Wait, what am I saying?
You can't.

654
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:41,819
What do you mean I can't?

655
00:38:41,888 --> 00:38:43,321
I won't let you.

657
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:46,953
which is
the boss of me?

658
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:48,289
There are better schools.

00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:52,759
and... and I can design
my own curriculum.

00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,630
OK, well, there are
safer schools.

662
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,464
There are safer prisons.

get me wrong... of you.

things just...
kinda got clear.

I mean, you've been fighting
evil here for 3 years...

671
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,881

supposed to decide...

what we want to do
with our lives.

674
00:39:21,595 --> 00:39:24,792
And I just realized
that's what I want to do.

Fight evil, help people.

I mean, I... I think
it's worth doing.

Yes, please.

687
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:57,655
It's weird.
You look at something...

688
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,392
and you think you know
exactly what you're seeing...

689
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:02,526
and... then you find out
it's something else entirely.

00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:04,194
Neat, huh?

691
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,034
Sometimes it is.

are you doing?

693

Your break's been over
for 10 minutes.

I still need you
to restock the shelves...

695

and sweep out
the storage room.

00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:29,390
Let's go!

697
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:01,251
It's gonna be fun.

698
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:05,128
Wil and I are gonna go
on Saturday, look at the campus.

699
00:41:05,198 --> 00:41:06,893
I'm hoping my mom
will let me live there.

700
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,663
It's too far
to come home every night.

701
00:41:09,736 --> 00:41:13,001
Plus the whole
lack-of-cool factor.

702
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:15,234
Either way, I'll be
close to your place.

703
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:21,640
I don't know what the mayor
was talking about.

704
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:25,214
How could he know
anything about us?

705
00:41:25,285 --> 00:41:27,116
Well, he's evil.

00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,984
Big-time.

707
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:32,689
He doesn't even know what
a lasting relationship is.

708
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:33,691
No.

709
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:37,791
Probably the only lasting
relationship he's ever had...

710
00:41:37,864 --> 00:41:39,798
is with...

711
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:40,924
evil.

712
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,561
Yeah.

713
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:46,605
Big, stupid, evil guy.

714
00:41:47,707 --> 00:41:50,198
We'll be OK.

715
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:51,470
We will.
