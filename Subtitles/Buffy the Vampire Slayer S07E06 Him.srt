Spike, this is the Hellmouth.
You have a soul? Fine. Show me.

3
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:11,798
- Get out of this basement.
- I don't have anywhere else to go.

4
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:16,562
There will always be vengeance demons.
But now you, Anya, you're out.

5
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:19,877
Whatever's between us... it doesn't matter.

6
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:23,117
- You shouldn't be alone in this.
- Yes, I should.

7
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:30,118
You'll live in there.
It looks like a closet, but it's a room now.

8
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:34,961
Don't touch my food. I take the first shower.
If I use all the hot water, tough noogies.

00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,525

Keeping up, or do you need an English

Invitation?

12
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:46,922
Is there something more emphatic
than "hate"? Can I "revile" the plan?

13
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,758
Fine.

14
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:51,997
I invite you in. Nimrod.

I don't understand when his problems
became yours - or mine.

17

The school basement is making him crazy.
We can't leave him there.

- No. A thousand gallons of no.

21

It's just things are different now.
He has a soul.

22
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:20,555
I'm sure that'll be a comfort
when he soulfully attacks you again.

23
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:25,720
Yeah, what does that mean exactly?
That Spike is all soul-having?

24

I don't know. But he's been through a lot, OK?
And nobody is attacking...

already stopped talking to invisible people.

- Bollocks to the whole thing.

I mean, none of it makes sense.

46

First you say Spike disgusts you,
but you're doing it like bunnies.

47
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:50,641
And then Spike says he'd die for you,
but he tries to rape you.

48
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:56,358
For the record, Spike knew how wrong it was.
That's why he went away.

49
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:59,882
But to get a soul?
Like that would make him a better man?

50
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:02,924
Xander had a soul
when he stood Anya up at the altar,

51
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:05,804
and now he says he still wants her?

52
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:10,885
I just don't think it's the school basement
that's making people crazy.

53

00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,954
Again, since yesterday.
Dawn, it's awfully fast.

167
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:02,004
What? You're telling me
I don't feel what I feel?

168
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:05,965
No, of course not.
I believe that you think it's real.

169
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:08,640
It seems real, to you.

170
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:14,881
Know what? Maybe I don't want advice
from the dysfunction queen.

171
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,764
You have no idea how I feel.

172
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:21,524
You have no idea what real love is.

173
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:24,841
Maybe if you did,
you wouldn't make fun of me.

174
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:28,919
- Dawn, I'm not making fun of you.
- Just go.

175
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:30,997
Leave me alone.

I told you, all those fumbles in practice -
he was gonna come down on you.

179
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:48,159
I'm starting on Saturday.

180
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:51,279
Great. Who knew fumbling
all the time was the key?

181
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:55,564
It's just time to let someone else have a turn.
And you knew this was comin'.

182
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,637
Yeah. Sure.

183
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:08,878
- You can't do this to RJ.
- Oh, hey, it's you.

184
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:11,400
Nice cheering the other day.

185
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:13,875
It isn't fair. He works so hard.

186
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,480
What do you care?
This is how the game is played.

187
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:19,763
It's dog eat dog, may the best man win.

188
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:22,440
But nobody's better than RJ.

Yeah, well, that's not really
up to you, is it? Hm?

190
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,397
It all happened so fast.

191
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:47,923
One minute he was walking,
and the next he stumbled and... and he fell.

192
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:51,883
Why would he say
you pushed him down the stairs?

193
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:54,321
I don't know.
Maybe he was just embarrassed.

194
00:13:54,406 --> 00:14:00,003
It's hard being clumsy, especially
when you're popular and athletic. I'd bet.

195
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:03,965
To be candid, it wouldn't be the first time
I caught O'Donnell in a lie.

196
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:08,119
- It'd be nice if they didn't involve my sister.
- I'll have to call Coach Wheeler

197
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:10,720
and tell him the bad news.

198
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:15,755
- Not a conversation I really wanna have.
- At least he's still got RJ to take over.

199
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:18,485
Yeah. I think we have
everything we need for now.

200
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,036
I'm sorry you had
to get involved in this, Dawn.

201
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:25,323
That's OK.
I'm just really sorry it happened.

203
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,804
- Hey!
- Hi.

204
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:39,356
- I heard Wood hauled you into his office.
- Well, yeah.

205
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,165
- About O'Donnell?
- Yes.

206
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:45,079
That sucks,
facing the whole inquisition thing.

207
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,761
Yeah. "No one expects
the Spanish Inquisition."

208
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:54,079
God, it's like I have a disease or something.
It was really no big deal.

209
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,805
No. It was.

210
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:59,605
I think it's cool that you faced him. Wood.

211
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,762
We just talked. He just wanted me
to tell him about the accident.

212
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,365
Yeah.

213
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:11,200
It sucks when these things
just happen - out of nowhere.

214
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,005
Right. Out of nowhere.

215
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:20,199
I was thinking of heading out tonight,
after practice. You wanna meet up?

216

once you get back the soul,

doesn't that mean you start, like,
picking up your own wet towels off the floor?

00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:56,354
No, but maybe you start to feel really bad
about leaving them there.

At least he's showering.
That's a refreshing and delightful change.

- What?
- Where do I start with the bad?

236
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:06,795
First, you said
you were going to the library.

237
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:09,639
Second, you do not go on a date
without informing me.

Third, Anna Nicole Smith

Well, I think I look hot, and so does RJ.

240
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:17,194

have a word with him.

No! Don't you dare

00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,875
But we have inside info.
We know he doesn't like being swept.

326
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:29,196
He likes to be the sweeper.

327
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:33,802
Dawn, you're gonna come out the winner
here. With me looking out for you.

328
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,324
Yeah, I guess so. Thank you.

329
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:46,603
So we do know that six <i>x plus y equals 16,
so we can solve for <i>y in terms of iso...

330
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:52,238
Sorry to interrupt. We need to see
RJ Brooks down in the guidance office.

332
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:07,360
There's no one here.

333
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:12,478
Yeah, there is.
There's one of you...

334
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:16,399
and there's one of me.

335
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:22,759
You were the one in math class.
Tell me what that adds up to.

336
00:24:27,806 --> 00:24:31,765
I'm not coming on too strong
if I just look at him.

<i>(Buffy) I've always been</i>
<i>fascinated by football.</i>

338
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:44,923
So what's it like to lead a team?

339
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:47,361
The thing of it is, the time.

340
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:51,405
Nobody gets how much time goes into it,
with practices and games.

341
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:56,116
I totally get it. I was kinda juggling
some stuff when I was in high school too.

342
00:24:56,206 --> 00:25:00,677
Which was also very recent.
Principal Snyder was always on me.

343
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:05,274
I still say Wood's the worst.
You haven't seen the way that guy rides me.

344
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:08,961
I wish somebody
would just get him off my back.

345
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:12,004
Yeah. That would be cool.

346
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:15,681
And sometimes,
I didn't even do anything wrong.

347
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,405
You're like a teacher.

348
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:25,078
Not really.

349
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:28,397
But, I mean, does it bother you?

350
00:25:29,646 --> 00:25:31,637
Not so much.

351
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:08,803
Dawn?

352
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:11,684
What's wrong? Is this...

353
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:13,757
Did that guy in the jacket...?

354
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:18,761
- I don't even wanna hear his name any more!
- I just called him "that guy in the jacket".

355
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:23,522
That's what I used to call him in my head
before I knew his real name!

356
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:28,726
Dawnie, honey,
you seem... extremely perturbed.

357
00:26:28,806 --> 00:26:31,604
- Maybe I should go get Buffy...
- No!

358
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:35,280
I don't ever wanna see her again.

359
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:38,881
I thought this was about
that guy in the... um...

360
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,920
That guy with the thing.

361
00:26:42,926 --> 00:26:45,520
No, it's about both of them.

362
00:26:48,846 --> 00:26:51,724
Buffy, I think Dawn needs y...

363
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:53,717
Xander, hi.

364
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:57,321
- This is RJ.
- Hey, guy. It's called knocking.

365
00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:01,804
I'm sorry. Checkout time was an hour ago.
We were hoping to make up the bed.

366
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,003
And also, it's a classroom,
you chowderhead!

367
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:08,635
Now get off the boy, Buffy.
We're going home.

368
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:13,441
Dawn, please stop crying. Please?

369
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:16,405
Crying isn't gonna make
his love for me go away.

370
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:19,159
You're under a love spell.
That's what this has to be.

371
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:22,318
You're right. He's right.

372
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:25,398
You're under a spell.
Oh, poor little Dawnie.

373
00:27:25,486 --> 00:27:27,920
But we're working on it.
It'll be better soon.

374
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:32,318
Yes. Soon neither one of you
will be in love with this boy.

375
00:27:32,406 --> 00:27:35,045
- He's not a boy.
- What do you know about our love?

376
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:39,119
It's true and real.
This isn't magic. This is my heart.

377
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:42,605
- Fine.
- We'll be working.

378
00:27:43,606 --> 00:27:48,361
Look, I know this feels terrible,
but it isn't real. Try to hold on to that.

379
00:27:48,446 --> 00:27:50,960
Did you hear that? It isn't real.

380
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,959
- You're just crazy.
- It is so real! I love him.

381
00:27:55,046 --> 00:28:00,074
You knew how I felt, like I'd finally
found something, and you betrayed me.

382
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:05,320
I betrayed you? <i>You</i> constructed this
elaborate fantasy about you and my lover.

383
00:28:05,406 --> 00:28:08,682
- Your lover? Your lover?!
- Guys, guys...

384
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:11,883
- I tried to get you to back away.
- That's right! You lied to me!

385
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:14,434
Did you want me to tell you
he's in love with me?

386
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,235
- That your little crush is hopeless?
- It's not a crush!

387
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:21,636
- Stop. You're not supposed to do this!
- Why?

388
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:25,719
Because he's younger than me? You know,
I'm extremely youthful. And peppy.

389
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:28,161
No.

390
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:31,363
Cos you were the one I trusted.

391
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:36,320
- Dawn, wait!
- <i>(door slams)</i>

392
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:41,202
- Crazy lust puppies, aren't they?
- At least the yelling went away.

393
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,925
It started to sound
like Christmas with my family.

394
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:46,600
Love spells. People forget
how dangerous they can be.

395
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:48,278
Hey, been there.

396
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:50,322
- Xander!
- Xander!

397
00:28:50,726 --> 00:28:52,876
Stop it! Stop!

398
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:57,798
- Good times.
- Here. Something.

399
00:28:58,206 --> 00:29:01,357
She's locked her door.
That spell has her good and loopy.

400
00:29:01,446 --> 00:29:04,756
- Info on one RJ Brooks.
- Oh, let me see. Is there a picture?

401
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:09,556
Family stuff. Hey, I knew his brother.
He was a big jock at Sunnydale High too.

402
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:13,241
Couple of years ahead of us.
He used to stick chewing gum in my hair.

403
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:16,318
- Hm.
- What are you thinking?

404
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:22,402
I think my relationship with RJ's brother was
complex at best, but maybe he's a way in.

405
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:24,442
Now look for a picture.

406
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:30,004
We're tangling with a powerful spell here
and we don't know what the deal is,

407
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:35,001
so keep an eye out if this guy looks twitchy.
And don't let this guy charm you, either.

408
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:40,399
He had everyone around him practically
kissing his ring back in high school.

409
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:47,238
Yeah?

410
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:52,679
- Construction, huh? That's awesome.
- <i>(Xander)</i> Yeah.

411
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:57,044
So, what's up with RJ?
How's he doing at the old alpha mater?

412
00:29:57,126 --> 00:30:02,837
Good. It's just... I know a girl that might be
going out with him and I was wondering...

413
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,396
God, and you wanna know if he's a good guy.
Truth is, he's the best.

414
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:11,241
Following in my footsteps. You might not
know it now, with a couple of extra pounds,

415
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:14,284
but back then, I was quite the guy.

416
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:17,438
Yeah, I gather that RJ is pretty popular too.

417
00:30:17,926 --> 00:30:21,601
I gotta tell ya, there was a time
I was worried about RJ.

418
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:26,714
He used to be all into comic books,
Model UN, geek stuff - no offence, Harris.

419
00:30:26,806 --> 00:30:30,082
One time, I found
all this poetry under his bed.

420
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:33,044
Turns out, he wrote it.

421
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:37,483
Then he, uh... what do you call it?
Blossomed. That's what it was like.

422
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:43,561
And do you have any idea why he, you know,
burst into a flower all of a sudd...?

423
00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:47,798
<i>(Spike)</i> You're wearing your brother's jacket.
Here, in this picture.

424
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:51,674
No, he's wearing mine. That jacket
was with me all the way through high school.

425
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,600
Gave it to him when I graduated,
right before I started at the Pizza Barn.

426
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:59,804
- I'm in the management programme.
- So, Lance, where did <i>you</i> get the jacket?

427
00:30:59,886 --> 00:31:02,684
Oh, Dad gave it to me.
Made a big deal about it too.

428
00:31:02,766 --> 00:31:06,554
How he met Mom wearing that jacket.
She was a former Miss Arkansas.

429
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:10,082
- Very hot in her day.
- Wow, that's wonderful.

430
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:13,363
- Boy, it's getting late.
- You guys don't have to take off.

431
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:16,882
I got sort of a rumpus room
set up in the basement.

432
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:20,197
There's air hockey and a mini fridge.

433
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:22,163
We could party.

434
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:24,714
<i>(Mrs Brooks)</i> Lance?
Do you have guests?

435
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:27,161
There's boxes of raisins
if you want snacks.

436
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:29,043
We really gotta go.

437
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:34,358
Damn love spell. I have tried
every anti-love spell spell I can find.

438
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:40,282
Even if you found the right one, he'd probably
just do an anti-anti-love spell spell... spell.

439
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,197
- What?
<i>- (doorbell)</i>

440
00:31:42,286 --> 00:31:47,155
I'll get it. Maybe it's Xander
with some answers from the brother.

441
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:53,479
- Oh, you have to be...
- I was looking for Buffy. Miss Summers.

442
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:57,002
- Buffy's not here. Go away!
- Are you sure?

443
00:31:57,086 --> 00:31:59,759
No Buffy for you. Leave quickly now.

444
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:01,837
Uh... OK.

445
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:04,716
Tell her to call me.

446
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:07,477
Man!

447
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:10,524
Good thing Buffy and Dawn are upstairs.

449
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:27,325
- But you don't even know him!
- Yes, I do. I looked into him. I saw his soul.

450
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:30,603
He was walking away,
so unless his soul is in his ass...

451

AJ is my best friend
and my dearest darling.

452
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:37,637
It's RJ. And what you were picking up on
was his deep caring and devotion to me.

453
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:40,798
- What's going on?
- Willow's in love with my boyfriend, RJ.

454
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:43,798
What? No! You two can't do this.

455
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:46,639
Willow, you're a gay woman. And he isn't.

456
00:32:46,726 --> 00:32:50,560
This isn't about his physical presence.
It's about his heart.

457
00:32:50,646 --> 00:32:53,718
- His physical presence has a penis!
- I can work around it!

458
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,195
This isn't fair!
How can you all do this to me?

459
00:32:56,286 --> 00:33:00,996
OK, wait. Everyone wait. Just calm down,
OK? I think I know what this is.

460
00:33:01,366 --> 00:33:05,803
Clearly, you've both been affected
by the same love spell that got Dawn.

461
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:08,764
This isn't a spell.
He owns my heart.

462
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:11,406
Dawn, be quiet.
We don't need you interfering.

463
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:14,922
There's a simple answer to this.
Think about who loves him the most.

464
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:19,318
Clearly I do, since I'm willing
to look past the whole orientation thing.

465
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:22,284
- I need him.
- You're gonna have to do better than that.

- I'd kill for him.
- You'd kill for a chocolate bar.

00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:27,762
- No.
- Yes!

468
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:30,918
Kill for him.
I'm the Slayer. Slayer means kill.

Oh, I'll kill the principal.

- Yeah, right.

Oh, man! Now I've gotta start all over.
Hecate hates that.

483
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:15,315
- What the hell are you doing?
- Proving I love RJ the most.

484
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:17,124
Will, honey.

485
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:21,036
- RJ's a guy.
- I did notice that, yeah.

486
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:25,517
That's why I'm doing my spell, cos
he doesn't have to be. Hand me my crystals.

487
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,836
- I don't have much time.
- Before what?

488
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:31,316
Before Buffy, Anya and Dawn
prove they love RJ the most.

489
00:35:31,406 --> 00:35:34,637
- How are they gonna do that?
- Buffy's gonna kill Principal Wood...

490
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:36,444
Fine, OK, let's start there.

491
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:05,478
Hey!

492
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:13,356
- What are you guys doing?
- Locator spell. Human variety. Almost done.

493
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:18,197
I've got a principal to kill.
What's going on? Who are we looking for?

494
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:20,277
<i>(train horn)</i>

495
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:33,804
You realise Anya's probably
seducing RJ as we speak?

496
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:36,241
- God. You think so?
- I wouldn't put it past her.

497
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:39,762
- She's recently evil, you know.
- So am I. Why should I miss out?

498
00:36:39,846 --> 00:36:42,155
Hey, crazy chicks, look.

499
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:43,918
Dawn?

500
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:45,678
- Dawn!
- Buffy!

501
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:48,234
<i>(train horn)</i>

502
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:26,836
- What were you doing? What is this?
- It doesn't matter.

503
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:30,316
This is a plan?
You're gonna steal RJ by being trisected?

504
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:32,397
What am I? Gonna compete with you?

505
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:36,161
You're older and hotter
and have sex that's rough and kill people.

506
00:37:36,246 --> 00:37:40,444
I don't have any of that stuff.
But if I did this, then his whole life he'd know

507
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:43,916
there was someone that loved him
so much they'd give up their life.

508
00:37:44,006 --> 00:37:45,439
Dawn...

509
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:49,437
And it would be true, forever.

510
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:52,440
No guy is worth your life. Not ever.

511
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:56,754
RJ is. And don't say he isn't.
Look what you were willing to do.

512
00:37:57,126 --> 00:38:00,482
Dawn, I would give him to you
in a second if I could.

513
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:03,319
That's how much you're scaring me.

514
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:08,359
But I thought you wanted him... for you.

515
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:11,318
Nah.

516
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:14,317
Well, yeah.

517
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:17,754
My God, that boy is hot.

518
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:20,125
Sorry.

519
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:24,404
- I think I might be under a spell here.
- I hear ya.

520
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:38,561
- Now, you're sure you understand the plan?
- I think I got it, yeah.

521
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:42,637
Hey! Ow!

522
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:51,041
That, my friends, is the smell
of sweet, sweet victory.

523
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:54,399
Also, burning cotton-poly blend.

524
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:59,924
Xander, be honest. You didn't think about
slipping that jacket on just a little bit?

525
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:03,801
I refuse to answer that
on the grounds that it didn't fit.

526
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:06,241
This tool gets his jacket
from his brother,

527
00:39:06,326 --> 00:39:10,285
who got it from their father, and we'll never
know where <i>he</i> got it. That bites.

528
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:13,676
Nah, welcome to the Hellmouth,
where even outerwear isn't safe.

529
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:16,758
- I can't believe I almost...
- I can't believe <i>I almost...

530
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:19,235
It was a spell. You were helpless.

531
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:23,205
We're not responsible for anything
we did morally or, you know, legally.

532
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:26,119
True. You fell
for a mystical, ancient curse.

533
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:30,161
Who hasn't made that mistake
seven, eight times?

534
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:36,439
You hear that? Not your fault.

535
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:41,516
I'm just so...

536
00:39:41,606 --> 00:39:43,722
The way I acted.

537
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:46,195
The way I talked to you.

538
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:49,084
I feel so stupid. All over a spell.

539
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:53,563
Get ready to feel even stupider
when it's not.

540
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:59,364
Hey, Anya, you never told us
what you can't believe you almost.

541
00:39:59,446 --> 00:40:01,402
Almost... Who, now?

542
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:05,957
No, you can't be the only
not-embarrassed one. What did you do?

543
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:12,083
I, uh... wrote a poem.
An epic poem.

544
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:15,283
Comparing him to a daisy
and a tower and a lake.

545
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:18,995
<i>(radio) The latest on Sunnydale's</i>
<i>late-night bandit who is still at large.</i>

546
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,361
<i>A masked thief held up a number...</i>

547
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:24,244
OK, great. Ice cream. My treat.

548
