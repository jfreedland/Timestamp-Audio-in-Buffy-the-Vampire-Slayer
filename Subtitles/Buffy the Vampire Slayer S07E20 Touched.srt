<i>Previously on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'':</i>

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:07,443
- Got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?
- Hello, Faith.

3
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:11,765
You got a rough sitch here, trying to turn
a bunch of little girls into an army.

4
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:15,050
They're potential slayers, just like we were.

5
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,168
Call me Caleb.

6
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:19,962
- l heard you have something of mine.
- l do now.

7
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:25,452
No!

8
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,603
l work in mysterious ways.

9
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:32,411
- Argh!
- Xander!

10
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:33,721
lt's not a happy scenario,

11
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:36,805
but we're dealing with the Big Bad
that can be any dead person it wants.

12
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:40,283
- At long last.
- The Slayer.

13
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,127
We've spent all this time worrying
about the seal and the Hellmouth.

14
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:46,443
The bad guys always go where the power is.

15
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,649
They're protecting something at the vineyard.

16
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,689
lt's time we go in and take it away from them.

17
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:54,288
- How about... we don't?
- This is a hell of a lot to ask.

18
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:57,012
And now suddenly
you're all acting like you can't trust me?

19
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:00,722
We have to be together on this.
You can't be a part of it.

20
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:02,007
So l need you to leave.

21
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:04,004
- l swear l didn't want it to go...
- Don't.

22
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:07,881
Whether you wanted it or not,
their lives are yours.

23
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:12,085
Power to the people?
You sound like a child of the seventies.

24
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,289
We're saying we're in charge of ourselves.

25
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:18,286
- OK, let's try not to freak out.
- Now Buffy's not here,

26
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,648
we have a say in how and when
we lose our necks.

27
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:24,328
Maybe you don't have to be so blunt
about the losing of the necks bit.

28
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:27,132
Let the girl speak the truth.
We're all on death's door,

29
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:30,285
ringing the doorbell like
girl scouts trying to make quota.

30
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:33,046
Maybe everyone here shouldn't have a say.

31
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:37,251
We need a way of having
constructive dialogue without going mad.

32
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:41,246
Do you know the parliamentary procedure?
That's a convenient way of...

33
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,166
- l wonder if...
- We should get into smaller groups,

34
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:47,086
so it wouldn't be so chaotic.
Faith, what do you think?

35
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:51,849
When l was involved with the Model UN,
the parliamentary procedure was a lifesaver.

36
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:55,369
She's gonna be fine.
Really, it's for the best.

37
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:58,206
Yeah? Then why do l feel like this?

38
00:01:58,293 --> 00:02:01,490
We had a system to allow us
to organise our conversation.

39
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:04,610
- l hear you, but...
- Shouldn't we get to business?

40
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:07,730
We're wasting time
arguing about how to argue.

41
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:10,373
- Why don't we...?
- Do not mention parliament.

42
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:13,843
- l second that.
- Everyone, listen to me. Chill.

43
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,767
All right? lt's been a long night,
and l don't know about you, but l'm wiped.

44
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,526
We should sleep and
figure it out in the morning.

45
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:24,572
- Do we have time to waste?
- l understand you guys are wicked stressed.

46
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:27,008
Frankly, our situation blows.

47
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:30,165
We've gotta stay cool.
lt's the only way to get through this.

48
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:32,687
- Can everyone handle that?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:36,686
We'll get some rest and then
tomorrow things won't seem so...

50
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:39,404
- What happened?
- The lights went out?

51
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,769
- <i>(Amanda)</i> l'll get some candles.
- <i>(Kennedy)</i> l'll check the fuse box.

52
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:45,492
Don't bother.
All the lights on the street went out.

53
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:46,608
Which means?

54
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:49,924
The people from the power company
have got the hell out of Sunnydale.

55
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:53,892
- l think l'm freaking out.
- Someone get a flashlight.

57
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:22,890
Don't move.

58
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,851
- Get out of my house.
- Hey.

59
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:30,562
l thought the place'd be empty.
l was looking for a place to crash.

60
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:32,325
You really should leave.

61
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,291
You can'tjust kick me out of my own house.

62
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:39,651
Why not? lt's what
all the cool kids are doing nowadays.

63
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,248
lt's not your house.

64
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:46,044
lt's not your town.

65
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,884
Not any more.

66
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,005
Got any Tab?

67
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:00,684
<i>(deep sigh)</i>

68
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:05,685
l spy with my little eye
something that begins with a T.

69
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,968
- Tapestry.
- Good one. How did you...?

70
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:10,965
Tapestry's the only thing
in the whole bloody room.

71
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:14,489
So say you, but l say look deeper.

72
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:16,450
l'll look deep into yourjugular.

73
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,172
- Don't spazz out.
- l'm not...

74
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:23,012
Don't say another word.

75
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,772
Rock, paper, scissors?

76
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:33,846
What's the matter with you?
Don't you understand what's happening?

77
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:38,961
Yeah. We're waiting till it's night so you can
ride on your motorcycle without exploding.

78
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:42,045
While we're stuck here,
the Slayer's facing hell knows what.

79
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,647
What's the worst thing
that could happen to her?

80
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:46,492
<i>(growls)</i>

81
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,330
All right. So, what do we know?

82
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:53,644
We know we're basically
the last humans left in Sunnydale.

83
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,849
And all the evil in town wants us dead.

84
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,844
- l don't wanna die.
- Don't worry.

85
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:02,006
lt's more likely you'll live long enough
to watch most of your friends die first.

86
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:03,970
- And then you'll die.
- We also know

87
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:07,966
Caleb told Buffy everything's going down
at the seal. We should head...

88
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:10,089
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

89
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:12,926
We know we've got a lot of enemies.
We'll start there.

90
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:15,049
- l'm sorry...
- l got this, OK?

91
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:18,732
Let's go over our rogues' gallery.
Who do we have here?

92
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,566
Well, there's the First, who we can't touch.

93
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:23,962
There's our friend
the Reverend l Hate Women.

94
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:26,772
- Who's untouchable.
- There's the ''roid-rage'' vamps,

95
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,048
who are pretty much the worst. And the...

96
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:33,445
- Bringers. They're our weakest link.
- Are you thinking of attacking the Bringers?

97
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:38,049
- Maybe, or... OK, we could kidnap one.
- And what? Hold it ransom?

98
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,488
l'll start ripping letters from magazines.

99
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:43,326
''Dear Mr First,
if you want your Bringer back...

100
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:46,485
we'll be surprised because
you got three million of them.''

101
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,848
''So please disregard this letter.''

102
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,447
l say we get us a Bringer and make it talk.

103
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:55,572
- Find out about the First and Caleb that way.
- How do we catch one?

104
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:58,326
l'm not sure this is such a good idea.

105
00:06:58,413 --> 00:07:01,211
Why look for information
when we know about the seal?

106
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:03,488
Let's go to the high school, do some recon.

107
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:05,609
No.

108
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:08,287
Just like that?
You're not even listening.

109
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:11,206
Sweetie, you're pushing too hard.

110
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:14,126
l thought things would change,
but you keep shutting me down.

111
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:18,764
Things are different,
because now l'm your boss.

112
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:23,608
Look, you guys, l'm not Buffy.
l'm not the one who's been on your asses,

113
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,809
but l'm not one of you any more, either.

114
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:29,488
l'm your leader, which means
l go first, and l make the rules,

115
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:32,929
and the rest of you follow after me.
ls that clear?

116
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:37,564
So, Kennedy, back the hell off
and let me do my job, all right?

117
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:41,043
OK, let's get down to business.

118
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:46,362
l was hoping you'd bring me
some better news.

119
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:48,444
And l wish l had some.

120
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:54,811
ls this gonna do anything?
Or is all this just to make the Bringers sweat?

121
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:59,728
- Do the Bringers sweat?
- Actually, l think they pant, like dogs.

122
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,328
l don't know if this is gonna do any good,
but we have to try everything.

123
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:06,371
You realise what will happen
if the Slayer and her girls get it?

124
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,091
They won't.

125
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:10,812
That's right. They won't.

126
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:17,885
Because you're going to kill all of them
and everyone they know.

127
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:19,565
Hallelujah.

128
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:16,810
l've never been the bait before. That was...

129
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:19,361
- actually, kind of scary.
- We had your back.

130
00:09:19,453 --> 00:09:23,731
You did well. Your performance
as a disgruntled minion was spot on.

131
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,883
l'm Method.

132
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:28,931
Let's get this back to the Captain.

133
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,521
Oh, hey. So?

134
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:41,771
The Bringer's dumb.

135
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:43,969
You were expecting a Rhodes scholar?

136
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:47,090
- Dumb as in mute.
- Someone ripped out its tongue.

137
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:50,006
- Gross!
- Hey...

138
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,812
l've been reading this old Turkish spell book.

139
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:57,091
There's an old conjuration the ancient Turks
used to communicate with the dying.

140
00:09:57,173 --> 00:10:00,210
Oh, yeah. l think l've read a translation of it.

141
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:02,363
There's a translation of it?

142
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:04,886
l'm over it.

143
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:09,091
So the spell is used to communicate
with people who can't talk.

144
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:13,212
lf a person was dying,
this spell would let them say their goodbyes

145
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:16,968
or gripe about how
nobody came to visit them.

146
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,851
Would this help us with Mr No-Tongue?

147
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:24,245
Yeah, l think so. l just need
to get together a few ingredients.

148
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,609
All right, cool.
While Willow does that, the rest of us can...

149
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,729
<i>(Andrew)</i> We're back!

150
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,724
- <i>(Giles)</i> Spike.
- Hey.

151
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,373
Hi, everybody.
l missed you guys a lot.

152
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:38,207
Sorry it took so long
to get back from our mission,

153
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,204
but we had to wait out the sun.

154
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:43,126
Well, l think our mission went very well.

155
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:47,684
We rode on Spike's Hog,
which was very cool, and...

156
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:51,527
played some amusing games,
and - oh, we got some information.

157
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:55,572
You know what?
l really need to urinate.

158
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:01,531
He's a breath of fresh air, isn't he?
Thank God l don't breathe.

159
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:04,844
So, l think we got a lead.
Where's Buffy?

160
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:09,563
- Um... she's not here right now.
- When does she get back?

161
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:16,884
While you were gone,
we all got together and...

162
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:20,932
talked out some disagreements
that we were having.

163
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,006
And eventually, after much discussion,

164
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:28,722
Buffy decided that
it would be best for all of us if...

165
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:33,329
she took a little time off, a little breather.

166
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:37,004
Uh-huh. l see.

167
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:42,484
Been practising
that little speech long, have you?

168
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:47,931
So, Buffy took time off right in the middle
of the apocalypse, and it was her decision?

169
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:52,211
- Well, we all decided.
- Oh, yeah, <i>you</i> all decided.

170
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:59,161
You sad, sad, ungrateful traitors.

171
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:02,131
- Who do you think you are?
- We're her friends. We just...

172
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:05,569
That's ballsy. You're her friends,
and you betray her like this?

173
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:10,249
- You don't understand.
- You know, l think l do, Rupert.

174
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:15,531
You used to be the big man, didn't you?
The teacher, all full of wisdom.

175
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:19,204
Now she's surpassed you,
and you can't handle it.

176
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:23,172
She has saved your lives again and again.

177
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:25,767
She has died for you.
And this is how you thank...

178
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:28,890
Hey. Why don't you
take it down a notch or two?

179
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:34,172
- The time for speech-giving is over, Bad Boy.
- Oh, is that right?

180
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:38,804
- Yeah, that's right. Save your lack of breath.
- All right.

181
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:45,366
You're pretty sweet on her, aren't you?

182
00:12:45,453 --> 00:12:47,762
l think it's cute.

183
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:52,128
- The way she's got you whipped.
- <i>(Giles)</i> Enough!

184
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,283
Finally got what you wanted, didn't you?

185
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:06,770
- Where is she?
- l don't know.

186
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:35,807
<i>(Willow recites in Latin)</i>

187
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:41,166
Speak to us.

188
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:46,851
- Maybe l should rough him up a little.
- Be quiet!

189
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:49,606
l don't know, guys.
That should have worked.

190
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:53,402
- l am a drone in the mind that is evil.
- Could you just shut up?

191
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:56,963
- l say l'm part of the great darkness.
- Somebody needs a reality check.

192
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,044
- Or a muzzle.
- Wait.

193
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:04,445
l'm only a fragment of the We.
We work as one to serve the First.

194
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:09,922
OK, what do you - the We - do for the First?

195
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:15,410
We work to prepare for the inevitable battle.

196
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:18,610
How? Tell me exactly
what the Bringers are doing.

197
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:22,971
- Kennedy, he can't see the knife.
- We can feel the knife.

198
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:25,924
Kennedy?

199
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:30,162
We attend to the needs of the infinite evil.

200
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:34,769
We exterminate girls
and destroy the legacy of the Slayer.

201
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:40,007
We build an arsenal beneath the dirt.
We obey the commands of our teacher Caleb.

202
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:42,971
Wait. Could we go back to the dirt thing?

203
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:46,443
We build weapons
to prepare for the coming war

204
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,649
at the farthest edge of town.

205
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:52,248
We are everywhere.
We are like the ocean's waves.

206
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:58,242
We watch your efforts and are not scared.
We will laugh at you as you die.

207
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:02,403
What the bananas?

208
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:06,168
You are so lucky that you did not
just magically decapitate me.

209
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,767
We've got enough here.
We need Faith in on this.

210
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:13,165
Gather maps. We need to find a subterranean
space large enough to house an armoury.

211
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:17,769
l feel used and violated,
and l need a lozenge.

212
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,444
<i>(knocking)</i>

213
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:33,288
There you are.

214
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:37,366
Do you realise l could just walk in here,
no invite needed?

215
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,843
This town really is theirs now, innit?

216
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:45,290
l heard. l was over there. That bitch.

217
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:49,251
She's all smiles and reformation
when you're on your feet,

218
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:53,121
but the moment you're down,
she's all about the kicking, isn't that right?

219
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:56,250
- Makes me want...
- lt wasn'tjust Faith.

220
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,528
lt was all of them.

221
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:02,850
And it's not like they were wrong.

222
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:05,923
Please leave.

223
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:11,133
No. This'll change your tune.
l came here cos l got something to tell you.

224
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:15,411
You were right. Caleb <i>is</i> trying
to protect something from you.

225
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:20,772
And l think you were spot on all the way.
l think it's at the vineyard.

226
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:23,208
So? You were right.

227
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:29,604
- Buffy?
- l don't feel very right.

228
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,564
You're not fooling me.

229
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,570
- What do you even mean?
- You're not a quitter.

230
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:43,650
- Watch me.
- You were their leader, and you still are.

231
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:49,409
This isn't something you gave up,
it's something they took.

232
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:51,723
And the difference is?

233
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,769
We can take it back.

234
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:57,967
Sewer tunnel on the north side's closest,
so guess we'll start there.

235
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:01,363
Sounds fine. What time shall l tell everyone?

236
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,171
How about around seven?

237
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:06,371
Seven sharp.

238
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:11,166
- So, tomorrow we fight.
- Tomorrow.

239
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:12,766
Good night, Faith.

240
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:15,492
- Faith.
- Yeah?

241
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:18,167
You're doing just fine.

242
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:26,245
l'd say better than fine.
l'd say you're doing a bang-up job.

243
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,167
- Get out.
- Well, well! Gosh!

244
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:34,212
l think a ''hello'' or a ''nice to see you''
might be a little more welcome.

245
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:37,524
lt's the end of humanity, Faith,
not the end of courtesy.

246
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:41,208
You're wasting your time.
l know who you are, what you are.

247
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,569
Nobody's explained to you
how this works, have they?

248
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:52,287
You see, l am part of the First, as you kids
call it, but l'm also me, Richard Wilkins lll,

249
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:56,127
late mayor and founder of Sunnydale.
Here. l'll prove it to you.

250
00:17:56,213 --> 00:18:00,092
Ask me a question only l know the answer to.
Something like:

251
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:03,006
Where did l hide the MoonPies in my office?

252
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:08,167
Or who was my favourite character
in <i>Little Women?</i>

253
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,369
Meg.

254
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:12,762
l know, l know! Most people guess Beth,

255
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:16,243
but Meg is such a proper young lady.
Remember when Jo burned her hair?

256
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,164
l know what you're doing.
lt won't work.

257
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:21,290
But keep talking
cos l could listen to you yap all night.

258
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:24,570
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Language!
You're a leader now.

259
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:28,965
Keep throwing the ''h-e-double hockey sticks''
around, the girls will pick up on it.

260
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:31,647
- Let me worry about the girls.
- Of course.

261
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,293
You're doing a greatjob.
Much better than Buffy.

262
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:37,524
- You were smart to kick her out.
- That's not what we...

263
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:40,525
- Buffy got 'em this far.
- Why are you protecting her?

264
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:43,605
You think she cares about you?
She nearly killed you, Faith.

265
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:46,048
lt's different now.

266
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:52,803
No matter what you do, Buffy will
always see you as a killer, not as a person.

267
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:57,364
And now you have what she so
desperately wants: the respect of these girls.

268
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:03,210
All she needs is an excuse to finish what
she started when she stuck that knife in you.

269
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:06,444
You stay on guard, Faith.
Buffy's dangerous.

270
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,605
lf you're not careful... she'll destroy you.

271
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:13,848
l'm just sayin'.

272
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:23,167
- <i>(Spike)</i> No?
- No.

273
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:27,041
- You mean ''no'' as in ''eventually''?
- You really have problems with that word.

274
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,249
You can get them back.

275
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,643
Can, maybe. Should?

276
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,727
l'm just so tired.

277
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:38,804
They need you.

278
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:44,610
- Well, l...
- lt's bloody chaos over there without you.

279
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:48,411
- lt is?
- Yeah! Yeah. lt's...

280
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,491
There's junk.

281
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:57,409
Food cartons, sleeping bags not rolled up,
everyone's very scared and... unkempt.

282
00:19:57,493 --> 00:20:00,485
- Sounds dire.
- l didn't see a lot.

283
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:06,011
l came, hit Faith a bunch of times, and left.

284
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:08,653
Really? l mean, not that l'm glad, but...

285
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,247
You say the word
and she's a footnote in history.

286
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,972
l'll make it look like a painful accident.

287
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,613
That's my problem.

288
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:20,049
l say the word, some girl dies.

289
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,203
Every time.

290
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:28,208
- There's always casualties in war.
- Casualties.

291
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:32,290
ltjust sounds so... casual.

292
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:38,088
These are girls that l got killed.

293
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:42,842
l cut myself off from them. All of them.

294
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:48,926
l knew l was gonna
lose some of them and l didn't...

295
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:53,965
You know what?
l'm still making excuses.

296
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:57,648
l've always cut myself off. l've always...

297
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:02,885
Being the Slayer made me different.

298
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:08,128
But it's my fault l stayed that way.

299
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:13,092
People are always trying to connect to me,

300
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:16,370
and l just... slip away.

301
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:20,170
You should know.

302
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:23,768
l seem to recall
a certain amount of connecting.

303
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:26,765
Please! We were never close.

304
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:31,051
You just wanted me
because l was... unattainable.

305
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:34,045
- You think that's all that was?
- Let's not go over the past.

306
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,886
Oh, no, no. Oh, let's hold on here.

307
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:40,522
l've hummed along to your pity-ditty.
l should have the mike for a bit.

308
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:45,482
Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.

309
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:49,809
- You're insufferable.
- Thank you. That really helped.

310
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,202
- l'm not trying to cheer you up.
- What, then?

311
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:55,683
l don't know.
l'll know when l'm done saying it.

312
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:59,448
Something pissed me off, and l just...

313
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,967
- Unattainable, that's it.
- Fine.

314
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:08,410
l'm attainable. l'm an attain-a-thon.
May l please just go to sleep?

315
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,688
You listen to me.

316
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:17,887
l've been alive a bit longer than you,
and dead a lot longer than that.

317
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:24,970
l've seen things you couldn't imagine,
and done things l prefer you didn't.

318
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:29,771
l don't exactly have a reputation
for being a thinker.

319
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:35,883
l follow my blood, which doesn't
exactly rush in the direction of my brain.

320
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:40,524
So l make a lot of mistakes,
a lot of wrong bloody calls.

321
00:22:40,613 --> 00:22:46,404
100+ years... and there's
only one thing l've ever been sure of:

322
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:47,962
you.

323
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:58,172
Hey, look at me.
l'm not asking you for anything.

324
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:03,202
When l say l love you, it's not because
l want you or because l can't have you.

325
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:06,046
lt has nothing to do with me.

326
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:08,727
l love what you are,

327
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:11,088
what you do,

328
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,050
how you try.

329
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:17,252
l've seen your kindness and your strength.

330
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,291
l've seen the best and the worst of you.

331
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:25,766
And l understand with perfect clarity
exactly what you are.

332
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:27,844
You're a hell of a woman.

333
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:32,409
You're the one, Buffy.

334
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:36,327
l don't wanna be the one.

335
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:43,411
l don't wanna be this good-looking
and athletic. We all have crosses to bear.

336
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,049
You get some rest now.

337
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:53,846
l'll check in before first light.
You can decide how you want.

338
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,924
Spike?

339
00:23:57,573 --> 00:24:00,007
Could you... stay here?

340
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:02,246
Sure.

341
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:11,281
That diabolical old torture device,
the comfy chair. lt'll do me fine.

342
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:15,286
No. l mean... here.

343
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,563
Will you just hold me?

344
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:43,323
Deep down, you always wanted
Buffy to accept you.

345
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:46,564
- To love you even. Why do you think that is?
- You a shrink now?

346
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:51,488
You keep looking for love and acceptance
from these people, these ''friends'' of yours,

347
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:56,044
but you're never gonna find it.
The truth is, nobody will ever love you.

348
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,203
- Not the way l love you.
- Get out.

349
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:01,046
- They'll forever see you as a killer.
- l said get out.

350
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:06,332
l'll always be with you, firecracker,
in everything you do.

351
00:25:07,653 --> 00:25:08,722
<i>(Wood)</i> Faith?

352
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:11,122
You shouldn't sneak.
l almost took your head off!

353
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:14,250
- Sorry, l knocked.
- Who... what'd you see?

354
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,484
Just... You're looking spooked.
What happened?

355
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:21,361
- Are you sure you're all right?
- You wanna rap about my problems now?

356
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,411
Lookin' to be the guy
who puts the ''pal'' in principal?

357
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:28,008
You know what? l came up here
to talk to you about weapons.

358
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,687
Sorry. l don't know what l'm doing. l'm just...

359
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:34,129
Listen, l'm gonna leave you alone.
l didn't mean to intrude.

360
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:36,204
lt was the First.

361
00:25:48,493 --> 00:25:53,283
You're really in the game now. The First
won't show itself unless it thinks you matter.

362
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:56,206
Lucky me. l'm a player.

363
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,124
Look at that. My hand's shaking.

364
00:25:58,213 --> 00:26:02,286
Demons, vampires, women in prison -
none of that freaks me out.

365
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:05,763
That's exactly what the First does.
Finds your Achilles heel.

366
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:09,448
No, itjust talked to me.
What, it does a heal thing too?

367
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:13,845
lt's a phrase. Your weak spot.

368
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:18,563
Oh, school thing.
l was kinda absent that decade.

369
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:25,682
So, who was it? The First.

370
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:29,446
He was like an old boss of mine.

371
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:34,241
Just a boss,
and he's got you shaking like this?

372
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:38,292
- Wouldn't give you a raise, huh?
- Yeah, right.

373
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:42,889
lt sounds retarded,
but he was like a dad to me.

374
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:44,770
Oh.

375
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:49,403
lt was my mother when it came to me.

376
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:53,850
And l mean it was her,
right down to the perfume.

377
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:56,527
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

378
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:00,772
l'm so pissed off at myself.
l knew it was a trick.

379
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:05,449
So did l, but l still wanted
my mother to hold me like a little baby.

380
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:09,208
- ln a manly way, of course.
- Of course.

381
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:13,772
Listen, nobody wants to be alone, Faith.

382
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:17,448
We all want someone who cares,
to be touched that way.

383
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:23,210
l mean, the First deals in figments,
but that wanting is real.

384
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:27,571
Hitting things
and a whole lot of Jack D dulls it some.

385
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:29,962
Among other things.

386
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:35,046
When it came to you,
did the First tell the truth?

387
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,248
Yeah.

388
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,211
lt said to watch out for Buffy,
that she's dangerous.

389
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:41,887
- And what do you think?
- Could be.

390
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:46,012
We've given her
pretty good reason to be pissed off.

391
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:47,811
You know the messed-up thing?

392
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:51,124
The First says to worry about her,
and l just wish she was here.

393
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:54,808
l'm gonna lead these girls into serious crap,
and she's the only one...

394
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:59,728
She's not the only one.
You're a slayer too, Faith.

395
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:01,804
And l think you're a good leader.

396
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:04,043
l'm an ex-con who didn't finish high school.

397
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,364
Well, l'm the principal of
a school where nobody finished.

398
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:12,925
- l am completely out of my league in this.
- l hear otherwise.

399
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:17,810
So...

400
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:22,890
- Tomorrow, then?
- Forget about tomorrow.

401
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:24,964
This is tonight.

402
00:28:27,453 --> 00:28:31,446
lt's been a while. Am l out of line?

403
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,284
Hey, you're the leader.

404
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:55,292
OK, guys. Giles said Faith wants us
to start early in the morning, so...

405
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:57,568
What happened to the girls?

406
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,848
Looks like there's only one girl here.

407
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:05,371
What about the other ones with their sleeping
bags and their headgear and their snoring?

408
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:08,525
- They're not here, are they?
- Nope.

409
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:15,044
- That's nice.
- Mm.

410
00:29:16,013 --> 00:29:17,002
Nice...

411
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:20,724
and necessary.

412
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:25,644
Come here, you.

413
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:38,849
Foreplay was threatening
to turn into twelve-play.

414
00:29:46,373 --> 00:29:48,364
Something not right?

415
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,204
No.

416
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:53,284
No, l just...

417
00:29:55,013 --> 00:30:00,212
- l guess l'm a little scared.
- lt's probably stupid to ask why, huh?

418
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:03,091
- Death, war, apocalypse.
- Me.

419
00:30:07,213 --> 00:30:10,011
l'm just scared that if we...

420
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:12,607
And then l'll...

421
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:14,843
- And then...
- And then?

422
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:18,248
lsn't that the good part?

423
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,890
Good. Yeah, good feeling.

424
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:27,450
- But also...
- Bad stuff, like,

425
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:31,970
unrestrained moaning
and screaming with joy?

426
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:39,205
Sort of. The unrestrained part.

427
00:30:39,293 --> 00:30:45,766
But l've just... l've kind of been
in a space where l... should be restrained.

428
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:48,765
l've been controlling myself and l...

429
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:55,850
lf l lose that control,
let myself go, l could just go.

430
00:30:57,893 --> 00:31:01,568
You worried
you're gonna turn into Big Bad Willow?

431
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:05,771
lt's not stupid. When we first kissed, l...

432
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:09,765
l turned into... Warren.

433
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:14,207
lt's not stupid, but it's not gonna happen.

434
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:18,925
l just want you to know
that you're safe with me.

435
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:20,287
Yeah?

436
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:24,969
You can float around and l'll tether you down.

437
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:29,046
- You'll be like... my kite string?
- Mm-hm.

438
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:35,525
You'll be a kite,
and l'll be your kite string, OK?

439
00:31:36,693 --> 00:31:38,684
- OK.
- OK.

440
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,924
Mmm... come here.

441
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:48,962
- <i>(moaning)</i>
- They could show a little respect, you know.

442
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:52,887
l mean, they should at least
acknowledge the fact that some people

443
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:59,526
might not wanna listen to an a cappella
concert of people, moaning and groaning.

444
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:03,731
- Disgusting is what it is.
- A little jealous, huh?

445
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:08,409
Of course. l'm a lotjealous.
l mean, if we're done having sex, then...

446
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:13,570
l think other people should just knock it off.

447
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,126
<i>(# ''Only Love'' by Heather Nova)</i>

448
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:25,131
<i>(The First) l envy them.</i>

449
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:30,130
lsn't that the strangest thing?

450
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:34,604
Well, it does throw me a tad.
l mean, they're just...

451
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:37,048
Why, they're barely more than animals.

452
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:40,364
Feeding off each other's flesh.
lt's nauseating.

453
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,250
But you?

454
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:45,442
You're everywhere.

455
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:49,082
You're in the hearts of little children.

456
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:52,561
You're in the souls of the rich.

457
00:33:52,653 --> 00:33:56,487
You're the fire
that makes people kill and hate.

458
00:33:56,573 --> 00:33:59,371
The fire that will cure the world of weakness.

459
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,648
They're just sinners.

460
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:03,724
You are sin.

461
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:09,251
- l do enjoy your sermons.
- And you're in me.

462
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:12,204
Gave me strength no man can have.

463
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:16,172
You're the only man
strong enough to be my vessel.

464
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:19,086
And l know you feel me, but...

465
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:22,966
l know why they grab at each other.

466
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:24,611
To feel.

467
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:28,364
l wanna feel.

468
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:34,691
l wanna wrap my hands around
some innocent neck and feel it crack.

469
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,491
Amen.

470
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:03,011
So, it turned out that all these stone tablets
basically said the same thing.

471
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:07,405
The First and Caleb are protecting something,
and we don't know exactly what it is,

472
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:11,645
but it's something powerful,
and they don't want the slayers to get it.

473
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:15,806
l'm thinking it could be a weapon,
and if we're looking for an arsenal...

474
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:18,248
You're not coming.

475
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:22,087
lf one is looking for an arsenal,
what better place to find a...

476
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:23,447
Weapon.

477
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:29,165
- OK. Got it. Good thinking, Andrew.
- lt's a pleasure, Faith. Back to you.

478
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:32,890
OK, l need you four
to suss out the situation on B.

479
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:35,248
Don't talk to her or get in her way.

480
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,484
Or let her know you're there.
Just do a little recon.

481
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:42,486
- Where do you want me?
- By your phone. l'll call you when l need you.

482
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:46,646
What are we looking for?
ls there a reason to spy on Buffy?

483
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,201
We're just making sure she's OK.

484
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:52,649
Those of you coming with me to the arsenal,
you know who you are.

485
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,203
Everybody ready?
Let's do this thing.

486
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:15,049
Shouldn't be long now.

487
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:18,125
Prophecies say one thing.
Brute strength says another.

488
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:21,091
- We'll get it out.
- l heard you, Caleb.

489
00:36:21,653 --> 00:36:25,771
- We're almost there.
- Yes, that's true. Now rouse the Bringers.

490
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:28,242
- Get them back to work.

<i>(Buffy)</i> Hey!

492
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:34,011
Heard you got something of mine.

493
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:41,083
Well, if it ain't the prodigal Slayer?

494
00:36:42,653 --> 00:36:45,292
Where's it at?
l'm gonna find it sooner or later.

495
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:50,367
No, you're not. l lay one hand on you,
and you're just a dead little girl.

496
00:36:50,453 --> 00:36:53,445
Lay a hand on me... if you can.

497
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:15,365
- This is embarrassing.
- Do you have to look like that?

498
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:18,445
- Will you concentrate?
- lt's just a little confusing.

499
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:20,842
Fine. Go. Kill.

500
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:38,204
Everybody stop.

501
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:40,409
l think we just found it.

502
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,251
- Look at all this.
- l don't get it.

503
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:48,564
Why'd they abandon all this stuff?

504
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:51,247
Maybe cos they didn't.

505
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,163
Aaaargh!

506
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:55,404
You whore!

507
00:38:56,373 --> 00:38:58,489
You really should watch your language.

508
00:38:58,573 --> 00:39:03,567
lf someone didn't know you, they might
think you were a woman-hating jerk.

509
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:19,652
ls that it? Not that that wasn't fun, but...

510
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:23,043
<i>(Kennedy)</i> Yo, Faith. Check this out.

511
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:23,522
Everybody get down!
