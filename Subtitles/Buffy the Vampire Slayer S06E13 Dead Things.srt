1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,593
- Previously:
- We screwed it up.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,838
She's just disoriented from being
tormented in some hell dimension.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,678
That the kinda demon you are?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,712
I don't know why you can hit me,
but I'm not a demon.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,879
So, you three have, what?
Banded together to be pains in my ass?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,797
We're your arch Nemesises.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,673
- Dawn, you need to eat.
- Thanks for your concern.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,360
Why is she taking it out on you?

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,756
- This isn't gonna work.
- Are you gonna leave me?

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,714
- Willow has a problem.
- No more spells. I'm finished.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,400
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,839
Afraid I'm gonna...?

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,635
- Things have changed.
- I'm disgusted with myself.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,240
We missed the bed again.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,715
Lucky for the bed.

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,036
Is this a new rug?

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,913
No. Just looks different
when you're under it.

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,517
You know, this place is OK
for a hole in the ground. You fixed it up.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,915
Well, I ate a decorator once.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,395
Maybe something stuck.

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,557
- I've been thinking of changing my room.
- Yeah?

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,912
Yeah. I think the New Kids on the Block
posters are starting to date me.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,395
Well, if you want, I can...

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,670
Are we having a conversation?

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,916
What? No.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,629
No.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,071
Maybe.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,755
What?

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,961
Isn't this usually the part where you
kick me in the head and run out,...

31
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:04,557
virtue fluttering?

32
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:08,519
That's the plan.
Soon as my legs start working.

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,475
You were amazing.

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,069
You got the job done yourself.

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,839
I was just trying to keep up.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,758
The things you do.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,749
The way you make it hurt in all the wrong
places. I've never been with such an animal.

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,429
I'm not an animal.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,791
You wanna see the bite marks?

40
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,879
You know, it's late. I should
get home before Dawn goes to sleep.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,753
- And she's off.
- Have you seen my underwear?

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,317
What is this to you, this thing we have?

43
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,433
What? We don't have a thing.
We have this.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,312
That's all.

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,555
Do you even like me?

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,635
Sometimes.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,629
But you like what I do to you.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,549
Do you trust me?

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,836
Never.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,712
How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,718
Actually living with supervillains
was not in the deal.

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,400
We're on the lam.
It's not like we have a choice.

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,910
This sucks. Couldn't we have
at least gotten a lair with a view?

54
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,237
Stop whining.
Get your sissy crap out of the way.

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,954
Quit it. Don't you curse me.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,753
Give me my bone.

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,995
When you girls are done,
the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,758
Cool.

59
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,755
Got the thing?

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,236
Musk gland of a Hombja'moleev demon.

61
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,112
Fresh.

62
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,951
All right. Stand back.

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,392
Gentlemen,
the cerebral dampener is on line.

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,194
Now, with this baby, we can make
any woman we desire our willing sex slave.

65
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,035
I know just where to start.

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,837
- Doublemeat is double sweet. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

67
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,158
- Just something I'm tryin'.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

68
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,315
Time has no meaning here.
Gina, I'm takin' a break.

69
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,039
I have this sudden urge
to dedicate my productive cooperation.

70
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,188
If you close your eyes and smash yourself
in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away.

71
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,279
Eventually.

72
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,075
I'm hoping.

73
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,714
Thanks for coming by.

74
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,796
Is it bad?

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,275
I was sort of hoping you could tell me.

76
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,679
I knew this was gonna happen. What did
Willow do now? Did she hurt anyone?

77
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,036
What? No, no. Tara, this isn't about Willow.

78
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,115
I thought that's why
you didn't want to meet at the house.

79
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,117
Sorry. It's...

80
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,710
Willow's fine. She's been doing really well.

81
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,635
You'd be proud of her.

82
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,716
Good. That's good.

83
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,034
So what do you want to talk about?

84
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,756
It's Spike.

85
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,790
He can hurt me...

86
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,755
without his head exploding.

87
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,394
Oh, my God. His chip stopped working?

88
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,478
No. It still works.

89
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,477
Just not on me.

90
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,718
I need to know about the spell,
the one that brought me back.

91
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,119
I'd ask Willow, but...

92
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,231
You think it's you.

93
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,595
I don't know.

94
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,154
I feel different.

95
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,995
There are things that...

96
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,509
I think maybe I came back wrong.

97
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,473
No, Buffy. That's not...

98
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,556
No. You didn't.

99
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,750
Can you check out the spell?
Just see if there's something that...

100
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,314
Could you just check? Please?

101
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,395
Right there. That's got it.
Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.

102
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,988
I thought I was Mad Dog Two.

103
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,031
Mad Dog Three to Mad Dog One.

104
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,474
- Signal's strong and clear. Over.
- Roger that. Beginning preliminary sweep.

105
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,992
Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer.
I don't want any surprises.

106
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,588
We can really have anyone we want.

107
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,951
- It's like candy.
- Juicy, pulsating candy.

108
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,555
- The one with the neck. Put it on her.
- No. I want the redhead.

109
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,956
The redhead's too tall.

110
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,595
- Get off of me. Jerk.
- Take it back.

111
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,676
- Target acquired.
- What?

112
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,677
Initiating contact.

113
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,110
- The brunette?
- She's kinda cute.

114
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,629
- No, go for the leather skirt.
- Bazoombas.

115
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,558
- Yeah. Go for the one with the bazoombas.
- Bazoombas.

116
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,079
Bazoombas.

117
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,913
So how did you get so beautiful?

118
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,110
OK. Does that line usually wor...?

119
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,308
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's nice to see you, too, Katrina.

120
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,635
It's the seeing you that's throwing me.

121
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,036
I thought I was pretty clear
I never wanted that to happen again.

122
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,391
- Never's a long time, baby.
- Apparently, not long enough.

123
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
You're not still sore
about that thing, are you?

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,719
What thing would that be, exactly?

125
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,035
The wind-up slut you tinkered together?

126
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,197
Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts
tried to choke me to death?

127
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,278
OK. So I've made a few mistakes.

128
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,630
No. No, I did.

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,753
For ever lowering myself
to be with a jerk like you.

130
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,952
- No. Don't say that.
- Well, what did you expect?

131
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,278
To just waltz in here and sweep me off my
feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?

132
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,269
No. I just thought we could talk.
I thought maybe we could work things out.

133
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,436
There is nothing to work out.
What you did was sick.

134
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,790
Just looking at you makes me want to vomit.

135
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,878
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes. God! Yes, I'm sure.

136
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,871
I love you, Master.

137
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,355
I love you, too, baby.

138
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,716
I'm home. Who wants to help
scrape the grease off my...

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,356
- Is there singing? Are we singing again?
- No. Just the dancin'.

140
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,712
We're teaching Dawn synchronised
dance steps for the wedding reception.

141
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,592
Wanna go for a spin?

142
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,678
I'm heading more towards
an ungainly collapse.

143
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,633
- Rough day?
- Kinda.

144
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,718
You've been goin' at it too hard.
We hardly ever see you.

145
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,957
What with slingin' the Doublemeat
and poundin' the big evil.

146
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,548
You are looking a little pounded.

147
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,315
Just around the eyes.

148
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,831
We're thinking of heading to the Bronze
later. Wanna come? Get all unwindy?

149
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,839
Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me.
Nectar of the working man.

150
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,994
No. I'll stay here with Dawn.

151
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,955
Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of
popcorn and... listen to the cars honk?

152
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,231
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping over at Janice's.

153
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,997
I'm falling for that again
because of the surprise lobotomy?

154
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,238
It's OK. I checked it out.
Janice's mom is picking her up.

155
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,033
I didn't think you'd care.
You're never home, so...

156
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,397
I know. I'm sorry.

157
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,516
But I'm here now,
all visible and everything.

158
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,599
- Can't you stay at Janice's another night?
- Her mom's cooking Mexican.

159
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,598
She's gonna teach me
how to make real tortillas.

160
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,674
Not like I knew you'd be around.

161
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,200
Frosty nectar. Now, please?

162
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,874
- Thank you, baby.
- My pleasure, Master.

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,956
That is so cool.

164
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,275
I could've used one of these in high school.

165
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,436
Gentlemen. To crime.

166
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,236
Crime.

167
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,395
- Crime tastes funny.
- Wow.

168
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,037
I still think I would have gone
with the bazoombas, but...

169
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,193
Wow.

170
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,550
Yeah, she's really cute.

171
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,313
Cute?

172
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,996
Look at her, men.

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,355
The shape of her lips.

174
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,839
The smooth, silky skin.

175
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,394
The way her nose crinkles when she laughs.

176
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,396
She's perfect.

177
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,679
- Yeah.
- She's totally hot.

178
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,360
So are you, Master.

179
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,199
- You think so?
- Yes, Master.

180
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,719
OK. So, how do we...?

181
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,157
- You know?
- Who gets to...?

182
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,635
- I do.
- That's not fair.

183
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,036
- Dude, you didn't call it.
- I don't have to call it. She's mine.

184
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,518
But don't worry.
You can play with her all you want.

185
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,756
After I'm done with her.

186
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,476
I missed you so much.
You never should have left me.

187
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,438
- Say it.
- I never should have left you, Master.

188
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,078
- Now tell me you love me.
- I love you, Master.

189
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,033
- Again.
- I love you, Master.

190
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,996
I love you, too, baby. Get on your knees.

191
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,436
Yes, Warren.

192
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,035
Wait. What'd you just say?

193
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,196
I said "Yes, Warr... "

194
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,158
What the...? What did you do to me?

195
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,677
- Get the dampener.
- Who the hell are you?

196
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,711
- Your masters.
- My what?

197
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,195
- Where'd you put it?
- Are you kidding me?

198
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,710
- Get the dampener.
- You were sharing me with these dorks?

199
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,957
We're supervillains. Call us "master".

200
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,479
Wait.

201
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,671
- Crap.
- It's out of juice.

202
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,999
Is that what you used on me? Oh, my God.
First the skankbot and now this?

203
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,793
- What is wrong with you?
- I wanted us to be together.

204
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,391
There is no us. Get that through your meaty
head. I am not your girlfriend any more.

205
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,159
- She's your ex?
- Dude, that is messed up.

206
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,795
You think? You bunch
of little boys playing at being men?

207
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,469
Well, this is not some fantasy.
It's not a game, you freaks.

208
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,393
It's rape.

209
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,080
- What?
- No, we didn't...

210
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,954
You're all sick. And I'm gonna
make sure you get locked up for this.

211
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,117
- Then we'll see how you like getting raped.
- Stop her.

212
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,955
Get off me.

213
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,956
Charge the cerebral dampener.

214
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,396
- Warren...
- Charge the dampener. Andrew, get her up.

215
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,078
We'll give her another dose. A stronger one.

216
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,115
Everything's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.

217
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,315
I don't think so.

218
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,516
She's dead.

219
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,957
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

220
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,991
Her neck, it just...

221
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,918
No, that's not...

222
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,879
- This isn't happening.
- I just... I gotta...

223
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,752
I gotta... Let me think.

224
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,836
What'd you do?

225
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,155
What the hell did you do?

226
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,599
We did this, me and Andrew and you.
It's on all of us.

227
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,314
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Shut up.

228
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,833
We have to get... We have to get rid of it.

229
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,352
How?

230
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,233
Maybe a spell.
Can you teleport it outta here?

231
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,636
No. She's...

232
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,675
It's too big.

233
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,869
Andrew?

234
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,236
- Andrew?
- What?

235
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,948
Is there anything that you can summon,

236
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,278
something that can devour that much?

237
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,869
Maybe a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater,
but they're hard to control.

238
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,432
It'd go for us, too.

239
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,038
Well, that's it, man. We're screwed.

240
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,230
- Stay calm.
- Tell that to your girlfriend.

241
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,909
- Ex-girlfriend.
- It doesn't matter. There's a link.

242
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,792
You knew her, so there's a link.

243
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,799
You don't think Buffy'll be able
to put that together? She'll figure it out.

244
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,992
It was an accident.
Maybe we could turn ourselves in.

245
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,951
- No.
- If we go to the police now...

246
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,390
- No. I'm not going to jail.
- We can't hide this.

247
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,353
Sooner or later,
the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead.

248
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,593
Well, then maybe it should be sooner.

249
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,788
- Are you insane?
- Listen.

250
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,512
- No.
- Listen.

251
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,350
We have two problems:
the body and the Slayer.

252
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,790
Well, what if there was a way that we could
take care of them both, with one big stone?

253
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,717
What are they doing?

254
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,080
We're not gonna have to
do that at the wedding?

255
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,398
Cos there's this last thread of dignity
I've been desperately clinging to.

256
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,670
You're still doing OK, right?

257
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,351
Yeah. You know, some days
are harder than the really hard days.

258
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,916
It's easier like this, though,
when I'm not alone.

259
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,036
- I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
- No, that's not...

260
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,152
It's OK. We know you've been all tied up.

261
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,431
- What?
- With your job and the slaying.

262
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,028
I see sitting where
there should be dancing.

263
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,029
- Come share in the joy of our groove thing.
- And despite that, I succumb to the beat.

264
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,075
- I think I'll catch the next soul train out.
- You sure?

265
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,591
Oh, yeah. You know, glass all the way empty.
More nectar required.

266
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,872
Cool. Well, shimmy on out
when you're done lubricatin'.

267
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,276
You see?

268
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,635
You try to be with them.

269
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,154
But you'll always end up in the dark.

270
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,996
With me.

271
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,918
What would they think of you if they
found out all the things you've done?

272
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,715
If they knew who you really were?

273
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,512
Don't.

274
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,392
Stop me.

275
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,594
No, don't close your eyes.

276
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,349
Look at them.

277
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,320
That's not your world.

278
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,795
You belong in the shadows.

279
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,356
With me.

280
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,238
Look at your friends, and tell me
you don't love getting away with this...

281
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,515
right under their noses.

282
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,511
I pulled a jive muscle last night.

283
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,074
The funky monkey claims another victim.

284
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,429
Tara. What are you doing here?

285
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,396
I mean, it's OK for you to be here if you
have things that you have to be here for.

286
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,353
Yeah. I'm gonna go bring Anya
up to speed on that monkey situation.

287
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,999
- There's a monkey problem?
- Only if you don't stretch first.

288
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,753
The Brekenkrieg Grimoire? Light reading?

289
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,516
Yeah. I was just...

290
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,192
No, it's OK. I didn't expect you
to stop doing magic just because...

291
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,874
You don't have to hide it. I'm not...

292
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,275
I'm doing better. No spells for 32 days.

293
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,398
I can even go to the magic shop now,
as long as someone's with me at all times.

294
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,154
But it's better now. It really is.

295
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,435
You know, if you were checking on me?

296
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,028
No, I wouldn't...

297
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,072
I was just looking for Buffy.

298
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,876
Well, I haven't seen her since last night.
She's not around much these days.

299
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,916
We kinda miss her.

300
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,474
I'm sure she feels the same way.

301
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,912
If you see her, can you tell her
that I need to talk to her? It's important.

302
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,793
- Yeah. Of course I will.
- Thanks.

303
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,630
Will?

304
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,116
I'm glad you're doing better.

305
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,793
Don't think about the evil, bloodsucking
fiend. Focus on anything but the evil fiend.

306
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,753
Thank you.

307
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,478
It's OK. I'm gonna get you out of here.

308
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,794
Can you walk? Are you hurt?

309
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,753
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?

310
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,798
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?

311
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,270
Bloody hell. What'd you do that for?

312
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,913
Spike?

313
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,278
Buffy.

314
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,116
Spike. What's happening?

315
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,471
So you thought you
could just slip away, then?

316
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,556
Vampire, remember?

317
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,309
I could feel you.

318
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,554
Bloody hell. What'd you do that for?

319
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,753
Buffy.

320
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,751
Buffy.

321
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,356
Do you mind?

322
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,669
Buffy?

323
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,119
She's dead.

324
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,196
I killed her.

325
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,156
We have to go.

326
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,872
What happened?

327
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,516
There's nothing you can do.
We have to go before someone sees you.

328
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,074
What did I do?

329
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,191
We have to go, now.

330
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,353
All right. Listen to me. Buffy. Buffy.

331
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,835
- She's dead.
- It was an accident.

332
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,156
But I killed her.

333
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,271
- I'm gonna get you home.
- No.

334
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,269
I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna
crawl in your warm bed and stay there.

335
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,233
I'm gonna sort this out. Trust me.

336
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,755
Two problems, one stone.

337
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,119
Nice job. She totally bought it.

338
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,158
Yeah.

339
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,716
Some of my best work.

340
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,154
What happens now?

341
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,955
The night's young.
Gotta be some more girls we could kill.

342
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,674
We stick to the plan.

343
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,236
Buffy thinks she killed Katrina.
It's her problem now.

344
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,109
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?

345
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,755
It's all right, love.

346
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,717
All right. It'll be our little secret.

347
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,788
Do you trust me?

348
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,112
Hey.

349
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,870
What time is it?

350
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,956
It's late.

351
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,036
I just wanna...

352
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,316
I love you.

353
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,469
You know that, right?

354
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,835
What's wrong?

355
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,874
I know I haven't been
everything I should be.

356
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,595
Everything Mom was.

357
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,076
But I love you. I always will.

358
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,715
Why are you talking like this?

359
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,556
Buffy?

360
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,514
There was an accident, in the woods.

361
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,949
A girl, she was hurt.

362
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,516
I hurt someone.

363
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,518
Oh, my God.

364
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,392
Is she all right?

365
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,794
No.

366
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,916
I'm sorry.

367
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,154
There's something I have to do.

368
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,189
I have to tell what I did.

369
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,595
I have to go to the police.

370
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,351
The police?

371
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,948
Dawnie, I have to.

372
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,512
But...

373
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,715
What's going to happen?

374
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,436
I don't know.

375
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,193
They'll take you away, won't they?

376
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,197
I'm sorry.

377
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,914
No, you're not.

378
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,554
You're never here.

379
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,955
You can't even stand to be around me.

380
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,117
- That's not true.
- You don't wanna be here with me.

381
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,470
You didn't wanna come back. I know that.

382
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,509
You were happier where you were.
You wanna go away again.

383
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,909
Dawn...

384
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,396
Then go. You're not really here anyway.

385
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,237
- What do you think you're doing?
- The right thing. For once.

386
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,558
Sorry, love. Can't let you do that.

387
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,434
- I have to tell them what happened.
- Nothing happened.

388
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,755
I killed that girl.

389
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,475
Demons in the woods?
Time going wonky? They won't believe you.

390
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,558
- I'll show them.
- Show them what?

391
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,997
- What did you do?
- I took care of it.

392
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,793
- What did you do?
- What I had to.

393
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,357
I went back and I took care of it. It
doesn't matter now. No one'll ever find her.

394
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,518
- Where'd they find her?
- The river, half a mile from the cemetery.

395
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,271
Balls.

396
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,392
- There is nothing to connect this to you.
- It doesn't matter.

397
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,034
- It wasn't your fault.
- I killed her.

398
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,392
- It was an accident. It just happened.
- Nothing just happens.

399
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,430
You are not going in there.

400
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,358
I have to do this. Just let me go.

401
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,392
I can't. I love you.

402
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,638
No, you don't.

403
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,796
You think I haven't tried not to?

404
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,112
Try harder.

405
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,589
You are not throwing your life away
over this.

406
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,996
- It's not your choice.
- Why are you doing this to yourself?

407
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,680
A girl is dead because of me.

408
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,270
How many people are alive because of you?
How many have you saved?

409
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,994
One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.

410
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,078
That's all it is to you, isn't it?
Just another body.

411
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,278
Buffy.

412
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,240
You can't understand why this is killing me.

413
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,191
Why don't you explain it?

414
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,155
That's it, put it on me.
Put it all on me.

415
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,231
- That's my girl.
- I am not your girl.

416
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,948
You don't have a soul.

417
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,753
There is nothing good or clean in you.

418
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,030
You are dead inside.

419
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,438
You can't feel anything real.

420
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,753
I could never be your girl.

421
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,512
You always hurt the one you love, pet.

422
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,793
Buffy?

423
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,531
Buffy.

424
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,596
No, no statements.
Not until I get confirmation.

425
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,269
- Excuse me. I need to...
- I'll be with you in a sec.

426
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,958
Sunnydale PD?

427
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,915
Yeah. Phone's ringing off the hook here.
Listen, you got an ID on that body yet?

428
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,838
Yeah? OK, shoot.

429
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,034
Katrina Silber.

430
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,993
S- i-I-b-e-r.

431
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,475
- Warren, tell her to go away.
- I can't.

432
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,433
You're keeping secrets from me -
other girls and...

433
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,233
Trina, shut up.

434
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,149
- Warren.
- Thanks. Now, what's the problem, miss?

435
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,917
- Is this what you saw?
- Yeah, that's it.

436
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,797
Rwasundi. Very rare.

437
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,547
Its presence in our dimension
causes a sort of...

438
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:46,829
localised temporal disturbance.

439
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,798
- So that's why time went all "David Lynch"?
- Right.

440
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,514
Human perception
is based on a linear chronology.

441
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,634
Being exposed to the Rwasundi for a few
seconds can cause vivid hallucinations.

442
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,910
And a slight tingly scalp.

443
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,079
So that's it. These things
just made you think you killed her.

444
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,636
She was probably dead
long before you stumbled across her.

445
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,478
It wasn't the demon.

446
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,673
It was Warren. He knew Katrina.
He had something to do with it, I know it.

447
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,836
How can you be sure?

448
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,394
You always hurt the one you love.

449
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,878
Does this mean you're not going away?

450
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,837
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.

451
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,153
We need to find Warren and the others.

452
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,748
Whatever they've done,
they won't get away with it.

453
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,640
We'll get away with it.

454
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:43,671
"Injuries consistent with a fall.
" The coroner's ruling it a suicide.

455
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,756
What about Buffy?

456
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,673
It wasn't that hard messing her
game up. If she figures it out,

457
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:51,775
we'll take care of her.

458
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,952
We really got away with murder.

459
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,629
That's kinda cool.

460
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,072
Yeah.

461
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,791
Cool.

462
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,514
- Are you sure?
- I've double-checked everything.

463
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,074
There's nothing wrong with you.

464
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,915
Then why can Spike hurt me?

465
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,431
Well, I said that there was nothing
wrong with you, but you are different.

466
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,750
Shifting you out of... from where you were,

467
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,959
funnelling your essence
back into your body,

468
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,834
it altered you on a basic molecular level.

469
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,272
Probably just enough to confuse
the sensors, or whatever, in Spike's chip.

470
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,309
But it's all surfacey physical stuff.

471
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:41,793
It wouldn't have any more
effect than bad sunburn.

472
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,070
I didn't come back wrong?

473
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,557
No, you're the same Buffy.
With a deep tropical cellular tan.

474
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,916
You must have missed something.
Will you check again?

475
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,708
I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.

476
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,400
There has to be.

477
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,954
This just can't be me. It isn't me.

478
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,235
Why do I feel like this?

479
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,874
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?

480
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,716
You mean, hit you?

481
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,676
Really?

482
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,109
He's everything I hate.

483
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,639
He's everything that
I'm supposed to be against.

484
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,156
But the only time that
I ever feel anything is when...

485
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,711
- Don't tell anyone. Please?
- I won't.

486
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,196
The way they would look at me.
I just couldn't...

487
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,596
I won't tell anyone. I wouldn't do that.

488
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,035
Why can't I stop?

489
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,310
Why do I keep letting him in?

490
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,388
Do you love him?

491
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,957
It's OK if you do. He's done a lot of good,
and he does love you.

492
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,038
And, Buffy, it's OK if you don't.

493
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,153
You're going through
a really hard time, and you're...

494
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,714
What? Using him?

495
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,399
What's OK about that?

496
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,308
- It's not that simple.
- It is. It's wrong.

497
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,433
I'm wrong.
Tell me that I'm wrong, please.

498
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,870
Please don't forgive me. Please.

499
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,309
God! Please don't...

500
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,354
Please don't forgive me.

501
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,156
Please don't...

502
