2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,765
- I'm giddy.
- I like you giddy. Always have.

3
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,394
It's the freedom. As seniors
we can go off campus now for lunch.

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:24,315
It's no longer cutting, it's legal.
It's expected.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,321
It's also a big step forward.
A senior moment, one to be savoured.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,074
You can't just rush into this.

7
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,452
No, I can't!

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,328
- You can.
- You are.

9
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:42,167
But what if they changed the rule?
What if they're lying in wait to arrest me

10
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,712
and throw me in detention
and mar my unblemished record?

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,672
Breathe.

12
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,549
OK...

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,097
This is good. This is... Hey, we're seniors.
Hey, I'm walkin' here.

14
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,768
Ah, Buffy and food.

15
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,396
We shouldn't be couply around Buffy.

16
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:08,318
Cos the only guy that ever liked her
had to be put down like a dog?

17
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,446
Can she cram complex issues
into a nutshell, or what?

18
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,948
All right, prepare to uncouple.

19
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,450
Uncouple.

20
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:23,124
Buffy, banned from campus, but not our
hearts. How are you, and what's for lunch?

21
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,586
- I just threw a few things together.
- Now you're Martha Stewart?

22
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,631
First, she knows jack
about hand-cut prosciutto.

23
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,635
- I don't believe she slays, either.
- I hear she can, but doesn't like to.

24
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,390
Second, way too much free time
since I got kicked out of school.

25
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,767
I know they'll let you back in.

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,104
- Aren't you and your mom meeting Snyder?
- We see Snyde-man tomorrow.

27
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,023
Scott Hope at 11 o'clock. He likes you.

28
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,443
He wanted to ask you out last year,
but you weren't ready.

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,278
But I think you're ready now.

30
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,824
Or at least in the state of pre-readiness
to make conversation.

31
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,451
Or do that thing with
your mouth that boys like.

32
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:03,790
Oh, not the bad thing with your mouth,
I meant that half-smile thing you...

33
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,628
- You're s'posed to stop me when I do that.
- I like when you do that.

34
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,760
- Hi, Buffy.
- Hi.

35
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,931
I think that went very well, don't you?

36
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,892
He didn't try to slit our throats. It's progress.

37
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,440
- Did you do that half-smile thing?
- Look, I'm not trying to snare Scott Hope.

38
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,027
I just wanna get my life back,
do normal stuff.

39
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,820
Like date?

40
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,322
- Well...
- You wanna date.

41
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,159
I saw that half-smile, you little slut.

42
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,374
All right, yes, date, and shop,
and hang out, and go to school,

43
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,463
and save the world from unspeakable
demons. You know, girlie stuff.

44
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,359
Welcome to Happy Burger,
May I take your order?

45
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,486
Diet soda. Medium.

46
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,280
that'll be 89 cents at the window, sir,

47
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,455
Sunnydale. Town's got quaint.

48
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,460
And the people. He called me "sir".
Don't you just miss that?

49
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:37,926
Admittedly it's not a haven for the brothers,
strictly the Caucasian persuasion,

50
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,514
but you just gotta stand up
and salute their death rate.

51
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,102
I ran a statistical analysis,
and hello, darkness!

52
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:53,191
Makes DC look like Mayberry.

53
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,277
And ain't nobody sayin' boo about it.

54
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,406
We could fit right in here.

55
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,158
Have us some fun.

56
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,412
We're here for one thing.

57
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:12,377
Kill the Slayer, yeah.
Still, big picture...

58
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,722
- Have a nice night, sir.
- Right back at ya.

59
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,309
The Slayer. I'm going to rip
her spine from her body,

60
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,731
and I'm going to eat her heart
and suck the marrow from her bones.

61
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,192
Now I'm hungry.

62
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,198
I miss you.

63
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,947
I had to.

64
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,124
I loved you.

65
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,255
- Oh, God, Angel...
- Go to hell!

66
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,720
I did.

67
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,124
Morning, sunshine. Ready to face the beast?

68
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:43,171
Here are the terms of your re-entry, missy.
Take 'em or leave 'em.

69
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:48,301
One, that you pass a make-up test of
every class you skipped out on last year.

70
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:53,807
Two, that you provide, in writing,
one glowing letter of recommendation

71
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,228
from any member of our faculty
who is not an English librarian.

72
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:04,234
Three, that you complete an interview
with our school psychologist

73
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,113
who must conclude
that your violent tendencies

74
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,616
are under control.

75
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,829
I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr Snyder.
I spoke with the school board, and...

76
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:21,501
I'm required to educate every juvenile
who's not in jail where she belongs.

77
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,255
Welcome back.

78
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,133
So let me get this straight.

79
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,387
I'm really back in school because
the school board overruled you.

80
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:38,435
Wow. That's like having your whole ability
to do this job called into question.

81
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,522
I think what my daughter's trying to say is:

82
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,952
It's the mayor on line one,

83
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,123
It's so great that you're a schoolgirl again.

84
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,625
Giles say what he wanted?
You think he's mad?

85
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,962
I don't think so.
I think he just needed to see you.

86
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,592
Have you noticed, though, when he is mad
but he's too English to say anything

87
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,387
he makes that weird cluck-cluck sound
with his tongue?

88
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,514
Hi, Giles.

89
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,311
Oh, hi. Been there long?

90
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,232
Buffy, good timing. I could use your help.
I trust you remember the demon Acathla?

91
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,694
Giles, contain yourself.
Yes, I'm back in school,

92
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,322
but you know it embarrasses me
when you gush so.

93
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,866
Let's just skip that and get to work.

94
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,209
Of course it's wonderful to have you back.
That goes without saying.

95
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,422
But you enjoy making me say it, don't you?

96
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,010
OK, Acathla, huh? What are you doin'?
Making him demon pizza?

97
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,930
We need to make sure
he remains dormant,

98
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:01,518
and that the dimensional vortex is sealed
tight, so I'm working on a binding spell.

99
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,479
Ooh, a spell! Can I help?

100
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,858
Possibly with the research.
It's a very sensitive and...

101
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,529
- Who's more sensitive than me?
- and difficult spell.

102
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,199
It involves creating
a protective circle around...

103
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:21,579
I won't bore you with the details, but there's
a litany one has to recite in Aramaic,

104
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,500
and it's very specific,
so I need details about your experience

105
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,294
of defeating Acathla and Angel.

106
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,592
- Fire away.
- I've put the time at about... 6:11,

107
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:39,180
about half an hour after Xander rescued me.

108
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,641
Less. More like ten minutes.

109
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,810
Oh, was the vortex already open?

110
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,479
Barely.

111
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,149
I see. And Angel?

112
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,986
Big fight, Angel got the
pointy end of the sword,

113
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,323
Acathla sucked him into Hell
instead of the world. That's about it.

114
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,160
Yes, well, that should be very helpful.

115
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,622
Oh, no. I have to go take
an English make-up exam.

116
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,127
They give you credit
just for speaking it, right?

117
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,842
Mm, sage. I love that smell.

118
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,348
And Marnox root. You know, a smidge of this
mixed with a virgin's saliva...

119
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,935
It does something I know nothing about.

120
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:30,148
These forces are not to be played around
with, Willow. What have you been conjuring?

121
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:35,612
Nothing... much. Well, you know,
I tried the spell to cure Angel,

122
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,573
and I guess that was a bust.

123
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,868
But since then, you know, small stuff.

124
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:47,332
Floating feather, fire out of ice -
which next time I won't do on the bedspread.

125
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,543
Are you mad at me?

126
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,796
No, of course not.

127
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:57,133
If I were, I would be making a strange
clucking sound with my tongue.

128
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,326
Don't let me interrupt.

129
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,330
Are you... Is she all glowy?

130
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,417
Yeah, I suspect happiness.

131
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,212
I passed my English make-up exam,
I'm hanging with my friends...

132
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,923
Hello, my life, how I've missed you.

133
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,219
Hi, Scott! What are you doin' here?

134
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,639
You told me if I came after eight
I could run into Buffy.

135
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,893
I'm sorry, I'm a bad liar.
It's not good for the soul.

136
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,813
Or the skin, actually, it makes me blotch.

137
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,940
Hi, Scott.

138
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,695
- Don't you love this song?
- Yeah, actually, I do.

139
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,448
Would you like to...?

140
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,617
Dance? Um... I don't know.

141
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,537
I'm bad with...

142
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,376
- Thank you for asking, it's just that...
- OK, I'll just stand by the dance floor.

143
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,088
If you change your mind, you can mosey
on over. If not, then you don't mosey.

144
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,799
No harm, no foul, right?

145
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,551
Right.

146
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,390
Come on, Buffy.
I mean, the guy is charm.

147
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,810
And normal, which is what
you wanted to get back to.

148
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,773
Plus bonus points
for use of the word "mosey".

149
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,567
I just don't think I'm ready.

150
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,110
What's stopping you?

151
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,238
Check out Slut-o-rama and her Disco Dave!

152
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:47,660
What was the last thing that guy danced to?
KC and the Sunshine Band?

153
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,479
I don't think that guy thrives on sunshine.

154
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,110
Hi.

155
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,237
Hi. Oh...

156
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,823
No, I have to...

157
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,410
Oh. Uh, sorry. My bad.

158
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:34,040
No, it's mine. Really, it's mine.
But I... I have to go.

159
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,424
Where'd she go?

160
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,510
I bet it's nothing.
They're probably just making out.

161
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,473
That's not what making out sounds like.
Unless I'm doing it wrong.

162
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,394
Stop struggling. This won't hurt.

163
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,652
It's OK, I got it. You're Buffy, right?

164
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,197
I'm Faith.

165
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,827
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say there's a new slayer in town.

166
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,294
Can I borrow that?

167
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,764
Thanks, B. Couldn't have done it without you.

168
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,689
The whole summer it was, like,
the worst heat wave.

169
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,068
So it's about 118 degrees
and I'm sleepin' without a stitch on.

170
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,821
All of a sudden I hear screaming outside,
so I tear out, stark nude,

171
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,408
and a church bus is broke down,
and there's three vamps

172
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,827
feasting on half the Baptists
in South Boston.

173
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,332
So I waste the vamps, and the preacher's
huggin' me like there's no tomorrow,

174
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,378
when all of a sudden the cops pull up,
and they arrested us both.

175
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,547
Wow, they should film that story
and show it every Christmas.

176
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:09,844
God, I could eat a horse! Isn't it crazy how
slayin' always makes you hungry and horny?

177
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,894
Well, sometimes I crave
a non-fat yoghurt afterwards.

178
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,022
I get it!

179
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,943
Not the horny thing - yuck -
but the two-slayer thing.

180
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,279
There was one,
then Buffy died for two minutes,

181
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:32,409
so then Kendra was called,
and when she died Faith was called.

182
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,536
But why were you called here?

183
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,665
I wasn't. My watcher went off to some
retreat thing in England, so I skipped out.

184
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,711
I figured this was my chance to meet
the infamous Buff and compare notes.

185
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,673
So, B, did you really use
a rocket launcher one time?

186
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,175
Yeah. Actually, it's a funny story...

187
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,178
So what was that alligator story?
You said something before?

188
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,558
There's this big daddy vampire out
in Missouri who used to keep 'em as pets.

189
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,562
So he's got me rasslin' one of 'em -
it must've been 12ft long...

190
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,815
So, was this also naked?

191
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,359
Well, the alligator was.

192
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,237
Xander? Find a new theme.

193
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,158
I tell ya, I never had more trouble
than that damn vamp.

194
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,536
So what about you?
What was your toughest kill?

195
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,421
Well, they're all difficult, I guess.

196
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,134
Oh, do you guys remember the Three?

197
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,262
Right, you never met the Three.
Well, there was...

198
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,224
Something occurring. You both kill vamps,
and who could blame you,

199
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,353
but I'm wondering about
your position on werewolves.

200
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,481
- Oz is a werewolf.
- It's a long story.

201
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,318
- I got bit.
- Apparently not that long.

202
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:53,406
Hey, as long as you don't go scratchin' at me
or humpin' my leg, we're five by five, y'know?

203
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,616
Fair enough.

204
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,994
The vamps, though,
better get their asses to DEFCON 1.

205
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,998
Cos you and I are gonna have fun,
watcherless and fancy-free.

206
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,211
- Watcherless?
- Didn't yours go to England, too?

207
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,674
There is a watchers' retreat every year
in the Cotswolds.

208
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,302
It's a lovely spot. It's very serene.

209
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,017
There's horse riding and hiking and punting,
and lectures and discussions...

210
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,562
It's a great honour to be invited.

211
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,941
Or so I'm told.

212
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,111
Ah, it's boring.
Way too stuffy for a guy like you.

213
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,323
Maybe I should introduce you again.
Faith, this is Giles.

214
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:39,119
If I'd known they came that young and cute,
I'd have requested a transfer.

215
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,705
Raise your hand if "eww".

216
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,793
Well, leaving aside for a moment
my youth and beauty,

217
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,256
I'd say it was fortuitous
that Faith arrived when she did.

218
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,802
Sorry. I just meant...

219
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,222
There's a big evil brewin'.

220
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:03,852
You'll never be bored here, Faith, cos this
is Sunnydale, home of the big brewin' evil.

221
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,980
I don't know how big and evil it is,

222
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,234
but two people have disappeared
from the Sunset Ridge district.

223
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:18,033
Well, I'm good for patrolling. Latish, though.
I promised Mom I'd be home for dinner.

224
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,331
To which you're invited, of course.
Dinner with us.

225
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,251
Dyin' to meet the fam. I'm in.

226
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:32,088
Great. Then we can patrol.
Also together.

227
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,092
- Don't you have a health science make-up?
- Oh, yeah. I could use some coaching.

228
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,804
You can hang out with us while
she's testing. You wanna?

229
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,182
Say yes, and bring your stories.

230
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,311
You guys go. It's fine. Fine. I'll just sit.

231
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,606
OK. Hey, later. We will talk weapons.

232
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,863
This new girl seems to have a lot of zest.

233
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,411
I've been having a little problem
with the binding spell for Acathla.

234
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,207
I'm lacking the requisite details
to perform it correctly.

235
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,585
Now physical location...
Acathla was facing south?

236
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,465
Acathla, Angel, me, sword.

237
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,593
That's what I thought, but...

238
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,931
Giles, look, I've got make-up tests to pass,
missing people in Sunset Ridge,

239
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:29,187
and a zesty new slayer to feed.
Next time I kill Angel, I'll video it.

240
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,609
And over here we have the cafeteria,
where we were mauled by snakes.

241
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,696
And this is the spot where
Angel tried to kill Willow.

242
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:42,450
And over there is where Spike and his gang
nearly massacred us on parent-teacher night.

243
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:46,621
And up those stairs
I was sucked into a muddy grave.

244
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,334
They say kids don't learn anything in school
nowadays, but I've learned to be afraid.

245
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:56,423
You guys are a hoot and a half. If I'd had
friends like you in high school, I'd...

246
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,844
probably still have dropped out, but
I might've been sad about it, you know?

247
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,013
So what's up with B?

248
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:07,976
I mean, she seems wound kinda tight,
needs to find the fun a little, like you two.

249
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,270
- Well...
- Oh. Water.

250
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,314
And then the alligator story.

251
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,983
She's got something, doesn't she?

252
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,485
What is it with you and slayers?

253
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:20,697
Maybe I should dress up as one
and put a stake to your throat.

254
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,408
Oh, please, God, don't let that be sarcasm.

255
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,577
I'm gonna tell him straight.

256
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:30,248
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sorry. I know you from somewhere.

257
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,251
- The Bronze. Friend of Buffy's, right?
- Yeah. I'm Faith.

258
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,712
- I'm Scott. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

259
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:40,842
Well, I'm two for two with make-up tests.
Proud, yes, but also humble, and...

260
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,345
We're looking at what?

261
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,724
Does anyone believe
that is her actual hair colour?

262
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:53,229
I haven't seen him laugh like that.
Hey, maybe Faith and Scott could hit it off.

263
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:57,692
I mean, if you're done with him...
Not that you used him...

264
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:05,283
Well, I... hadn't definitely 100 per cent
said no for all time.

265
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,412
It's just, you know, you don't
enter into these things lightly.

266
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,124
There's repercussions to consider, and...

267
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,418
Why am I seeing a look?

268
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,714
You really do need to find the fun, B. Buffy.

269
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,888
- Hey.
- Hey, Buffy.

270
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,307
Faith has been telling me tall tales.

271
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,852
She's funny. And she's leaving.
We have to go.

272
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,691
He's a cutie. Is he seeing anybody?

273
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,986
Mr Trick, talk to me.

274
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:48,743
This town... this very street,
wired for fibre optics.

275
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:55,875
See, we jack in a T-3, 2500 megs per,
we have the whole world at our fingertips.

276
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:01,923
All I'm sayin' is we stay local, where the
humans are jumpin' and the cotton is high,

277
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,718
but we live global.

278
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:08,054
You get the hankerin' for
the blood of a 15-year-old Filipina,

279
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:11,975
I'm on the net and she's here
the next day, express air.

280
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,145
I want the blood of the Slayer.

281
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,025
On that note, there's good news and bad.

282
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:25,488
Rumour has it that this town already
has a slayer, which makes two.

283
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,741
I'm not sure how that happened.

284
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:31,536
I don't care if there are a hundred slayers!
I'll kill them all!

285
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,789
She's going to pay for what she did to me.

286
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,585
Yes, she is.

287
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:43,840
I'm running a computer check on every hotel,
rooming house and youth hostel in town.

288
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,636
Meanwhile, as soon as the sun goes down,

289
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,098
we're out in force.

290
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,352
Food's here, boys.

291
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,606
You guys order...

292
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,403
So you're a slayer, too.
Isn't that interesting.

293
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,323
- Do you like it?
- God, I love it.

294
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,909
- Mom?
- Just a second, honey.

295
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,537
You know, Buffy never talks that way.
Why do you love it?

296
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,459
Well, when I'm fighting it's like the whole
world goes away and I only know one thing,

297
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:23,963
that I'm gonna win and they're gonna lose.
I like that feeling.

298
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,634
Sure - it beats that dead feeling you get
when they win and you lose.

299
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:32,806
- I don't let that kind of negative thinking in.
- Right. That could get you hurt.

300
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,226
Buffy can be awfully negative sometimes.

301
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,604
- Honey, you gotta fight that.
- Workin' on it.

302
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:43,525
- Faith, can I get you another soft drink?
- You bet.

303
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,570
She's really cool, huh?

304
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,406
Best mom ever.

305
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,367
Excuse me.

306
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,793
I like this girl, Buffy.

307
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,339
She's very personable. She gets along
with my friends, my watcher, my mom...

308
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:11,094
- Look, now she's getting along with my fries.
- Now, Buffy...

309
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:15,348
Plus at school she was making eyes
at my not-boyfriend. This is creepy.

310
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,685
Does anybody else think Faith is creepy?

311
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:22,105
No. But I'm the one getting
Single White Femaled.

312
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,316
It's probably good you were an only child.

313
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:29,612
Mom, I'm just getting my life back.
I'm not looking to go halfsies on it.

314
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:33,450
Well, some things I'd be happy
to see you share - like the slaying.

315
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:37,120
I mean, two of you fighting
is safer than one, right?

316
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:39,289
I guess.

317
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:45,211
Unless... I mean, you heard her, she loves
the slaying. Couldn't she take over for you?

318
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,757
Mom, no one can take over for me.

319
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,301
But you go to college next year.
It would be...

320
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,889
Mom, the only way you get a new slayer
is when the old slayer dies.

321
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,684
Then that means you.

322
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,605
- When did you die? You never told me.
- It was just for a few minutes.

323
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,316
Oh, I hate this. I hate your life.

324
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,276
Mom, I...

325
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:12,155
Look, I know you didn't choose this.
I know it chose you.

326
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:16,076
I have tried to march
in the slayer pride parade, but...

327
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,372
I don't want you to die.

328
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:26,169
I'm not gonna die. I know how to do my job.

329
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:30,590
Besides, like you said, I've got help now.

330
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,056
I've got all the help I can stand.

331
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,691
Didn't we do this street already?

332
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:52,737
Funny thing about vamps - they'll hit a street
even after you've been there. No manners.

333
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,324
You've been doing this the longest.

334
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,703
- I have.
- Yeah. Maybe a little too long.

335
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,164
Excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?

336
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,750
- Nothing.
- You got a problem?

337
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:10,255
I'm five by five, B, livin' entirely large,
actually wondering about your problem.

338
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,883
Well, I may not sleep in the nude
and rassle alligators...

339
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:17,846
Maybe it's time you started, cos something
in your bottle needs uncorking.

340
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,849
What is it, the Angel thing?

341
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,185
What do you know about Angel?

342
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:29,232
Just what I've heard - big love, big loss,
you oughta deal and move on, but you're not.

343
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:33,486
I got an idea. How about from now on
we don't hear from you on Angel

344
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:37,365
or anything else in my life,
which, by the way, is my life.

345
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,493
Why are you gettin' so strung out, B?

346
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,287
Why are your lips still moving, F?

347
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,457
- Did I just hear a threat?
- Would you like to?

348
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,083
Wow. Think you can take me?

349
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,587
Yeah. I just hope they can't.

350
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,950
My dead mother hits harder than that!

351
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,334
Stake him already and give me a hand!

352
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,674
This is for me, you undead bastard!

353
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:40,470
For Kakistos we live,
for Kakistos you'll die!

354
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,347
Faith!

355
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:58,905
Faith...

356
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,869
You... can't... touch... me!

357
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,586
- What is wrong with you?
- What do you mean?

358
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,464
You "living large" on that vampire.

359
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:20,218
Gee, if doing violence to vampires upsets
you, you're in the wrong line of work.

360
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:24,305
- Or maybe you like it a little too much.
- I was getting the job done.

361
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:29,728
The job is to slay demons, not beat them to
a bloody pulp while their friends corner me!

362
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:31,980
I thought you could handle yourself.

363
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:40,071
You must realise, Buffy, that you and Faith
have very different temperaments.

364
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,699
And mine's the sane one.

365
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,661
The girl's not playing with a full deck.
She has almost no deck. She has a three.

366
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:49,581
You said yourself that she killed one.

367
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:53,043
She's just a plucky fighter
who got a little carried away.

368
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,837
Which is natural.
She's focused on the slaying.

369
00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:00,133
- She doesn't have a life here, as you do.
- She doesn't need a life. She has mine.

370
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:03,636
- I think you're being a little...
- No, I'm being a lot. I know that.

371
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:07,307
She nearly got us both killed.
The girl needs help.

372
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:10,602
All right, I'll see if I can reach
her watcher at the retreat.

373
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:15,982
They're... eight hours ahead now.
They're probably sitting down to a nightcap.

374
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:21,321
I wonder if they still kayak.
I used to love a good kayak.

375
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,782
You see, they don't even consider...

376
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:29,120
Sorry, I digress.
The vampire that attacked you,

377
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:33,375
can you furnish me with some details
that might help me trace their lineage?

378
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:37,420
Ancient or modern dress,
amulets, cultish tattoos?

379
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:41,841
No tats, crappy dressers, and...

380
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:46,721
Oh, the one that nearly bit me
mentioned something about kissing toast.

381
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,933
- He lived for kissing toast.
- You mean Kakistos?

382
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:53,937
Maybe it was taquitos,
Maybe he lived for taquitos, What?

383
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,022
Kakistos.

384
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,818
Is that bad?

385
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,947
Kakistos is Greek.
It means the worst of the worst.

386
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:09,411
It's also the name of a vampire
so old that his hands and feet are cloven.

387
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,292
Now, this guy shows up
two days ago, right?

388
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,171
Right around the time my bestest
new little sister makes the scene.

389
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,966
You think he and Faith are connected?

390
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:26,511
Giles, there are two things I don't believe in:
coincidence and leprechauns.

391
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:32,100
Buffy, it's entirely possible that they both
arrived here by chance simultaneously.

392
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:36,104
OK, but I was right
about the leprechauns, right?

393
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,397
As far as I know.

394
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:42,152
Good. OK, you phone England,
I'll talk to Faith, see if khaki trousers rings...

395
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:47,490
- Kakistos.
- ..Kakistos rings a bell. Or an alarm.

396
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,951
- Right.
- Right.

397
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,461
Hi.

398
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,671
- Scott.
- How are you?

399
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:05,091
- OK. I gotta...
- Be somewhere else, right?

400
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:10,096
Think of this as my last-ditch effort.
I realise one more will qualify as stalking.

401
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:16,186
I've given a lot of thought - some might say
too much - to how I might be part of your life.

402
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:21,149
It begins with conversation, we all know this.
Maybe over a cup of coffee,

403
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:27,197
or maybe at the Buster Keaton festival
playing on State Street all this weekend.

404
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:35,497
You know, come to think of it, I don't think
I've given a fair chance to Buster Keaton.

405
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:43,380
I like what I've seen of him so far.
I think it might be time to see a little more.

406
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,717
Keaton is key.

407
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:53,390
Oh, um, I got you a little present. A guy in
the retro shop said it represents friendship,

408
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:57,686
and that's something
I'd very much like to have with you.

409
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:02,232
You like?

410
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:08,738
I can't. I can't do this.

411
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,493
OK. I get the message.

412
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,374
Are you all right?

413
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:24,004
Giles, hi. Uh, yeah... I'm fine.

414
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:27,966
- Did you reach the retreat?
- Yes, I did.

415
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,136
What did her watcher say?

416
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,388
Her watcher's dead.

417
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,270
The room's $18 a day.

418
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:44,190
- That's every day.
- I'll get it to you by tomorrow, I swear.

419
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,109
It's not like I own the place.

420
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:50,321
- But I bet you will some day.
- Not if I listen to broads like you.

421
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:54,576
- Roommates are extra.
- I'm just visiting.

422
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,332
So, what brings you to the poor side of town?

423
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:08,048
Cloven guy. Goes by the name Kakistos.

424
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:13,386
- What do you know about Kakistos?
- That he's here.

425
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,934
We're not happy to see old friends, are we?
What did he do to you?

426
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:22,562
It's what I did to him, all right?

427
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,066
And what was that?

428
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,486
Faith, you came here
for a reason. I can help.

429
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:32,655
You can mind your own business.
I'm the one who can handle this.

430
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,992
Yeah. You're a real bad-ass
when it comes to packing.

431
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:38,995
What was that you said about my problem?
Gotta deal and move on?

432
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:44,292
Well, you have the moving-on part here. What
about dealing? You gonna dump that on me?

433
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:48,546
You don't know me, or what I've been
through. I'll take care of this, all right?

434
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,633
Like you took care of your watcher?

435
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,266
He killed her, didn't he?

436
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,853
They don't have a word for what he did to her.

437
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,902
- Oh, what now?
- Faith, you run, he runs after you.

438
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:14,030
That's where the head start comes in handy.

439
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,495
Faith...

440
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,508
I just bought us a little more... time.

441
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,177
- Oh, no!
- Scream later! Escape now!

442
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,270
Let's go!

443
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:05,540
We're OK. What happened?

444
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,545
Faith, what happened?

445
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,924
I was there when he killed my watcher,

446
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:19,220
and I saw what he did to her,
what he was gonna do to me.

447
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:23,141
I tried to stop him, but I...
I couldn't. And I ran.

448
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:26,936
Faith, first rule of slaying - don't die.

449
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:34,361
You did the right thing, OK? You didn't die.
Now you do the math - one of him, two of us.

450
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:37,197
Yes.

451
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:39,240
No.

452
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:43,286
- This is his place.
- He drove us here.

453
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,309
Faith!

454
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,186
Don't die!

455
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,243
Don't!

456
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:44,097
If we don't do something,
the Master could get killed.

457
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:47,517
Well, our prayers are with him.

458
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,856
There's a reason these vengeance
crusades are out of style.

459
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:56,901
See, the modern vampire,
we see the big picture.

460
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,619
I guess you need a bigger stake, Slayer!

461
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:31,144
You hungry?

462
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,104
Starved.

463
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:42,155
The Council has approved our request.

464
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:44,574
Faith is to stay here indefinitely,

465
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,911
and I'm to look after you both
until a new watcher is assigned.

466
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:51,039
Good. She really came through in the end.

467
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:56,503
She had a lot to deal with,
but she did it. She got it behind her.

468
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:59,714
I'm glad to hear it.

469
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:06,096
Angel was cured.

470
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,642
I'm sorry?

471
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:15,772
When I killed him, Angel was cured.

472
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:20,443
Your spell worked at the last minute, Will.

473
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:26,074
I was about to take him out and, um,
something went through him,

474
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:28,702
and he was Angel again.

475
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,207
He didn't remember anything that he'd done.

476
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,168
He just held me.

477
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:42,966
But it was... it was too late and I had to.

478
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,765
So I told him that I loved him,
then I kissed him,

479
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,226
then I killed him.

480
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:05,155
I don't know if that helps
with your spell or not, Giles.

481
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,950
Yes, I believe it will.

482
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:11,119
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:13,872
It's OK.

484
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:19,252
I've been holding onto that for so long,
it felt good to get it out.

485
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:24,883
I'll see you guys later.

486
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,272
Giles, I know you don't like me
playing with mystical forces,

487
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,151
but I can really help
with this binding spell.

488
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:45,862
There is no spell.

489
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,252
Scott...

490
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:03,296
Hello.

491
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,798
Hey.

492
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,302
I was waiting for you to get out of class.

493
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,888
Oh. Why?

494
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:18,144
There was someone a while ago,
and the ring sort of confused me,

495
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:22,273
but I liked what you said about friendship
a lot. And Buster Keaton, big fun,

496
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:26,486
and I'm capable of big fun, though there's
no way you could know that about me.

497
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:31,449
Wow, if I knew I was gonna go on this long
I probably would've brought some water.

498
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:35,704
What I'm trying to say is,
if you'd still like to go to the film festival,

499
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:41,543
and I would understand if you didn't,
I'd pretty much love to go with you.

500
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,592
I don't know, Buffy.
I'm really gonna have to think about this.

501
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:54,014
OK, I thought about it and I'm in.
When do you wanna go?

502
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:59,102
Well, I have one thing that I have to do
tonight, and then I'm good.

503
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,063
Good.

504
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,691
Goodbye.

505
00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:53,378
