This dataset contains all source code required to measure the amount of time each character speaks for. It also contains a finalized dataset for further analysis.

FOLDERS:
- Subtitles: contains .srt subtitle files used for the analysis.
- Episode Scripts: contains .mat (MATLAB) files that contain each episode's transcript. These were downloaded directly from http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewforum.php?f=122; the webpage is user-friendly and easy-to-use.
- Episode Audio: An empty folder that contains the audio of each episode. It is not included for copyright and disk space purposes.
- Audio Samples: Short segments of character-specific audio from season 1, episode 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. These finalized clips were generated for each character in each episode and were used to generate X_timing.csv.
- Dataset: all our finalized data. This folder contains two types of files:
	- X_timing.csv (comma separated values).
	- X_script.csv (comma separated values).
 		where, 	S0X refers to the season # (i.e S03 = season 3 of Buffy)
 			EX refers to the episode # (i.e E1 = episode 1 of Buffy)
		in other words: S01E1 = Season 1, Episode 1 of Buffy.

	Please see compiledTimings.csv for every episode of X_timing.csv compiled by character.

- All other folders are relevant for the source code. Please refer to tutorial.m for use.
