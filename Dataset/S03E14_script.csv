4.11,5.9,,"So, what, you're"
4.11,5.9,,telling me never?
5.98,8.21,,"Faith, really,"
5.98,8.21,,now is not the time.
8.28,10.34,Faith,I'm curious. Never ever?
13.52,14.95,Faith,"Come on, really."
15.02,18.28,Faith,"All this time,"
15.02,18.28,Faith,and not even once?
18.35,20.25,Buffy,How many times
18.35,20.25,Buffy,do I have to say it?
20.32,22.98,Buffy,I have never...
20.32,22.98,Buffy,done it...
23.06,25.25,Buffy,with Xander!
25.33,26.76,Buffy,He's just a friend.
29.93,32.7,Faith,So? What are friends for?
32.77,34.57,Faith,"I mean, I'm sorry,"
32.77,34.57,Faith,"it's just,"
34.64,36.83,Faith,"all this sweatingnightly,"
34.64,36.83,Faith,"sidebyside action,"
36.91,38.2,Buffy,and you never put in
38.2,39.93,Faith,for a little afterhours... 
42.02,41.41,Buffy,Thanks for the poetry.
41.48,43.88,Buffy,"And, no. I love Xander."
43.95,46.54,Buffy,I just don't...
43.95,46.54,Buffy,love Xander.
46.62,49.02,Buffy,"Besides, I think it ruins"
46.62,49.02,Buffy,friendships to do that stuff.
49.08,50.02,Faith,You think too much.
50.09,53.28,Buffy,Hey... there's one more.
53.36,54.95,Faith,How do you know?
55.02,56.69,Buffy,I think too much.
61.23,63.29,Buffy,OK. Count of 3...
63.37,64.8,Buffy,
72.02,76.07,Buffy,Advertise your product or brand here
72.02,76.07,Buffy,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
94,95.19,Faith,"Nicely diverted, B."
95.26,97.63,Buffy,Diverted? That was me
95.26,97.63,Buffy,"fighting for my life,"
97.7,98.96,Faith,Miss Attention Span.
99.03,101.8,Faith,This isn't a Tupperware party.
99.03,101.8,Faith,It's a little hard to plan.
101.87,104.81,Buffy,The count of 3 isn't a plan.
101.87,104.81,Buffy,It's Sesame Street.
104.87,106.84,Faith,"Hey, they're toast"
104.87,106.84,Faith,"and we're here,"
106.91,108.5,Faith,so it couldn't have
106.91,108.5,Faith,"been too bad, right?"
108.58,110.34,Faith,"Who were those guys,"
108.58,110.34,Faith,anyways?
110.41,111.85,Buffy,I don't know.
111.91,113.25,Buffy,They didn't seem local.
113.32,114.94,Buffy,"Look, why don't"
113.32,114.94,Buffy,we grab the weapons.
115.02,115.95,Buffy,Maybe Giles...
118.79,121.22,Trick,Mr. Trick:
118.79,121.22,Trick,Check these out.
121.29,124.38,Trick,
124.46,126.66,Mayor Wilkins,I just love
124.46,126.66,Mayor Wilkins,The Family Circus.
126.73,129.89,Mayor Wilkins,"That P.J., he's getting"
126.73,129.89,Mayor Wilkins,to be quite a handful.
131.7,133.73,Mayor Wilkins,Well...
133.8,136.29,Mayor Wilkins,I haven't seen
133.8,136.29,Mayor Wilkins,"anything like this in, uh,"
136.37,138.31,Mayor Wilkins,"well, a good long while."
138.37,141.71,Mayor Wilkins,Where is the owner
138.37,141.71,Mayor Wilkins,of these fine implements?
141.78,143.57,Mayor Wilkins,The common term
141.78,143.57,Mayor Wilkins,is "slain."
143.65,145.7,Mayor Wilkins,But I've been seeing
143.65,145.7,Mayor Wilkins,this breed around.
145.78,147.81,Mayor Wilkins,Are we expecting
145.78,147.81,Mayor Wilkins,any trouble?
147.88,148.98,Mayor Wilkins,Do you like Family Circus?
149.05,150.75,Trick,I like Marmaduke.
150.82,152.55,Mayor Wilkins,Oh! Eww!
152.62,154.56,Mayor Wilkins,He's always on the furniture.
152.62,154.56,Mayor Wilkins,Unsanitary.
154.62,157.82,Trick,Nobody can tell Marmaduke what to do.
154.62,157.82,Trick,That's my kinda dog.
157.89,160.33,Allan,I like to read Cathy.
163.73,165.86,Allan,"So, uh, what about"
163.73,165.86,Allan,these swords?
165.93,167.99,Allan,What should we do
165.93,167.99,Allan,about that?
168.07,169.37,Mayor Wilkins,"Well, let's just"
168.07,169.37,Mayor Wilkins,keep an eye out.
169.44,171.17,Mayor Wilkins,We've got the dedication
169.44,171.17,Mayor Wilkins,coming up in a few days.
171.24,173.77,Mayor Wilkins,We certainly can't have anything
171.24,173.77,Mayor Wilkins,interfering with that.
173.84,178.51,Allan,"Well, maybe we should"
173.84,178.51,Allan,postpone the...
178.58,180.61,Allan,the... the dedication.
180.68,184.24,Trick,I believe the honorable mayor
180.68,184.24,Trick,hates that idea.
187.46,189.62,Mayor Wilkins,The dedication...
189.69,193.39,Mayor Wilkins,is the final step
189.69,193.39,Mayor Wilkins,before my ascension.
193.46,197.09,Mayor Wilkins,I have waited longer
193.46,197.09,Mayor Wilkins,than you can imagine for this.
197.17,201.54,Mayor Wilkins,"After the hundred days,"
197.17,201.54,Mayor Wilkins,I'll be on a higher plane.
201.6,205.51,Mayor Wilkins,And I'll have
201.6,205.51,Mayor Wilkins,no more need for...
205.57,209.84,Mayor Wilkins,"Well, let's just say"
205.57,209.84,Mayor Wilkins,I won't be concerned...
209.91,211.35,Mayor Wilkins,with the little things.
214.02,215.78,Xander,"Mr. Trick,"
214.02,215.78,Xander,watch these people.
215.85,217.72,Xander,Anything you
215.85,217.72,Xander,"find out about them,"
217.79,219.13,Xander,"well, let's just see that"
219.13,221.12,Mayor Wilkins,that information reaches the slayers.
221.19,223.32,Xander,"Who knows? With any luck,"
221.19,223.32,Xander,they'll kill each other.
223.39,224.69,Mayor Wilkins,Then everyone's a winner.
225.79,227.56,Xander,"Everyone, of course..."
227.63,228.89,Xander,meaning me.
287.58,288.51,Xander,"Willow, what are these?"
288.51,289.81,Willow,They're early admission packets.
289.88,291.91,Xander,Harvard...
291.98,294.04,Xander,Yale...
294.12,296.38,Xander,Wesleyan...
296.45,300.29,Xander,some German polytechnical
296.45,300.29,Xander,"institute whose name I, uh,"
300.36,301.79,Oz,I can't pronounce.
301.86,303.52,Oz,Is anyone else
301.86,303.52,Oz,intimidated?
303.59,304.51,Xander,Because I'm just expecting
304.51,305.19,Oz,thin slips of paper
305.26,306.72,Xander,with the words "No way"
306.72,307.86,Oz,written in crayon.
307.93,309.96,Oz,They're typing
307.93,309.96,Oz,those now.
310.03,311.63,Willow,I'm so overwhelmed.
311.7,314.69,Willow,I... I got in!
311.7,314.69,Willow,To actual colleges!
314.77,316.93,Willow,AAnd they're wooing me!
319.02,318.2,Buffy,They're pitching woo!
318.28,319.83,Buffy,The wooing stage
318.28,319.83,Buffy,is always fun.
319.91,322.07,Buffy,Ahh. But it's weird.
322.15,326.45,Willow,Rejection I can handle 'cause
322.15,326.45,Willow,"of the years of training, but this..."
326.52,327.95,Xander,"I feel your pain, Wil."
328.02,330.21,Xander,"Like right now, I'm torn between"
328.02,330.21,Xander,the fastgrowing fields
330.29,332.52,Xander,of appliance repair
330.29,332.52,Xander,and motel management.
332.59,336.49,Xander,"Of course, I'm still waiting to hear"
332.59,336.49,Xander,"back from the Corndog Emporium, so..."
336.56,338.49,Buffy,"Well,"
336.56,338.49,Buffy,I think it's great.
338.56,339.53,Buffy,Early admission.
339.6,341.5,Buffy,Now there's nothing
339.6,341.5,Buffy,standing between you
341.57,342.83,Buffy,and a brilliant
341.57,342.83,Buffy,future.
342.9,345.3,Buffy,"Well, if I may suggest,"
342.9,345.3,Buffy,graduate.
345.37,348.7,Buffy,"Getting left back,"
345.37,348.7,Buffy,it's not the thrill ride you'd expect.
348.77,351.83,Buffy,That's so cute.
348.77,351.83,Buffy,Planning life as a loser?
351.91,354.04,Buffy,Most people just
351.91,354.04,Buffy,"turn out that way,"
354.11,355.91,Buffy,but you're really
354.11,355.91,Buffy,taking charge.
355.98,358.31,Buffy,The comedy stylings of
355.98,358.31,Buffy,"Miss Cordelia Chase, everyone."
358.38,360.82,Buffy,"Who, incidentally, won't be"
358.38,360.82,Buffy,needing a higher education
360.89,364.05,Buffy,when she markets her own
360.89,364.05,Buffy,very successful line of hooker wear.
364.12,367.06,Buffy,"Well, Xander,"
364.12,367.06,Buffy,"I could dress more like you,"
367.12,369.65,Buffy,"but, oh,"
367.12,369.65,Buffy,my father has a job.
371.06,374.05,Buffy,I'm not gonna waste
371.06,374.05,Buffy,the perfect comeback on you now.
374.13,375.62,Buffy,But don't think
374.13,375.62,Buffy,I don't have it.
375.7,378.19,Buffy,"Oh, yes,"
375.7,378.19,Buffy,its time will come!
378.27,380.7,Buffy,"So, life beyond"
378.27,380.7,Buffy,high school.
380.77,383.17,Buffy,"Anyone, please..."
383.24,384.54,Buffy,chime in.
384.61,385.8,Buffy,I hear it's nice.
385.88,387.71,Buffy,And a place
385.88,387.71,Buffy,I'll never go
387.78,389.94,Buffy,if I don't pass Mrs. Taggart's
387.78,389.94,Buffy,chemistry test tomorrow.
390.01,391.5,Buffy,"Oh, I can help."
391.58,394.88,Buffy,Chemistry's easy. It's a lot like
391.58,394.88,Buffy,"witchcraft, only less newt."
394.95,397.85,Buffy,So what do you say... study jam?
394.95,397.85,Buffy,My house? Tonight?
397.92,398.85,Buffy,I'm there.
398.92,399.86,Buffy,
399.92,402.36,Buffy,Oh. I have to go
399.92,402.36,Buffy,"see Giles,"
402.43,404.89,Buffy,report on last night's
402.43,404.89,Buffy,patrol.
404.96,407.12,Willow,"Oh, yeah. He said he wanted"
404.96,407.12,Willow,to talk to you.
407.2,409.19,Buffy,What about? Is he OK?
409.27,411.53,Willow,He's looked better.
411.64,412.86,Wesley,"Of course,"
411.64,412.86,Wesley,training procedures
412.94,415.27,Wesley,have been updated quite a bit
412.94,415.27,Wesley,since your day.
415.34,417.9,Wesley,Much greater emphasis
415.34,417.9,Wesley,on field work.
417.98,418.91,Giles,Really?
418.98,419.91,Wesley,"Oh, yes."
419.98,424.28,Wesley,Not all books
419.98,424.28,Wesley,and theory nowadays.
424.35,427.61,Wesley,"I have, in fact,"
424.35,427.61,Wesley,faced 2 vampires myself.
427.69,430.02,Wesley,"Under controlled circumstances,"
427.69,430.02,Wesley,of course.
430.09,432.52,Giles,No danger of finding
430.09,432.52,Giles,those here.
432.59,433.56,Wesley,Vampires?
433.62,436.49,Giles,Controlled circumstances.
433.62,436.49,Giles,"Hello, Buffy."
437.63,438.65,Wesley,Well...
440.97,442.73,Giles,hello.
444.2,445.13,Buffy,New watcher?
445.2,446.57,Buffy,New watcher.
446.64,448.61,Wesley,Wesley WyndamPryce.
451.78,453.54,Wesley,It's very nice
451.78,453.54,Wesley,to meet you.
455.68,457.65,Buffy,Is he evil?
457.72,458.98,Wesley,Evil?
459.05,461.07,Buffy,The last one
459.05,461.07,Buffy,was evil.
461.15,464.12,Wesley,"Oh, yes. Gwendolyn Post."
461.15,464.12,Wesley,We all heard.
464.19,467.45,Wesley,No. Mr. Giles has checked
464.19,467.45,Wesley,my credentials rather thoroughly
467.52,468.68,Wesley,"and phoned the Council,"
468.76,471.63,Wesley,but I'm glad to see
468.76,471.63,Wesley,you're on the ball as well.
471.7,475.1,Wesley,A good slayer
471.7,475.1,Wesley,is a cautious slayer.
477.77,479.2,Buffy,Is he evil?
479.27,480.43,Giles,Not in the strictest sense
479.27,480.43,Giles,of the...
480.5,482.17,Wesley,"Well, I'm glad"
480.5,482.17,Wesley,that's cleared up.
482.24,486.68,Wesley,And as I'm sure none of us is anxious
482.24,486.68,Wesley,"to waste any time on pleasantries,"
486.74,490.41,Wesley,why don't you tell me everything
486.74,490.41,Wesley,about last night's patrol.
490.48,492.21,Buffy,Vampires.
492.28,493.98,Wesley,Yes?
494.05,495.31,Buffy,Killed 'em.
495.39,497.82,Wesley,Anything else
495.39,497.82,Wesley,you can tell me?
500.56,502.82,Buffy,Uh... one of them had swords.
502.89,505.12,Buffy,I don't think he was
502.89,505.12,Buffy,with the other two.
505.2,506.46,Wesley,Swords?
507.93,509.59,Wesley,Swords.
512.94,514.34,Wesley,"One long, one short?"
514.41,516,Buffy,Mmm. Both pointy.
516.07,518.17,Buffy,"With, like,"
516.07,518.17,Buffy,jewels and things.
518.24,519.17,Giles,Sounds familiar.
519.24,520.18,Wesley,It should.
523.98,526.04,Giles,El Eliminati.
526.12,529.55,Wesley,"thcentury duelist cult,"
526.12,529.55,Wesley,deadly in their day.
529.62,531.35,Wesley,Their numbers dwindled
529.62,531.35,Wesley,in later centuries
531.42,533.48,Wesley,due to an increase
531.42,533.48,Wesley,in antivampire activity
533.56,536.19,Wesley,and a lot of
533.56,536.19,Wesley,pointless dueling.
536.26,537.72,Wesley,They eventually became the acolytes
537.72,538.89,Giles,"of a demon called Balthazar,"
538.96,541.23,Giles,who brought them
538.96,541.23,Giles,"to the new world,"
541.3,542.53,Giles,specifically here.
542.6,544.73,Giles,You seem to know
542.6,544.73,Giles,a lot about them.
544.8,547.07,Wesley,I didn't get this job
544.8,547.07,Wesley,because of my looks.
547.14,549.73,Buffy,"I really, really"
547.14,549.73,Buffy,believe that.
549.81,553.5,Wesley,I've researched this town's
549.81,553.5,Wesley,history extensively.
553.58,556.05,Giles,So why have we not
553.58,556.05,Giles,seen them before this?
556.11,559.55,Wesley,They were driven out
556.11,559.55,Wesley,a hundred years ago.
559.62,561.05,Buffy,"Happily, Balthazar"
559.62,561.05,Buffy,was killed.
561.12,562.95,Wesley,I don't know by whom.
563.02,564.75,Buffy,And they're back 'cause...
564.82,568.02,Wesley,Balthazar had an amulet
564.82,568.02,Wesley,purported to give him strength.
568.09,572.55,Wesley,"When he was killed, it was taken"
568.09,572.55,Wesley,by a wealthy landowner named...
572.63,573.79,Wesley,I don't want to bore you
572.63,573.79,Wesley,with the details.
573.86,574.96,Buffy,A little bit late.
575.03,577.66,Wesley,Named Gleaves.
575.03,577.66,Wesley,"It was buried with him,"
577.73,579.76,Wesley,and I believe the few
577.73,579.76,Wesley,remaining Eliminati
579.84,581.4,Wesley,are probably
579.84,581.4,Wesley,looking for it.
581.47,583.24,Wesley,For sentimental value.
583.31,585.97,Giles,And you don't think that
583.31,585.97,Giles,this amulet poses any threat?
586.04,587.67,Wesley,"Oh, no, not at all."
587.74,590.18,Wesley,"Nonetheless, we may as well"
587.74,590.18,Wesley,keep it from them.
590.25,592.31,Wesley,"Buffy, you will go to"
590.25,592.31,Wesley,the Gleaves family crypt tonight
592.38,593.61,Wesley,and fetch the amulet.
593.68,594.95,Buffy,I will?
595.02,598.32,Wesley,Are you not used
595.02,598.32,Wesley,to being given orders?
598.39,602.65,Buffy,"Whenever Giles sends me on a mission,"
598.39,602.65,Buffy,he always says "Please."
602.73,604.37,Buffy,And afterwards
604.37,606.13,Wesley,I get a cookie.
606.2,610.16,Wesley,I don't feel we're getting off
606.2,610.16,Wesley,on quite the right foot.
610.23,611.83,Wesley,Ah.
611.9,613.77,Wesley,This is perhaps Faith.
615.51,616.73,Faith,New watcher?
616.81,617.93,Faith,New watcher.
616.81,617.93,Faith,New watcher.
620.02,620.27,Faith,Screw that.
621.68,623.98,Buffy,"Now, why didn't"
621.68,623.98,Buffy,I just say that?
624.05,625.38,Giles,"Eh, Buffy, would you..."
625.45,628.58,Buffy,I'll see if
625.45,628.58,Buffy,I can get her back.
628.65,632.25,Buffy,Don't say anything incredibly
628.65,632.25,Buffy,interesting while I'm gone.
638.23,640.16,Wesley,They'll get used to me.
645.37,646.7,Buffy,"Buffy: Faith, wait."
646.77,649.9,Buffy,"Look, I know this new guy's"
646.77,649.9,Buffy,"a dork, but..."
649.97,652.13,Buffy,"Well, I have nothing to follow that."
649.97,652.13,Buffy,He's pretty much just a dork.
652.21,654.84,Faith,You're actually gonna
652.21,654.84,Faith,take orders from him?
654.91,657.11,Buffy,That's the job.
654.91,657.11,Buffy,What else can we do?
657.18,658.34,Faith,Whatever we want.
658.42,659.85,Faith,"We're slayers, girlfriend,"
658.42,659.85,Faith,the chosen two.
659.92,662.28,Faith,Why should we let him
659.92,662.28,Faith,take all the fun out of it?
662.35,663.65,Buffy,"Oh, that would be tragic,"
663.72,666.59,Buffy,"taking the fun out of slaying,"
663.72,666.59,Buffy,"stabbing, beheading."
666.66,668.63,Faith,"Oh, like you"
666.66,668.63,Faith,don't dig it.
668.69,669.62,Buffy,I don't.
669.69,671.63,Buffy,You're a liar.
669.69,671.63,Buffy,I've seen you.
671.7,674.43,Buffy,Tell me staking a vamp
671.7,674.43,Buffy,doesn't get you a little bit juiced.
674.5,675.83,Buffy,"Come on, say it."
675.9,677.46,Buffy,
677.53,678.97,Buffy,You can't fool me.
679.04,680.87,Buffy,The look in your eyes
679.04,680.87,Buffy,right after a kill.
680.94,682.24,Buffy,You just get
680.94,682.24,Buffy,hungry for more.
682.31,683.64,Buffy,You're way off base.
683.71,686.44,Faith,Tell me that if you don't get in
683.71,686.44,Faith,"a good slaying,"
686.51,690.21,Faith,"after a while, you just start"
686.51,690.21,Faith,itching for some vamp to show up
690.28,694.02,Faith,so you can give him
690.28,694.02,Faith,a good... 
692.08,694.07,Buffy,Again with the grunting.
694.15,695.91,Buffy,You realize I'm not
694.15,695.91,Buffy,comfortable with this.
695.99,697.61,Faith,"Hey, slaying's what"
695.99,697.61,Faith,we were built for.
697.69,698.88,Faith,If you're not
697.69,698.88,Faith,"enjoying it,"
698.96,700.39,Faith,you're doing
698.96,700.39,Faith,something wrong.
700.46,702.48,Buffy,What about the assignment?
702.56,704.7,Faith,"Tell you what, you do the homework,"
704.7,705.93,Buffy,and I'll copy yours.
744.52,746.85,Buffy,Buffy: Strike one.
744.52,746.85,Buffy,No amulet there.
755.7,758.17,Buffy,Game over.
803.68,805.48,Buffy,Oh!
805.55,806.88,Buffy,Faith!
806.95,808.54,Faith,"What are you doing,"
806.95,808.54,Faith,hiding in there?
808.62,810.41,Buffy,Looking for the amulet.
810.49,811.82,Buffy,Wasn't counting on the special
811.82,813.11,Faith,guest stars... 6 against one.
813.19,814.65,Buffy,Hence the hiding.
814.72,817.66,Faith,"Yeah. Well, it's 6 against 2 now,"
814.72,817.66,Faith,so come on.
824.8,826.46,Buffy,Wait! Stop! Think.
826.53,828.76,Faith,"No, no, no!"
828.84,830.27,Buffy,It's a manhole...
830.34,833.74,Buffy,"tight space, no escape, 6 against 2..."
830.34,833.74,Buffy,not unlike 3 against one.
833.81,837.02,Faith,"And there might be more,"
833.81,837.02,Faith,so come on.
835.08,837.37,Buffy,You're just gonna go down there.
835.08,837.37,Buffy,That's your plan.
837.45,838.78,Faith,Who said I had a plan?
838.85,841.25,Faith,"I don't know how many's down there,"
838.85,841.25,Faith,but I want to find out.
841.32,842.06,Faith,And I'll know
842.06,842.75,Wesley,"when I land,"
842.82,844.05,Faith,"and if you don't come in after me,"
844.05,844.48,Wesley,I might die.
860.17,862.19,Wesley,"These are all the diaries, then,"
860.17,862.19,Wesley,yours included.
862.27,864.64,Giles,That's everything.
862.27,864.64,Giles,Knock yourself out.
864.71,865.64,Wesley,Please?
868.51,871.5,Wesley,"Oh, yes. Here's"
868.51,871.5,Wesley,your first entry.
871.58,873.74,Wesley,Slayer is willful
871.58,873.74,Wesley,and insolent."
875.25,876.39,Wesley,"That would be our girl,"
876.39,876.98,Giles,wouldn't it?
877.05,879.52,Giles,"Well, you have"
877.05,879.52,Giles,to get to know her.
879.59,881.61,Wesley,Her abuse of
879.59,881.61,Wesley,the English language
881.69,884.75,Wesley,is such that I understand only
881.69,884.75,Wesley,every other sentence."
884.83,887.45,Wesley,"Oh, this is going to make"
884.83,887.45,Wesley,fascinating reading.
887.53,890.86,Giles,She should be back by now.
890.93,892.19,Wesley,Not to fret.
892.27,896.29,Wesley,My mission scenario
892.27,896.29,Wesley,has her back in one minute.
896.37,898.13,Wesley,Shouldn't be
896.37,898.13,Wesley,any trouble.
900.74,902.17,Buffy,We're surrounded!
902.24,903.64,Faith,You noticed that too?!
946.35,947.72,Vincent,Let's settle this
946.35,947.72,Vincent,honorably.
954.1,955.82,Vincent,"Well, then,"
954.1,955.82,Vincent,let's just settle it.
960.37,961.46,Faith,Buffy!
961.54,963.2,Faith,You son of a bitch!
979.02,981.61,Buffy,I hate it
979.02,981.61,Buffy,when they drown me.
990.53,992.06,Faith,B! Gotta go!
993.17,995.23,Buffy,We came for the amulet.
997.67,1001.11,Faith,Tell me you don't
997.67,1001.11,Faith,get off on this.
1001.18,1002.87,Buffy,It didn't suck.
1005.61,1008.08,Wesley,Wesley: Well...
1008.15,1009.74,Wesley,looks authentic enough.
1011.85,1015.65,Wesley,"Of course, there are tests to be made"
1011.85,1015.65,Wesley,before actual verification.
1015.72,1017.59,Buffy,How about verifying that
1015.72,1017.59,Buffy,your "nearly extinct" cult
1017.66,1019.35,Buffy,was out in magnum force
1017.66,1019.35,Buffy,last night?
1019.43,1022.29,Buffy,Faith and I got into
1019.43,1022.29,Buffy,a serious party situation.
1022.36,1023.3,Giles,Are you all right?
1023.36,1025.3,Buffy,"I had to lather,"
1023.36,1025.3,Buffy,"rinse, and repeat"
1025.37,1028.46,Buffy,about 5 million times
1025.37,1028.46,Buffy,"to get the sewer out of my hair,"
1028.54,1030.47,Buffy,"but otherwise,"
1028.54,1030.47,Buffy,I'm of the good.
1030.54,1031.97,Buffy,Thank you for asking.
1032.04,1033.94,Wesley,Perhaps there were a few more
1032.04,1033.94,Wesley,"than we'd anticipated,"
1036.02,1035.7,Wesley,but I'd expect you to be
1036.02,1035.7,Wesley,ready for anything.
1035.78,1038.24,Wesley,Remember the 3 key words
1035.78,1038.24,Wesley,for any slayer:
1038.31,1039.44,Wesley,Preparation...
1039.51,1040.74,Wesley,preparation...
1040.82,1042.72,Wesley,preparation.
1042.78,1044.61,Buffy,That's one word 3 times.
1047.09,1049.02,Buffy,I have a chem. Test.
1049.09,1051.62,Buffy,So sad that I'm actually
1049.09,1051.62,Buffy,happy about that.
1051.69,1053.63,Buffy,"Giles, we need to talk."
1053.69,1055.79,Wesley,Buffy...
1055.86,1059.03,Wesley,I must ask you to remember
1055.86,1059.03,Wesley,that I am your watcher.
1059.1,1061.83,Wesley,"From now on, anything"
1059.1,1061.83,Wesley,you have to say about slaying
1061.9,1064.13,Wesley,you will say to me.
1064.21,1069.02,Wesley,The only thing
1064.21,1069.02,Wesley,you need discuss with Mr. Giles
1067.07,1068.56,Wesley,is overdue book fees.
1068.64,1070.13,Wesley,Understood?
1071.45,1072.3,Buffy,We'll talk.
1072.3,1073.07,Giles,Of course.
1076.08,1077.71,Wesley,You're not helping.
1077.79,1079.48,Giles,I know.
1079.55,1081.61,Giles,I feel just sick
1079.55,1081.61,Giles,about it.
1085.13,1086.56,Buffy,Buffy: It was intense.
1086.63,1090.46,Buffy,It was like I just let go
1086.63,1090.46,Buffy,and became this force.
1090.53,1091.9,Buffy,I just didn't care anymore.
1091.97,1093.7,Willow,"Yeah, I know"
1091.97,1093.7,Willow,what that's like.
1093.77,1097.4,Buffy,I don't think you can!
1093.77,1097.4,Buffy,It's kind of a slayer thing.
1097.47,1099.6,Buffy,I don't even think
1097.47,1099.6,Buffy,I'm explaining it well.
1099.67,1101.11,Xander,You're explaining it
1099.67,1101.11,Xander,"a lot, though."
1101.18,1104.17,Mrs. Taggart,All right. You have one period
1101.18,1104.17,Mrs. Taggart,to fill out your test booklets.
1104.25,1106.11,Mrs. Taggart,Periodic charts
1104.25,1106.11,Mrs. Taggart,are located on the back.
1106.18,1109.71,Mrs. Taggart,"You're on the honor system,"
1106.18,1109.71,Mrs. Taggart,"so remember, no talking."
1110.99,1112.11,Buffy,"You see, the thing was,"
1112.19,1113.88,Buffy,Faith knew I didn't even
1112.19,1113.88,Buffy,want to go down there...
1113.95,1116.18,Buffy,Mrs. Taggart: Ahem!
1116.26,1117.45,Mrs. Taggart,Ms. Summers?
1120.19,1121.86,Mrs. Taggart,You have one hour.
1124.3,1125.36,Buffy,"OK, so the best part..."
1125.43,1129.16,Willow,Buffy. Test?
1125.43,1129.16,Willow,You know. Remember?
1129.24,1131.57,Willow,The thing you didn't
1129.24,1131.57,Willow,come over to study for?
1131.64,1133.47,Buffy,Right.
1133.54,1134.47,Buffy,Got it.
1136.94,1139.54,Buffy,"Sorry. OK, so we're down there,"
1136.94,1139.54,Buffy,"in the sewers,"
1139.61,1143.02,Buffy,and Faith got 3 of them
1139.61,1143.02,Buffy,on her at once...
1141.08,1142.11,Xander,Hey. Whoa.
1142.18,1143.98,Xander,Can we resume Buffy's
1142.18,1143.98,Xander,"Ode to Faith"" later,"
1144.05,1146.99,Xander,like when I'm not actively
1144.05,1146.99,Xander,multiplechoicing?
1147.05,1151.18,Buffy,How come your eye twitches
1147.05,1151.18,Buffy,every time I say Faith's name?
1151.26,1152.78,Xander,What?
1152.86,1154.23,Xander,"No, it doesn't."
1155.3,1156.23,Buffy,Faith.
1157.77,1159.2,Xander,Cut it out!
1159.27,1160.36,Xander,We got a test
1159.27,1160.36,Xander,"to take, OK?"
1160.43,1161.59,Xander,And I'm highly
1160.43,1161.59,Xander,"caffeinated,"
1161.67,1163.4,Xander,and I'm trying
1161.67,1163.4,Xander,to concentrate.
1163.47,1166.03,Xander,Some of us actually
1163.47,1166.03,Xander,"care about school, you know."
1174.05,1175.24,Buffy,
1175.32,1176.61,Buffy,
1176.68,1177.98,Faith,"Hey, girlfriend."
1178.05,1178.98,Faith,Bad time?
1190.36,1191.63,Willow,"No, shshe can't!"
1194.37,1196.86,Willow,YYou can't! Can you?
1202.51,1203.44,Buffy,What's up?
1203.51,1204.5,Faith,Vampires.
1204.58,1206.77,Buffy,"Uh, Faith, unless"
1204.58,1206.77,Buffy,there's a total eclipse
1206.85,1208.25,Buffy,"in the next 5 minutes,"
1206.85,1208.25,Buffy,it's daylight.
1208.32,1209.37,Faith,"Good for us,"
1208.32,1209.37,Faith,bad for them.
1209.45,1210.75,Faith,Found a nest.
1210.82,1211.87,Buffy,Has potential.
1221.58,1223.07,Faith,"Faith: Rise and shine,"
1221.58,1223.07,Faith,people.
1223.15,1225.64,Buffy,It's your wakeup call.
1269.83,1271.53,Buffy,Hey!
1269.83,1271.53,Buffy,Oof.
1271.6,1272.69,Buffy,"You're not leaving,"
1271.6,1272.69,Buffy,are you?
1272.77,1274.63,Angel,I saw you making friends.
1274.7,1275.64,Buffy,Them?
1278.14,1281.76,Buffy,Boys. I like you.
1282.76,1284.52,Buffy,What's the matter?
1284.6,1287.5,Buffy,You're not afraid of
1284.6,1287.5,Buffy,"little me, are ya?"
1287.57,1289.4,Angel,We better sit down.
1287.57,1289.4,Angel,Come on.
1290.9,1293.93,Buffy,I can sense this is
1290.9,1293.93,Buffy,a business trip.
1295.31,1296.5,Buffy,What's the what?
1296.58,1298.1,Angel,Balthazar.
1298.18,1299.11,Buffy,Dead demon.
1299.18,1301.7,Angel,Not as dead as you think.
1304.22,1306.91,Angel,Word on the street puts him
1304.22,1306.91,Angel,in the packing warehouse on Devereau.
1306.99,1308.18,Angel,He's looking for...
1308.25,1310.38,Buffy,His amulet. It's supposed
1308.25,1310.38,Buffy,to restore his strength.
1310.46,1312.89,Angel,"From what I'm hearing, that's not"
1310.46,1312.89,Angel,something we'd like to see happen.
1312.96,1314.95,Buffy,No problem.
1312.96,1314.95,Buffy,We got the amulet.
1315.03,1317.29,Angel,"I know. I spoke to Giles,"
1315.03,1317.29,Angel,but he said you gave it...
1317.36,1318.8,Wesley,Ah. There you are.
1318.86,1320.7,Buffy,Ah. Speak of the really
1318.86,1320.7,Buffy,annoying person.
1320.77,1323.7,Wesley,You're certainly giving me
1320.77,1323.7,Wesley,a run for my money.
1325.87,1327.86,Angel,I think we ought
1325.87,1327.86,Angel,to establish
1327.94,1329.41,Wesley,that if you're going
1327.94,1329.41,Wesley,"to go out slaying,"
1329.48,1331.57,Wesley,you leave me a number
1329.48,1331.57,Wesley,where I can contact you.
1331.64,1333.58,Angel,Where is the amulet?
1334.75,1335.68,Wesley,Who are you?
1335.75,1337.58,Angel,A friend.
1335.75,1337.58,Angel,Do you have it?
1337.65,1339.74,Wesley,It's somewhere safe.
1342.15,1343.59,Wesley,How did you know?
1343.66,1345.09,Buffy,It pooches your jacket.
1345.16,1347.22,Wesley,"Now, hang on a minute..."
1347.29,1349.16,Angel,Walking around with this thing
1347.29,1349.16,Angel,is like wearing a target.
1349.23,1351.7,Buffy,You're gonna put it somewhere safe
1349.23,1351.7,Buffy,that's actually safe?
1351.76,1353.79,Angel,Yeah. I'll do it now.
1353.87,1355.27,Buffy,I'll do some recon
1353.87,1355.27,Buffy,on Balthazar.
1355.33,1356.7,Wesley,If I may...
1356.77,1358.2,Wesley,Balthazar is dead.
1358.27,1360.03,Wesley,Am I the only one
1358.27,1360.03,Wesley,that remembers that?
1360.11,1361.37,Angel,Be careful.
1361.44,1362.67,Buffy,You know me.
1362.74,1364.17,Angel,I mean it.
1367.75,1369.48,Wesley,What's going on?
1373.49,1374.68,Faith,Call me!
1376.52,1380.52,Balthazar,Let me tell you what I see.
1382.09,1385.33,Balthazar,I see fear...
1385.4,1388.3,Balthazar,and remorse...
1388.37,1391.7,Balthazar,and the pitiful
1388.37,1391.7,Balthazar,look of faces
1391.77,1394.86,Balthazar,that cry out for mercy.
1394.94,1396.87,Balthazar,But what I don't see
1396.94,1399.78,Balthazar,"is what I want to see,"
1399.85,1403.91,Vampire,and that's my amulet!
1403.98,1407.42,Vampire,"Lord Balthazar,"
1403.98,1407.42,Vampire,"we found it, we had it,"
1407.49,1408.42,Vampire,but the slayers...
1408.49,1410.35,Balthazar,Already I'm bored.
1419.67,1422.57,Balthazar,Vincent...
1422.63,1424.63,Balthazar,come here.
1424.7,1427.14,Balthazar,
1427.21,1428.37,Balthazar,Closer.
1430.88,1433.44,Balthazar,Closer.
1437.48,1441.89,Balthazar,Let me tell you...
1437.48,1441.89,Balthazar,what I want to see.
1450.83,1452.52,Balthazar,"Buffy: OK, we got 10,"
1452.52,1453.89,Buffy,maybe 12 bad guys
1453.97,1457.73,Buffy,and one big demon in desperate need
1453.97,1457.73,Buffy,of a Stairmaster.
1457.8,1461.3,Faith,"I say we take 'em all,"
1457.8,1461.3,Faith,hard and fast and now.
1461.37,1463.86,Buffy,We need a little more
1461.37,1463.86,Buffy,firepower than none.
1463.94,1465.07,Buffy,We should head back
1463.94,1465.07,Buffy,to the library.
1465.14,1467.17,Faith,"Well, I guess Jacuzzi boy"
1465.14,1467.17,Faith,isn't going anywhere.
1467.25,1469.87,Faith,I just... wish we had...
1469.95,1470.94,Faith,Ah.
1471.02,1473.08,Faith,That is too good.
1482.09,1483.65,Faith,Ah. Score.
1488.7,1490.07,Buffy,Think they're insured?
1490.14,1493.16,Faith,"Strangely,"
1490.14,1493.16,Faith,not my priority.
1493.24,1495.26,Faith,When are ya gonna
1493.24,1495.26,Faith,"get this, B?"
1495.34,1498.17,Faith,Life for a slayer
1495.34,1498.17,Faith,is very simple... want...
1500.21,1501.2,Faith,"take,"
1501.28,1502.58,Buffy,have.
1505.82,1506.94,Faith,Want...
1508.42,1510.51,Faith,take...
1510.59,1511.75,Buffy,have.
1515.23,1516.99,Buffy,I'm gettin' it.
1527.31,1529.37,Officer,Freeze!
1529.44,1533.24,Officer,Drop the weapons and get
1529.44,1533.24,Officer,down on the ground! Now!
1538.68,1541.95,Officer,"I said drop the weapons,"
1538.68,1541.95,Officer,or I fire.
1551.33,1552.26,Officer,Now spread 'em.
1552.33,1553.89,Faith,You wish.
1555.07,1558.47,Officer,Hands in the air where
1555.07,1558.47,Officer,I can see 'em... slow!
1563.41,1565.93,Officer,Good. Now cuff'em.
1568.68,1570.91,Faith,I like him.
1570.98,1573.25,Faith,He's butch.
1575.12,1577.95,Officer,That's some artillery
1575.12,1577.95,Officer,you two were puttin' together.
1578.02,1580.79,Officer,You with one of them
1578.02,1580.79,Officer,girl gangs?
1580.86,1582.99,Faith,Yeah. We're the Slayers.
1587.37,1588.86,Faith,You want to get out here?
1598.02,1598.37,Faith,We can't save
1598.02,1598.37,Faith,the world in jail.
1617.16,1619.13,Faith,Got it. Got it.
1619.2,1620.13,Faith,Ow!
1620.2,1622.53,Buffy,We should call an ambulance.
1622.6,1625.47,Faith,"people already have,"
1622.6,1625.47,Faith,"the racket we made, and they're fine."
1628.41,1630.2,Faith,Come on.
1628.41,1630.2,Faith,Let's get outta here.
1630.28,1631.67,Faith,Come on!
1631.74,1633.68,Faith,
1651.6,1652.83,Joyce,Admit it.
1652.9,1655.2,Joyce,Some days don't you
1652.9,1655.2,Joyce,want to just wake up
1655.27,1657.2,Joyce,and say to hell
1655.27,1657.2,Joyce,with the diet?
1657.27,1658.96,Joyce,Want to make waffles?
1659.04,1661.16,Joyce,Big Saturday brunch?
1661.24,1664.33,Buffy,"No, thanks. I'm not"
1661.24,1664.33,Buffy,really that hungry.
1664.41,1665.38,Buffy,
1665.44,1670.02,Joyce,So what did you
1665.44,1670.02,Joyce,and Faith do last night?
1670.02,1668.83,Joyce,So what did you
1670.02,1668.83,Joyce,and Faith do last night?
1668.9,1670.17,Buffy,Nothing.
1670.24,1672.93,Buffy,Uh... nothing
1670.24,1672.93,Buffy,really important.
1674.94,1678.04,Joyce,Don't worry. I'm not gonna meddle
1674.94,1678.04,Joyce,in your slaying.
1678.11,1680.01,Joyce,Just as long
1678.11,1680.01,Joyce,as you're careful.
1680.08,1681.21,Buffy,I am.
1685.39,1687.38,Joyce,Sure about
1685.39,1687.38,Joyce,those waffles?
1689.26,1690.88,Buffy,Yeah.
1690.96,1693.19,Buffy,"But if you want them,"
1690.96,1693.19,Buffy,I can help you make them.
1693.26,1697.82,Joyce,No. They only don't have calories
1693.26,1697.82,Joyce,if I make them for you.
1697.9,1699.39,Joyce,Mom logic.
1699.47,1701.9,Joyce,"You, uh,"
1699.47,1701.9,Joyce,done with the paper?
1701.97,1703.3,Buffy,Yeah.
1703.37,1706.64,Joyce,Let's see what's
1703.37,1706.64,Joyce,happening in Sunnydale.
1708.41,1709.41,Mayor Wilkins,There we go.
1709.41,1711.17,,"Thanks a lot, fellas."
1711.25,1712.68,,Thanks a heap.
1712.75,1714.72,,"Hey, have fun on"
1712.75,1714.72,,"that camping trip, now."
1714.78,1718.22,,Don't forget to roast
1714.78,1718.22,,a wiener for me.
1718.29,1719.65,,
1719.72,1722.02,,Here we go.
1722.09,1724.02,,"All right,"
1722.09,1724.02,,you can come out now.
1725.59,1728.93,,"Backbone of America,"
1725.59,1728.93,,those little guys.
1729,1732.06,,Seeing the hope and courage
1729,1732.06,,"on their bright little faces,"
1732.13,1734.62,,I swear I could just...
1732.13,1734.62,,I could just eat 'em up.
1734.7,1735.63,,
1735.7,1740.02,,"So, any news"
1735.7,1740.02,,about the Eliminati?
1738.07,1741.7,,
1741.78,1746.02,,In the name of
1741.78,1746.02,,"Lord Balthazar, die!"
1745.75,1747.77,,
1747.85,1748.78,,"Thank you, Mr. Trick."
1748.85,1750.72,,That was very thoughtful
1748.85,1750.72,,of you.
1750.79,1754.22,,Why do they always
1750.79,1754.22,,gotta be using swords?
1754.29,1755.38,,"It's called an Uzi, ya chump."
1755.46,1756.95,,Could have saved your ass
1755.46,1756.95,,right about now.
1757.03,1759.26,,"You know, it's curious"
1757.03,1759.26,,how he could have gotten
1759.33,1761.56,,all the way
1759.33,1761.56,,into my liquor cabinet.
1761.63,1764.96,,"Allan, don't we have"
1761.63,1764.96,,security working in this building?
1765.03,1766.8,,"Sir, I..."
1766.87,1768.3,,I had no idea. I... I...
1768.37,1770.3,,There's no need
1768.37,1770.3,,"to swoon, Allan."
1770.37,1772.97,,But try to keep things
1770.37,1772.97,,secure.
1773.04,1774.74,,Lock him up.
1774.81,1777.33,,"He wake up, he's just gonna"
1774.81,1777.33,,try and kill you again.
1777.41,1780.78,,"Yes. Yes, I expect he will."
1782.55,1783.41,Angel,Balthazar:
1783.41,1785.82,Balthazar,Vincent made a noble effort.
1785.89,1789.98,Balthazar,"Man to man,"
1785.89,1789.98,Balthazar,as befits a true warrior.
1790.06,1792.69,Angel,
1792.76,1795.13,Balthazar,He had courage...
1795.2,1796.99,Balthazar,he had honor...
1799.13,1801.03,Balthazar,and I have jack
1801.03,1802.93,,to show for it!
1806.31,1808.4,,It has been a hundred years
1808.48,1812.04,,since my enemy crippled me.
1812.11,1817.85,,Now ultimate power
1812.11,1817.85,,is within his grasp.
1817.92,1822.32,,And I shall not let it be!
1822.39,1824.38,,Forget about honor!
1824.46,1826.52,,Forget about everything
1826.59,1829.93,,but getting my amulet!
1830,1832.13,,Bring the watchers to me!
1832.2,1835.14,,Find the slayers
1832.2,1835.14,,and kill them!
1835.2,1836.64,,Kill everything
1835.2,1836.64,,that gets in your way!
1836.7,1839.54,Buffy,Go!
1839.61,1842.34,Buffy,Go!
1842.48,1843.34,Buffy,Buffy: Mmm.
1843.41,1845.35,Willow,Willow: You like it?
1845.41,1847.28,Buffy,It smells good.
1845.41,1847.28,Buffy,What is it?
1847.35,1853.02,Willow,Just a little something we witches
1847.35,1853.02,Willow,like to call a protection spell.
1851.09,1853.65,Buffy,"Good deal, protection."
1853.72,1855.12,Buffy,"I'm surprised, though,"
1855.19,1856.18,Buffy,cause usually
1855.19,1856.18,Buffy,spell stuff s more...
1856.26,1859.09,Willow,Stinky. Yeah. That's why
1856.26,1859.09,Willow,I added lavender.
1859.16,1861.42,Willow,"Give me time,"
1859.16,1861.42,Willow,and I may be the first wicca
1861.5,1864.33,Willow,to do all my conjuring
1861.5,1864.33,Willow,in pine fresh scent.
1864.4,1865.99,Willow,So what's the plan?
1866.07,1869.13,Willow,For tonight's slayage.
1866.07,1869.13,Willow,"We're going, aren't we?"
1869.2,1871.07,Buffy,Yeah.
1871.14,1873.13,Willow,Great.
1873.21,1875.97,Buffy,But... there's a but.
1876.04,1879.84,Buffy,And that's but you
1876.04,1879.84,Buffy,shouldn't come... tonight.
1879.91,1881.35,Buffy,Is that cool?
1882.68,1883.62,Willow,"Well, sure."
1883.69,1885.15,Willow,Makes sense.
1885.22,1888.81,Willow,"You know... you'll be facing big,"
1885.22,1888.81,Willow,hairy danger.
1888.89,1891.42,Buffy,"Uh, bbiggest"
1888.89,1891.42,Buffy,and very hairy.
1891.49,1893.93,Willow,You'll be
1891.49,1893.93,Willow,risking your life.
1894,1894.93,Buffy,Right.
1895,1896.36,Buffy,And why risk yours?
1896.43,1898.92,Willow,Cause I'm your friend?
1901.02,1902.53,Buffy,"I know, Wil. That's exactly"
1901.02,1902.53,Buffy,why I don't want you going.
1902.6,1904.54,Buffy,It's... It's too dangerous.
1904.61,1907.3,Willow,But II've done
1904.61,1907.3,Willow,"this sort of thing before,"
1907.38,1910.44,Willow,"like, a million times,"
1907.38,1910.44,Willow,and I can totally handle myself.
1910.51,1913.81,Willow,"Besides,"
1910.51,1913.81,Willow,minty fresh protection.
1913.88,1914.87,Willow,So?
1914.95,1916.44,Buffy,
1916.52,1917.95,Faith,Ready? Time to motor.
1918.02,1919.51,Faith,"Hey, Willow."
1919.59,1921.68,Willow,Hi.
1921.76,1924.38,Buffy,"Uh, I really should..."
1924.46,1926.43,Buffy,but we'll hang out
1924.46,1926.43,Buffy,"later, right?"
1926.49,1927.93,Willow,Yeah. You go ahead.
1928,1929.96,Willow,I'll just get my stuff.
1938.61,1939.54,Willow,
1939.61,1941.47,Willow,Stupid.
1943.24,1944.68,Faith,You're quiet tonight.
1944.75,1947.04,Buffy,I just want
1944.75,1947.04,Buffy,to get this done.
1947.12,1949.11,Faith,Yeah. I'm dying
1947.12,1949.11,Faith,to test out the longbow.
1949.18,1951.01,Faith,I think it might be
1949.18,1951.01,Faith,my new thing.
1951.09,1953.05,Buffy,I can't believe you went back
1951.09,1953.05,Buffy,for that stuff.
1953.12,1954.35,Faith,"Hey, how do you feel"
1953.12,1954.35,Faith,about getting some ribs?
1954.42,1955.45,Faith,"You know,"
1954.42,1955.45,Faith,after we're done.
1958.13,1961.06,Wesley,I didn't say you had
1958.13,1961.06,Wesley,emotional problems.
1961.13,1964.1,Wesley,I said you had an emotional problem.
1961.13,1964.1,Wesley,It's quite different.
1964.17,1967.6,Giles,My attachment to the slayer
1964.17,1967.6,Giles,is not a problem.
1967.67,1968.6,Giles,In point of fact...
1968.67,1970.47,Wesley,The way you've handled
1968.67,1970.47,Wesley,this assignment
1970.54,1972.84,Wesley,is something of an embarrassment
1970.54,1972.84,Wesley,to the Council.
1972.91,1974.81,Giles,If you want to criticize
1972.91,1974.81,Giles,"my methods, fine."
1974.88,1976.5,Giles,But you can keep your
1974.88,1976.5,Giles,snide remarks to yourself.
1976.58,1978.91,Giles,"And while you're at it,"
1976.58,1978.91,Giles,don't criticize my methods.
1978.98,1983.51,Wesley,"The fact is, you're"
1978.98,1983.51,Wesley,no longer qualified to act as watcher.
1983.58,1985.14,Giles,It's not your fault.
1985.22,1988.15,Wesley,You've done well.
1988.22,1990.87,Wesley,It's simply time for somebody else
1990.87,1992.28,Giles,to take the field.
1992.36,1994.83,Giles,Now's a good time
1992.36,1994.83,Giles,to start.
1998.33,1999.46,Giles,
2004.87,2006.1,Faith,Screw it.
2012.85,2014.31,Faith,I think we've got
2012.85,2014.31,Faith,more comin'!
2014.38,2015.71,Buffy,We're never gonna
2014.38,2015.71,Buffy,make it to the warehouse.
2015.78,2017.81,Faith,If they keep coming one
2015.78,2017.81,Faith,"at a time, we got a shot."
2029.23,2030.29,Buffy,"Faith, no!"
2039.64,2041.57,Buffy,Don't move.
2041.64,2043.97,Faith,I didn't... I didn't know.
2044.05,2044.98,Faith,I didn't know.
2045.05,2047.48,Buffy,"We need to call 911, now!"
2047.55,2049.48,Buffy,Don't move. It's OK.
2053.29,2055.95,Buffy,I need something
2053.29,2055.95,Buffy,to stop the...
2079.9,2081.34,Faith,We gotta go!
2081.4,2082.93,Faith,"Come on, we gotta go!"
2092.75,2093.72,Faith,"All right, come on."
2109.33,2110.26,Buffy,Angel.
2110.33,2113.06,Angel,"Buffy, I've been"
2110.33,2113.06,Angel,looking for you.
2116.14,2117.47,Angel,Your hand.
2117.54,2118.73,Buffy,It's OK.
2118.81,2120.71,Angel,I've just been
2118.81,2120.71,Angel,at the warehouse.
2120.78,2123.04,Angel,I was waiting for you.
2123.11,2124.31,,They got Giles.
2153.31,2156.68,Buffy,
2156.75,2158.71,Balthazar,The front! The front!
2158.78,2161.08,Balthazar,Moisten the front!
2161.15,2164.52,Balthazar,Oooh!
2164.59,2165.92,Wesley,"Oh, God."
2168.56,2169.52,Wesley,"Oh, God!"
2169.59,2171.32,Giles,It doesn't seem
2169.59,2171.32,Giles,"too promising, does it?"
2171.39,2173.76,Wesley,"Stay calm, Mr. Giles."
2171.39,2173.76,Wesley,We have to stay calm.
2173.83,2176.63,Giles,"Well, thank God you're here."
2173.83,2176.63,Giles,I was planning to panic.
2176.7,2178.13,Wesley,What is that thing?
2178.2,2179.93,Wesley,Aaahh.
2182.02,2181.63,Giles,That would be
2182.02,2181.63,Giles,your demon.
2181.7,2183.5,Giles,"You know,"
2181.7,2183.5,Giles,the dead one?
2183.57,2186.3,Wesley,There's no need
2183.57,2186.3,Wesley,to get snippy.
2186.38,2188.47,Balthazar,Bring them closer.
2188.54,2189.64,Balthazar,
2192.95,2194.97,Balthazar,You know what I want.
2195.05,2196.78,Giles,If it's for me to scrub
2195.05,2196.78,Giles,"those hardtoreach areas,"
2196.85,2198.05,Giles,I'd like to request
2196.85,2198.05,Giles,you kill me now.
2198.12,2199.52,Giles,
2199.59,2200.52,Giles,Ow.
2200.59,2201.68,Wesley,Are you out of your mind?
2201.76,2203.09,Wesley,This is hardly
2201.76,2203.09,Wesley,the time for games!
2203.16,2205.29,Giles,Why not? They're going
2203.16,2205.29,Giles,to torture us to death anyway.
2205.36,2205.36,Giles,
2205.36,2208.06,Balthazar,You're not wrong about that.
2208.13,2209.4,Balthazar,"Now, hold on. We can deal"
2209.4,2210.46,Wesley,with this rationally.
2210.53,2212.47,Wesley,We have something you want.
2212.53,2214.16,Wesley,You have something we want.
2214.24,2216.3,Balthazar,Hmm...
2216.37,2220.37,Balthazar,A trade. Intriguing.
2220.44,2222.5,Balthazar,No. Wait. Boring.
2222.58,2223.88,Wesley,Pull off his kneecaps!
2223.95,2227.02,Wesley,"Nooo! No, no, no!"
2225.08,2226.84,Wesley,The slayer
2225.08,2226.84,Wesley,gave it to someone.
2226.92,2228.82,Balthazar,"A tall man, a friend..."
2226.92,2228.82,Balthazar,a friend of hers.
2228.88,2230.22,Balthazar,I can tell you everything.
2230.29,2232.22,Balthazar,"Quiet, you twerp!"
2230.29,2232.22,Balthazar,They'll kill us both.
2232.29,2235.26,Balthazar,But I like to have
2232.29,2235.26,Balthazar,my kneecaps.
2235.32,2238.26,Balthazar,You will tell us everything!
2238.33,2240.26,Wesley,Yes! Sir.
2240.33,2243.03,Balthazar,What is this friend's name?
2246.04,2247.73,Wesley,I didn't actually catch it.
2247.8,2249.07,Giles,"Look, um, tell you what,"
2249.14,2250.22,Giles,let Captain Courageous
2250.22,2250.61,Balthazar,"here go,"
2250.67,2253.7,Giles,and I'll tell you what you need to know.
2250.67,2253.7,Giles,How's that deal?
2253.78,2255.3,Balthazar,There is one deal!
2255.38,2259.44,Balthazar,"You will die quickly,"
2255.38,2259.44,Balthazar,or you will die slowly!
2259.52,2263.18,Balthazar,The man who has my amulet!
2263.25,2266.28,Angel,What is his name?!
2266.36,2267.52,Angel,His name is Angel.
2283.04,2285.91,Balthazar,Un... 
2285.97,2287.81,Balthazar,Unacceptable!
2292.35,2295.98,Balthazar,Unacceptable!
2296.05,2297.21,Balthazar,Hyaaah!
2308.93,2310.62,Wesley,"Oh, Mr. Giles!"
2310.62,2311.23,Giles,Down!
2381.74,2382.67,Balthazar,Slayer!
2385.51,2386.84,Balthazar,You think you've won.
2388.58,2390.44,Giles,
2392.65,2395.62,Balthazar,When he rises...
2395.68,2400.85,Balthazar,you'll wish
2395.68,2400.85,Balthazar,I'd killed you all.
2410.88,2415.25,Mayor Wilkins,Potestatem matris nostrae
2410.88,2415.25,Mayor Wilkins,in tenebris invoco.
2415.32,2419.22,Mayor Wilkins,Maledictum filium tuum
2415.32,2419.22,Mayor Wilkins,ab omni periculo
2419.29,2422.73,Mayor Wilkins,custodias nunc
2419.29,2422.73,Mayor Wilkins,et in saecula.!
2422.8,2425.03,Giles,
2436.91,2438.97,Mayor Wilkins,I don't understand
2436.91,2438.97,Mayor Wilkins,why Allan would miss this.
2439.05,2440.84,Mayor Wilkins,He's usually so punctual.
2443.18,2445.08,Trick,Did it work?
2445.15,2446.71,Mayor Wilkins,Let's find out.
2445.15,2446.71,Mayor Wilkins,Open the cage.
2446.79,2448.15,Trick,You sure?
2448.22,2449.21,Mayor Wilkins,Oh! Hold on.
2456.2,2458.13,Mayor Wilkins,OK. Now we're ready.
2485.53,2487.08,Mayor Wilkins,Well...
2493.77,2498.7,Mayor Wilkins,This officially commences
2493.77,2498.7,Mayor Wilkins,the hundred days.
2498.77,2502.04,Mayor Wilkins,Nothing can harm me
2498.77,2502.04,Mayor Wilkins,until the ascension.
2508.02,2507.64,Mayor Wilkins,"Gosh,"
2508.02,2507.64,Mayor Wilkins,I'm feeling chipper.
2507.71,2512.02,Mayor Wilkins,Who's for a root beer?!
2520.16,2522.63,Mayor Wilkins,
2523.83,2525.35,Buffy,"Buffy: Faith, it's me."
2536.04,2537.84,Buffy,Hey.
2537.91,2538.84,Buffy,Hey.
2544.48,2547.61,Buffy,"So, I, uh..."
2551.83,2553.32,Buffy,How are ya doin'?
2553.39,2555.52,Faith,I'm all right.
2553.39,2555.52,Faith,You know me.
2558.3,2560.23,Buffy,"Faith, we need to talk"
2558.3,2560.23,Buffy,about what we're gonna do.
2560.3,2561.12,Faith,There's nothing
2561.12,2561.89,Buffy,to talk about.
2561.97,2563.44,Faith,I was doing my job.
2565.71,2568.7,Buffy,Being a slayer's not the same
2565.71,2568.7,Buffy,as being a killer.
2570.94,2573.88,Buffy,"Faith, please don't"
2570.94,2573.88,Buffy,shut me out here.
2573.95,2576.25,Buffy,"Look, sooner or later,"
2573.95,2576.25,Buffy,we're both gonna have to deal.
2576.32,2577.25,Faith,Wrong.
2577.32,2578.94,Buffy,We can help each other.
2579.02,2581.04,Faith,I don't need it.
2581.12,2583.92,Buffy,Yeah? Who's wrong now?
2583.99,2587.79,Buffy,"Faith, you can shut off"
2583.99,2587.79,Buffy,all the emotions that you want.
2587.86,2590.96,Buffy,"But eventually, they're"
2587.86,2590.96,Buffy,gonna find a body.
2591.03,2594.4,Faith,"OK, this is the last time"
2591.03,2594.4,Faith,"we're gonna have this conversation,"
2594.47,2597.06,Faith,"and we're not even having it now,"
2594.47,2597.06,Faith,you understand me?
2597.14,2598.07,Buffy,There is no body.
2598.14,2600.54,Buffy,"I took it, weighted it,"
2598.14,2600.54,Buffy,and dumped it.
2600.61,2602.94,Buffy,The body doesn't exist.
2605.02,2604.53,Buffy,Getting rid
2605.02,2604.53,Buffy,of the evidence
2604.61,2607.17,Buffy,doesn't make
2604.61,2607.17,Buffy,the problem go away.
2607.25,2608.65,Faith,It does for me.
2608.72,2610.74,,"Faith, you don't get it."
2610.82,2612.94,,You killed a man.
2613.02,2616.58,,"No, you don't get it."
2616.66,2618.32,,I don't care.
