2.21,4.52,GLORY,You keep refusing to tell me where the Key is.
4.61,9.64,MONK,We had to hide the Key.
4.61,9.64,MONK,Made it human and sent it to you.
10.45,10.85,BUFFY VOICEOVER,Dawn.
10.85,12.6,DAWN,What's wrong with Mom?
12.69,15.3,GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
15.3,16.13,BUFFY,I don't know.
16.21,20.84,RILEY,"Buffy's like nobody else. When I'm with her,"
16.21,20.84,RILEY,"it's like half of me is just on fire,"
20.93,25.48,RILEY,going crazy if I'm not touching her.
20.93,25.48,RILEY,But she doesn't love me.
26.05,27.93,RILEY,I know you got a lot on your mind.
28.01,31.64,RILEY,If you decide you wanna let me in
28.01,31.64,RILEY,"on any of it, you let me know."
32.57,37.17,SANDY,We could go somewhere else.
32.57,37.17,SANDY,Someplace more private.
38.41,39.61,RILEY,"Sandy, Sandy."
39.97,42.57,RILEY,My heart belongs to another.
43.25,45.4,RILEY,"Besides, I don't go out with vampires."
47.01,49.48,BUFFY,"Spike, I want you."
52.09,53.89,SPIKE,"God, I love you so much."
54.69,57.05,SPIKE,"Oh, God, no. Please, no."
58.17,59.29,BUFFY,Are you OK?
59.37,63.76,JOYCE,The "nothing" I've been dealing with
59.37,63.76,JOYCE,the last two weeks might not be nothing.
63.85,64.97,BUFFY,What is it?
65.05,69.97,JOYCE,I'm staying overnight at the hospital
65.05,69.97,JOYCE,for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan.
73.02,77.07,JOYCE,Advertise your product or brand here
73.02,77.07,JOYCE,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
119.29,121.28,DAWN,What is a CAT scan exactly?
124.41,127.85,BUFFY,"I don't know. It's some xray, I guess."
129.93,132.53,DAWN,Where do they get the "CAT" scan from?
134.41,136.8,DAWN,"I mean, do they test it on cats or..."
139.37,142.01,DAWN,Or does the machine sorta look like a cat?
142.01,143.21,BUFFY,"Dawn, I'm really..."
162.49,165.96,TARA VOICEOVER,Your OneStop Spot to Shop
162.49,165.96,TARA VOICEOVER,for all your Occult Needs."
166.05,166.79,TARA,Catchy.
166.79,167.73,GILES,Think so?
167.81,171.6,TARA,"Uhhuh, in a hardtoread sort of way,"
167.81,171.6,TARA,but I think it's great.
175.69,177.29,XANDER,I'm saying I think it's rude.
177.29,178.61,WILLOW,I wouldn't call it rude.
178.69,181.29,XANDER,Rudeish. Rudeesque.
178.69,181.29,XANDER,Whatever you wanna call it.
181.37,186.08,XANDER,"If you make a destroyallvampires date,"
181.37,186.08,XANDER,it's courtesy to wait for your codestroyers.
186.17,187.61,XANDER,"Am I right, Giles?"
187.69,190.84,GILES,I'm almost certain you're not
187.69,190.84,GILES,"but, to be fair, I wasn't listening."
190.93,193.97,TARA,The new phone book's in with Mr Giles's ad.
195.25,197.45,WILLOW,Nice.
197.53,199.13,ANYA,Am I mentioned?
199.13,200.41,GILES,Not as such.
200.97,205.73,XANDER,We were supposed to hook up with Riley to
200.97,205.73,XANDER,take on a nest o' vamps holed up in a tomb?
205.81,208.49,XANDER,So we get there and guess what?
205.81,208.49,XANDER,"Tell him, Will."
208.69,209.94,WILLOW,Tomb go boom.
209.94,210.33,XANDER,Yep.
210.41,214.33,XANDER,Captain America blowed it up real good.
210.41,214.33,XANDER,All by his Ionewolf Ionesome.
214.41,216.01,GILES,Rather reckless of him.
216.01,217.41,XANDER,I'd say very rather.
217.49,220.53,GILES,I should think you'd be pleased
217.49,220.53,GILES,to avoid the confrontation.
220.61,226.17,ANYA,"That's what I've been saying. I mean, I for one"
220.61,226.17,ANYA,didn't wanna start my day with a slaughter.
226.25,229.72,ANYA,Which really just goes to show
226.25,229.72,ANYA,how much I've grown.
231.17,233.81,GILES,"Yes. In any event, since you're all here,"
233.89,237.93,GILES,Tara and I could use your help
233.89,237.93,GILES,researching Buffy's mysterious woman.
238.21,240.17,XANDER,"Oh, yeah. This has been fruitful."
240.25,243.8,XANDER,Trying to look up something
240.25,243.8,XANDER,you never saw and don't know the name of.
243.89,247.25,ANYA,Just do what I do.
243.89,247.25,ANYA,Flip through the pages and look busy.
247.33,250.56,WILLOW,"It'd be nice if we knew where she was,"
247.33,250.56,WILLOW,where she's hiding out.
250.65,253.45,XANDER,No doubt lurking around
250.65,253.45,XANDER,some sewer or condemned church
253.53,257.53,XANDER,or ratinfested warehouse.
253.53,257.53,XANDER,"You know, the usual haunts."
257.61,260.53,DREG,Most Beauteous
257.61,260.53,DREG,"and Supremely Magnificent One,"
260.77,265.53,DREG,this dark spell I hold in my worthless
260.77,265.53,DREG,"and scabby hand is our gift to you,"
265.61,268.17,DREG,Most Tingly and Wonderful Glorificus.
268.25,270.24,GLORY,"Please, call me Glory."
270.33,272.4,GLORY,Get up.
270.33,272.4,GLORY,Looking at you is hurting my neck.
272.49,275.21,DREG,"Forgive me, Shiny Special One."
275.29,278.52,DREG,I beg of you to rip out my inadequate tongue.
278.61,280.6,GLORY,Gimme.
288.41,290.72,DREG,I thought...
291.29,294.33,DREG,"You should know,"
291.29,294.33,DREG,"Your Elaborate Marvellousness,"
294.45,299.37,DREG,that this dark incantation has been lost for
294.45,299.37,DREG,"aeons, and great dangers have been faced..."
299.45,302.29,GLORY,Does this pump make my ankle look bony?
303.01,304.81,DREG,No.
305.37,308.97,DREG,"No, Your Terrifically Smooth One."
305.37,308.97,DREG,It is the epitome of ankles.
309.05,313.25,DREG,To touch such an ankle would be...
309.05,313.25,DREG,But I'm not touching. I'm backing away.
313.81,315.08,DREG,Thank you.
315.08,316.61,GLORY,"Dreg, is it?"
316.69,321.05,DREG,Yes. Dreg. Your Creamy Coolness
316.69,321.05,DREG,has honoured me by speaking my name.
321.25,323.49,DREG,Your voice is like a thousand songbirds...
323.49,325.04,GLORY,I never tire of hearing that.
325.13,328.52,GLORY,"Look, just so we're clear,"
325.13,328.52,GLORY,"this spell's gonna work, right?"
328.61,330.92,GLORY,Nothing worse than a gift that doesn't work.
331.01,337.02,GLORY,Then I'd have to get all mad and kill you.
331.01,337.02,GLORY,It's this whole big thing.
335.41,339.41,DREG,"It will work, Your Extremeness."
335.41,339.41,DREG,Provided you have the other items you need.
339.65,341.64,GLORY,Don't worry.
342.21,344.6,GLORY,"I'll have them, all right."
349.49,351.88,GLORY,I'll have it all.
415.57,417.56,RILEY,Hello?
418.33,420.32,RILEY,Buffy?
438.69,440.65,RILEY,What are you doing in here?
440.73,443.69,RILEY,"What, me? I was..."
443.77,447.65,RILEY,What are you doin' here?
443.77,447.65,RILEY,Looking for the girl who'll rip your arms off
447.73,450.49,RILEY,when she finds out you were in here.
450.49,452.25,SPIKE,"Oh, yeah? Well, me too."
456.97,459.81,RILEY,Were you just smelling her sweater?
460.89,461.96,SPIKE,No.
464.89,467.09,SPIKE,"Well, yeah, all right. I did."
467.17,469.73,SPIKE,It's a predator thing. Nothin' wrong with it.
469.81,473.17,SPIKE,"Know your enemy's scent,"
469.81,473.17,SPIKE,whet the appetite for a hunt.
474.57,478.57,SPIKE,That's the stuff. Slayer musk.
474.57,478.57,SPIKE,It's bitter and aggravating.
480.93,482.33,RILEY,Out.
484.97,488.09,SPIKE,"Watch it. Easy, you're bruisin' the leather."
489.57,493.93,SPIKE,Look. I know for a bleedin' fact
489.57,493.93,SPIKE,the Slayer wouldn't mind me bein' here.
494.01,497.24,RILEY,Right. What's a little sweatersniffing
494.01,497.24,RILEY,between sworn enemies?
497.33,498.27,RILEY,She in the habit of
498.27,499.56,SPIKE,buyin' her enemies drinks?
499.65,503.25,SPIKE,Cos she spent the better part of
499.65,503.25,SPIKE,"last night with me, doin' just that."
503.33,507.09,RILEY,Cos you guys are such tight pals.
503.33,507.09,RILEY,That's good. Tell me another.
507.17,514.02,SPIKE,"OK. Twice recently, she's had the"
507.17,514.02,SPIKE,loverWiccas do a deinvite on the house.
512.09,516.88,SPIKE,Keep out specific vamps. Asked yourself why
512.09,516.88,SPIKE,she's never taken my name off the guest list?
518.25,520.14,RILEY,Because you're harmless.
520.14,521.09,SPIKE,"Yeah, right."
522.29,524.73,SPIKE,"Takes one to know, I suppose."
524.81,529.05,SPIKE,At least I still got the attitude.
524.81,529.05,SPIKE,What you got? A piercing glance?
529.13,532.49,SPIKE,"Face it, white bread."
529.13,532.49,SPIKE,"Buffy's got a type, and you're not it."
532.57,538.02,SPIKE,"She likes us dangerous, rough,"
532.57,538.02,SPIKE,maybe bumpy in the forehead region.
536.09,540.72,SPIKE,"Not that she doesn't like you. But sorry,"
536.09,540.72,SPIKE,"Charlie, you're just not dark enough."
543.69,545.17,RILEY,Am I dark enough for you now?
545.17,547.21,SPIKE,Pull me back in. I'm startin' to sizzle.
547.29,550.37,RILEY,You don't know anything about Buffy.
547.29,550.37,RILEY,I know what she needs.
550.45,553.41,SPIKE,"So you're at the hospital now,"
550.45,553.41,SPIKE,givin' her what she needs?
553.49,555.08,RILEY,What are you talking about?
555.08,557.2,SPIKE,Don't you know? Didn't she tell you?
557.29,558.51,RILEY,You tell me.
558.51,560.25,SPIKE,Her mum's sickly.
560.33,563.17,SPIKE,Buffy took her to hospital
560.33,563.17,SPIKE,for a bit of prod 'n' probe.
563.25,568.37,SPIKE,"Bitesized one went too. You know,"
563.25,568.37,SPIKE,it's funny her not calling you about that.
568.85,570.76,SPIKE,I've known since last night.
571.53,573.52,SPIKE,Blanket!
592.05,593.05,BUFFY,Riley.
593.05,594.04,RILEY,Sorry.
594.93,598.21,RILEY,I heard. I thought maybe you'd need...
600.85,603.77,BUFFY,I do. I'm glad.
603.89,608.13,BUFFY,I just... I didn't...
603.89,608.13,BUFFY,"I mean, until we knew what it was..."
608.21,610.77,RILEY,I understand. How's she doing?
612.49,616.12,BUFFY,"Well, she's just had a CAT scan."
612.49,616.12,BUFFY,I was about to go in and find out.
617.65,620.12,BUFFY,Will you sit with Dawn while I talk to Mom?
620.21,622.14,BUFFY,She's in the waiting room.
622.14,623.41,RILEY,"Yeah, you got it."
632.69,634.76,BUFFY,Hi.
634.85,635.76,BUFFY,May I come in?
635.76,637.57,JOYCE,"Of course, baby. Come on in."
638.25,639.85,JOYCE,Where's Dawn?
639.93,642.49,BUFFY,With Riley. Watching TV in the waiting room.
642.57,645.93,DR. ISAACS,"Excuse me, I'm just gonna"
642.57,645.93,DR. ISAACS,check on the status of the OR.
647.69,649.45,BUFFY,The OR?
649.53,653.97,JOYCE,Dr Isaacs says I'm lucky
649.53,653.97,JOYCE,there's one available on such short notice.
654.65,660.02,JOYCE,"Some people wait for days,"
654.65,660.02,JOYCE,sometimes weeks.
658.89,661.49,BUFFY,"Mom, what did they find?"
662.61,666.37,JOYCE,A shadow. I've got a shadow.
666.45,668.57,JOYCE,Somewhere over there.
668.65,674.21,JOYCE,"He showed it to me, but they have to do"
668.65,674.21,JOYCE,a biopsy to find out exactly what it is.
680.09,683.09,JOYCE,The doctor says it's
680.09,683.09,JOYCE,too early to be concerned.
683.97,685.96,BUFFY,Right.
687.05,688.29,BUFFY,No concern.
688.29,690.65,JOYCE,Right. Just a shadow.
695.41,697.46,WILLOW VOICEOVER,I wish we knew what we were dealing with.
697.46,699.65,WILLOW,It feels like we're going around in circles.
699.73,704.41,XANDER,Our circles are going around in circles.
699.73,704.41,XANDER,"We've got dizzy circles here, Giles."
704.49,707.88,GILES,Weeping Buddha.
704.49,707.88,GILES,Shoulders your spiritual burden.
707.97,709.85,GILES,"Makes a lovely paperweight, too."
710.73,712.52,TARA,Maybe she's not in the books.
712.52,713.57,WILLOW,What do you mean?
713.65,719.92,TARA,"I mean, what if she's not a demon, sorceress"
713.65,719.92,TARA,"or spirit, or whatever these books cover?"
721.81,724.25,TARA,What if she's something else altogether?
724.33,726.32,GILES,Thank you. Come again.
727.25,729.32,GILES,"Something new, you mean?"
729.32,730.53,TARA,Something old.
731.77,734.41,TARA,So old it predates the written word.
735.13,738.84,WILLOW,"Giles, the Dagon Sphere."
735.13,738.84,WILLOW,You said that was created to repel...
740.13,742.33,GILES,ThatWhichCannotBeNamed.
742.81,745.41,WILLOW,"So, I'm thinking maybe she..."
745.49,747.64,GILES,Predates language itself?
750.57,755.04,XANDER,"If it means I don't have to read any more,"
750.57,755.04,XANDER,whoo. And might I add a big "hoo".
755.13,757.97,GILES,"If Tara's right, then we're blind."
758.37,764.05,GILES,"There's no way we can determine her moves,"
758.37,764.05,GILES,"her habits, where she'll turn up next."
765.57,766.61,GILES,I beg your...
766.61,767.09,GLORY,Uhhuh.
767.17,768.41,GLORY,I want these.
768.41,769.85,GILES,"Yes, of course."
771.45,774.11,GILES,Did you find everything all right?
774.11,775.05,GLORY,No problemo.
777.09,779.08,GILES,That's...
782.37,784.65,GILES,your receipt. And...
787.21,788.93,GILES,thank you.
793.09,796.56,GILES,She could be anywhere.
793.09,796.56,GILES,"But if she is as powerful as Buffy says,"
796.65,800.49,GILES,I imagine it won't be long
796.65,800.49,GILES,before she makes herself known.
848.57,852.17,DR. ISAACS,Everything went fine.
848.57,852.17,DR. ISAACS,They're moving her into Recovery now.
853.45,855.65,BUFFY,Do we have the results yet?
855.73,858.41,DR. ISAACS,Let's sit down over here for a minute.
855.73,858.41,DR. ISAACS,No.
859.13,863.73,BUFFY,"Excuse me. No, I don't mean to be rude."
859.13,863.73,BUFFY,It's just I've been sitting for hours.
863.81,867.57,BUFFY,"I don't wanna sit. I just... Tell me, please."
869.37,873.57,DR. ISAACS,Your mother has...
869.37,873.57,DR. ISAACS,the term is "lowgrade glioma".
874.81,876.8,DR. ISAACS,It's a brain tumour.
876.89,882.05,DR. ISAACS,The clinical name is oligodendroglioma.
876.89,882.05,DR. ISAACS,It's in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum.
882.13,885.73,DR. ISAACS,"In your mother's case,"
882.13,885.73,DR. ISAACS,the tumour seems to have started...
895.29,901.37,DR. ISAACS,"I know this is very difficult and, because"
895.29,901.37,DR. ISAACS,"of the nature of your mother's illness,"
901.45,904.68,DR. ISAACS,unfortunately things may
901.45,904.68,DR. ISAACS,progress very quickly.
904.77,906.73,BUFFY,Things? What things?
906.81,910.81,DR. ISAACS,Symptoms.
906.81,910.81,DR. ISAACS,There's a fair variety that might present.
911.61,914.41,DR. ISAACS,Loss of vision or appetite.
914.49,917.72,DR. ISAACS,Lack of muscle control. Mood swings...
917.81,919.93,BUFFY,But what can we do?
920.01,923.93,DR. ISAACS,"Not much, until we determine"
920.01,923.93,DR. ISAACS,"if the tumour's operable,"
925.53,928.13,DR. ISAACS,which we are working on.
929.41,933.53,BUFFY,Is there something that I...?
929.41,933.53,BUFFY,"I mean, can I help?"
933.61,934.94,BUFFY,There's some literature
934.94,936.45,DR. ISAACS,you might want to look at.
936.53,941.02,DR. ISAACS,"If we aren't able to go in surgically,"
939.09,942.32,DR. ISAACS,there are a number of new treatments
939.09,942.32,DR. ISAACS,that are very promising.
942.41,950.02,DR. ISAACS,Your mother's prognosis is a lot better today
942.41,950.02,DR. ISAACS,than it would have been only a year ago.
948.09,950.39,DR. ISAACS,"Even if the tumour's not operable,"
950.39,951.88,BUFFY,she has a real chance.
951.97,955.05,BUFFY,What's "a real chance"?
955.13,959.05,DR. ISAACS,Nearly one out of three patients
955.13,959.05,DR. ISAACS,with this condition does just fine.
960.01,964.61,DR. ISAACS,"Now, let me ask. Does your mother's"
960.01,964.61,DR. ISAACS,insurance company require copies
964.69,966.73,DR. ISAACS,of the MRI and pathology reports?
966.81,967.6,BUFFY,I'm not sure.
967.6,970.2,DR. ISAACS,"Well, just let me know as soon as possible."
970.29,974.84,DR. ISAACS,And I could use some information regarding
970.29,974.84,DR. ISAACS,your mom's lifestyle and home environment.
974.93,977.77,DR. ISAACS,"For instance, does she use a cellphone?"
977.85,979.92,BUFFY,"I think so, yeah."
980.01,982.57,BUFFY,She has one of those ear things.
982.65,989.21,DR. ISAACS,"OK. Is your house near any power lines,"
982.65,989.21,DR. ISAACS,"chemical plants, wastedisposal facilities?"
990.29,992.89,BUFFY,I don't know. Maybe.
992.97,995.57,DR. ISAACS,"Well, the more we know..."
996.45,998.57,BUFFY,I'm sorry.
1001.05,1004.76,BEN,"Excuse me, Doc, but they told me"
1001.05,1004.76,BEN,you're needed in ICU.
1004.85,1007.85,DR. ISAACS,"Excuse me, Miss Summers."
1007.85,1008.85,BUFFY,It's OK.
1013.85,1016.57,BEN,You looked like you needed
1013.85,1016.57,BEN,"a break. That guy's great,"
1016.65,1021.17,BEN,but he doesn't have that bone
1016.65,1021.17,BEN,in his head that tells him when to back off.
1021.25,1023.81,BUFFY,You mean that they didn't need him?
1024.01,1026.61,BEN,I'm sure someone does somewhere.
1024.01,1026.61,BEN,They always do.
1026.69,1030.21,BEN,He really is a good doctor.
1026.69,1030.21,BEN,Your mom's in good hands.
1030.29,1031.85,BUFFY,Thank you.
1031.93,1033.38,BUFFY,"It's Ben, right?"
1033.38,1033.92,BEN,Right.
1036.17,1040.09,BUFFY,He was just telling me
1036.17,1040.09,BUFFY,that there's nothing I can do.
1041.21,1043.59,BUFFY,And I'm gonna tell you the same thing.
1043.59,1044.97,BEN,Give yourself a break.
1045.05,1050.25,BEN,"Listen, your mom's gonna be unconscious"
1045.05,1050.25,BEN,"for at least another six, seven hours."
1051.53,1052.03,BUFFY,A break?
1052.03,1054.45,BEN,"Well, I just mean go out, get some air."
1054.53,1058.65,BEN,Come back later on this evening.
1054.53,1058.65,BEN,Talk to the doc then if you want.
1058.73,1061.33,BEN,My unsolicited advice for the day.
1069.93,1071.92,RILEY,Buffy.
1074.89,1076.33,BUFFY,It's bad.
1076.33,1077.45,RILEY,I know.
1079.85,1082.61,BUFFY,I have to do something.
1083.49,1084.51,RILEY,Do something?
1084.51,1087.57,BUFFY,"Yeah, like magic. Like a healing spell."
1087.85,1090.37,RILEY,"Buffy, people get sick."
1090.65,1092.73,RILEY,I don't think magic can help.
1092.73,1094.73,BUFFY,That attitude's not helping.
1096.21,1098.2,BUFFY,I have to try.
1099.41,1101.05,RILEY,OK.
1101.13,1105.33,BUFFY,I need to talk to Giles. Will you do me
1101.13,1105.33,BUFFY,a favour and drop Dawn off at school?
1105.41,1108.25,BUFFY,Tell her I'll meet her at the magic shop
1105.41,1108.25,BUFFY,when she gets off.
1108.33,1110.64,RILEY,Of course. Whatever you need me to do.
1112.53,1114.52,RILEY,Buffy.
1115.29,1118.13,RILEY,What do you want me
1115.29,1118.13,RILEY,to tell Dawn about your mom?
1126.09,1128.73,BUFFY,Tell her we don't know anything yet.
1152.29,1154.79,GILES,Your "heys" are startling the customers.
1154.79,1156.41,XANDER,And pretty much the state.
1156.49,1160.81,ANYA,You sold someone a Khul's amulet
1156.49,1160.81,ANYA,and a Sobekian bloodstone.
1160.89,1162.55,GILES,"Yes, I believe I did."
1162.55,1164.77,ANYA,Are you stupid or something?
1166.09,1168.61,GILES,Allow me to answer
1166.09,1168.61,GILES,that question with a firing.
1168.69,1169.84,XANDER,She's kidding.
1169.93,1175.8,XANDER,"An, we talked about the employeeemployer"
1169.93,1175.8,XANDER,vocabulary nonos. That was number five.
1175.89,1179.68,ANYA,You never sell these things
1175.89,1179.68,ANYA,"together, ever. Bad news."
1179.77,1182.36,ANYA,Don't you know about the Sobekites?
1182.36,1182.73,WILLOW,I do.
1182.81,1186.65,WILLOW,"It was an ancient Egyptian cult,"
1182.81,1186.65,WILLOW,heavy into dark magic.
1186.97,1189.81,TARA,Wasn't the Khul's amulet
1186.97,1189.81,TARA,a transmogrification conduit?
1189.89,1190.72,ANYA,Damn straight.
1190.72,1192.97,GILES,But I still see no reason for concern.
1193.05,1196.84,GILES,The Sobekian transmogrification
1193.05,1196.84,GILES,spells were lost thousands of years ago.
1196.93,1201.29,GILES,And the young woman to whom I sold them
1196.93,1201.29,GILES,would have to have had enormous power...
1201.37,1203.76,WILLOW,Young woman?
1204.85,1206.84,GILES,Dear Lord.
1208.29,1210.12,XANDER,What?
1220.13,1222.33,RILEY,You're melting.
1224.37,1226.6,DAWN,Guess I'm not hungry.
1228.89,1231.45,RILEY,Maybe I'm not making this any better.
1231.53,1233.52,DAWN,"No, I just..."
1234.37,1236.52,DAWN,This is better.
1242.37,1244.93,DAWN,I had my tenthbirthday party here.
1245.65,1246.81,RILEY,Really?
1246.81,1247.64,DAWN,Mmhm.
1249.13,1251.12,DAWN,We'd just moved to Sunnydale.
1251.21,1255.81,DAWN,Mom rented the carousel for
1251.21,1255.81,DAWN,an entire hour forjust me and my friends.
1256.73,1260.93,DAWN,"Except I hadn't made any friends yet,"
1256.73,1260.93,DAWN,so it was just me and Mom and Buffy
1261.01,1265.13,DAWN,"riding it by ourselves, over and over again,"
1266.17,1271.17,DAWN,"for the whole hour, just so Mom"
1266.17,1271.17,DAWN,felt like we'd gotten our money's worth.
1273.37,1275.36,DAWN,She's...
1276.01,1278.61,DAWN,"She's not gonna get better, is she?"
1279.93,1282.21,RILEY,Absolutely she will.
1282.29,1284.41,RILEY,Summers women are tough.
1288.57,1290.97,DAWN,I'm really glad you're here.
1290.97,1291.57,RILEY,Thanks.
1294.25,1296.37,DAWN,Buffy's glad too.
1297.81,1299.8,RILEY,Yeah?
1299.97,1304.41,DAWN,She sure cries a lot less with you
1299.97,1304.41,DAWN,than she did with Angel.
1304.49,1307.17,RILEY,Angel made her cry a lot?
1307.73,1310.65,DAWN,Everything with him
1307.73,1310.65,DAWN,"was all ""Eee!"", you know?"
1311.17,1312.73,RILEY,AII...?
1312.81,1317.44,DAWN,"You know, ""My boyfriend's"
1312.81,1317.44,DAWN,a vampire" crazycrazy.
1317.73,1320.96,DAWN,Every day was like the end of the world.
1321.05,1322.03,RILEY,She doesn't get all
1322.03,1323.52,DAWN,worked up like that over you.
1328.89,1332.04,DAWN,I think you've been really good for her.
1336.01,1337.49,DAWN,So I figure there has to be
1337.49,1338.97,BUFFY,some kind of mystical cure.
1339.05,1343.52,BUFFY,I mean like a potion or a spell
1339.05,1343.52,BUFFY,or something. We have to look.
1343.61,1348.08,WILLOW,"We can look. I mean, we will,"
1343.61,1348.08,WILLOW,but I haven't seen anything.
1348.17,1354.17,GILES,"The truth is, the mystical and"
1348.17,1354.17,GILES,"the medical aren't meant to mix, Buffy."
1354.61,1357.75,GILES,Sorry. The human mind is very delicate.
1357.75,1359.69,TARA,Too much could go wrong.
1359.77,1362.81,TARA,I've heard stories about
1359.77,1362.81,TARA,people trying healing spells.
1362.89,1363.91,TARA,If we did something
1363.91,1365.36,ANYA,it could make things worse.
1365.45,1370.24,ANYA,We've done just about enough making
1365.45,1370.24,ANYA,"things worse for one day, haven't we?"
1370.33,1372.53,BUFFY,Why? What do you mean?
1372.69,1378.53,XANDER,Nothing. Anya broke a bippity boppity boo.
1372.69,1378.53,XANDER,A thing. Don't worry about it.
1378.89,1380.96,ANYA,I did not. I didn't break...
1380.96,1381.33,GILES,Anya.
1381.41,1385.09,GILES,Buffy doesn't need to hear
1381.41,1385.09,GILES,about your clumsiness right now.
1385.17,1388.25,ANYA,"My clumsiness. I mean, that is so..."
1391.81,1395.93,ANYA,like me. Slippery butterfingers.
1396.01,1396.83,BUFFY,What happened?
1396.83,1398.29,GILES,Nothing to concern you...
1398.37,1400.6,BUFFY,Giles.
1402.05,1406.05,GILES,"The demon woman was here,"
1402.05,1406.05,GILES,the one who attacked you.
1406.89,1410.49,WILLOW,It's no biggie. She just got
1406.89,1410.49,WILLOW,an amulet and a bloodstone.
1410.57,1412.76,ANYA,That can create a monster.
1412.76,1413.69,WILLOW,OK. Biggie.
1413.77,1416.61,BUFFY,My God. Are you guys OK?
1413.77,1416.61,BUFFY,"I mean, no one got hurt, right?"
1416.77,1419.45,GILES,"No, thankfully. No violence to speak of."
1420.29,1422.65,BUFFY,"OK, so that's good."
1422.73,1426.09,BUFFY,How did she get away
1422.73,1426.09,BUFFY,with this bad mojo stuff?
1429.65,1432.53,ANYA,Giles sold it to her.
1433.49,1436.77,GILES,"I didn't know it was her. I mean, how could I?"
1438.09,1440.77,GILES,"If it's any consolation,"
1438.09,1440.77,GILES,I may have overcharged her.
1440.85,1443.73,TARA,Anya figured out
1440.85,1443.73,TARA,what the demon lady's up to.
1443.81,1448.13,ANYA,"Yeah, a few thousand years ago"
1443.81,1448.13,ANYA,"there was this cult, the Temple of Sobek."
1448.21,1449.65,BUFFY,Sobek?
1449.73,1453.09,ANYA,Reptile demon. Sobekites
1449.73,1453.09,ANYA,were reptile worshippers.
1453.77,1457.37,XANDER,Just once I would like to run into
1453.77,1457.37,XANDER,a cult of bunny worshippers.
1457.45,1460.41,ANYA,Great. Thank you very much
1457.45,1460.41,ANYA,for those nightmares.
1460.61,1462.68,XANDER,Sorry.
1462.77,1467.24,ANYA,"Anyway, their high priest Khul"
1462.77,1467.24,ANYA,had great mystic powers.
1467.33,1470.85,ANYA,He forged an amulet
1467.33,1470.85,ANYA,with a transmogrifying crystal.
1471.33,1476.45,WILLOW,Transmogrifying is changing a living thing
1471.33,1476.45,WILLOW,into a different kind of thing.
1476.53,1480.69,GILES,We've managed to decipher the markings
1476.53,1480.69,GILES,that were on the bloodstone that I sold...
1480.77,1485.24,GILES,that she left with. A cobra.
1480.77,1485.24,GILES,She's going to transmogrify a cobra.
1485.33,1488.88,BUFFY,"OK, so she's making a monster."
1485.33,1488.88,BUFFY,What for? What does it do?
1488.97,1491.81,GILES,That's the part... We're working on it.
1492.21,1497.02,BUFFY,"Well, you keep working on it. I'll go kill it."
1496.01,1496.59,GILES,Buffy?
1496.59,1498.13,BUFFY,What? I'm going.
1498.21,1500.31,XANDER,"Buffy, this chick creamed you last time."
1500.31,1502.57,BUFFY,I wasn't ready for her last time. I am now.
1502.65,1503.41,WILLOW,But you...
1503.41,1506.2,BUFFY,"But what? Will, I can'tjust sit here."
1506.29,1508.89,BUFFY,I have to do something.
1531.89,1536.28,GLORY,"Chill, worm. I'm gonna make you a star."
1549.33,1550.16,GLORY,Chant.
1557.01,1561.72,DREG,"Sobek, grant the power that it"
1557.01,1561.72,DREG,"may mould this wretched creature,"
1562.01,1565.21,GLORY,"that it may be reborn,"
1562.01,1565.21,GLORY,that it may serve.
1566.21,1568.89,GLORY,Dark incantations. Always overwritten.
1569.33,1571.32,GLORY,Why can't they just cut to the...
1571.41,1573.4,BUFFY,Fight?
1573.49,1574.69,GLORY,No fair.
1574.77,1577.57,GLORY,Attacking when I wasn't even looking.
1581.65,1583.85,GLORY,"No, this is no good."
1584.29,1588.17,GLORY,I'm out of the moment and
1584.29,1588.17,GLORY,you're not giving me anything I can use.
1588.25,1592.33,GLORY,"Dreg, I am not hearing chanting. Continue."
1592.41,1593.73,DREG,"Yes, Glory."
1597.37,1598.6,GLORY,Work with me here.
1601.53,1605.73,GLORY,"There. That feels more real, don't you think?"
1612.77,1615.37,GLORY,Even if I do have to carry your performance.
1617.25,1618.53,GLORY,Scene.
1622.41,1623.45,GLORY,Arise.
1625.09,1626.05,GLORY,Arise.
1629.53,1630.85,GLORY,Arise.
1641.33,1643.85,DREG,He is arisen.
1643.93,1645.92,GLORY,Bout damn time.
1653.37,1655.36,GLORY,Spawn of Sobek.
1661.05,1666.57,GLORY,"The power is yours to see what is unseen,"
1661.05,1666.57,GLORY,to find what is shrouded in shadow.
1667.25,1669.32,GLORY,"Already, you know what I seek."
1669.41,1674.36,GLORY,I have given you form. Now find for me
1669.41,1674.36,GLORY,the Key. Seek it out in the holy places.
1675.05,1676.93,GLORY,"Yes, yes, yes."
1677.01,1681.77,GLORY,"Let your vision guide you to its hiding place,"
1677.01,1681.77,GLORY,then return to me and tell me where it lies.
1687.53,1689.52,GLORY,Now would be good.
1693.45,1694.49,GLORY,"Fun, fun, fun."
1694.93,1698.53,GILES,Aleister Crowley Sings"?
1694.93,1698.53,GILES,"Sadly, no, I don't carry that,"
1698.61,1703.48,GILES,but I do have some very nice whale sounds.
1698.61,1703.48,GILES,Excuse me for a moment.
1705.81,1706.82,RILEY,Where's Buffy?
1706.82,1708.33,GILES,She left a while ago.
1708.65,1711.41,RILEY,What? Where?
1711.49,1715.73,XANDER,That creepy demon woman's
1711.49,1715.73,XANDER,conjuring some kind of monster.
1715.81,1718.2,RILEY,And you let Buffy go after her? Alone?
1718.29,1723.29,GILES,Let" isn't really a factor when she sets
1718.29,1723.29,GILES,her mind to something. You know that.
1725.45,1728.13,RILEY,She'll get herself killed. It's crazy.
1728.21,1733.49,XANDER,"Yeah, crazy. Going off alone, halfcocked,"
1728.21,1733.49,XANDER,instead of waiting for muchneeded backup.
1733.57,1736.85,XANDER,Charging in with a big ol'
1733.57,1736.85,XANDER,"hand grenade... Oh, wait."
1738.41,1740.3,RILEY,This is different.
1740.3,1741.56,XANDER,"Yeah, it is."
1741.65,1745.44,XANDER,"Buffy needs something she can fight,"
1741.65,1745.44,XANDER,something she can solve.
1745.81,1750.09,XANDER,I don't know what kind of action
1745.81,1750.09,XANDER,you're looking for. Do you?
1752.57,1754.52,XANDER,I'm not trying to get...
1754.52,1755.33,RILEY,It's cool.
1756.93,1758.41,XANDER,You OK?
1760.33,1763.25,RILEY,Just a little crazed. I hear ya.
1764.49,1767.17,RILEY,If she needs me...
1795.77,1798.14,GILES,"Magic Box, your onestop spot to shop for..."
1798.14,1798.97,BUFFY,"Giles, it's me."
1799.05,1800.96,GILES,Buffy. Are you all right?
1801.21,1803.2,BUFFY,"No, I'm really not."
1804.45,1807.25,BUFFY,I couldn't stop her.
1804.45,1807.25,BUFFY,I couldn't even slow her down.
1807.45,1808.79,GILES,Where are you?
1808.79,1810.6,BUFFY,Sunnydale Memorial.
1810.69,1813.56,GILES,Are you badly hurt? I'll come right over.
1813.56,1813.77,BUFFY,No.
1813.85,1817.89,BUFFY,"No, I just wanted to warn you that"
1813.85,1817.89,BUFFY,"that thing she conjured, it's loose."
1817.97,1822.29,BUFFY,"It's a big snake thing. Not Mayor big,"
1817.97,1822.29,BUFFY,but it's pretty lethalIooking.
1822.37,1824.28,GILES,Do you know why she raised it?
1824.28,1825.37,BUFFY,I don't know yet.

1846.81,1848.83,BUFFY,She doesn't know how bad it is.
1848.83,1850.2,GILES,We'll not say a word.
1851.25,1858.02,BUFFY,"Well, my mom's gonna wake up soon, and"
1851.25,1858.02,BUFFY,I should be there when the doctors tell her.
1856.09,1858.13,GILES,"She's in good hands, Buffy."
1858.61,1860.97,GILES,There's really nothing else you can do.

2061.13,2064.74,BUFFY,"So, any monsterreptile sightings?"

2065.77,2069.81,WILLOW,"Tara and I did a minipatrol earlier,"
2065.77,2069.81,WILLOW,but the biggie snake was nowhere to be...
2096.89,2098.11,XANDER,"Dawn, are you OK?"
2098.11,2100.77,WILLOW,Why was the big snake afraid of Dawn?
2101.01,2102.65,BUFFY,It knows.
2147.57,2150.24,BUFFY,I've gotta stop it before it gets back to Glory.
2150.24,2150.57,GILES,Glory?
