2.08,2.96,GILES VOICEOVER,Previously:
3.08,5.36,SPIKE,"If I'd known you were comin',"
3.08,5.36,SPIKE,I'd have baked a cake.
5.48,6.45,BUFFY,Tell me you love me.
6.45,6.99,SPIKE,I love you.
7.12,8.57,BUFFY,Tell me you want me.
8.57,9.87,SPIKE,I always want you.
12.02,12.8,XANDER,"Anya, you wanna marry me?"
12.92,14.11,ANYA,Yes.
14.24,15.33,XANDER,We're getting married.
15.33,16.12,BUFFY,Congratulations.
16.24,18.8,XANDER,"Wedding, one week! We have friends, family,"
18.92,21.39,XANDER,"demons flying in,"
18.92,21.39,XANDER,a todo list getting no shorter...
21.52,23.32,TARA,Can we not do this now?
23.44,25.64,TARA,I don't think this is gonna work.
25.76,27.91,WILLOW,Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
28.32,31.95,DAWN,Big wedding coming up.
28.32,31.95,DAWN,You and Tara are speaking again.
32.08,36.6,DAWN,You wanna call her? Invite her over?
32.08,36.6,DAWN,No. Too soon for so bold a manoeuvre.
36.72,37.35,BUFFY,It's over.
37.35,39.31,SPIKE,"I've memorised this tune, love."
39.44,42.16,BUFFY,"I'm using you, and it's killing me."
43.52,45.8,BUFFY,"I'm sorry, William."
51.24,54.2,HALFREK,I know there's been a lot of loss.
54.32,57.04,DAWN,People have a tendency to go away.
57.16,60.6,DAWN,And sometimes I wish
57.16,60.6,DAWN,I could just make them stop.
61.64,63.47,HALFREK,Wish granted.
66.2,68.27,WILLOW,"Buffy, it's hideous."
68.4,71.55,WILLOW,"Oh, my God, Buffy. Look at its arms."
72.44,74.64,BUFFY,I know.
74.76,78.44,BUFFY,But it's my duty. I'm Buffy the bridesmaid.
80.28,83.24,WILLOW,"Duty, schmuty. I'm supposed to be best man."
83.36,86.96,WILLOW,Shouldn't I be all Marlene Dietrichy
83.36,86.96,WILLOW,in a dashing tuxedo number?
87.08,88.31,BUFFY,No.
88.44,93.67,BUFFY,That would be unfair. We must share equally
88.44,93.67,BUFFY,in the cosmic joke that is bridesmaidsdom.
96.28,102.15,WILLOW,"Well, maybe if I ask Anya, I can still go"
96.28,102.15,WILLOW,with the traditional blood larva and burlap.
102.28,105.08,WILLOW,She was a vengeance demon
102.28,105.08,WILLOW,for a thousand years.
105.2,108.56,WILLOW,She would know
105.2,108.56,WILLOW,all the most flattering larvae.
109.56,111.87,WILLOW,What was she thinking?
114.02,114.43,BUFFY,"She's probably too stressed to be thinking,"
114.56,117.87,BUFFY,what with Xander's relatives and her demons.
120.02,120.39,WILLOW,"Oh, my God, last night,"
120.02,120.39,WILLOW,the rehearsal dinner.
120.52,125.23,WILLOW,It was like a zoo without the table manners.
120.52,125.23,WILLOW,And I bet it got worse after we left.
125.36,129.43,BUFFY,I can't believe everyone bought that story
125.36,129.43,BUFFY,about Anya's people being circus folk.
129.56,131.68,BUFFY,Did you see the guy with the tentacles?
131.68,133.31,WILLOW,What's he? Inky the Squid Boy?
133.64,138.03,WILLOW,And Xander's family. I haven't seen them
133.64,138.03,WILLOW,that bad since my Bat Mitzvah.
138.16,140.37,WILLOW,Did you see how much they drank?
140.37,143,BUFFY,Kinda. Mr Harris threw up in my purse.

156.02,156.36,ANYA,You guys look so beautiful!
158.12,161.48,ANYA,This is the happiest day of my whole life!
163.56,165.29,XANDER VOICEOVER,"You seen my cuff links, Uncle Rory?"
165.29,167.16,XANDER,"Metal deals, hold my sleeves together?"
167.28,170.96,UNCLE RORY,You don't want those.
167.28,170.96,UNCLE RORY,What you really want is Velcro.
171.08,173.6,UNCLE RORY,Did I ever tell you how that was my idea?
173.6,175.07,KRELVIN,Scuse me. How you doin'?
175.2,177.11,XANDER,Good.
177.56,179.55,XANDER,Rory? What you doin' there?
179.68,183.88,UNCLE RORY,"I'm tryin' to make myself an Irish coffee,"
179.68,183.88,UNCLE RORY,but this stupid thing is on the fritz.
186.02,186.47,XANDER,"Watch it, it's still plugged in."
188.88,190.6,UNCLE RORY,Gotcha.
190.72,194.03,KRELVIN,"Oh, is that broken?"
190.72,194.03,KRELVIN,You want me to take a look at that?
194.8,196.87,UNCLE RORY,"Knock yourself out there, Kevin."
199.02,199.07,KRELVIN,It's Krelvin.
199.2,201.56,UNCLE RORY,Right. Right. Krelvin.
207.72,209.63,MR. HARRIS,"Xander, you're not ready yet?"
209.63,210.68,MRS. HARRIS,Look at my hair.
210.8,212.16,MRS. HARRIS,It doesn't really matter
212.16,214.32,XANDER,cos I won't be in any of the pictures.
214.44,216.26,XANDER,"You'll be in the pictures, Mom."
216.26,218.07,KRELVIN,I think your hair looks lovely.
219.36,221.48,XANDER,How's about some breakfast?
221.6,225.8,MRS. HARRIS,"Well, I guess if I'm a little plump"
221.6,225.8,MRS. HARRIS,it doesn't matter cos I won't really be...
225.92,228.19,XANDER,"You'll be in the pictures, Ma!"
228.19,230.15,MR. HARRIS,"That's one of hers, right?"
231.32,232.88,MR. HARRIS,"You're one of hers, right?"
235.02,236,XANDER,"You met Krelvin already, Dad. Last night."
236,236.31,KRELVIN,Yeah. We met.
236.44,239.48,KRELVIN,You said I resembled your motherinlaw.
239.6,240.45,MRS. HARRIS,Tony!
240.45,241.99,MR. HARRIS,"Oh, yeah."
242.12,246.35,KRELVIN,"And then you hit me with a cocktail wiener,"
242.12,246.35,KRELVIN,and then you insulted my heritage.
246.48,248.28,KRELVIN,Heritage?
248.4,251.6,MR. HARRIS,Bein' circus folks
248.4,251.6,MR. HARRIS,is suddenly heritage now?
252.12,254.44,MR. HARRIS,"I mean no disrespect, of course."
254.44,258.59,MR. HARRIS,I'm sure you come from a
254.44,258.59,MR. HARRIS,"long, proud line of geeks."
259.72,261.53,MR. HARRIS,Kidding. Just kidding.
261.53,262.76,COUSIN CAROL,Xander? Xander.
263.64,268.19,COUSIN CAROL,You know that guy Kevin?
263.64,268.19,COUSIN CAROL,"If he could clear up the skin problem,"
268.32,272.28,COUSIN CAROL,do you think... do you suppose
268.32,272.28,COUSIN CAROL,he'd date a woman with a kid?
272.4,275.47,COUSIN CAROL,"I mean, I really can't afford"
272.4,275.47,COUSIN CAROL,to be very picky.
275.6,279.15,XANDER,"Cousin Carol, your earrings"
275.6,279.15,XANDER,are my cuff links.
279.52,282.48,COUSIN CAROL,"They are? Oh, my. Oops."
282.6,286.7,XANDER,Excellent. Cuff links  check.
282.6,286.7,XANDER,We're rollin'.
286.74,288.47,XANDER,Nothing on earth can stop this wedding now.
356.32,358.26,XANDER,Is it too small?
358.26,358.75,BUFFY,Nah.
359.68,363.23,XANDER,It fit when I picked up the tux.
359.68,363.23,XANDER,How can it not fit now?
364.36,365.87,BUFFY,It'll fit.
366.24,368.44,XANDER,"Man, what if it doesn't?"
368.56,373.19,XANDER,"What if I can't wear my kummerbund, and"
368.56,373.19,XANDER,the world can see my pants meet my shirt?
373.32,376.31,XANDER,"Buffy, that cannot happen."
373.32,376.31,XANDER,I must wear das kummerbund!
376.44,379.03,BUFFY,And so you shall!
380.96,381.97,XANDER,You got it!
381.97,383.43,BUFFY,Slayer strength.
384.4,387.84,XANDER,I've been meanin' to cut back
384.4,387.84,XANDER,on that habitforming oxygen.
387.96,392.8,BUFFY,"Look at you. You look great,"
387.96,392.8,BUFFY,Mr About To Get Married. Glowing.
394.88,397.44,BUFFY,"Oh, my God! Maybe you're pregnant!"
397.56,400.6,XANDER,Maybe. I dunno. Maybe I'm just happy.
406.92,407.91,XANDER,Teary.
409.8,411.79,BUFFY,Good. Good teary.
411.92,415.44,XANDER,Happy teary?
411.92,415.44,XANDER,Not frustratedwithbowtie teary?
416.48,418.95,BUFFY,Yes. Happy.
419.08,420.99,BUFFY,Happy for you.
421.12,425.19,BUFFY,That makes me happy for me.
421.12,425.19,BUFFY,You and Anya give me hope.
425.32,427.31,BUFFY,It's like you two are proof
427.44,432.12,BUFFY,that there's light at the end of
427.44,432.12,BUFFY,"this very long, long, nasty tunnel."
433.28,437.8,BUFFY,And I cannot tie this tie. Where's your
433.28,437.8,BUFFY,best man? Isn't she supposed to do this?
437.92,439.8,XANDER,She said she had something to do.
441.68,444.41,WILLOW,Want me to hold it shut for you?
444.41,444.67,TARA,OK.
448.02,449.12,ANYA,Are you guys even listening?
448.02,449.12,ANYA,"I need feedback, people."
449.24,453.36,TARA,Sorry. Please continue with the vows.
449.24,453.36,TARA,OK.
453.48,455.99,ANYA,"I, Anya, promise to..."
456.12,460.88,ANYA,"love you, to cherish you, to honour you,"
456.12,460.88,ANYA,"but not to obey you, of course "
463.02,465.92,ANYA,that's anachronistic and misogynistic and
463.02,465.92,ANYA,"who do you think you are, a sea captain?"""
466.04,469.03,ANYA,"However, I do entrust you... """
469.16,471.54,ANYA,What? Is something funny?
471.54,475.16,TARA,"No, nothing, sweetie. Just keep still."
476.28,478.4,TARA,"OK. Blah, blah, blah, misogynistic."
478.52,483.8,ANYA,"Blah, blah... ""I do, however,"
478.52,483.8,ANYA,entrust you with my heart. "
483.92,486.67,ANYA,"Take care of my heart, won't you, please?"""
486.8,489.31,ANYA,Take care of it because
486.8,489.31,ANYA,it's all that I have. "
489.44,492.99,ANYA,"And, if you let me,"
489.44,492.99,ANYA,I'll take care of your heart too. "
493.92,498.28,ANYA,"I'll protect it and tend to it,"
493.92,498.28,ANYA,like a little stray. "
498.4,502.19,ANYA,"Wait, no. ""Like a little"
498.4,502.19,ANYA,mangy stray that needs a home. "
502.32,504.47,ANYA,"No, that's not it either."
505.72,508.39,TARA,I think we're all set here.
508.52,510.91,TARA,Let's take a look at you.
518.44,519.79,WILLOW,Wow.
519.92,522.64,WILLOW,You look lovely. Really lovely.
523.4,527.19,ANYA,Thanks. It's probably the blush
523.4,527.19,ANYA,of imprudent spending.
527.32,530.87,ANYA,Do you think Xander will like it?
527.32,530.87,ANYA,"Oh, I want to see Xander now!"
533.02,535.39,WILLOW,You can't. It's bad luck for the groom
533.02,535.39,WILLOW,"to see the bride in her dress, remember?"
535.52,539.67,ANYA,Right. I can't keep all these
535.52,539.67,ANYA,ridiculous traditions straight.
539.8,544.95,ANYA,What if I'm not wearing my dress
539.8,544.95,ANYA,"when I see him? OK, no sex. Cuddling?"
548.02,549.23,ANYA,It's just I'm so excited
548.02,549.23,ANYA,and I want to share it with my best friend.
549.36,552.51,ANYA,I get to be with my best friend for ever!
559.72,561.98,UNCLE RORY,Guess who agreed to be my date
559.72,561.98,UNCLE RORY,for tonight.
561.98,564.24,CATERER,I'm really supposed to be working.
564.36,565.95,CATERER,I'm one of the caterers.
565.95,568.67,UNCLE RORY,"Oh, hush. No woman of mine is gonna work."
568.8,573.03,UNCLE RORY,"All you have to do is sit pretty,"
568.8,573.03,UNCLE RORY,and laugh when I tell a good one.
573.16,576.28,UNCLE RORY,"Tell her what a funny guy I am, Dawnie."
576.4,578.55,DAWN,Gotta go. Enjoy the wedding.
581.8,583.73,UNCLE RORY,"Oh, bad head."
583.73,584.47,CATERER,What?
584.6,587.09,UNCLE RORY,"Well, the lip wasn't split right."
587.12,590.04,UNCLE RORY,You gotta grab the lip between
587.12,590.04,UNCLE RORY,"your thumb and your finger,"
590.16,594.15,UNCLE RORY,and then you have to slice
590.16,594.15,UNCLE RORY,right through the centre of the meat.
594.28,597.88,UNCLE RORY,It was my trade. I used to stuff things.
598.92,600.8,UNCLE RORY,I still do.
600.92,602.64,UNCLE RORY,But only for fun.
607.48,609.48,D'HOFFRYN,Hymen's greetings.
609.48,610.71,DAWN,Hy... what?
610.84,614.36,D'HOFFRYN,"Hymen, the god of matrimony."
610.84,614.36,D'HOFFRYN,His salutations upon you.
614.88,619.43,D'HOFFRYN,May the love we celebrate today
614.88,619.43,D'HOFFRYN,avoid an almost inevitable decline.
619.56,620.55,DAWN,Cool.
620.68,623.19,D'HOFFRYN,I brought a gift. I suppose there's a table.
625.68,626.49,DAWN,Halfrek.
626.49,628.8,HALFREK,"Please, call me Hallie!"
628.92,630.77,HALFREK,We're practically family now.
630.77,633.44,DAWN,Neat. I can put this on the table for you.
633.56,635.53,D'HOFFRYN,"Thank you. Careful, it's..."
635.53,636.12,DAWN,Fragile?
636.24,637.96,D'HOFFRYN,Squirmy.
641.12,645,HALFREK,"So, Dawnie, how's everything?"
645.12,649.24,HALFREK,Going good?
645.12,649.24,HALFREK,Nothing you wish was different?
649.36,653.83,D'HOFFRYN,"For Yekk's sake, take a day off. We're not"
649.36,653.83,D'HOFFRYN,"here to do vengeance, we're here to mingle."
653.96,658.91,HALFREK,"Oh, look. It's Katrika Whatshername."
653.96,658.91,HALFREK,What has she done with...?
663.24,663.78,DAWN,Spike!
663.78,666.2,SPIKE,I want you to meet my date.
668.16,670.31,DAWN,Hi. I'm Dawn.
673.04,677.19,SPIKE,"So, yeah. Anyway, that's my date."
673.04,677.19,SPIKE,She's with me. My date for the wedding.
677.88,679.47,SPIKE,Yeah.
679.6,681.64,DAWN,"OK. Well, nice meeting you."
686.28,689.59,COUSIN CAROL,"So, circus folk. What's that like?"
690.16,692.96,UNCLE RORY,Your friend  the fella with the warts 
693.08,697.95,UNCLE RORY,"went off on his circus ""heritage"","
693.08,697.95,UNCLE RORY,like you folks are all in some kind of cult.

703.04,707.16,CLEM,"grew out of the commedia dell'arte,"
703.04,707.16,CLEM,"and ancient sports, of course."
707.28,710.5,UNCLE RORY,If you expect Xander to bring up
707.28,710.5,UNCLE RORY,his kids in some kind of...
710.56,713.83,UNCLE RORY,foreignspeaky
710.56,713.83,UNCLE RORY,bowtotheeasty kinda cult...
713.96,717.19,TENTACLE DEMON,You think children should be raised
713.96,717.19,TENTACLE DEMON,in ignorance of our ways?
717.32,721.87,COUSIN CAROL,"No, the Harrises are very broadminded."
717.32,721.87,COUSIN CAROL,We're Episcopalians.
723.08,725.47,MR. HARRIS,Till death do us part. "
726.76,731.47,MR. HARRIS,That's what cracks me up.
726.76,731.47,MR. HARRIS,"Hit me again, barkeep."
742.84,743.77,XANDER,How do I look?
743.77,744.83,BUFFY,"Well, let's see."
744.96,747.84,BUFFY,Found your shoes. Your fly's zipped.
748.68,752.47,BUFFY,I'd say you look like
748.68,752.47,BUFFY,you're ready to get married.
754.32,758.95,BUFFY,"You're one of the decent ones, Xander."
754.32,758.95,BUFFY,I hope I'm as lucky as you guys someday.
759.08,762.87,XANDER,You wanna get lucky?
759.08,762.87,XANDER,"I've still got, what, 15, 20 minutes."
764.84,767.12,BUFFY,All right. Into the breach with you.
767.24,772,XANDER,"OK, breach me. Now, let's go over the list"
767.24,772,XANDER,one more time. Number one?
773.28,774.99,BUFFY,Don't let your dad near the bar.
774.99,775.95,XANDER,Check. Number two?
776.08,777.39,BUFFY,Don't let your mom near the bar.
777.39,777.64,XANDER,Check.
777.76,780.75,DAWN,"Hey, Buffy. Spike brought a total skank."
780.75,781.12,BUFFY,A...?
781.24,784.68,DAWN,A Manic Panic freak he's macking with
781.24,784.68,DAWN,in the middle of the room.
784.8,786.47,DAWN,I saw him shove his tongue...
786.47,787.68,BUFFY,Spike brought a date?
787.8,789.87,DAWN,Yeah. Wait till you see her.
790.96,793.47,XANDER,"Guys, I better go meet and greet."
794.92,797.23,BUFFY,Just go ahead. I'll be a sec.
809.32,811.47,BUFFY,"Hey, congratulations."
812.96,815.39,MRS. HARRIS,"Congratulations, there, son."
816.04,817.51,MRS. HARRIS,"Hello, young man."
817.51,818.63,BUFFY,"Oh, Xander..."
818.76,822.83,MRS. HARRIS,"Alexander, do you realise that"
818.76,822.83,MRS. HARRIS,the usher sat us in the third row?
822.96,824.24,XANDER,I'm sure it was a mistake.
824.24,825.03,MRS. HARRIS,I don't think...
825.16,825.72,OLD MAN,Excuse me.
825.72,827.83,UNCLE RORY,Do you know where the photographer is?
827.96,829.66,UNCLE RORY,I've got a proposition for him...
829.66,830.79,OLD MAN,I need to talk to you.
830.92,834.36,DAWN,"Xander, one of Anya's presents got loose!"
834.36,835.2,XANDER,Got loose?
835.32,838.55,DAWN,It's a fully alive squiggly thingy 
835.32,838.55,DAWN,and why is Halfrek a bridesmaid?
838.68,842.39,OLD MAN,"Please, please,"
838.68,842.39,OLD MAN,you have got to listen to me!
842.52,846.27,OLD MAN,You can't get married today.
842.52,846.27,OLD MAN,It's a huge mistake.
847.44,852.07,XANDER,"Yeah, right. Thanks for the advice,"
847.44,852.07,XANDER,Uncle... Help me here.
852.2,855.34,OLD MAN,"Uncle? You don't recognise me, do you?"
855.34,857.07,XANDER,"I'm sorry, I don't..."
857.2,861.16,OLD MAN,"This sounds crazy, I know,"
857.2,861.16,OLD MAN,but you have to believe me.
863.72,865.68,OLD MAN,I'm Xander Harris.
866.44,868.4,OLD MAN,I'm you.
873.12,875.94,XANDER,"What do you mean, you're me?"
875.94,876.75,OLD MAN,I'm you.
876.88,879.55,OLD MAN,I'm you from the future.
879.68,881.38,OLD MAN,"Oh, from the future!"
881.38,883.85,XANDER,"I thought you were a nutball,"
883.89,885.12,XANDER,but now that you're from the future...
885.12,885.76,OLD MAN,Please listen to me.
885.79,888.79,OLD MAN,"I found my way back to warn you,"
885.79,888.79,OLD MAN,to tell you...
888.92,891.43,XANDER,Easy. Everything's gonna be all right.
891.43,891.83,MR. HARRIS,Toast!
891.96,894.29,XANDER,That's why I told that guy no drinks
891.96,894.29,XANDER,before the ceremony.
894.34,897.59,MR. HARRIS,Toast! A toast to the Harris clan.
897.72,899.82,OLD MAN,"Look, I can prove it to you."
899.82,901.92,MR. HARRIS,I know we've had problems...
905.24,907.6,OLD MAN,I thought you might need convincing.
907.72,912,OLD MAN,Anya's crew make mine look good.
907.72,912,OLD MAN,Come on. Follow me.
912.12,915,MR. HARRIS,"And to my wife, Jessica."
915.12,917.27,MR. HARRIS,"Where are you, honey?"
918.2,920.16,MR. HARRIS,There she is.
920.92,922.8,MR. HARRIS,To my wife.
922.92,925.67,MR. HARRIS,"What would I do without you, beautiful?"
927.52,932.23,MR. HARRIS,"Well, for starters, I probably"
927.52,932.23,MR. HARRIS,"wouldn't need to drink so much, would I?"
933.4,938.87,MR. HARRIS,"On the brighter side, marriage has probably"
933.4,938.87,MR. HARRIS,saved me from a nasty dose of the clap.
940.08,941.88,MR. HARRIS,Here's to ya.
944.02,944.85,CLEM,Does this jerk ever shut up?
944.85,946.04,TENTACLE DEMON,He's startin' to make my suckers twitch.
946.16,951.71,MR. HARRIS,And a toast to the bride's
946.16,951.71,MR. HARRIS,dermatologicallychallenged family shrub.
951.84,952.88,TENTACLE DEMON,Sit down!
952.88,955.2,MR. HARRIS,I paid for all this!
955.32,958.87,MR. HARRIS,"You want me to sit down,"
955.32,958.87,MR. HARRIS,"you cough up a couple of grand, Squidly."
959.96,962.87,TENTACLE DEMON,"What'd you call me,"
959.96,962.87,TENTACLE DEMON,you drunken piece of sh...?
965.02,965.12,BUFFY,Mazel tov!
965.12,965.23,MR. HARRIS,What's this?
965.36,970.72,BUFFY,You must be so happy for Xander on his very
965.36,970.72,BUFFY,"special, onceinalifetime day, Mr Harris."
970.84,973.59,MR. HARRIS,Nice chassis. What's under the hood?
973.72,975.73,BUFFY,"You know, I could use"
973.72,975.73,BUFFY,a strong cup of coffee.
975.86,978.43,BUFFY,Let's get you one too. What do you say?
978.56,982.38,MR. HARRIS,Did you own a little square pinkish purse?
982.38,982.92,BUFFY,I did.
983.04,986.83,MR. HARRIS,I thought so. What do you say we slip
983.04,986.83,MR. HARRIS,in the back room and I show you my...
986.96,992.32,BUFFY,You finish that sentence and I guarantee
986.96,992.32,BUFFY,you won't have anything to show.
1001.72,1002.84,XANDER,What is it?
1002.84,1003.95,OLD MAN,It's magic.
1004.08,1007.31,OLD MAN,Very powerful. Look at it.
1008.24,1010.36,OLD MAN,You'll see what I've seen.
1010.48,1012.76,OLD MAN,Feel what I've felt.
1035.2,1038.64,SARAH,Get the hell away from me!
1035.2,1038.64,SARAH,"Dad, Josh is teasing me."
1038.76,1041.75,JOSH,Sara's a weirdo! Sara's a weirdo!
1041.88,1043.44,ANYA,What?
1044.56,1046.99,XANDER,You goin' out again?
1047.12,1048.83,ANYA,I'm doing a makeover party.
1048.83,1050.48,XANDER,I thought you hated those.
1051.12,1053.43,ANYA,"Well, one of us has to make some money."
1053.56,1056.79,XANDER,"Well, what do you want me to do?"
1053.56,1056.79,XANDER,I can't work. My back's shot.
1056.92,1058.74,ANYA,And whose fault is that?
1058.74,1061.31,XANDER,"Oh, no. Not the Buffy thing again."
1061.44,1063.87,ANYA,You had no business
1061.44,1063.87,ANYA,fighting demons with her.
1066.02,1067.07,XANDER,Buffy needed me. I had to help.
1068.68,1073.23,ANYA,"Well, it didn't save her, did it?"
1068.68,1073.23,ANYA,All it did was ruin our lives.
1075.44,1077.59,ANYA,I'll be late.
1083.24,1085.63,XANDER,I hope you crash in your stupid pink car!
1089.56,1090.2,XANDER,What?
1090.2,1092.52,SARAH,I hate this place.
1092.64,1094.12,SARAH,You know I don't eat wheat.
1094.12,1095.76,JOSH,"You don't eat anything, freak."
1095.88,1097.28,SARAH,At least I'm not a mama's boy.
1097.28,1098.44,JOSH,At least I'm not a freak.
1098.56,1099.66,SARAH,"Dad, make him cut it!"
1099.66,1101.87,XANDER,You should talk to your mother about that.
1104.04,1106.79,ANYA,You've had too much wine.
1106.92,1110.44,XANDER,Have I? I'm just saying
1106.92,1110.44,XANDER,maybe you should talk to your daughter!
1110.56,1114.24,SARAH,I hate you guys! I know
1110.56,1114.24,SARAH,"that you're not my real dad,"
1114.28,1115.51,SARAH,and I hate you. I hate you both.
1115.64,1117.95,SARAH,I wish you'd die!
1119.44,1120.79,JOSH,This sucks.
1121.04,1123.11,XANDER,"If you were so unhappy,"
1121.04,1123.11,XANDER,why didn't you leave?
1123.24,1126.07,ANYA,I wanted to. I should have!
1126.2,1129.51,XANDER,Yeah. Maybe I would have gotten
1126.2,1129.51,XANDER,some touch in the past 20 years.
1129.64,1132.26,ANYA,I wasn't the one who stopped touching!
1132.26,1134.95,XANDER,"Oh! Maybe, but you weren't touchin' me!"
1135.08,1138.79,ANYA,What did you expect me to do?
1135.08,1138.79,ANYA,You wouldn't come near me after Buffy...
1138.92,1140.82,XANDER,Don't bring her into this!
1140.82,1142.07,ANYA,Fine. Forget her.
1142.2,1146.27,ANYA,Maybe you were just born
1142.2,1146.27,ANYA,"to be a bitter, angry old man."
1146.68,1147.49,XANDER,Shut up.
1147.49,1149.91,ANYA,No! I want my life back!
1150.52,1152.95,ANYA,If I hadn't married you I wouldn't have
1152.95,1155.51,,had to hate myself for the last 30 years!
1155.64,1156.76,XANDER,Shut up!
1163.04,1165.77,OLD MAN,I'm so sorry. I didn't want to show you.
1165.77,1167.75,XANDER,What happened? What was that?
1167.88,1171.71,OLD MAN,"A glimpse of your future,"
1167.88,1171.71,OLD MAN,harnessed by magic.
1171.84,1173.99,XANDER,Is she OK? What did I do?
1174.12,1179.35,OLD MAN,Listen. I don't have long here. The spell
1174.12,1179.35,OLD MAN,"that brought me back, it won't last."
1180.16,1182.31,OLD MAN,But you can change things.
1182.76,1185.15,OLD MAN,It doesn't have to go like this.
1185.28,1187.3,OLD MAN,But you can't marry Anya.
1187.3,1187.79,XANDER,But...
1187.92,1191.88,OLD MAN,You'll hurt her less today
1187.92,1191.88,OLD MAN,than you will later. Believe me.
1192.6,1194.91,OLD MAN,"Sometimes, two people..."
1195.04,1198.4,OLD MAN,all they bring each other is pain.
1222.02,1222.43,SPIKE,"Hello, Buffy."
1223.2,1224.63,BUFFY,Hey.
1225.2,1227.71,SPIKE,It's a happy occasion.
1228.16,1230.52,SPIKE,You meet my friend?
1230.64,1233.28,BUFFY,No. Not yet.
1233.4,1237.28,BUFFY,But she seems like a very nice attempt
1233.4,1237.28,BUFFY,at making me jealous.
1240.24,1242.2,SPIKE,Is it working?
1244.32,1246.79,BUFFY,A little.
1246.92,1249.59,BUFFY,"It doesn't change anything,"
1249.72,1252.23,BUFFY,but if you're wildly curious...
1253.2,1255.16,BUFFY,"yeah, it hurts."
1255.84,1257.48,SPIKE,I'm sorry.
1257.6,1259.72,SPIKE,Or... good!
1263.48,1265.16,SPIKE,You want us to go?
1265.16,1265.44,BUFFY,No.
1265.56,1270.27,BUFFY,"No, you have every right to be here."
1265.56,1270.27,BUFFY,I pretty much deserve...
1270.4,1272.76,SPIKE,That's not true.
1274.88,1276.87,SPIKE,"God, this is hard."
1279.02,1278.56,BUFFY,Yeah.
1280.2,1282.16,SPIKE,I think we'll go.
1282.28,1284.51,BUFFY,Go where? Your place?
1286.44,1288.4,SPIKE,"Yeah, I suppose."
1289.48,1292.05,SPIKE,That was the idea.
1292.05,1292.76,BUFFY,Yeah.
1292.88,1293.59,SPIKE,Evil.
1293.59,1295,BUFFY,Of course.
1296.96,1299.08,SPIKE,But I won't...
1299.2,1301.16,SPIKE,or...
1301.96,1306.4,SPIKE,I'll just go. Give my best to whatever...
1301.96,1306.4,SPIKE,the happy couple.
1306.8,1308.2,BUFFY,I will.
1310.68,1313.04,SPIKE,It's nice to watch you be happy.
1313.92,1315.88,SPIKE,"For them, even."
1316.64,1318.55,SPIKE,I don't see it a lot.
1318.68,1321.64,SPIKE,You glow.
1325.48,1328.31,BUFFY,That's because the dress is radioactive.
1331.72,1333.07,BUFFY,I should...
1333.07,1333.68,SPIKE,Yeah.
1334.84,1336.48,SPIKE,But it hurts?
1340.56,1342.12,BUFFY,Yeah.
1343.16,1344.72,SPIKE,Thanks.
1350.36,1352.32,BUFFY,You're welcome.
1352.44,1353.04,SPIKE,Let's go.
1353.04,1354.59,SKANKY GOTH GIRL,What about the wedding?
1354.72,1357,SPIKE,"Let's just piss off, all right?"
1373.8,1376.36,WILLOW,I'll say this for the Ychromosome:
1377.08,1379.39,WILLOW,looks good in a tux.
1382.02,1384.23,XANDER,"Well, your double Xs"
1382.02,1384.23,XANDER,"don't look too bad there, either."
1384.92,1388.63,WILLOW,You're getting married. My little Xander.
1388.76,1391.32,XANDER,All growed up.
1391.44,1396.64,WILLOW,"It's a good thing I realised I was gay,"
1391.44,1396.64,WILLOW,"otherwise you, me and formalwear..."
1404.32,1407.09,WILLOW,Do you know how much I love you?
1407.09,1409.95,XANDER,About half as much as I love you.
1413.48,1415.76,WILLOW,You ready for the long walk?
1418.36,1420.59,XANDER,Just give me a sec.
1418.36,1420.59,XANDER,I wanna work on my vows.
1420.72,1424.63,WILLOW,Take your time. It's not like
1420.72,1424.63,WILLOW,we can start the wedding without you.
1428.48,1432,ANYA,"I, Anya, promise to cherish you... """
1432.12,1434.24,ANYA,"No, not cherish."
1434.92,1439.87,ANYA,I promise to have sex with you
1434.92,1439.87,ANYA,"whenever I want,"
1440.56,1444.6,ANYA,"and pledge to be your friend,"
1444.72,1447.15,ANYA,"your wife, and your confidante,"
1447.28,1450.32,TARA,and your sex poodle... "
1447.28,1450.32,TARA,Sex poodle?
1453.02,1453.23,ANYA,Yeah. Why?
1453.36,1457.59,TARA,I'm not sure you should say
1453.36,1457.59,TARA,sex poodle" in your vows.
1466.8,1470.16,ANYA,The music.
1466.8,1470.16,ANYA,They're playing the music! This is it.
1471.72,1474,BUFFY,Are you ready to go?
1474.52,1477.03,WILLOW,He's gone. Xander disappeared.
1482.16,1486.07,BUFFY,What? Xander's gone? What should we do?
1486.2,1490.75,WILLOW,I'm gonna go look for him.
1486.2,1490.75,WILLOW,I'm gonna find him. And you're gonna stall.
1495.12,1499.96,BUFFY,Sorry about that. There's just
1495.12,1499.96,BUFFY,gonna be a little bit of a delay.
1500.76,1503.09,ANYA,Why? What's wrong?
1503.09,1504.12,BUFFY,Nothing!
1504.24,1507.6,BUFFY,Nothing's wrong. It's just the minister.
1508.08,1512.2,BUFFY,He had to go and perform
1508.08,1512.2,BUFFY,an emergency Csection.
1512.32,1513.7,ANYA,Csection?
1513.7,1514.47,BUFFY,Yeah!
1514.6,1518.31,BUFFY,"He's not just a minister,"
1514.6,1518.31,BUFFY,he's also a doctor.
1518.44,1523.15,BUFFY,"He's halfminister, halfdoctor."
1518.44,1523.15,BUFFY,He's a minitor.
1523.56,1526.79,BUFFY,"Not to be confused with a Minotaur,"
1523.56,1526.79,BUFFY,"because he's all man,"
1526.92,1530.52,BUFFY,this doctorminister man 
1526.92,1530.52,BUFFY,no bull parts whatsoever.
1532.68,1535.72,BUFFY,So it should just be a couple of minutes.
1535.84,1537.51,ANYA,OK.
1543.2,1544.55,ANYA,OK.
1545.52,1547.48,ANYA,For the last time.

1559.2,1564.59,ANYA,"And before I knew you, I was"
1559.2,1564.59,ANYA,a completely different person. "
1564.72,1566.55,ANYA,"Not even a person, really. """
1567.2,1569.4,ANYA VOICEOVER,"I had seen what love could do to people,"

1575.02,1574.96,ANYA VOICEOVER,Alone was better. "
1575.08,1578.31,ANYA VOICEOVER,"And then, suddenly, there was you,"
1579.24,1581.36,ANYA VOICEOVER,and you knew me. "

1620.02,1621.63,BUFFY,"No! No, it's not what you think."
1622.12,1624.11,COUSIN CAROL,Beautiful.
1649.16,1650.83,ANYA,What's going on?
1653.88,1657.4,ANYA,"I mean, I am sorry, but what the hell"
1653.88,1657.4,ANYA,was that minister thinking?
1657.52,1659.04,TARA,I don't know. He...
1659.04,1661.91,ANYA,Delivering a baby on my special day.
1662.04,1664.2,ANYA,It's totally rude of him  and the mother.
1664.38,1666.72,ANYA,Why couldn't he have just
1664.38,1666.72,ANYA,told her to hold it?
1670.72,1673.23,MR. HARRIS,Give me a double Jack.
1673.36,1675.59,MRS. HARRIS,This is a disaster.
1675.72,1678.15,MR. HARRIS,It's that Anya. I know it.
1678.68,1683.88,MR. HARRIS,She made us pay for the whole thing
1678.68,1683.88,MR. HARRIS,and now she's gonna louse it up. Women!
1686.02,1686.56,MRS. HARRIS,I offered to help. She didn't want my help.
1691.96,1695.19,HALFREK,This totally isn't happening.
1691.96,1695.19,HALFREK,We should've known she'd never...
1695.32,1697.71,D'HOFFRYN,I am worried about Anya.
1697.84,1700.72,HALFREK,"Oh, sure. Of course you are."
1700.84,1702.64,D'HOFFRYN,"Oh, Halfrek."
1702.76,1705.83,D'HOFFRYN,You know I love all my demons equally.
1708.48,1710.99,COUSIN CAROL,"Buffy, you've gotta do something."
1715.2,1718.35,BUFFY,"So, who here's from out of town?"
1721.92,1723.88,DEMON TEEN,My family is worse.
1726.02,1726.47,DAWN,No way. Mine is so messed up
1726.02,1726.47,DAWN,you have no idea.
1726.6,1731.28,DEMON TEEN,Wait until you see my mom dance at the
1726.6,1731.28,DEMON TEEN,reception and then tell me who's messed up.
1731.4,1733.4,DAWN,I guess they're all messed up.
1733.4,1735.39,DEMON TEEN,Yeah. Everybody's pretty lame.
1735.84,1738.23,GUESTS,First word!
1735.84,1738.23,GUESTS,One word!
1738.36,1740.51,GUESTS,Animal?
1740.64,1741.36,GUESTS,Bull!
1741.72,1743.02,TARA,"Anya, wait up!"
1743.02,1745.63,ANYA,This bride waits for no one.
1745.76,1750.36,ANYA,"If the minister's not here yet, we just"
1745.76,1750.36,ANYA,have to get married without a minister.
1756.4,1758.83,DEMON TEEN,Jeez. What is the holdup?
1759.76,1761.72,DAWN,Can you keep a secret?
1762.44,1766.99,DAWN,"Nobody knows this, but the groom,"
1762.44,1766.99,DAWN,he took off and no one can find him.
1767.96,1770.39,ANYA,What?
1770.52,1772.59,DEMON TEEN,"I'll catch you later, Dawn."
1772.59,1775.04,ANYA,Xander's gone? Xander's missing?
1775.44,1777.95,ANYA,"What do you mean, Xander's missing?"
1785.24,1788.31,UNCLE RORY,It's a joke. Xander's playing a joke.
1788.44,1792.15,UNCLE RORY,"It's like one time, at one of Carol's"
1788.44,1792.15,UNCLE RORY,"weddings, I had this ape suit..."
1792.28,1795.48,TENTACLE DEMON,"Oh, great. Another Harris family joke."
1795.6,1798.03,TENTACLE DEMON,Why don't you have another drink?
1798.16,1802.39,MR. HARRIS,Drinking is the only way I can dull the pain
1802.52,1805.48,MR. HARRIS,of looking at your ugly face.
1807.88,1810.08,TENTACLE DEMON,"Think real hard about this, Harris."
1810.2,1813.32,MR. HARRIS,Don't touch me
1810.2,1813.32,MR. HARRIS,with those nasty circus things!
1814.12,1816.08,TENTACLE DEMON,That's it!
1835.02,1834.07,TARA,Thanks.
1834.2,1835.34,WILLOW,You OK?
1835.34,1836.16,TARA,Yeah.
1837.56,1842.48,ANYA,Xander? Have you seen Xander?
1837.56,1842.48,ANYA,Has anyone seen Xander?
1842.6,1846.15,COUSIN CAROL,"Well, I saw him go into"
1842.6,1846.15,COUSIN CAROL,the trophy room with that guy!
1855.64,1860.71,ANYA,You. You were talking to Xander right
1855.64,1860.71,ANYA,before he left. What did he say to you?
1860.84,1862.5,ANYA,What did you say to him?
1862.5,1865.2,OLD MAN,"Doesn't matter now, does it? It's done."
1868.02,1870.12,ANYA,What's done? Did you...? If you
1868.02,1870.12,ANYA,said something to make him leave...
1870.24,1875.84,OLD MAN,You'll what? Haven't changed a bit.
1870.24,1875.84,OLD MAN,Still as vindictive as ever.
1876.84,1878.99,ANYA,Do I know you?
1879.48,1882.04,OLD MAN,"You don't recognise me, Anya?"
1882.16,1884.99,OLD MAN,I'm not the man I used to be. I know.
1887.8,1889.84,BUFFY,Guys! Will you break it up?
1890.84,1892.59,ANYA,Xander.
1893.24,1895.67,ANYA,"Where is he? You tell me, old man!"
1895.8,1897.19,ANYA,You tell me why he left!
1897.19,1898.52,OLD MAN,He left because of you.
1900.04,1902.09,ANYA,I didn't do anything.
1902.09,1903.16,OLD MAN,"Oh, really?"
1903.76,1905.72,OLD MAN,What about this?
1918.28,1921.16,ANYA,Tell me what you did with Xander.
1918.28,1921.16,ANYA,What are you?
1921.28,1924.19,ANYA,You did this. You brought this on.
1924.32,1927.23,ANYA,"I've waited a long time for this, Anyanka."
1929.12,1930.38,ANYA,Who are you?
1930.38,1932.16,DEMON,Remember Chicago?
1932.28,1934.79,DEMON,"South Side, 1914?"
1935.8,1938,DEMON,"Stewart Burns, philanderer!"
1938.72,1942.24,DEMON,You'd think you'd remember.
1938.72,1942.24,DEMON,I remember you. But you ruined my life.
1942.72,1945,ANYA,You were a...
1945.12,1946.26,ANYA,I punished you.
1946.26,1947.24,DEMON,That's right.
1947.36,1949.75,DEMON,Some hussy I'd been taking around
1947.36,1949.75,DEMON,summons you.
1949.88,1953.71,DEMON,"Next thing I know, I look like this"
1949.88,1953.71,DEMON,and I'm being tortured in another dimension.
1953.84,1954.65,ANYA,I forgot.
1954.65,1955.99,DEMON,"Well, I didn't!"
1961.02,1960.91,DEMON,Every day I remembered...
1961.04,1963.74,DEMON,and every day I thought how I would
1961.04,1963.74,DEMON,"somehow get here,"
1963.78,1966.03,DEMON,and ruin your life
1963.78,1966.03,DEMON,like you ruined mine.
1967.44,1972.96,DEMON,"It didn't take much, either. I scared off"
1967.44,1972.96,DEMON,your fiancé with a couple of phoney visions.
1974.56,1976.36,ANYA,Visions of what?
1976.72,1980.16,DEMON,Your future.
1976.72,1980.16,DEMON,Or his nightmare vision of your future.
1983.92,1986.59,ANYA,That's it? That's all you did?
1986.59,1987.04,DEMON,Yeah.
1987.16,1989.07,DEMON,It was easy.
1989.2,1992.88,DEMON,"Look at that, you're crying. I like that."
1994.64,1995.7,ANYA,Stop it.
1995.7,1998.08,DEMON,"Cry, Anyanka, cry."
1998.68,2004.15,DEMON,I love to see you cry.
1998.68,2004.15,DEMON,And now I'd love to see you scream.
2011.32,2013.44,DEMON,Come any closer and I'll kill her.
2024.56,2027.23,ANYA,I'm so glad you're here.
2027.36,2029.2,ANYA,"It was all lies, what he showed you."
2029.33,2031.91,ANYA,"It wasn't true, he just"
2029.33,2031.91,ANYA,wanted to break us up.
2036.08,2038.13,XANDER,It doesn't matter now.
2038.13,2039.52,ANYA,So we'll be OK?
2044.72,2046.68,BUFFY,Excuse me.
2064.48,2065.88,XANDER,It's dead.
2065.88,2066.44,BUFFY,Yup.
2076.24,2079.31,WILLOW,Is anyone else waiting for it to go poof?
2079.44,2082.19,WILLOW,Maybe we can cover it with flowers.
2085.88,2089.71,MR. HARRIS,Look at this damage.
2085.88,2089.71,MR. HARRIS,"I'm not payin' for this, you freaks!"
2089.84,2092.23,KRELVIN,Stop calling us freaks!
2093.56,2095.52,MRS. HARRIS,"Oh, no! No, not again! No!"
2097.84,2099.8,ANYA,Stop it!
2101.2,2103.4,ANYA,Everyone sit down!
2104.24,2106.91,ANYA,"This wedding will go on,"
2104.24,2106.91,ANYA,so get back in your seats!
2117.36,2120.83,ANYA,"You know, it's bad luck"
2117.36,2120.83,ANYA,to see me in my dress.
2121.96,2127.4,ANYA,"It's OK. It's all over now. He's dead,"
2121.96,2127.4,ANYA,and it was just smoke and mirrors.
2130.08,2132.04,XANDER,I know.
2133.92,2135.67,ANYA,So...
2136.36,2139.38,ANYA,we're ready now. Let's get married.
2139.38,2139.72,XANDER,I...
2142.76,2144.32,XANDER,I'm not...
2146.36,2148.32,XANDER,I'm not ready.
2149.12,2151.08,XANDER,"I can't, An, I'm sorry."
2154.4,2158.52,ANYA,But it wasn't real.
2154.4,2158.52,ANYA,"What he showed you, it wasn't real."
2158.64,2161.55,XANDER,I know it wasn't real.
2161.68,2164.19,XANDER,But it could be.
2170.56,2174.87,ANYA,What was it? Was it about me?
2170.56,2174.87,ANYA,"Cos he wanted you to hate me, Xander."
2175.32,2177.63,XANDER,It wasn't you.
2177.76,2179.99,XANDER,It wasn't you I was hating.
2181.72,2184.84,XANDER,I had these thoughts and fears before this.
2189.76,2191.82,XANDER,Maybe we just went too fast.
2191.82,2193.96,ANYA,"Look, everybody has thoughts."
2195.44,2198.48,ANYA,"It's natural, it doesn't mean"
2195.44,2198.48,ANYA,getting married is wrong.
2198.6,2199.95,XANDER,"I know, I know."
2199.95,2202.83,ANYA,"Look, you're just shaken up, OK?"
2204.04,2207.19,ANYA,"You just calm down and we'll start over, OK?"
2215.2,2217.32,XANDER,We can't start over.
2218.52,2223.47,XANDER,"If this is a mistake, it's for ever."
2218.52,2223.47,XANDER,And I don't wanna hurt you.
2224.32,2226.68,XANDER,Not that way.
2229.36,2231.32,XANDER,I'm sorry.
2232.52,2234.67,XANDER,But...
2232.52,2234.67,XANDER,I am so sorry.
2310.84,2313.27,DAWN,Should we do something for her?
2314.04,2316.32,DAWN,Anything?
2316.44,2320.23,WILLOW,She wants to be alone.
2316.44,2320.23,WILLOW,That's what she wants.
2321.64,2324.95,WILLOW,"Oh, God, it just hurts"
2321.64,2324.95,WILLOW,my heart to think of her.
2325.84,2328.96,BUFFY,I know. The whole thing hurts my heart.
2333.4,2335.9,DAWN,I thought they were happy.
2335.9,2338.6,BUFFY,They were. I know they were.
2340.08,2345.2,BUFFY,They were supposed to be my light at the end
2340.08,2345.2,BUFFY,of the tunnel. I guess they were a train.
2348.32,2350.44,DAWN,Why did this happen?
2350.56,2352.52,WILLOW,I don't know.
2353.28,2356.83,WILLOW,I feel like I should be hating Xander.
2356.96,2358.92,WILLOW,But I can't.
2360.12,2362.24,WILLOW,I just...
2362.68,2364.8,WILLOW,I just hope he's OK.
2366.84,2368.96,DAWN,I wonder where he is.
2375.88,2378.39,,Not much to explain.
2378.52,2380.88,,Air conditioner's busted.
2382.28,2384.71,,That's it. Checkout's at 11.
2412.08,2414.04,,Are you OK?
2418.32,2420.99,,I'm tired of crying.
2424.4,2426.91,,"I'm just so tired, D'Hoffryn."
2428.24,2430.2,,"Oh, Anyanka."
2430.32,2432.28,,I'm sorry.
2433.48,2436.71,,But you let him domesticate you.
2436.84,2439.51,,"When you were a vengeance demon,"
2436.84,2439.51,,you were powerful.
2439.64,2443.11,,"At the top of your game,"
2439.64,2443.11,,you crushed men like him.
2447.04,2451.4,,It's time you got back to
2447.04,2451.4,,"what you do best, don't you think?"
