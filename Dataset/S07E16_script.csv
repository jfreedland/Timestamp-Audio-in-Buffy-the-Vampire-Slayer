6.21,8.41,WARREN,Somebody! Help!
9.57,11.77,ANDREW,We gotta get out of this town. Mexico.
12.73,14.21,ANYA,"lt's not a happy scenario,"
14.29,17.21,ANYA,but we're dealing with the Big Bad
14.29,17.21,ANYA,that can be any dead person.
17.29,20.81,WARREN,You know the rules.
17.29,20.81,WARREN,l can't take corporeal form.
22.17,23.97,ANDREW,l don't think l can kill anybody else.
27.37,31.53,WILLOW,Look who l found. Guess who was buying
27.37,31.53,WILLOW,mass amounts of blood at the butcher's shop.
31.61,34.57,BUFFY,"Andrew is our... Actually, he's our hostage."
34.65,37.88,ANDREW,l like to think of myself more as a "guestage".
37.97,39.93,DAWN,i> They're all slayers?</i>
37.97,39.93,DAWN,i> Potential slayers.</i>
40.01,43.77,GILES (V.O.),i>There were many more like them all over</i>

44.65,45.19,ROBIN WOOD,Buffy?

46.97,49.17,ROBIN WOOD,l'd like to take you out to dinner.
49.25,51.21,BUFFY,l'd be happy to have dinner with you.
51.21,51.53,ROBIN WOOD,Great.
51.61,53.49,BUFFY,How do you know about slayers?
53.49,54.61,ROBIN WOOD,My mother was one.
54.69,56.25,ROBIN WOOD,She was killed when l was four.
56.69,57.67,BUFFY,i> A demon...?</i>

75.05,77.61,ANDREW,"Oh, hello there, gentle viewers."
78.69,81.92,ANDREW,You caught me catching up
78.69,81.92,ANDREW,on an old favourite.
82.01,85.72,ANDREW,"lt's... wonderful to get lost in a story, isn't it?"
86.69,90.69,ANDREW,Adventure and heroics and discovery.
90.77,93.24,ANDREW,Don't they just take you away?
102.29,106.81,ANDREW,"Come with me now,"
102.29,106.81,ANDREW,"if you will, gentle viewers."
106.89,109.73,ANDREW,Join me on a new voyage of the mind.
109.81,115.68,ANDREW (V.O.),A little tale l like to call:
109.81,115.68,ANDREW (V.O.),"Buffy, Slayer of the Vampires""."
119.01,125.57,ANDREW (V.O.),i> lt was cold last night and the wind</i>
119.01,125.57,ANDREW (V.O.),"i>was cruel, but the Slayer had a job to do.</i>"
137.61,141.4,ANDREW (V.O.),"i>Unfortunately, vampires have a job to do too.</i>"
152.57,156.41,ANDREW,Ouch! My goodness!
152.57,156.41,ANDREW,"Things look bad for the Slayer, don't they?"
156.49,161.09,ANDREW,"She didn't see that second vampire,"
156.49,161.09,ANDREW,"concealed by cover of darkness,"
161.17,163.29,ANDREW,ready...
161.17,163.29,ANDREW,i></i>
163.37,166.45,ANDREW,ready to attack and make her
163.37,166.45,ANDREW,his own vampirical spawn.
166.53,169.68,ANDREW,i> </i>
166.53,169.68,ANDREW,Let's rejoin them now to see...
169.77,174.4,ANYA,"For God's sakes, Andrew, you've been"
169.77,174.4,ANYA,in here for 30 minutes. What are you doing?
174.49,177.49,ANDREW,Entertaining and educating.
177.57,181.57,ANYA,Why can't you just masturbate
177.57,181.57,ANYA,like the rest of us?
242.25,246.85,ANDREW,That was great. l got you dusting that guy
242.25,246.85,ANDREW,on film. Why do vampires show up on video?
246.93,251.05,BUFFY,l told you l didn't want you doing that.
246.93,251.05,BUFFY,lt's distracting.
251.13,253.49,ANDREW,l'll cut it together
251.13,253.49,ANDREW,and do the intro tomorrow.
253.57,255.91,ANDREW,"She was a woman in danger, or was she?"""
255.91,257.77,BUFFY,Are you still filming me? Stop!
257.85,263.49,ANDREW,But it's a valuable record. An important
257.85,263.49,ANDREW,document for the ages. "A slayer in action."
263.57,267.81,BUFFY,A nerd in pain." Would they like that?
263.57,267.81,BUFFY,Cos we could do that.
267.89,271.36,ANDREW,But the story needs to be told.
271.45,274.09,ANYA,Birds need to fly
271.45,274.09,ANYA,and girls need to use the toilet.
274.17,279.2,ANYA,"Why were you videotaping yourself,"
274.17,279.2,ANYA,anyway? Sounds like kinky business to me.
279.29,281.36,ANDREW,The world will wanna know about Buffy.
281.45,286.29,ANDREW,lt's a story of ultimate triumph tinged with
281.45,286.29,ANDREW,bitterness for what's been lost in the struggle.
286.37,288.69,ANDREW,lt's a legacy for future generations.
288.69,289.76,ANYA,lf there are any.
289.85,293.61,ANYA,Buffy thinks that this apocalypse
289.85,293.61,ANYA,is going to actually be apocalyptic.
293.69,297.29,ANYA,l think your story seems pretty pointless.
297.37,300.84,ANDREW,Oh. l was gonna interview you later today.
300.93,302.92,ANYA,"Cos, you know, your unique"
302.92,305.29,ANDREW,perspective on the whole thing.
305.37,309.49,ANDREW,Give it editorial balance and... glamour.
310.69,311.76,ANDREW,Oh...
311.85,317.21,ANYA,"Well, balance is important."
311.85,317.21,ANYA,People don't always take that into account.
317.29,319.57,ANYA,l could bring that to you. Absolutely.
320.61,327.02,ANDREW,"Let's explore the world of our story, shall we?"
325.09,328.37,ANDREW,"Buffy lives in Sunnydale, California."
330.25,332.4,ANDREW,This is the local high school.
332.49,337.33,ANDREW,There's a Hellmouth...
332.49,337.33,ANDREW,Hellmouth... underneath the high school.
337.41,340.33,ANDREW,"See, weird things happen on a Hellmouth."
340.41,346.12,ANDREW,lt attracts all sorts of bad people
340.41,346.12,ANDREW,and demons and vampires.
346.21,353.77,ANDREW,Now there's this thing in the basement of
346.21,353.77,ANDREW,"the high school called the Seal of Danzalthar,"
353.85,357.32,ANDREW,and it's sort of a door to the Hellmouth.
359.09,364.29,ANDREW,"Due to some circumstances,"
359.09,364.29,ANDREW,it got opened up... a little bit...
365.21,367.41,ANDREW,recently.
368.13,372.73,ANDREW,"And this nasty, nasty"
368.13,372.73,ANDREW,vampire thing came out of it.
372.81,375.69,ANDREW,lt was just awful.
375.77,377.76,ANDREW,lt was awful.
378.53,380.6,ANDREW,This whole thing
380.69,385.37,ANDREW,is being orchestrated
380.69,385.37,ANDREW,by something called "the First".
385.49,388.05,ANDREW,lt's made up of all the evil in the whole world.
388.69,391.97,ANDREW,"Oh, there's also these guys."
393.81,397.17,ANDREW,They work for the First.
398.21,401.73,ANDREW,We don't know much about them
398.21,401.73,ANDREW,except for they're very ugly
401.81,406.17,ANDREW,and they're very mobile for blind people.
409.21,410.49,19 INT. KITCHEN AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY,ls that all clear?
410.81,412.66,ANDREW,lt's morning in Sunnydale...
412.66,414.97,RONA,Who the hell's got the lowfat milk?
415.05,416.69,ANDREW,"lt's morning in Sunnydale,"
416.77,422.17,ANDREW,and the women of Command Central take the
416.77,422.17,ANDREW,time to fortify themselves for the day ahead.
422.25,422.93,XANDER,Hey!
422.93,427.02,ANDREW,i></i> Women and Xander.
425.45,427.89,ANDREW,"Hey, l'm gonna do your special intro later."
427.97,430.61,ANDREW,The man who is the heart
427.97,430.61,ANDREW,of the Slayer machine."
430.69,432.68,XANDER,Yeah? The heart?
434.21,436.49,ANDREW,Things are tense this morning.
436.57,442.81,ANDREW,Buffy is concerned with some unknown
436.57,442.81,ANDREW,danger and the air is filled with foreboding.
442.89,444.68,DAWN,"Oh, we're out of Raisin Bran."
444.68,446.17,ANYA,l'll put it on the list.
446.25,449.96,ANDREW,That's probably not the unknown danger.
451.01,454.77,SPIKE,Look at this place.
451.01,454.77,SPIKE,Damn girls' dorm is what it is.
454.85,458.13,DAWN,That's nice. Secondhand stinkiness.
458.21,463.45,ANDREW,lt's a full house. l think it's a good time
458.21,463.45,ANDREW,"to do some introductions, gentle viewers."
463.53,466.17,AMANDA,"l'm Amanda, and l grew up right here..."
466.17,467.53,ANDREW,"Not you, sweetheart."
467.61,468.84,ANDREW,i></i>
469.65,472.12,ANDREW,Let's start from the top.
474.17,480.93,ANDREW,"i>You've already met Buffy. She's beautiful,</i>"
474.17,480.93,ANDREW,i>with a lion's heart and the face of an angel.</i>
481.01,486.21,BUFFY,i>She's never afraid because</i>
481.01,486.21,BUFFY,i>she knows her side will always win.</i>
487.53,494.02,BUFFY,i>Buffy and Spike have some kind of history.</i>
487.53,494.02,BUFFY,"i>You can feel the heat between them,</i>"
492.09,497.17,ANDREW,"i>although technically, as a vampire,</i>"
492.09,497.17,ANDREW,i>he's room temperature.</i>
498.77,503.69,BUFFY,i>Anya  a feisty waif with a fiery temper</i>
498.77,503.69,BUFFY,"i>and a vulnerable heart that she hides,</i>"
503.77,505.76,ANDREW,i>even from herseIf.</i>
512.13,515.17,BUFFY,i>This lovely girl l don't remember her name.</i>
515.25,517.64,BUFFY,ls he doing that again?
515.25,517.64,BUFFY,Can't we make him stop?
517.73,521.57,RONA,"l don't know. lf we save the world,"
517.73,521.57,RONA,it will be kinda nice to have a record of it.
521.65,525.28,AMANDA,"lf we don't save the world,"
521.65,525.28,AMANDA,then... nothing matters.
525.37,529.08,KENNEDY,"That's catchy, Amanda."
525.37,529.08,KENNEDY,Let's make that our slogan.
529.17,532.77,XANDER,"lt is strange how you keep saving the world,"
529.17,532.77,XANDER,and there's not any proof.
532.85,535.08,ANYA,Yeah. For future generations.
535.17,539.49,WILLOW,And it does help the girls with training.
535.17,539.49,WILLOW,"You know, viewing the tapes."
539.57,541.38,BUFFY,No one else thinks this is idiotic?
541.38,542.72,XANDER,i></i> Or is it important?
542.81,545.28,XANDER,"Buff, l don't get why"
542.81,545.28,XANDER,this bothers you so much.
545.37,549.69,BUFFY,Because it's a waste of time.
545.37,549.69,BUFFY,Someone has to agree with me. Spike?
549.77,555.02,SPIKE,Long as you're not pointing it at me.
549.77,555.02,SPIKE,lt keeps the boy busy.
553.09,557.29,BUFFY,This isn't about keeping busy.
553.09,557.29,BUFFY,This is about war.
557.37,563.97,BUFFY,"l'm sorry to jump all over you guys,"
557.37,563.97,BUFFY,but l have to tell you what's really going on.
564.73,569.17,BUFFY,"There's something new. Amanda, Dawn,"
564.73,569.17,BUFFY,you're gonna stay home from school today.
569.25,571.64,BUFFY,"We can survive what's coming,"
569.25,571.64,BUFFY,but not like this.
572.93,577.17,BUFFY,l had a vision of what's to come.
572.93,577.17,BUFFY,A horrible vision.
577.25,578.53,BUFFY,Hundreds upon hundreds...
578.61,582.85,ANDREW,"Gentle viewers, these motivating speeches"
578.61,582.85,ANDREW,of hers tend to get a little long.
582.93,585.37,ANDREW,l'll take you back in there in a while.
585.45,589.33,ANDREW,"ln the inbetween time, l thought"
585.45,589.33,ANDREW,"you might want to know a little about me,"
589.41,591.29,ANDREW,your humble host.
591.37,596.73,ANDREW,"You see, l'm a man with a burden."
591.37,596.73,ANDREW,A man with a dark past.
597.61,601.08,ANDREW,"You see, l was once a supervillain."
602.17,605.77,ANDREW,Thus the validity
602.17,605.77,ANDREW,of the BronstedDebyeHuckel equation
605.85,609.56,ANDREW,"at low ionic strength has been amply tested,"
609.65,612.65,ANDREW,and the charges
609.65,612.65,ANDREW,"on the reactant ions are well known,"
612.73,615.45,ANDREW,if their reagents are properly characterised.
615.53,616.81,JONATHAN,lt smells funny.
616.81,618.49,ANDREW,l know. Kinda sweaty.
619.89,621.23,WARREN,What'll it do to Buffy?
621.23,622.57,ANDREW,Make her supermagnetic!
622.65,624.97,JONATHAN,Wow! She won't be able to get out of her car.
624.97,627.04,WARREN,Knives and sharp things will fly at her.
627.13,629.52,ANDREW,"We could walk by her,"
627.13,629.52,ANDREW,she'd not be able to stop us.
629.61,632.61,WARREN,"Unless we had metal belt buckles,"
629.61,632.61,WARREN,then we'd stick to her.
632.69,635.25,ANDREW,"ln my plan, we are beltless."
635.33,637.8,JONATHAN,"Wow! You're the best, Andrew."
637.89,640.97,WARREN,Yep. Goodlooking and smart too.
640.97,641.97,JONATHAN,"Yeah, wow!"
642.41,647.25,ANDREW,Warren was cool.
642.41,647.25,ANDREW,And wasn't Jonathan just the cutest thing?
647.33,650.8,ANDREW,"Well, shall we see if Buffy's still talking?"
650.89,654.89,BUFFY,l mean mentally. And from what l've seen
650.89,654.89,BUFFY,"so far, there's no way you girls..."
654.97,660.09,ANDREW,She's not done. Even Willow looks bored and
654.97,660.09,ANDREW,she can take a lot of that stuff. Look at her.
660.17,663.37,ANDREW,"Ooh, ooh. Do you see that? That's important."
663.45,668.48,ANDREW,Willow and Kennedy have been in kind of
663.45,668.48,ANDREW,"a bad place lately, but things are looking up."
668.57,672.57,ANDREW,"You see, Kennedy pursued"
668.57,672.57,ANDREW,"the reluctant Willow and won her heart,"
672.65,677.73,ANDREW,only to find herself frightened when she saw
672.65,677.73,ANDREW,the darkness within the witch's mind.
677.81,683.49,ANDREW,Sidenote: l once had my own
677.81,683.49,ANDREW,personal encounter with Dark Willow.
684.05,686.2,DARK WILLOW,Jonathan. Andrew.
687.13,689.81,DARK WILLOW,"You boys like magic, don't you?"
689.89,691.57,DARK WILLOW,Abracadabra.
693.69,694.67,DARK WILLOW,i></i>
694.67,695.81,ANDREW,Haltem!
695.89,698.41,DARK WILLOW,OK. Didn't see that coming.
698.49,701.34,ANDREW,We have power you can't imagine.
701.34,701.88,JONATHAN,We do?
701.97,705.57,ANDREW,"You, Dark Willow, wield the force"
701.97,705.57,ANDREW,"of mighty evil, it is true."
705.65,707.7,ANDREW,"But you are new to the game, little one."
707.7,708.88,DARK WILLOW,You know what they say.
708.97,710.74,DARK WILLOW,"lf at first, you don't succeed..."
710.74,712.41,JONATHAN,"Holy cats, here it comes again."
714.05,716.81,ANDREW,l deflect thy power.
716.89,719.57,DARK WILLOW,"Damn, that is one effective counterspell."
719.65,723.44,ANDREW,"Thank you, little one. Thank you."
723.53,726.61,ANDREW,She was something. lndeed she was.
728.45,733.77,ANDREW,"Hey, l think Buffy stopped talking."
728.45,733.77,ANDREW,That usually means she had to go to work.
733.85,737.53,ANDREW,Let's see what the little locusts
733.85,737.53,ANDREW,"left for breakfast, shall we?"
741.53,744.21,21 INT. HALLWAY AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY,Not late. Not late till the bell rings.
746.05,748.61,21 INT. HALLWAY AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY,Hey! Hey! Break it up!

770.25,772.24,21 INT. HALLWAY AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY,Oh.
773.45,775.58,SHY GIRL,You knew l was there.
775.58,776.09,BUFFY,Yeah.
776.17,777.35,SHY GIRL,You noticed me.
777.35,780.41,BUFFY,"lt's OK, l promise. lt may seem that..."
783.49,785.37,BUFFY,What's wrong?
785.97,789.73,CRYING GIRL,The mirror said l was fat. lt said it.
790.53,792.48,STRESSED OUT BOY,l can't take this semester any more.
792.48,793.73,CRYING GIRL,lt's so much to handle.
793.81,796.18,STRESSED OUT BOY,Not only does Mr Hildebrand move up the trig
796.18,798.6,BUFFY,"exam, but it also covers three more chapters."
798.69,800.72,STRESSED OUT BOY,l've got an English paper due tomorrow.
800.72,801.65,BUFFY,l'm gonna explode.
801.73,805.73,BUFFY,"Hey, l can help. You just need to relax."
805.81,808.89,BUFFY,Maybe one of you guys
805.81,808.89,BUFFY,could give him a foot rub?
809.65,811.64,BUFFY,Something bad is going on.
811.73,812.66,ROBIN WOOD,ls that right?
812.66,814.73,BUFFY,"Oh, you're hurt. What happened?"
814.81,818.04,ROBIN WOOD,Someone threw a rock at me
814.81,818.04,ROBIN WOOD,as l got out of my car.
818.13,819.93,ROBIN WOOD,l didn't get a chance to see who.
819.93,821.57,BUFFY,lt could have been any of 'em.
821.65,824.73,BUFFY,"Students, teachers."
821.65,824.73,BUFFY,Something is going on today.
824.81,829.6,ROBIN WOOD,"Yes, well, that occurred to me"
824.81,829.6,ROBIN WOOD,as l ducked the other two rocks.
829.69,834.02,ROBIN WOOD,"Buffy, what the hell is this?"
832.09,833.06,BUFFY,Everything.
833.06,835.88,ROBIN WOOD,"Slowly, l may be concussed here."
840.53,846.29,BUFFY,"There's this thing that happens here,"
840.53,846.29,BUFFY,"in this school, over the Hellmouth,"
846.37,854.05,BUFFY,where the way a thing feels...
846.37,854.05,BUFFY,it kind of starts being that way... for real.
854.13,858.68,BUFFY,l've seen all these things before.
854.13,858.68,BUFFY,Just not all at once.
858.77,862.4,ROBIN WOOD,"So, what, it's like hell's abustin' out all over?"
863.81,867.02,BUFFY,Exactly.
867.13,869.58,ROBIN WOOD,What's the worst that can happen?
869.58,870.84,BUFFY,"War, pretty much."
870.93,874.69,ROBIN WOOD,l see you're being amusing now
870.93,874.69,ROBIN WOOD,with comical exaggeration.
874.77,878.61,BUFFY,Being in high school can feel
874.77,878.61,BUFFY,like being at war. Now it's true.
878.69,883.64,BUFFY,The students feel the teachers are out to get
878.69,883.64,BUFFY,them. The chess club resents the French club.
883.73,888.02,BUFFY,Everybody hates the cheerleaders.
886.09,891.02,BUFFY,"lf we don't do something,"
886.09,891.02,BUFFY,we'll have a riot on our hands.
889.09,891.37,BUFFY,And a lot of other nasty stuff too.
891.45,893.76,ROBIN WOOD,Like what?
891.45,893.76,ROBIN WOOD,Aargh!
896.01,899.77,BUFFY,Really shoulda had that foot rub.
904.01,910.02,ANDREW,Dawn is a typical American teenager 
904.01,910.02,ANDREW,bubbly and sweet with a hunger for fun
908.09,910.97,ANDREW,and a smile that lights up the room.
911.77,913.29,DAWN,Hello.
913.37,917.97,ANDREW,Dawn used to be a key.
913.37,917.97,ANDREW,l don't really know what that means.
919.77,922.35,24 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY,Hey. Here's something l think you're
922.35,925.37,ANDREW,"going to be interested in, gentle viewers."
925.45,928.45,ANDREW,Look at the work Xander did
925.45,928.45,ANDREW,replacing that window sash.
928.53,931.89,ANDREW,"You can't even tell it's new,"
928.53,931.89,ANDREW,it blends in so well.
931.97,934.17,ANDREW,He's extraordinary.
936.17,941.33,ROBIN WOOD,"You've dealt with this before? l mean,"
936.17,941.33,ROBIN WOOD,you've seen stuff like this in a high school?
942.25,946.25,BUFFY,"Sure. You know, swim team monsters"
942.25,946.25,BUFFY,or killer prom dogs.
946.33,948.77,BUFFY,"Again, not all at once."
948.85,951.65,ROBIN WOOD,"So, what makes now so special?"
951.73,954.73,BUFFY,"My guess, it's that seal thing in the basement."
955.57,960.28,BUFFY,All the Hellmouth's energy is trying to escape
955.57,960.28,BUFFY,"from that one spot, and it's getting all..."
960.37,962.36,ROBIN WOOD,Focusy.
963.49,967.45,BUFFY,Careful. You're starting to speak like me now.
967.97,973.17,ANDREW,This is Xander and Anya interview No.1
967.97,973.17,ANDREW,"for ""Buffy, a Slayer of the Vampires""."
973.25,974.61,ANYA,That's what it's called?
974.69,978.48,ANDREW,"That or ""Buffy, the Slayer"
974.69,978.48,ANDREW,Who Knew No Fear".
978.57,979.6,XANDER,l like that one.
979.6,982.12,ANDREW,"Thank you, Xander. That's sweet of you."
983.57,988.81,ANDREW,l understand that exactly one year ago today
983.57,988.81,ANDREW,you left Anya at the altar. Any comment?
988.89,990.36,XANDER,Whoa. What the hell...?
990.36,992.85,ANDREW,l just think people will be interested.
992.93,996.4,ANYA,l know l am. What do you have
992.93,996.4,ANYA,to say for yourself one year later?
996.49,999.69,XANDER,l've apologised enough.
996.49,999.69,XANDER,That's what l have to say.
999.77,1002.57,ANDREW,But it was something
999.77,1002.57,ANDREW,that called for an apology?
1002.65,1004.21,XANDER,"Well, yes."
1004.29,1005.41,ANDREW,So you don't think
1005.41,1007.21,XANDER,it was the right thing to do?
1007.29,1009.41,XANDER,Of course he doesn't think it was.
1009.49,1012.15,XANDER,lt was the right thing to do.
1012.15,1012.61,ANYA,What?
1012.97,1015.44,ANDREW,lnteresting. l think
1012.97,1015.44,ANDREW,we're getting to something.
1015.53,1019.73,XANDER,"Anya, if l had married you, it would have been"
1015.53,1019.73,XANDER,against everything l thought was best.
1019.81,1022.05,XANDER,lt wouldn't have worked.
1022.05,1022.89,ANYA,But we...
1023.61,1026.08,ANYA,We still spark.
1026.17,1029.72,ANYA,l getjealous of you. You getjealous of me.
1031.49,1033.88,ANYA,You still love me.
1035.17,1039.05,ANDREW,"ls that true, Xander? Do you still love her?"
1043.61,1045.71,BUFFY,l swear we just covered this thing up.
1045.71,1047.32,ROBIN WOOD,lt doesn't wanna stay hidden.
1047.41,1052.65,ROBIN WOOD,lt wants to turn these kids into monsters
1047.41,1052.65,ROBIN WOOD,and victims and who knows what.
1052.73,1054.93,BUFFY,lt's more than that.
1055.01,1057.32,ROBIN WOOD,"Look, Robin, l..."
1057.41,1059.88,BUFFY,l had a vision the other day.
1061.21,1063.52,ROBIN WOOD,You have visions?
1063.61,1065.3,BUFFY,Sometimes.
1065.3,1065.81,ROBIN WOOD,Oh.
1066.69,1071.05,ROBIN WOOD,"Well, how do you know"
1066.69,1071.05,ROBIN WOOD,that they're notjust dreams?
1071.13,1074.25,BUFFY,You're running to catch the bus naked?
1071.13,1074.25,BUFFY,That's a dream.
1074.33,1078.29,BUFFY,Army of vicious vampire creatures?
1074.33,1078.29,BUFFY,That's a vision.
1078.37,1080.93,ROBIN WOOD,Also l was awake.
1078.37,1080.93,ROBIN WOOD,A bus to where?
1082.01,1084.61,ROBIN WOOD,"l mean, an army of how many?"
1084.61,1085.45,BUFFY,Hundreds.
1085.53,1088.57,BUFFY,Maybe hundreds of hundreds.
1088.65,1091.96,BUFFY,All l know is the last Ubervamp l faced
1088.65,1091.96,BUFFY,crawled out of that hole.
1092.05,1095.52,BUFFY,lt makes me awfully nervous.
1092.05,1095.52,BUFFY,What are you doing?
1095.61,1098.76,ROBIN WOOD,Have you ever really studied it?
1095.61,1098.76,ROBIN WOOD,Gotten close?
1098.85,1101.73,ROBIN WOOD,"Well, l know it's a goat with its tongue out."
1101.81,1104.41,BUFFY,Willow did a search
1101.81,1104.41,BUFFY,"on the symbolic database,"
1104.49,1107.72,BUFFY,but it turns out everybody likes
1104.49,1107.72,BUFFY,a good goat's tongue.
1107.81,1112.13,BUFFY,"Rock groups, covens, Greek cookbooks."
1107.81,1112.13,BUFFY,She said she couldn't narrow it down.
1112.21,1113.86,ROBIN WOOD,And you trust her?
1113.86,1116.6,BUFFY,Yes. Why wouldn't l trust her?
1116.69,1122.02,ROBIN WOOD,Why should any of you trust each other?
1116.69,1122.02,ROBIN WOOD,You've all been evil.
1120.09,1122.85,BUFFY,"No, that's not true."
1122.93,1127.09,BUFFY,"Yeah, Willow had a bad patch,"
1122.93,1127.09,BUFFY,but l've never been.
1127.17,1130.77,ROBIN WOOD,"Evil is what evil does,"
1127.17,1130.77,ROBIN WOOD,and l know what you're doing.
1134.01,1137.53,ROBIN WOOD,"You're with that vampire,"
1134.01,1137.53,ROBIN WOOD,screwing that vampire.
1137.61,1139.81,ROBIN WOOD,You filthy whore!
1140.89,1143.45,BUFFY,"Robin, are you OK?"
1143.53,1145.52,ROBIN WOOD,Whoa...
1146.09,1147.73,ROBIN WOOD,What happened?
1147.81,1150.89,BUFFY,l... think it was controlling you.
1152.29,1157.32,ROBIN WOOD,"Buffy, we gotta get rid of this seal. Shut"
1152.29,1157.32,ROBIN WOOD,it down before it starts affecting everyone.
1157.41,1160.05,BUFFY,l have a pretty good idea
1157.41,1160.05,BUFFY,who we should talk to.
1160.13,1163.09,ROBIN WOOD,Yeah? Who's that?
1163.17,1166.4,BUFFY,The guy that fed it its first drop of blood.

1170.85,1173.41,ROBIN WOOD,"God, l hope that's not a student."
1176.13,1178.46,28 INT. BASEMENT AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY,l thought l told you to piss off with
1178.46,1181.16,SPIKE,this bloody camera. Yet here you are again.
1181.25,1184.05,SPIKE,Would you sod off

1184.13,1188.25,ANDREW,"i></i> Spike, the light"
1184.13,1188.25,ANDREW,was kinda behind you.

1196.89,1197.95,ANYA,l thought l told you

1199.57,1201.93,SPIKE,Here you are again. Would you sod off...
1202.01,1206.17,ANYA,You keep dodging the question.
1202.01,1206.17,ANYA,l don't mean to.
1206.25,1209.69,XANDER,"lt's just... You know how l feel, right?"
1209.77,1213.69,XANDER,You were the one who didn't want
1209.77,1213.69,XANDER,to keep seeing each other.
1213.77,1216.53,ANYA,Now we hop on the merrygoround
1213.77,1216.53,ANYA,of rotating knives.
1216.61,1221.61,ANYA,"l blame you, and you blame me,"
1216.61,1221.61,ANYA,and we both end up all cut to shreds.

1224.13,1226.33,ANYA,Do you still love me?
1226.41,1228.13,XANDER,Yes.

1237.25,1240.05,ANYA,l don't know if that means anything either.

1298.97,1300.85,ANDREW,That would be very exciting on tape.
1300.93,1304.89,BUFFY,The school is out of control with energy
1300.93,1304.89,BUFFY,from the Hellmouth. lt's time to help.

1581.61,1585.45,WARREN/FIRST,lt's the only way for us to get our reward.

1590.17,1592.97,WILLOW,Wait a second. Go back.
1590.17,1592.97,WILLOW,What was that part again?
1593.05,1594.41,ANDREW,You mean this part?
1594.49,1596.96,ANDREW,i>#</i> We are as gods
1597.05,1600.84,WILLOW,Not that part. We need to see that knife.
1597.05,1600.84,WILLOW,There's something there.
1600.93,1602.92,BUFFY,"Kennedy, search his stuff."
1603.01,1608.04,ANDREW,lt's not in my stuff.
1603.01,1608.04,ANDREW,lt's in the kitchen in the cutlery drawer.
1608.13,1610.04,ANDREW,You didn't have any steak knives.
1610.13,1613.52,WILLOW,You put your old murder weapon
1610.13,1613.52,WILLOW,in with our utensils?
1613.61,1614.48,ANDREW,l washed it.
1614.48,1616.29,SPIKE,What are you looking for?
1616.37,1621.57,WILLOW,He said the First said something about
1616.37,1621.57,WILLOW,words. "Drive the words deep into him."
1621.65,1626.41,ANDREW,There was some carving on the blade.
1621.65,1626.41,ANDREW,l just thought it was a pattern.
1626.49,1628.48,KENNEDY,Found it.
1632.09,1636.05,WILLOW,"OK, you're Mr DemonSummoner."
1632.09,1636.05,WILLOW,How are you with demon languages?
1636.13,1643.56,ANDREW,"Whoa, you were right. lt's in Tawarick."
1636.13,1643.56,ANDREW,"lt's, like, protoTawarick. lt's really, really old."
1643.65,1645.3,KENNEDY,But what's the big?
1645.3,1649.02,ROBIN WOOD,We've never known anything about this seal.
1647.09,1651.25,ROBIN WOOD,Now we know that this knife and
1647.09,1651.25,ROBIN WOOD,this language are connected to it somehow.
1651.33,1653.62,WILLOW,"Andrew, do you speak Tawarick?"
1653.62,1654.77,ANDREW,l'm OK with it.
1654.85,1657.37,WILLOW,lt says...
1657.45,1662.93,ANDREW,The blood which l spill
1657.45,1662.93,ANDREW,l consecrate to the oldest evil."
1663.01,1664.05,KENNEDY,i></i> Creepy.
1664.13,1668.52,BUFFY,"Will, what are you thinking?"
1664.13,1668.52,BUFFY,You think you can do something with that?
1668.61,1670.92,WILLOW,Let me work on it.
1671.01,1673.21,WILLOW,l think it's got a shot.
1675.45,1679.45,BUFFY,"Guess what, Andy. You just won yourself"
1675.45,1679.45,BUFFY,a free vacation to the Hellmouth.
1679.53,1682.09,SPIKE,So he can do what?
1679.53,1682.09,SPIKE,Yell at it in its own language?
1682.17,1683.02,WILLOW,Maybe.
1683.02,1683.73,ROBIN WOOD,What?
1683.81,1684.96,ROBIN WOOD,l'm not following.
1684.96,1687.57,BUFFY,We have to deal with the seal right away.
1687.65,1691.61,BUFFY,"We might have to shut the school,"
1687.65,1691.61,BUFFY,and l'm not losing more territory to the First.
1691.69,1693.81,BUFFY,"Besides, it's all we've got."
1693.89,1699.13,WILLOW,"The seal responds to this language somehow,"
1693.89,1699.13,WILLOW,or the First wouldn't have needed the knife.
1699.21,1705.02,WILLOW,"Andrew knows the language,"
1699.21,1705.02,WILLOW,"can talk to it, maybe give it commands."
1703.09,1705.97,BUFFY,"Come on. Robin, Spike, let's go."
1718.49,1720.44,BUFFY,Riot that almost happened.
1720.44,1723.36,ROBIN WOOD,Looks to me like it happened after all.
1724.37,1727.57,SPIKE,Looks to me like it's still happening.
1729.73,1733.57,SPIKE,Nice way to run a school.
1729.73,1733.57,SPIKE,There's gotta be kids injured in here.
1733.65,1736.21,ROBIN WOOD,Yeah. Easy pickings for the likes of you.
1737.05,1739.52,SPIKE,"Hey, here to help, you know."
1739.52,1740.05,ROBIN WOOD,Right.
1741.33,1745.25,ANDREW,Check out Spike and the principal.
1741.33,1745.25,ANDREW,There's something going on there.
1745.33,1748.05,ANDREW,Sexual tension you could cut with a knife.
1752.81,1754.8,SPIKE,i></i>
1760.29,1762.25,SPIKE,"These kids went nuts, didn't they?"
1762.25,1762.89,ROBIN WOOD,No kidding.
1762.97,1764.38,BUFFY,"Shh, they'll hear you."
1764.38,1766.57,ROBIN WOOD,"Buffy, they're all the way down..."
1771.09,1771.57,BUFFY,Spike!
1771.57,1773.97,SPIKE,The kids are getting stronger.
1774.05,1777.36,ANDREW,"i></i> Oh, God. Struck down"
1774.05,1777.36,ANDREW,before l achieve redemption.
1807.77,1811.48,BUFFY,Spike! Don't kill them. They're just students.
1811.48,1812.53,SPIKE,They'll live.
1819.45,1822.6,BUFFY,"Spike, Wood, l need you to stay here,"
1819.45,1822.6,BUFFY,hold our line of retreat.
1822.69,1826.45,ANDREW,"So l'll stay here with these men,"
1822.69,1826.45,ANDREW,helping out that holding the line thing.
1826.53,1828.52,ANDREW,l'll be with Buffy.
1831.65,1834.49,ANDREW,"We make our way down the stairs,"
1831.65,1834.49,ANDREW,alert for any danger.
1834.57,1835.64,BUFFY,"Oh, stop it."
1835.64,1836.8,ANDREW,l was just...
1836.89,1838.61,BUFFY,No more.
1838.69,1841.33,ANDREW,But l want the world to see what you do.
1841.41,1843.9,BUFFY,This is too important to show the world.
1843.9,1844.96,ANDREW,"Ooh, l like that."
1845.05,1848.93,BUFFY,"Be quiet! l don't want a biographer,"
1845.05,1848.93,BUFFY,especially a murderer.
1849.01,1854.33,ANDREW,"Yeah, about that. We keep tossing that word"
1849.01,1854.33,ANDREW,"around, but that's not really what happened."
1854.41,1858.45,BUFFY,What? You stabbed Jonathan to death.
1854.41,1858.45,BUFFY,What were you trying to do?
1858.53,1860.69,BUFFY,Scratch his back from the front?
1860.69,1861.84,ANDREW,lt was confusing.
1861.93,1865.48,ANDREW,"Jonathan and l were digging, but Warren"
1861.93,1865.48,ANDREW,was there. Only l could see him.
1865.57,1868.23,ANDREW,i></i> Not one of them cares about you.
1868.23,1871.17,JONATHAN,But l care about them. That's why l'm here.
1871.25,1872.64,WARREN/FIRST,Do it. Stab him.
1872.64,1874.21,ANDREW,"No, l can't do it."
1874.29,1875.53,JONATHAN,What?
1875.53,1878.02,WARREN/FIRST,Do it now.
1876.09,1877.42,ANDREW,This isn't right.
1877.42,1878.13,WARREN/FIRST,Stab him.
1878.21,1879.42,JONATHAN,Who are you talking to?
1879.42,1880.57,WARREN/FIRST,What's wrong with you?
1880.65,1882.22,WARREN/FIRST,Are you a little coward?
1882.22,1884.77,ANDREW,No. But did you think l could use this?
1884.85,1885.81,WARREN/FIRST,That's good.
1885.81,1886.45,JONATHAN,A knife?
1886.53,1887.33,WARREN/FIRST,Just do it.
1887.33,1888.49,JONATHAN,What's going on?
1888.57,1890.55,ANDREW,He's making me do it.
1890.55,1891.96,JONATHAN,You tricked me.
1892.05,1893.94,JONATHAN,Damn you! l'll kill you first.
1893.94,1895.33,WARREN/FIRST,Stab him. You have to!
1895.41,1898.45,WARREN/FIRST,l'll kill you.
1895.41,1898.45,WARREN/FIRST,"lf you fail, l'll hate you forever!"
1905.13,1908.44,ANDREW,No!
1909.61,1913.81,ANDREW,"See, l'm a man trapped by circumstances"
1909.61,1913.81,ANDREW,into paying for a crime l didn't even...
1913.89,1914.2,ANDREW,What?
1914.2,1916.53,BUFFY,"No, l just thought you would say that."
1916.61,1919.73,BUFFY,l saw the seal possess Wood
1916.61,1919.73,BUFFY,like that earlier today.
1919.81,1922.37,ANDREW,Yes. Yes. See...
1922.45,1924.89,JONATHAN,i></i> That's why l'm here.
1930.21,1932.52,JONATHAN,Die! Die!
1938.09,1940.29,JONATHAN,What... have l done?
1942.05,1944.89,ANDREW,Get out of my brain!
1944.97,1947.36,BUFFY,Aargh!
1950.69,1952.9,BUFFY,You just changed your entire story.
1952.9,1953.41,ANDREW,Did not.
1953.49,1954.43,BUFFY,Ya did too.
1954.43,1956.49,ANDREW,"Did... Hey, here we are."
1957.05,1959.28,ANDREW,i> </i>
1957.05,1959.28,ANDREW,Wait.
1959.37,1961.81,BUFFY,There's someone in there.
1959.37,1961.81,BUFFY,We should go.
1961.89,1963.88,BUFFY,No. We are going in.
1963.97,1968.09,BUFFY,Just be prepared. The seal
1963.97,1968.09,BUFFY,could have done anything to them.
1968.17,1969.97,BUFFY,Go.
1974.25,1976.48,BUFFY,Nope. They're OK.
1984.89,1985.93,ANYA,i></i> Well.
1987.05,1988.37,BUFFY,"Well, well."
1988.37,1990.05,XANDER,That was nice.
1991.33,1993.89,ANYA,"lt certainly was, you carpenter, you."
1995.17,1999.09,XANDER,lt's too bad Buffy took
1995.17,1999.09,XANDER,"Spike's chains down, huh?"
1999.17,2001.16,ANYA,You said it.
2002.85,2005.49,XANDER,Mm... l feel good.
2007.29,2010.92,ANYA,"Well, yeah. l'm a spitfire in the bedroom."
2011.57,2014.93,XANDER,"Yeah, l knew we'd always do that again."
2015.01,2017.93,ANYA,"Yeah. One more time, anyway."
2018.61,2022.85,XANDER,ls that what that was? One more time?
2023.37,2026.76,ANYA,Do you think there should be more?
2026.85,2028.68,XANDER,l don't know.
2028.77,2031.49,XANDER,lt was nice. lt felt...
2033.49,2038.02,XANDER,lt felt like a one more time.
2037.09,2042.02,ANYA,l think maybe we're really over.
2040.57,2043.85,ANYA,"Which is... lt's good, right? l mean..."
2045.09,2047.08,ANYA,Now we can move on.
2048.09,2049.73,XANDER,Sure.
2056.13,2060.05,SPIKE,Wonder what's keeping 'em.
2056.13,2060.05,SPIKE,l thought they'd be up here by now.
2060.13,2063.21,SPIKE,"How'd they make this in here, you suppose?"
2064.61,2068.69,ROBIN WOOD,"Wood shop, l guess. lt's nice to know"
2064.61,2068.69,ROBIN WOOD,they pay attention in class.
2102.49,2108.05,ANDREW,She's like a woman fighting for more than life.
2102.49,2108.05,ANDREW,She fights like fighting is her life.
2108.53,2113.48,ANDREW,"lt is the air she breathes, and she knows"
2108.53,2113.48,ANDREW,she will win because there is no alternative.
2124.41,2126.61,BUFFY,"lt's your turn, Andrew."
2132.25,2135.13,BUFFY,"So you figure, what? l..."
2135.21,2137.89,BUFFY,"l stand on the seal, and hold the knife,"
2137.89,2140.77,ANDREW,and command it to stop glowing in Tawarick?
2142.17,2144.31,BUFFY,Or we could do this.
2144.31,2144.85,ANDREW,What?
2145.49,2150.2,BUFFY,"Doesn't really make sense, does it?"
2145.49,2150.2,BUFFY,Bringing you here to talk to it?
2150.29,2156.02,BUFFY,This thing doesn't understand words.
2150.29,2156.02,BUFFY,lt understands blood.
2154.09,2158.56,ANDREW,Blood opens it. You don't wanna open it.
2154.09,2158.56,ANDREW,Opening it... would be bad.
2158.65,2161.45,BUFFY,"Yeah, Willow did a little research."
2161.53,2165.21,BUFFY,"Turns out, the blood of the person"
2161.53,2165.21,BUFFY,that awoke it  you 
2165.29,2169.13,BUFFY,different kinda deal.
2165.29,2169.13,BUFFY,lt reverses the whole thing.
2169.21,2174.02,ANDREW,So... how much blood?
2173.25,2175.32,ANDREW,Are you gonna...
2175.41,2178.88,BUFFY,l don't know. Maybe not enough to kill you.
2181.41,2184.21,BUFFY,"So, this is my redemption at last."
2184.29,2188.92,BUFFY,l buy back my bruised soul
2184.29,2188.92,BUFFY,with the blood of my heart.
2189.01,2191.45,BUFFY,But not enough to kill...
2191.53,2193.17,BUFFY,Stop!
2193.25,2195.48,BUFFY,Stop telling stories.
2195.57,2197.77,BUFFY,Life isn't a story.
2197.85,2199.68,ANDREW,Sorry. Sorry.
2199.77,2202.92,BUFFY,Shut up. You always do this.
2203.01,2207.25,BUFFY,"You make everything into a story,"
2203.01,2207.25,BUFFY,so no one's responsible for anything
2207.33,2209.93,BUFFY,because they're just following a script.
2209.93,2211.29,ANDREW,Please don't kill me.
2211.37,2215.76,ANDREW,Warren said Jonathan would be OK.
2211.37,2215.76,ANDREW,"l trusted him, and l lost my friend."
2215.85,2219.48,BUFFY,You didn't lose him. You murdered him.
2220.05,2221.85,BUFFY,l know.
2222.45,2226.08,ANDREW,You don't need to kill me.
2222.45,2226.08,ANDREW,You said we could all get through this.
2226.17,2229.48,BUFFY,l made it up. l'm making it all up.
2230.49,2233.61,BUFFY,So what kinda hero does that make me?
2233.69,2236.81,ANDREW,"No, you're doing great. Really. Kudos."
2237.89,2239.45,BUFFY,Yeah?
2239.53,2245.45,BUFFY,"Well, l don't like giving speeches about"
2239.53,2245.45,BUFFY,"how we're all gonna live, because we won't."
2245.53,2250.4,BUFFY,This isn't some story where good triumphs
2245.53,2250.4,BUFFY,because good triumphs.
2250.49,2252.64,BUFFY,Good people are going to die!
2253.41,2255.17,BUFFY,Girls.
2255.25,2257.4,BUFFY,Maybe me.
2257.49,2259.21,BUFFY,Probably you.
2259.85,2262.32,BUFFY,Probably right now.
2262.41,2264.32,ANDREW,Don't... Please.
2264.41,2266.4,ANDREW,"Don't, please!"
2267.33,2270.64,BUFFY,"When your blood pours out,"
2267.33,2270.64,BUFFY,it might save the world.
2270.73,2274.77,BUFFY,What do you think about that?
2270.73,2274.77,BUFFY,Does it buy it all back? Are you redeemed?
2274.85,2275.38,ANDREW,No.
2275.38,2276.81,BUFFY,Why not?
2276.89,2279.28,ANDREW,Because l killed him.
2279.37,2281.36,ANDREW,Because l...
2282.13,2286.89,ANDREW,"l listened to Warren,"
2282.13,2286.89,ANDREW,"and l pretended l thought it was him,"
2286.97,2289.97,ANDREW,but... l knew. l knew it wasn't.
2292.41,2297.02,ANDREW,And l killed Jonathan.
2295.09,2298.32,ANDREW,And now... you're gonna kill me.
2298.41,2303.25,ANDREW,"And l'm scared, and l'm going... to die."

2324.33,2325.28,ANDREW,lt stopped.
2325.28,2328.29,BUFFY,Didn't want blood. lt wanted tears.

2336.45,2339.37,ANDREW,"gonna stab me, were you?"
2339.45,2341.65,BUFFY,l wasn't going to stab you.
2344.41,2346.88,ANDREW,What if the tears didn't work?
2369.17,2371.04,ROBIN WOOD,She got it done.
2371.04,2372.32,SPIKE,Always has.
