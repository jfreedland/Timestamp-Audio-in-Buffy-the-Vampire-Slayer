2.61,4.84,,Isn't college cool?
5.65,9.49,,I just haven't had a lot of time
5.65,9.49,,to think about life at UC Sunnydale.
9.57,12.33,,Wow.
9.57,12.33,,Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
12.41,14.48,,Have you met your roommate yet?
12.41,14.48,,No.
14.77,17.97,,Hi.
14.77,17.97,,Hi. It's nice to meet you.
18.05,21.57,,Kathy. I just know that this
18.05,21.57,,whole year is gonna be super fun.
23.97,28.49,,I've forgotten my manners in the concussion.
23.97,28.49,,I'm Riley. Are you taking Intro Psych?
28.57,31.17,,You've taken it?
28.57,31.17,,I'm a TA. I help the professor.
31.25,32.65,,I'm Professor Walsh.
32.73,36.09,,Those who fall under my good graces
32.73,36.09,,will come to know me as Maggie.
36.17,40.53,,Those who don't will come to know me by
36.17,40.53,,the name my TAs use and think I don't know:
40.61,42.6,,the Evil Bitch Monster of Death.
42.69,46.65,,"Officially, you no longer have a watcher."
42.69,46.65,,I'll always be here when you need me.
46.73,48.17,,You'll have to take care of yourself.
53.05,55.65,,"So, college not so scary after all, huh?"
56.37,60.45,,"It's turning out to be a lot like high school,"
56.37,60.45,,which I can handle.
60.53,62.65,,At least I know what to expect.

71.25,73.48,Buffy,"Wow, this music is so,"
73.85,74.25,Buffy,so...
74.25,77.56,Kathy,"I know. This song is super fun, isn't it?"
77.81,84.02,Buffy,You bet. Itjust gets funner
77.81,84.02,Buffy,and funner every time you play it.
83.85,85.58,Kathy,Going out?
85.58,86.45,Buffy,Yeah.
87.45,89.6,Buffy,I'm seriously caffeine deprived.
89.69,92.53,Buffy,Figured I'd head down
89.69,92.53,Buffy,to The Grotto and get ajolt and
92.61,93.82,Buffy,do some studying.
93.82,96.45,Kathy,It's late. Won't you be up all night?
96.85,98.97,Buffy,"Oh, yeah, but it's cool."
99.05,102.57,Buffy,I'm sort of an up kinda night person.
104.09,105.29,Buffy,"I mentioned that, right?"
105.37,110.05,Kathy,I guess I didn't realise you'd be coming
105.37,110.05,Kathy,"and going at all hours. Well, not that I mind."
110.13,111.51,Kathy,I'm just surprised.
111.51,114.13,Buffy,"I'll be quiet as a mouse, I promise."
115.45,115.98,Buffy,OK.
115.98,117.92,Kathy,"Say, Buffy."
119.05,122.28,Kathy,I wanted to show you
119.05,122.28,Kathy,this little system I implemented.
123.53,124.97,Buffy,"Oh, goody. System."
125.05,129.57,Kathy,Just log every call you make in here
125.05,129.57,Kathy,so when the bill comes it won't be a problem.
129.65,131.93,Kathy,Cos I figure "A stitch in time...
131.93,133.17,Buffy,catches the worm."
134.53,137.33,Buffy,"You bet. OK, then."
138.85,140.84,Kathy,Also...
140.93,144.16,Kathy,I noticed that some of my milk was missing.
140.93,144.16,Kathy,Did you...?
144.73,146.79,Buffy,"Yeah, actually, I did. I meant to..."
146.79,149.2,Kathy,No. It's totally OK. I was just wondering.
149.29,152.08,Buffy,"Yeah, I was making my coffee and..."
152.08,155.02,Kathy,It's fine. I just wanted to make sure
160.21,162.77,Kathy,that we didn't have a thief or something.
162.85,165.41,Buffy,Like who? Sid the Wiley Dairy Gnome?
166.37,169.45,Kathy,I don't know... It's no big deal.
166.37,169.45,Kathy,"I mean, please, feel free."
169.61,172.37,Buffy,OK. I'm really sorry.
173.53,174.66,Buffy,I have to...
174.66,176.25,Kathy,Have a good time.
177.45,179.44,Buffy,"Yeah. You, too."
180.29,182.28,Buffy,With ironing.
192.25,194.69,Willow,So you had trouble getting past Kathy?
194.77,197.37,Buffy,Yep. She made big with the questions.
198.05,201.05,Willow,You thought your days
198.05,201.05,Willow,of sneaking out of your room were over.
201.13,203.28,Buffy,No such luck.
203.37,209.69,Buffy,"Kathy's nice and all, but she's, sort of,"
203.37,209.69,Buffy,"I don't know, like, MiniMom of Momdonia."
210.49,212.96,Buffy,Wait. Did you just hear something?
213.05,215.15,Willow,I'm chewing my gum kinda loud.
215.15,216.13,Buffy,That's not it.
216.21,217.76,Willow,My sneakers are squeaky.
217.76,220.21,Buffy,"I'm looking for something lurky, Will."
223.85,224.62,Willow,"Sorry, no."
224.62,227.69,Buffy,"Darn, I could use a little play tonight."
227.77,230.69,Buffy,Listening to the best of VH1 all day
227.77,230.69,Buffy,sorta put me on edge.
230.77,235.45,Willow,Kathy's still spinning the divas?
230.77,235.45,Willow,Cos it's the funnest.
235.53,238.89,Buffy,"It's no big. College is a time of change, right?"
239.73,242.77,Buffy,"Before too long,"
239.73,242.77,Buffy,she'll be triphopping all over the place.
242.85,247.61,Willow,Yeah. This whole dorm thing is just
242.85,247.61,Willow,an adjustment we need to make.
247.69,251.53,Willow,"You know? I mean, my roomie"
247.69,251.53,Willow,"is kind of ""challenging"", too."
252.21,254.6,Buffy,"And what are we,"
252.21,254.6,Buffy,if not women up to a challenge?
254.69,258.29,Willow,"Exactly. I mean,"
254.69,258.29,Willow,did we not put the "grr" in "girl"?
259.25,261.2,Willow,"Well, here's where I get off."
261.2,262.61,Buffy,Say hey to Oz for me.
262.69,263.83,Willow,Happy hunting.
263.83,265.21,Buffy,Wish me monsters.
341.93,343.92,Buffy,Will?
349.93,355.37,Buffy,"All right, why don't you quit hiding"
349.93,355.37,Buffy,and come out and face me like a thing?
356.93,358.92,Kathy,"Hey, I caught you."
360.05,361.22,Buffy,Is everything OK?
361.22,362.52,Kathy,Everything's super.
362.61,368.02,Kathy,I just decided a decaf latte
362.61,368.02,Kathy,sounded like heaven after all.
367.93,369.97,Buffy,So you're coming along.
370.49,374.96,Kathy,"Why not? This way, you don't have"
370.49,374.96,Kathy,to walk these spooky paths alone.
375.05,377.04,Buffy,Great.
377.25,379.24,Buffy,That's just great.
381.45,385.37,Kathy,"This is neat, isn't it? The fresh air, the trees."
385.45,387.68,Kathy,The smell of...
408.61,410.68,Kathy,What the blizzard was that all about?
411.37,414.84,Buffy,He tried to take my backpack.
414.93,418.37,Kathy,"God, what were you thinking,"
414.93,418.37,Kathy,taking him on like that?
418.45,421.84,Buffy,I don't know. I guess I panicked.
421.93,425.56,Kathy,"I mean, it's just you could've"
421.93,425.56,Kathy,gotten hurt or something.
425.65,428.25,Kathy,"God, and look at my sweater, it's ruined."
429.05,431.04,Buffy,"Yeah, sorry about that."
431.77,433.97,Buffy,"Here, we'll go get you cleaned up."
455.65,457.77,Buffy,Boring. Boring.
457.85,459.84,Buffy,Bill. Bill.
462.77,464.84,Giles,Hello.
464.93,466.12,Buffy,You run?
466.12,468.93,Giles,And jump. And bend.
470.61,473.03,Giles,And occasionally frolic.
473.03,473.33,Buffy,OK.
473.41,477.12,Buffy,And what's with the Motorbike
473.41,477.12,Buffy,and Scooter magazine?
477.21,480.52,Giles,"Congratulations, you've found me out."
477.21,480.52,Giles,I'm a mod jogger.
480.85,482.84,Buffy,Are you having a midlife thing?
482.93,486.29,Buffy,I still go "ish" from the last time
482.93,486.29,Buffy,you tried to recapture your youth.
486.37,487.37,Giles,Buffy.
487.37,488.36,Buffy,Sorry.
490.01,493.29,Buffy,Demon. Last night.
490.01,493.29,Buffy,"Made with the pummelling, but he got away."
493.37,496.68,Giles,What sort of demon?
493.37,496.68,Giles,He had a cloak on
496.77,501.21,Buffy,and glowing green eyes. And his skin
496.77,501.21,Buffy,"had a, like, superbad fake rubon tan."
502.45,503.81,Giles,Translate?
503.81,504.89,Buffy,Orangey.
505.29,508.21,Giles,Thank you. Anything else?
508.61,512.24,Buffy,"My roommate Kathy was there,"
508.61,512.24,Buffy,but she didn't see anything.
513.65,516.12,Giles,You took your roommate
513.65,516.12,Giles,patrolling with you?
516.21,520.81,Buffy,"I invited the whole dorm,"
516.21,520.81,Buffy,but she was the only one that could make it.
520.89,524.77,Buffy,I told her I was going for coffee
520.89,524.77,Buffy,and she decided to tag along.
525.01,528.53,Giles,We should discourage her from that habit.
525.01,528.53,Giles,"From what you describe,"
528.61,533.37,Giles,"I'm not familiar with the creature, but I'll"
528.61,533.37,Giles,give you a ring when I've found something.
533.45,535.29,Buffy,"You know, it's nice out here."
535.29,537.69,Giles,"Yes, I take my tea out here sometimes."
537.77,539.4,Buffy,What are you doing today?
539.4,541.48,Giles,"It's a big day for me, actually."
541.57,544.61,Giles,A friend acquired an original
541.57,544.61,Giles,Gutenberg demonography.
544.69,547.69,Giles,And you've never once asked me
544.69,547.69,Giles,"what my day's plans were,"
547.77,549.31,Giles,which leads me to inquire
549.31,551.29,Buffy,whether you're feeling yourself.
551.37,554.37,Buffy,That's not true. I ask about you all the time.
556.65,560.89,Buffy,"OK, maybe the words don't actually make it"
556.65,560.89,Buffy,"out of my mouth, but I think about it."
560.97,562.65,Giles,And it's appreciated.
562.73,566.57,Giles,Doesn't explain why you're hanging around
562.73,566.57,Giles,instead of rushing off as usual.
567.69,572.05,Buffy,"It's no big. I just figured I'd hang here,"
567.69,572.05,Buffy,"you know, until"
572.13,574.17,Buffy,my roommate goes to class.
575.81,577.37,Giles,I see.
577.93,581.81,Buffy,"I know, it's probably just me"
577.93,581.81,Buffy,having a bitch attack. But it's not me.
582.85,586.21,Giles,Living with somebody is never easy.
582.85,586.21,Giles,Especially for an only child.
586.29,588.85,Buffy,"Giles, listen. When sharpening her pencils,"
588.93,592.29,Buffy,she measures them with a ruler
588.93,592.29,Buffy,so they're all the same size.
592.37,596.37,Giles,"Which is fussy, I agree,"
592.37,596.37,Giles,but everybody has their idiosyncrasies.
596.45,598.6,Giles,You'd do well to learn to tolerate them.
598.69,601.84,Buffy,Or I'll end up an old lady
598.69,601.84,Buffy,who can only live with cats?
603.21,609.02,Giles,Something like that.
603.21,609.02,Giles,OK. You know what? You're right.
607.53,612.93,Giles,Take a mental pic. This is the new Buffy.
607.53,612.93,Giles,"Kinder, gentler, roommate extraordinaire."
695.17,697.81,Parker,Exboyfriend or loan shark?
700.17,700.94,Buffy,Excuse me?
700.94,703.25,Parker,The person you're hiding from.
705.17,706.37,Buffy,Both.
706.45,708.44,Buffy,Ugly breakup.
709.01,710.85,Buffy,"I'm sorry, I just cut you..."
710.85,713.29,Parker,"No, stay, stay. I'll watch your back."
720.25,721.51,Parker,"Freshman, huh?"
721.51,723.21,Buffy,Is it that obvious?
723.29,728.97,Parker,There are signs. People who've been around
723.29,728.97,Parker,know how to use their dininghall card.
729.05,730.53,Buffy,It's not for food?
730.61,735.61,Parker,"Work it right and you get three meals' worth,"
730.61,735.61,Parker,which equals fewer punch cards used.
735.69,738.05,Buffy,More cash from dad
735.69,738.05,Buffy,that you keep for yourself.
738.13,740.46,Buffy,"Right. See, the goal is to polish off"
740.46,743.16,Parker,as much as humanly possible in one sitting.
743.25,745.86,Buffy,"Enough to get you through the day, while"
745.86,748.53,Parker,chipmunking items for future consumption.
749.81,750.85,Buffy,Got it.
750.93,755.37,Parker,Excess dry goods
750.93,755.37,Parker,fit nicely in a backpack or your pocket.
755.45,760.29,Parker,"The wetter items  macaronis,"
755.45,760.29,Parker,your turkey loaf  then you're into Ziplocs.
760.37,761.87,Parker,It's not for beginners.
761.87,763.37,Buffy,I'll just take it slow.
774.13,774.61,Parker,So...
774.61,776.41,Buffy,"So, those are my..."
777.65,778.49,Buffy,Are you...?
778.49,780.85,Parker,"Oh, no, I have someone waiting."
780.93,782.76,Parker,"Otherwise, I'd..."
784.37,786.97,Parker,Parker Abrams. I'm at Kresky Hall.
787.77,790.16,Buffy,"Buffy Summers, Stevenson."
790.49,795.73,Parker,"OK. Well, I'll see you around,"
790.49,795.73,Parker,Buffy Summers of Stevenson.
796.37,798.76,Buffy,"See ya, Parker Abrams."
805.29,808.29,Xander,Hey. Say hi to NonCollege Guy.
809.53,813.77,Buffy,"Not that I mind, but don't noncollege guys"
809.53,813.77,Buffy,usually populate the noncampus?
813.85,817.61,Xander,Usually. I just thought I'd come around
813.85,817.61,Xander,and check on my girls.
817.69,819.03,Willow,And eat off my plate.
819.03,821.65,Buffy,What's the deal? Parents not feeding you?
821.73,825.31,Xander,Sure they do. For a price.
825.31,826.68,Willow,"So, spill."
826.77,829.85,Willow,"What was that all about,"
826.77,829.85,Willow,with the cutie patootie?
829.93,834.29,Buffy,"I don't know. Nothing serious, I think."
829.93,834.29,Buffy,Just random adorableness.
834.37,839.37,Xander,A technique I know well.
834.37,839.37,Xander,"Hit the girl with your best shot, then hasta."
839.45,841.34,Oz,Gotta respect the driveby.
841.34,843.45,Xander,"Low rejection, fond memories."
844.53,848.21,Willow,It looked like more than that to me.
844.53,848.21,Willow,He got all googlyeyed.
848.29,851.92,Xander,That's because he got hit by the Buffinator.
848.29,851.92,Xander,Now he's powerless.
852.01,852.92,Buffy,You think?
852.92,855.37,Oz,"No question, he'll be back."
856.65,858.8,Xander,So what else is up with the Buff?
858.89,860.7,Xander,Any vamp action?
860.7,861.04,Buffy,No.
861.13,864.57,Buffy,I did getjumped by a demon
861.13,864.57,Buffy,of nonspecific origin last night.
864.65,869.41,Xander,Yeah? Something apocalypsey?
864.65,869.41,Xander,Do we need to assemble the Scooby gang?
870.69,872.76,Buffy,"No, but thank you for asking."
873.37,875.6,Xander,"I just got way too excited, didn't I?"
875.69,878.13,Buffy,You need to get out of
875.69,878.13,Buffy,the basement a little more.
878.21,880.2,Kathy,"Hi, everybody."
881.45,883.21,Kathy,Squeeze in.
884.49,886.48,Buffy,"You all know my roomie, Kathy."
886.57,887.01,Willow,Hi.
887.01,888.61,Oz,"Hey, Kathy."
891.77,894.21,Buffy,Is that my sweater?
894.29,896.81,Kathy,I didn't think you'd mind.
894.29,896.81,Kathy,You got mine all muddy.
896.89,898.89,Buffy,I was saving you from a...
898.89,899.28,Willow,Bear.
900.17,902.16,Buffy,mugger.
902.73,909.33,Kathy,"It's not a problem, is it? I figure we're like"
902.73,909.33,Kathy,"sisters now, living together and everything."
912.93,915.73,Buffy,"No, it's... it's fine."
916.25,918.48,Buffy,I just wished you'd asked.
919.69,921.87,Xander,"So, where're you from, Kathy?"
921.87,923.45,Kathy,"Nebraska, originally."
923.53,926.09,Xander,"Ah, yes. Bigsky country."
935.85,937.49,Buffy,Can you believe her? First she acts
935.85,937.49,Buffy,like she has sit privileges at my lunch table
937.49,940.29,Buffy,Can you believe her? First she acts
937.49,940.29,Buffy,like she has sit privileges at my lunch table
940.37,943.29,Buffy,just because a computer
940.37,943.29,Buffy,decided to make us cellmates.
943.37,948.13,Willow,I'm sure it's not easy for her. She's
943.37,948.13,Willow,not like you  she doesn't know anybody here.
948.21,950.2,Buffy,Fine. But what about my sweater?
950.29,952.33,Buffy,You can't believe what I put up with.
952.41,954.4,Willow,"Yeah, I guess it's hard."
955.37,957.4,Willow,The sweater thing was an accident.
957.4,958.17,Buffy,I don't know.
958.25,961.69,,Sorry.
958.25,961.69,,I don't think I can take another day of this.
961.77,963.57,,She's back from the bathroom. Call you back.
968.45,970.68,,Don't forget to log those calls.
1015.89,1017.88,,Who left their gum here?
1019.41,1020.06,,Gum gnome?
1020.06,1022.85,Kathy,"It wasn't me. It had to be somebody, Buffy."
1024.77,1025.92,Buffy,I don't know.
1051.13,1054.17,Kathy,Do you always make that noise
1051.13,1054.17,Kathy,when you sleep?
1060.53,1063.68,Buffy,"So, after the scorpion, the demon opened my"
1063.68,1066.69,Kathy,mouth and sucked a weird light out of me.
1066.77,1071.4,Buffy,And the worst part? I wake up and
1066.77,1071.4,Buffy,"there's Kathy, staring at me like I'm a freak."
1071.49,1075.85,Oz,"Actually, the worst part, I'd have to go with"
1071.49,1075.85,Oz,the demon pouring blood down your throat.
1075.93,1080.02,Willow,"Me, too. I would vote for that, too."
1078.09,1080.85,Buffy,"But that's just a dream,"
1078.09,1080.85,Buffy,and this Kathy thing is real.
1080.93,1084.16,Buffy,All she cared about was
1080.93,1084.16,Buffy,her precious sleep being disturbed.
1084.25,1088.8,Giles,Perhaps it would be more productive
1084.25,1088.8,Giles,to examine your dreams.
1088.89,1091.77,Giles,Determine their meaning.
1091.85,1094.37,Kathy,You can read dreams? Neat.
1094.45,1097.13,Buffy,"Giles, Kathy. Kathy, Giles."
1097.41,1100.8,Willow,He's our grownup friend.
1097.41,1100.8,Willow,Not in a creepy way.
1102.13,1103.79,Giles,"Nice to meet you, Kathy."
1103.79,1104.2,Kathy,Ditto.
1104.29,1106.93,Kathy,Maybe you can read
1104.29,1106.93,Kathy,the dream I had last night?
1107.01,1110.61,Kathy,There was this monster and he sat on me
1107.01,1110.61,Kathy,and did all this stuff to me.
1110.69,1113.92,Oz,Stuff like scorpions?
1110.69,1113.92,Oz,And Bloody Mary minus the Mary?
1114.01,1114.88,Kathy,How'd you know?
1114.88,1116.32,Oz,"Well, I'm a good guesser."
1116.41,1120.73,Buffy,"Me, too. And I'm guessing that you need"
1116.41,1120.73,Buffy,"to be on your way to class. Right, Kath?"
1121.57,1124.04,Kathy,Somebody woke up
1121.57,1124.04,Kathy,on the wrong side of the bed.
1124.29,1127.09,Buffy,And guess what? You were next to it.
1127.85,1132.53,Kathy,"You know, I need to dash. My whole schedule"
1127.85,1132.53,Kathy,is off because someone kept me up all night.
1132.61,1134.97,Kathy,"Well, it's been fun. Toodles."
1135.05,1137.04,Buffy,Toodles.
1140.33,1142.36,Giles,You know what this means?
1142.36,1142.69,Buffy,Yes.
1142.77,1146.4,Buffy,"Not only does she take my sweater,"
1142.77,1146.4,Buffy,but now she has to horn in on my dreams.
1146.49,1150.93,Buffy,She is the most ever mooch.
1146.49,1150.93,Buffy,I haven't even gotten to the floss.
1151.01,1156.29,Giles,"Buffy, focus. Please? If Kathy and you"
1151.01,1156.29,Giles,"are having the same nightmares,"
1156.37,1158.11,Giles,chances are something happened
1158.11,1159.73,Willow,when you both met the demon.
1159.81,1165.05,Willow,So we need to figure out if this ritual they're
1159.81,1165.05,Willow,dreaming about has some use or meaning.
1165.45,1167.76,Buffy,Cool. You guys can do the brain thing.
1167.85,1169.23,Buffy,I'm gonna go to class.
1169.23,1171.48,Oz,Which could also be the brain thing.
1171.57,1174.13,Buffy,Not when you're minoring in Napping 101.
1176.53,1181.45,Willow,"OK, so that was the evil twin, right?"
1176.53,1181.45,Willow,Cos she was bordering on Cordeliaesque.
1181.53,1184.76,Oz,She's definitely pushing
1181.53,1184.76,Oz,the stress meter on this Kathy thing.
1184.85,1187.53,Giles,I concur that she's not herself.
1187.61,1191.85,Giles,"But, you know, learning"
1187.61,1191.85,Giles,to live with someone can be a challenge.
1191.93,1194.13,Willow,And she hasn't been sleeping.
1194.45,1198.05,Giles,"Right, then."
1194.45,1198.05,Giles,Nothing to get too concerned about.
1198.77,1200.84,Giles,"Still, let me know if she..."
1201.21,1203.2,Oz,Hits the red zone?
1204.29,1205.77,Giles,Yes.
1249.89,1253.28,Parker,Lots of popular artists don't get their dues.
1249.89,1253.28,Parker,Madonna. Whitney.
1253.37,1255.55,Kathy,That's so totally true.
1255.55,1256.21,Buffy,Parker?
1257.05,1262.84,Parker,Hey. I just stopped by
1257.05,1262.84,Parker,to say that. And bring you...
1264.69,1267.89,Parker,"You know, to maximise"
1264.69,1267.89,Parker,your dininghall exports.
1268.21,1269.68,Parker,They're heavyduty.
1269.68,1272.37,Buffy,Plus freezer guard". That's so...
1272.45,1276.41,Kathy,Parker was just gonna leave his number
1272.45,1276.41,Kathy,"and go, but we started talking."
1276.81,1279.28,Kathy,"He's such a blast, and the time just flew."
1279.89,1282.09,Buffy,Time? Really? How much time?
1283.45,1286.37,Parker,I'm not sure. We sort of
1283.45,1286.37,Parker,got caught up talking Red Wings.
1286.45,1289.84,Parker,It turns out Kathy's a closet hockey fan.
1286.45,1289.84,Parker,I think it's the violence.
1289.93,1292.28,Kathy,Quit it. I told you that was just between us.
1292.28,1293.69,Parker,It could be the sweaty men.
1293.77,1295.45,Parker,Stop.
1295.53,1300.56,Buffy,"Look, if you two are gonna rassle, can you"
1295.53,1300.56,Buffy,take it outside? I have a lot of work to do.
1301.37,1303.36,Parker,"Sorry, I didn't realise."
1304.93,1308.16,Buffy,"Parker, wait."
1304.93,1308.16,Buffy,"Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to..."
1308.25,1310.61,Parker,"No, it's totally cool. I should go anyway."
1310.93,1315.21,Buffy,"Well, it was great of you to stop by."
1310.93,1315.21,Buffy,Maybe we could do it another time?
1316.85,1319.08,Parker,"Another time, for sure."
1320.05,1321.19,Parker,"Bye, Kathy."
1321.19,1322.44,Kathy,Bye. See ya.
1329.69,1332.45,Kathy,It wouldn't have killed you
1329.69,1332.45,Kathy,"to be nice, you know."
1332.53,1335.61,Buffy,Looked like you were being
1332.53,1335.61,Buffy,nice enough for the both of us.
1335.69,1339.05,Kathy,"I wasn't moving in on your territory,"
1335.69,1339.05,Kathy,if that's what you mean.
1339.13,1342.13,Buffy,Right. Just like you didn't
1339.13,1342.13,Buffy,destroy my sweater.
1354.17,1354.99,Kathy,I'm cold.
1354.99,1357.56,Buffy,"Well, I'm hot. Deal with it."
1358.53,1360.67,Kathy,"D'you know what your problem is, Buffy?"
1360.67,1360.89,Buffy,You?
1360.97,1364.36,Buffy,Hardly. Your problem is you're spoiled.
1364.45,1368.53,Buffy,The world revolved around you where
1364.45,1368.53,Buffy,"you used to live, but it's share time now."
1368.61,1372.21,Buffy,"Share time, huh? Fine."
1368.61,1372.21,Buffy,I'll show you share time.
1393.13,1395.06,Oz,You're worried about her.
1395.06,1396.52,Willow,"Yeah, both of them."
1396.61,1401.93,Willow,What kind of demon runs around putting
1396.61,1401.93,Willow,ooky blood dreams into people's heads?
1402.01,1405.45,Willow,Like some kind of nightmare fairy.
1402.01,1405.45,Willow,It's not right.
1405.53,1407.22,Oz,"Well, I'm against it."
1407.22,1410.53,Willow,And Buffy's completely being not herself.
1411.01,1414.05,Willow,"If it wasn't for this English paper,"
1411.01,1414.05,Willow,I'd be there right now.
1414.13,1417.52,Willow,"You know, listening."
1414.13,1417.52,Willow,Doing the girly best friend thing.
1419.09,1421.23,Oz,"Well, I can do that."
1421.23,1422.09,Willow,You can?
1422.17,1425.77,Oz,"I'm not saying we'll braid each other's hair,"
1422.17,1425.77,Oz,but I can hang with her.
1425.85,1428.51,Oz,Watch for signs she's going over the edge.
1428.51,1429.53,Willow,You're the best.
1429.61,1431.73,Willow,She's probably patrolling by now.
1431.81,1434.12,Willow,Check around the science centre.
1434.21,1439.16,Willow,"If you need me, I'll be at the library."
1469.61,1474.61,Buffy,so then Kathy's like "It's share time."
1469.61,1474.61,Buffy,"And I'm like ""Oh, yeah? Share this."""
1476.57,1480.17,Oz,"So either you hit her,"
1476.57,1480.17,Oz,or you did your wacky mime routine for her.
1480.93,1484.61,Buffy,"I didn't do either, actually."
1480.93,1484.61,Buffy,"But she deserved it, don't you think?"
1484.69,1487.32,Oz,"Nobody deserves a mime, Buffy."
1487.32,1488.29,Buffy,Kathy does.
1488.85,1493.97,Buffy,She deserves to be locked in an invisible box
1488.85,1493.97,Buffy,and blown away by an imaginary wind and...
1494.05,1495.97,Oz,Forced to wear a binding unitard?
1495.97,1497.65,Buffy,The itchy kind. It's perfect.
1497.73,1499.63,Oz,I'm just here to help.
1499.63,1501.28,Buffy,Which I appreciate.
1501.37,1506.29,Buffy,But you've never come on routine patrol
1501.37,1506.29,Buffy,"with me before, Oz. So what's the deal?"
1506.57,1509.04,Oz,Seemed more interesting than homework.
1509.13,1513.05,Buffy,As long as it's an elective.
1509.13,1513.05,Buffy,"I can handle myself alone, you know."
1513.13,1514.93,Oz,Not in question.
1514.93,1515.49,Buffy,Good.
1515.85,1519.37,Buffy,"So, I go to the refrigerator, right?"
1515.85,1519.37,Buffy,And the Label Queen has put...
1519.45,1524.32,Oz,Just a thought  do you think all this
1519.45,1524.32,Oz,ranting is scaring away potential demons?
1525.05,1529.49,Buffy,You're right.
1525.05,1529.49,Buffy,She's even affecting my work now.
1529.57,1533.49,Buffy,She's the Titanic.
1529.57,1533.49,Buffy,She's a crawling black cancer.
1535.53,1538.97,Buffy,She's other really bad things.
1539.33,1543.41,Oz,"On the plus side, you killed the bench,"
1539.33,1543.41,Oz,which was looking shifty.
1544.05,1547.6,Buffy,"This isn't funny, Oz."
1544.05,1547.6,Buffy,Something has to be done.
1550.77,1552.37,Oz,Agreed.
1628.85,1630.84,Buffy,I'm going to bed.
1661.97,1663.88,Kathy,"Oh, jeez."
1666.37,1669.97,Kathy,"I do what I can, but Buffy's difficult."
1666.37,1669.97,Kathy,"She's secretive, for one thing."
1670.05,1673.97,Kathy,She comes in at all hours of the night.
1670.05,1673.97,Kathy,She leaves her gum all over the place.
1674.05,1678.6,Willow,"It sounds like things are rough, but don't"
1674.05,1678.6,Willow,you wanna be talking to Buffy about this?
1678.69,1682.24,Kathy,"I would, but she's so touchy"
1678.69,1682.24,Kathy,about all kinds of weird stuff.
1682.33,1686.88,Kathy,"I mean, sometimes I get the feeling"
1682.33,1686.88,Kathy,that she is not quite normal. You know?
1686.97,1689.61,Willow,"Well, normal is relative, right?"
1694.81,1696.8,Kathy,"Later, OK?"
1699.93,1701.65,Buffy,Why were you talking to her?
1701.65,1704.05,Willow,"Buffy, come on. We were just saying hi."
1704.13,1706.44,Kathy,"Yeah, that's what she wants you to think."
1706.53,1708.68,Willow,"Buffy, this has to stop."
1708.77,1713.8,Willow,"I mean, I get it. I have a sucky roomie, too."
1708.77,1713.8,Willow,But you just have to deal.
1715.05,1721.02,Buffy,You're right. I've been
1715.05,1721.02,Buffy,thinking a lot about this and
1719.09,1720.69,Buffy,it's clear to me now.
1720.69,1722.21,Willow,Good. That's better.
1722.29,1725.09,Buffy,Kathy's evil. I'm an evil fighter.
1725.85,1728.45,Buffy,It's simple. I'm gonna have to kill her.
1733.85,1736.05,Willow,You have to kill her?
1736.13,1739.57,Willow,Don't you think you could
1736.13,1739.57,Willow,just switch rooms or something?
1739.65,1742.93,Buffy,"Well, I would, but it's notjust me"
1739.65,1742.93,Buffy,in danger from Kathy.
1743.01,1744.69,Buffy,Look.
1747.01,1749.61,Willow,Toenails?
1747.01,1749.61,Willow,Evil toenails.
1750.29,1753.84,Buffy,I took them when she was in the bathroom.
1750.29,1753.84,Buffy,She thought I was asleep.
1753.93,1757.4,Willow,Cos in the middle of the night
1753.93,1757.4,Willow,they could have attacked you
1757.49,1759.96,Willow,and left little marks all over your body.
1760.05,1762.41,Buffy,Don't be ridiculous.
1762.49,1766.09,Buffy,I measured them before I fell asleep
1762.49,1766.09,Buffy,"and again this morning,"
1766.17,1770.45,Buffy,and they grew. After they were cut.
1766.17,1770.45,Buffy,That's a demon thing.
1770.53,1772.49,Buffy,She has to be eliminated.
1772.49,1774.85,Willow,Of course. It makes sense now.
1774.93,1779.64,Willow,But you'd better show those bad puppies to
1774.93,1779.64,Willow,"Giles before you do anything, just to be sure."
1779.73,1783.17,Buffy,Absolutely. I wouldn't wanna
1779.73,1783.17,Buffy,do anything crazy.
1783.89,1787.68,Willow,You hurry on to Giles.
1783.89,1787.68,Willow,I'll hang here and keep an eye on Kathy.
1787.77,1791.29,Buffy,"Great. Good. Thanks, Will."
1799.45,1805.24,Willow,"Giles. I just talked to Buffy and, yeah,"
1799.45,1805.24,Willow,I think she's feeling a little insane.
1805.93,1810.61,Willow,"No, not bitchy crazy."
1805.93,1810.61,Willow,More like homicidalmaniac crazy?
1810.69,1813.05,Willow,"So I told her to come see you, OK?"
1815.93,1817.92,Willow,Giles?
1820.45,1822.44,Buffy,Anybody home?
1824.85,1826.65,Buffy,Hello?
1829.05,1832.44,Buffy,What are you guys doing?
1829.05,1832.44,Buffy,This is... this is ridiculous.
1832.53,1834.59,Xander,This hurts me more than it hurts you.
1834.59,1835.76,Buffy,"Not yet, but it will."
1835.89,1837.53,Xander,Don't say that.
1838.09,1839.77,Xander,Please don't say that.
1839.85,1843.69,Giles,We're doing this to stop you
1839.85,1843.69,Giles,from making a terrible mistake.
1845.69,1847.97,Giles,"Clearly, something is amiss."
1848.05,1849.4,Giles,"Yeah, something's amiss,"
1849.4,1850.52,Buffy,a Miss Kathy Newman.
1850.61,1855.02,Buffy,"Giles. Giles, look in my bag."
1853.09,1858.65,Buffy,Look in the bottom pocket of my bag. She
1853.09,1858.65,Buffy,has parts that grow after they're detached.
1858.73,1862.97,Buffy,She irons herjeans. She's evil.
1858.73,1862.97,Buffy,She has to be destroyed.
1863.05,1866.73,Giles,I fear the demon that Buffy met in the woods
1863.05,1866.73,Giles,has somehow possessed her.
1866.81,1869.49,Buffy,Lite FM. Nothing but love songs.
1869.49,1870.33,Xander,You think?
1871.13,1876.57,Giles,You stay and watch her. I know a spell that
1871.13,1876.57,Giles,"will reveal the demon so that we can fight it,"
1876.65,1880.04,Giles,but I need to get some supplies
1876.65,1880.04,Giles,from the magic shop.
1880.13,1883.76,Giles,"Buffy, I... See you around."
1892.45,1893.75,Willow,Can I come in?
1893.75,1894.21,Kathy,Sure.
1896.89,1898.34,Kathy,Where's Buffy?
1898.34,1900.52,Willow,I don't know exactly.
1901.13,1907.93,Willow,But I've been thinking. You and Buffy
1901.13,1907.93,Willow,should give each other some apart time.
1908.01,1912.53,Willow,"In fact, you might wanna be apart"
1908.01,1912.53,Willow,before she gets back.
1912.61,1915.29,Kathy,What do you mean?
1912.61,1915.29,Kathy,I should leave the room?
1915.37,1916.73,Kathy,Why should I go?
1916.73,1918.6,Willow,"It's not fair, I know."
1918.89,1923.09,Kathy,"You bet it's not fair, having to live"
1918.89,1923.09,Kathy,with someone who's obviously troubled.
1923.17,1926.45,Kathy,Someone who so clearly needs
1923.17,1926.45,Kathy,"to be in a home, not in a dorm."
1926.85,1930.73,Willow,I don't know about that.
1926.85,1930.73,Willow,"Buffy's going through something, yes, but..."
1930.81,1932.98,Kathy,"I wouldn't put it past her to drop out, or"
1932.98,1935.2,Willow,take off. Do something horrible to herself.
1935.29,1935.96,Willow,Herself?
1935.96,1939.29,Kathy,"Or worse. She's capable of it, you know."
1939.77,1943.08,Kathy,You can see it
1939.77,1943.08,Kathy,in those shifty little eyes of hers.
1943.17,1945.81,Kathy,One of these days
1943.17,1945.81,Kathy,she might push somebody too far.
1949.77,1951.76,Kathy,Hello?
1952.33,1954.32,Kathy,It's Oz.
1954.85,1959.21,Kathy,Hi. You did? She's at Giles'. OK.
1960.77,1966.48,Willow,"You know, during that really"
1960.77,1966.48,Willow,short phone call I realised you are so right.
1966.57,1971.25,Willow,"I mean, it's not fair to make you"
1966.57,1971.25,Willow,"leave your own room. So, you're good."
1971.33,1973.72,Buffy,"You just stay, right there. OK?"
1975.45,1976.97,Buffy,I can't believe this.
1977.05,1981.57,Buffy,"After all we've been through, and you won't"
1977.05,1981.57,Buffy,believe me when I tell you that Kathy is bad.
1981.65,1983.77,Xander,"We want to, Buff. It's just..."
1983.77,1984.69,Oz,Don't engage.
1987.37,1990.37,Xander,I don't know if I tightened
1987.37,1990.37,Xander,those ropes enough.
1991.21,1994.57,Oz,"Well, then we'd better"
1991.21,1994.57,Oz,go over there and check 'em.
1998.01,2000.05,Xander,"Oh, dear God."
2002.77,2004.76,Xander,Avoid the legs.
2005.85,2007.84,Xander,Avoid the legs.
2012.85,2014.84,Buffy,"Nope, not tight enough."
2026.05,2027.73,Buffy,Kathy.
2028.57,2030.25,Kathy,Buffy.
2031.37,2033.65,Buffy,"I think we need to talk, don't you?"
2035.25,2038.56,Kathy,Absolutely. Let's talk.
2042.85,2044.57,Buffy,Look what I did.
2047.81,2049.96,Buffy,Look what I did.
2061.53,2064.05,Buffy,I knew it.
2085.13,2085.75,Kathy,Quit it.
2085.75,2088.44,Buffy,I knew it. I knew you were a demon.
2088.53,2091.37,Kathy,Why don't you just stuff it
2088.53,2091.37,Kathy,and let me finish my ritual?
2091.45,2091.97,Buffy,Ritual?
2091.97,2093.76,Giles,"The ritual of Mok'tagar,"
2093.85,2097.45,Giles,transdimensional demons:
2093.85,2097.45,Giles,forced ingestion of animal blood
2097.53,2099.52,Giles,while the victim slumbers."
2100.93,2102.17,Giles,Buffy's nightmares...
2102.17,2102.76,Buffy,were real.
2102.85,2107.85,Kathy,"I'm sorry, OK? I left my dimension to go"
2102.85,2107.85,Kathy,to college and they sent these guys after me.
2107.93,2109.72,Kathy,While they can assume many forms
2109.72,2111.29,Giles,"and guises, including human,"
2111.37,2115.13,Giles,they can always be recognised
2111.37,2115.13,Giles,by others of their kind
2115.21,2116.81,Giles,due to the lack of a soul."
2116.89,2118.28,Kathy,So I'm borrowing yours.
2118.28,2119.49,Buffy,Without even asking.
2119.57,2123.45,Kathy,"Tonight, when they come looking for me,"
2119.57,2123.45,Kathy,they'll take the one without a soul.
2123.53,2125.71,Buffy,I won't have to watch you floss.
2125.71,2128.24,Kathy,And I won't have to live with a slob.
2148.85,2151.57,Kathy,"It's share time, Buffy."
2155.61,2158.45,Buffy,Fine. Then let's start with my sweater.
2171.33,2175.85,Xander,Why couldn't Giles have shackles
2171.33,2175.85,Xander,like any selfrespecting bachelor?
2175.93,2178.53,Willow,"Guys, I just saw Kathy and she's acting..."
2178.85,2180.59,Willow,"Oh, my God. Are you OK?"
2180.59,2180.97,Oz,Yeah.
2181.05,2182.92,Oz,Buffy's got a pretty good lead on us.
2182.92,2185.25,Willow,"I'll call Kathy, tell her to get out of there."
2185.33,2189.96,Kathy,All you had to do was
2185.33,2189.96,Kathy,write down your calls.
2191.13,2192.18,Willow,No answer.
2192.18,2193.12,Giles,Toenails.
2194.65,2198.41,Giles,Buffy's right. Kathy's toenails
2194.65,2198.41,Giles,"not only grow after they're cut,"
2198.49,2199.88,Giles,they actually regenerate
2199.88,2201.09,Willow,if they're destroyed.
2201.17,2202.87,Willow,And that's a demon thing?
2202.87,2204.56,Giles,"Unequivocally, yes. So..."
2205.05,2207.04,Giles,Where is Buffy?
2208.37,2211.33,Giles,"Oh, dear, we have"
2208.37,2211.33,Giles,even less time than I feared.
2211.41,2213.85,Giles,I've looked up all known
2211.41,2213.85,Giles,regenerating demons.
2213.93,2218.17,Giles,Only one species practises the ritual
2213.93,2218.17,Giles,that Buffy's been seeing in her sleep.
2218.25,2220.53,Giles,It's used to steal the soul from a human body.
2220.61,2225.32,Xander,Wait. Has Buffy been doing a Linda Blair on
2220.61,2225.32,Xander,us because Kathy's been sucking her soul?
2225.41,2227.38,Giles,"I believe so, yes. Excuse me, please."
2227.38,2228.93,Willow,So Buffy was right all along.
2229.01,2230.52,Willow,"Later on, big remorse."
2230.52,2232.93,Giles,"Now, I've found a spell that should"
2233.01,2237.56,Giles,reverse the soul transfer procedure
2233.01,2237.56,Giles,immediately. Willow and I will perform it.
2237.65,2240.85,Oz,Leaving Xander and me
2237.65,2240.85,Oz,to help Buffy in the flesh.
2240.93,2243.93,Giles,"Hear me, elders of the upper reaches."""
2244.01,2251.02,Giles,Elders of the lower reaches. Elders
2244.01,2251.02,Giles,of the dry land. Elders of the river flats."
2266.13,2269.52,Student,Do you mind? People are trying to study.
2277.33,2281.21,Giles,"Ancients, I beseech you. The soul,"
2277.33,2281.21,Giles,"abstracted, let it revert to its true seat."""
2282.45,2284.76,Kathy,The window's open. Happy?
2291.33,2293.53,Kathy,Open up. Let me finish.
2293.61,2294.76,Giles,Let it be finished."
2294.85,2298.29,Giles,Let the unnatural vessel be emptied. Let
2294.85,2298.29,Giles,the essence be returned to its original host."
2309.17,2311.16,Kathy,How did you do...?
2375.53,2376.6,Willow,How's that?
2376.6,2378.65,Buffy,A little to the left.
2379.61,2381.6,Buffy,There. Perfect.
2382.01,2383.84,Buffy,"I'm so glad you're here, Will."
2383.93,2385.56,Buffy,I can already feel all that bad
2385.56,2386.93,Willow,Kathy karma draining away.
2387.57,2390.17,Willow,About that. The Kathy thing?
2390.25,2392.08,Willow,I'm sorry I doubted you.
2392.08,2394.13,Buffy,You're completely forgiven.
2394.21,2396.2,Buffy,"I mean, you had reason to doubt."
2396.29,2401.49,Buffy,"Except for the soulsucking thing, I bet Kathy"
2396.29,2401.49,Buffy,was pretty regular  as far as roomies go.
2401.69,2404.1,Willow,That's a pretty big "except".
2404.1,2404.77,,I guess.
2404.85,2408.64,,I'm just glad that it was Kathy's
2404.85,2408.64,,demony ways making me NoFun Buffy.
2408.73,2410.96,,I've always thought I was pretty easygoing.
2411.05,2414.36,,It's not like I have the big issues.
2411.05,2414.36,,I don't burn incense or...
2414.45,2416.13,,Are you gonna finish this?
