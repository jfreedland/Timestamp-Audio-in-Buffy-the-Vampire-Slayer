20.68,22.7,,Well.
25.25,26.58,,Well.
26.65,29.38,,That was... very...
29.45,30.85,,artistic.
32.86,34.02,,Yeah.
34.09,36.03,,It wasn't what
34.09,36.03,,I expected.
36.09,39.86,,I've never actually seen...
39.93,41.59,,"Well, from the title,"
41.67,44.19,,I thought it
41.67,44.19,,was about food.
44.27,46.13,Angel,"Well, there was food."
47.57,51.44,Angel,Right. ThThe scene
47.57,51.44,Angel,with the... food.
53.24,57.44,Buffy,"So, feel like getting"
53.24,57.44,Buffy,some hot chocolate
57.52,59.24,Buffy,or some cold shower?
59.32,60.54,Angel,I'm sorry.
60.62,63.25,Angel,I wanted to take you out
60.62,63.25,Angel,somewhere fun.
63.32,67.62,Angel,It's been a long time since
63.32,67.62,Angel,I've been to the movies.
67.69,69.06,Angel,They've changed.
69.13,71.19,Buffy,A little scary.
72.66,76.26,Buffy,"And a little not,"
72.66,76.26,Buffy,which is also scary.
77.33,78.49,Angel,I'm sorry.
78.57,81.97,Buffy,I just don't like getting you
78.57,81.97,Buffy,worked up like that.
82.04,85.3,Angel,We can't actually do
82.04,85.3,Angel,any of those things.
85.38,86.57,Angel,"You'd lose your soul,"
86.64,87.92,Buffy,"and besides, I don't"
87.92,89.08,Angel,even own a kimono.
89.15,91.84,Angel,"Buffy, you don't have"
89.15,91.84,Angel,to worry about me.
91.92,93.48,Angel,I just don't like
93.48,95.58,Buffy,to rub your nose in it.
95.65,98.42,Buffy,Suddenly wondering
95.65,98.42,Buffy,where that expression comes from.
98.49,101.08,Angel,"Look, I don't need to see movies"
98.49,101.08,Angel,to get worked up.
101.16,102.89,Angel,Just being around you
101.16,102.89,Angel,does that just fine.
102.96,105.52,Angel,It doesn't mean that
102.96,105.52,Angel,"I'm gonna lose control,"
105.6,108,Angel,or that I'm gonna be
105.6,108,Angel,frustrated around you.
108.07,110.93,Angel,It feels nice just to feel.
113.02,114.8,Buffy,It doesn't drive you crazy
113.02,114.8,Buffy,when we're close?
114.87,116.53,Angel,Watch this.
126.95,129.25,Angel,See?
129.32,132.31,Angel,Safe as houses.
141.43,142.96,Faith,Check out
141.43,142.96,Faith,the lust bunnies.
147.94,150.3,Buffy,Patrol?
151.54,154.48,Angel,Council has you back
151.54,154.48,Angel,on active duty?
154.55,157.64,Faith,Finally.
154.55,157.64,Faith,They want us down by Mercer.
157.72,159.34,Buffy,OK.
161.15,162.62,Buffy,Good night.
165.06,167.18,Angel,I'll see you soon.
167.26,168.69,Faith,"Don't worry, big guy."
168.76,170.69,Faith,Just keeping her warm for you.
180.2,182.14,Faith,"I gotta tell you, B."
182.21,184.54,Faith,The willpower thing?
182.21,184.54,Faith,Nice job.
184.61,186.54,Buffy,Thanks. What?
186.61,189.55,Faith,The "close but no cigar"
186.61,189.55,Faith,deal with Angel.
189.61,192.55,Faith,I don't know if I could
189.61,192.55,Faith,"handle, you know,"
192.62,194.52,Faith,the way you're
192.62,194.52,Faith,not handling it.
194.59,197.99,Buffy,"Faith, when it comes to Angel,"
194.59,197.99,Buffy,do me a favor. Duck!
198.06,198.99,Buffy,
199.06,200.49,Demon,"Ow! What are you, nuts?"
200.56,202.36,Demon,Going around
200.56,202.36,Demon,punching people?
203.43,204.39,Buffy,People?
204.46,207.12,Demon,"So what, I'm a demon."
204.46,207.12,Demon,That makes it OK?
207.2,208.56,Demon,Hold it! Whoa!
208.63,211.43,Demon,Stake me now and you'll never
208.63,211.43,Demon,find out what I got for you.
211.5,212.94,Demon,Huh? Think about it.
215.02,215.23,Demon,Demon seeks slayers.
215.02,215.23,Demon,Highly unusual?
219.02,217.94,Faith,Talk fast.
220.02,220.57,Demon,How'd you like
220.02,220.57,Demon,to get your hands
220.64,222.48,Demon,"on the Books of Ascension, huh?"
222.55,224.64,Buffy,Never heard of them.
224.72,225.64,Faith,Books of Ascension...
225.64,226.51,,"very powerful works,"
226.58,228.71,,and I'm not talking
226.58,228.71,,about the prose.
228.79,230.52,,They deal
228.79,230.52,,"with some dark stuff,"
230.59,232.75,,"and the mayor,"
230.59,232.75,,he would hate it
232.82,236.12,,if somebody got ahold of them
232.82,236.12,,"before he... Well, you know."
236.19,238.29,,Don't know.
236.19,238.29,,Before he what?
238.36,239.52,,"Hey, hey, read 'em"
238.36,239.52,,and weep.
239.6,240.89,,That's all I got to say.
240.97,242.9,,Tomorrow I get the books.
242.97,244.56,,"Meet me here,"
242.97,244.56,,"and if the price is right,"
244.64,246.5,,"well, I give the books"
244.64,246.5,,to you.
246.57,248.56,,Not really looking
246.57,248.56,,to trade with a demon.
248.64,250.54,,And if this were still
248.64,250.54,,"a barter economy,"
250.61,253.3,,that would be a problem.
250.61,253.3,,"I want cash, princess."
253.38,257.02,,large for the whole set.
255.08,257.14,,So you can buy...
255.08,257.14,,I'm guessing here...
257.21,258.61,,some skin care products?
258.68,261.12,,Plane ticket out
258.68,261.12,,of the hellmouth
261.19,263.75,,"before it's adios, slayer loco."
263.82,266.98,,"So, 5 G's?"
263.82,266.98,,What do you say?
267.06,269.18,,"I think ""Die, fiend,"""
267.06,269.18,,"sums it up,"
269.26,270.69,,wouldn't you say?
270.76,272.13,,"Oh, let him go."
272.2,275.06,,I don't think he falls into
272.2,275.06,,the deadly threat to humanity category.
275.13,277.07,Faith,Demon's a demon.
277.13,280.19,Buffy,I'd like to know more about
277.13,280.19,Buffy,these Books of Ascension.
280.27,283.83,Buffy,Anything that would pin
280.27,283.83,Buffy,the mayor down would be great.
284.94,287.84,Faith,Yeah... it'd be great.
343.68,347.01,Mayor,And what exactly did
343.68,347.01,Mayor,this demon look like?
347.08,348.81,Faith,Demonic.
348.89,351.48,Mayor,Ah. And you say he has
351.56,354.12,Mayor,"the Books of Ascension,"
351.56,354.12,Mayor,"or will soon,"
354.19,358.29,Mayor,"and he was, what,"
354.19,358.29,Mayor,willing to sell them?
358.36,359.73,Faith,That's what I said.
359.8,360.73,Mayor,Hmm.
360.8,362.73,Mayor,You know what I wish?
362.8,365.89,Mayor,I wish you'd pull
362.8,365.89,Mayor,your hair back.
365.97,368.1,Mayor,"I know, I know, fashion"
365.97,368.1,Mayor,"isn't exactly my thing,"
368.17,372.2,Mayor,"but gosh darn it, you know,"
368.17,372.2,Mayor,you've got such a nice face.
372.28,377.02,Mayor,I can't understand
372.28,377.02,Mayor,why you hide it.
375.08,376.71,Faith,Yeah. Sure.
376.78,378.27,Faith,Whatever.
378.35,380.32,Faith,It's just a matter
378.35,380.32,Faith,of time
380.38,382.22,Faith,before this demon guy's
380.38,382.22,Faith,gonna spill.
382.29,384.45,Faith,Then Buffy
382.29,384.45,Faith,and the Super Friends...
384.52,387.22,Mayor,You worry too much
384.52,387.22,Mayor,for a girl your age.
387.29,388.22,Mayor,That's unnecessary stress.
388.29,390.12,Mayor,"Luckily, I've got"
388.29,390.12,Mayor,just the thing.
398.64,400.07,Mayor,There you go.
400.14,402.5,Mayor,"Now, first you load up"
400.14,402.5,Mayor,"on calcium,"
402.57,405.91,Mayor,"then find this demon,"
402.57,405.91,Mayor,"kill the heck out of him,"
405.98,408.07,Mayor,and bring the books to me.
409.15,411.48,Faith,And if Buffy gets to him first?
411.55,415.48,Mayor,"Oh, well, frankly, I don't like"
411.55,415.48,Mayor,to think about that.
415.55,417.99,Mayor,"I like good, positive,"
415.55,417.99,Mayor,up thoughts.
418.06,420.68,Mayor,"If you fail me in that way,"
420.76,423.52,Mayor,"well, you know, replacing Mr. Trick"
420.76,423.52,Mayor,was chore enough.
423.59,427.29,Mayor,"Oh, come on, don't worry."
423.59,427.29,Mayor,Drink up.
427.36,428.96,Mayor,There's nothing uncool about
428.96,430.33,Wesley,healthy teeth and bones.
430.4,434.39,Wesley,And you say
430.4,434.39,Wesley,this demon wanted cash.
434.47,436.1,Wesley,That's very unusual.
436.17,437.47,Giles,Demons after money.
437.54,440.07,Giles,Whatever happened to
437.54,440.07,Giles,the stillbeating heart of a virgin?
440.14,442.13,Giles,No one has any
440.14,442.13,Giles,standards anymore.
442.21,444.7,Buffy,"Well, he said the books"
442.21,444.7,Buffy,were worth the price.
444.78,446.44,Xander,What's this ascension mean?
448.69,450.12,Giles,I'm not sure.
450.19,452.99,Wesley,"No, not really a common term"
450.19,452.99,Wesley,in demonology.
453.06,455.65,Willow,"Ooh, ooh!"
453.06,455.65,Willow,The Merenshtadt text!
455.73,458.66,Willow,I think in the section
455.73,458.66,Willow,"on genocide,"
458.73,460.79,Willow,they mention ascension.
460.86,462.66,Buffy,"Well, we have a winner."
462.73,464.72,Xander,"And more importantly,"
462.73,464.72,Xander,losers.
464.8,466.86,Giles,Where did you find
464.8,466.86,Giles,that volume?
466.94,469.17,Willow,In the top of
466.94,469.17,Willow,your book cabinet
469.24,472.04,Willow,with the stuff
469.24,472.04,Willow,you try to keep hidden.
472.11,475.55,Xander,Hidden? Are there any engravings
472.11,475.55,Xander,I should know about?
475.61,477.48,Willow,Frolicking nymphs
475.61,477.48,Willow,of some kind?
477.55,481.68,Willow,No. Just magic secrets
477.55,481.68,Willow,Giles doesn't think I'm ready for.
481.75,483.26,Willow,"Giles: Um... Ah, yes."
483.26,484.48,Giles,"Yes, here we are."
484.55,486.75,Giles,There's a reference here
486.82,489.26,Giles,to the journal
486.82,489.26,Giles,"of Desmond Kane,"
489.33,491.26,Giles,pastor of a town
489.33,491.26,Giles,called Sharpsville.
491.33,493.19,Wesley,"May 26, 1723."
493.26,494.7,Giles,Tomorrow is
493.26,494.7,Giles,the ascension.
494.77,496.53,Giles,God help us all."
497.93,499.7,Giles,It was the last
497.93,499.7,Giles,anyone heard.
499.77,501.7,Wesley,Of Kane?
501.77,503.21,Giles,Of Sharpsville.
503.27,506.07,Giles,The town more
503.27,506.07,Giles,or less disappeared.
506.14,508.34,Buffy,So ascension possibly
506.14,508.34,Buffy,not a lovein.
508.41,510.94,Giles,I think you should meet
508.41,510.94,Giles,"with this demon, Buffy."
511.01,513.21,Buffy,"Yeah? Anybody got $5,000?"
515.79,518.25,Cordelia,I have something
515.79,518.25,Cordelia,important to ask you.
518.32,519.41,Cordelia,Xander: Important?
519.49,521.51,Xander,Let's start calculating
519.49,521.51,Xander,"those odds, people."
521.59,523.42,Cordelia,What are you doing
521.59,523.42,Cordelia,Friday night?
523.49,526.46,Cordelia,Uh... uh...
526.53,529.66,Wesley,"As always, my sacred duty"
526.53,529.66,Wesley,as a watcher
529.73,532.26,Wesley,prevents me from... Why?
532.34,535.67,Cordelia,I have a paper
532.34,535.67,Cordelia,"to write for English,"
535.74,540.2,Cordelia,"and you're English,"
535.74,540.2,Cordelia,so I thought... What?
540.28,542.27,Cordelia,Is it so wrong to be getting
542.35,543.84,Xander,an insider's perspective?
545.55,549.18,Cordelia,I study best
545.55,549.18,Cordelia,in a good restaurant...
549.25,552.05,Cordelia,around eightish?
549.25,552.05,Cordelia,Think it over?
557.86,561.19,Xander,And on the day the words
557.86,561.19,Xander,"flimsy excuse"" were redefined,"
561.26,563.43,Xander,we stood in awe
561.26,563.43,Xander,and watched.
563.5,567.96,Wesley,"Wesley: Right. Books of Ascension,"
563.5,567.96,Wesley,"mayor, slaughter..."
568.04,569.2,Wesley,Tell you what.
569.27,570.65,Wesley,Why don't we try
570.65,572.21,Buffy,to find this demon
572.28,573.05,Wesley,sooner rather
573.05,573.71,Buffy,"than later,"
573.78,574.86,Buffy,perhaps persuade him
574.86,576.8,Wesley,to lend us the books free of charge?
576.88,579.82,Buffy,I think Faith might be useful
576.88,579.82,Buffy,in that persuasion part.
579.88,581.32,Wesley,I imagine so.
581.39,583.32,Wesley,"Where is Faith, anyway?"
593.3,594.23,Demon,"Hey, slayer."
594.3,595.73,Demon,I wasn't expecting company.
595.8,597.23,Demon,"Give me a minute,"
597.3,600.6,Demon,and I'll have the place
597.3,600.6,Demon,tidied up for you.
600.67,601.83,Faith,You got the books?
601.91,603.34,Demon,"Well, that depends."
603.41,604.93,Demon,You got my money?
610.31,611.75,Demon,You're tough
610.31,611.75,Demon,"in negotiations,"
611.82,613.41,Demon,and I respect that.
616.29,617.72,Demon,Check 'em out.
617.79,619.76,Demon,"Now, that is quality"
617.79,619.76,Demon,merchandise.
619.82,622.05,Demon,"That's worth 5 grand, easy."
622.13,623.39,Faith,Books of Ascension.
623.46,625.89,Demon,Mmhmm.
623.46,625.89,Demon,Original editions and everything.
625.96,627.26,Demon,Great condition.
627.33,629.76,Demon,"OK, it's a little worn"
627.33,629.76,Demon,"on one spine,"
629.83,632.56,Demon,"some slight foxing,"
629.83,632.56,Demon,but otherwise perfect.
632.64,637.47,Faith,"Now, the 5 grand,"
632.64,637.47,Faith,"it's, you know, negotiable."
637.54,639.87,Faith,I don't like to haggle.
679.25,680.44,Angel,Faith.
682.45,683.51,Faith,Angel...
685.19,687.95,Faith,I got nowhere else to go.
688.02,692.76,Faith,"Look, I hate asking for help,"
688.02,692.76,Faith,"but I'm asking,"
692.83,697.03,Faith,"cause I'm in trouble,"
692.83,697.03,Faith,like the real bad kind.
697.1,699.93,Angel,It's OK.
702.02,703.27,Faith,"No, it's a couple county lines"
702.02,703.27,Faith,"over from OK, believe me."
703.34,705.11,Faith,I believe you.
705.11,707.14,Angel,"Look, just talk."
707.21,708.14,Angel,Come on.
708.21,710.2,Angel,Start from the beginning.
710.28,711.71,Faith,Mind if I skip past
711.78,713.72,Faith,the "Mom never
711.78,713.72,Faith,loved me" part
713.78,715.34,Faith,and get right to it?
716.95,719.25,Faith,I'm scaring myself.
719.32,720.91,Angel,I know the feeling.
720.99,722.72,Faith,That's why I came to you.
722.79,723.72,Faith,I don't wanna get
722.79,723.72,Faith,"all 12steppy,"
723.79,725.69,Faith,but remember
723.79,725.69,Faith,when you told me
725.76,728.89,Faith,that killing people'd make me
725.76,728.89,Faith,feel like some kind of god?
730.53,732.83,Angel,I think I just
730.53,732.83,Angel,came down to earth.
732.9,736.24,Angel,"It's not human,"
732.9,736.24,Angel,"if that's what you're thinking,"
736.31,738.74,Angel,not that that makes me
736.31,738.74,Angel,feel any better
738.81,741.17,Angel,or this guy
738.81,741.17,Angel,any less dead.
741.24,747.02,Angel,"Faith, you need help."
741.24,747.02,Angel,You can't do this alone.
746.08,749.25,Faith,"I know. For real now,"
746.08,749.25,Faith,I'm scared...
749.32,750.55,Faith,"scared of what I am,"
750.55,752.02,Angel,what I'm turning into...
752.09,753.94,Faith,"coldblooded, straightup"
753.94,755.46,Angel,killer... like you.
755.53,757.69,Angel,Not like me.
755.53,757.69,Angel,"I didn't have a choice,"
757.76,759.32,Angel,but you do.
759.4,760.99,Angel,"Look, you can stop this."
761.06,764.03,Faith,"Believe me, I don't wanna end up"
761.06,764.03,Faith,the way everybody said I would...
764.1,765.86,Faith,dead or alone or a loser.
765.94,767.37,Angel,You don't have to.
767.44,768.74,Faith,I don't know.
768.87,771.17,Faith,Maybe it's too late for me.
771.24,772.57,Angel,It's not.
772.64,774.54,Faith,"Angel, I'm so scared."
776.14,778.51,Angel,It's all right. Shh.
776.14,778.51,Angel,It's OK.
790.16,791.89,Angel,Whoa.
791.96,794.83,Angel,"Whoa, Faith. I..."
794.9,796.76,Angel,"Look, I can be here for you,"
796.83,799.6,Angel,"but not like that,"
796.83,799.6,Angel,all right?
799.67,801.5,Angel,I'm with Buffy.
801.57,803.33,Faith,"Buffy, yeah."
804.61,806.3,Faith,I didn't mean it like that.
809.14,813.05,Faith,"Maybe I did,"
809.14,813.05,Faith,but I wouldn't press it.
816.32,818.51,Faith,"You love her, don't you?"
818.59,820.89,Angel,I love her.
820.96,821.95,Faith,Good for you.
822.02,824.86,Faith,"The two of you,"
822.02,824.86,Faith,you're lucky.
826.96,828.93,Angel,We friends?
829,831.02,Angel,We're friends.
831.1,832.5,Faith,"Then I'm lucky, too."
835.34,836.93,Faith,I better go.
838.21,839.97,Angel,Where?
840.04,842.07,Faith,I need to cool down...
842.14,844.08,Faith,spend some time alone.
844.15,845.98,Faith,Don't worry about me.
846.05,849.71,Faith,You've been a big help.
846.05,849.71,Faith,Just knowing somebody cares.
852.95,856.58,Faith,"Hey, I know I shouldn't"
852.95,856.58,Faith,"be asking this, but..."
856.66,859.09,Faith,do you think if things
856.66,859.09,Faith,"were different,"
859.16,862.29,Faith,that things between you
859.16,862.29,Faith,"and me'd be different, too?"
862.36,864.33,Angel,We'll never know.
864.4,865.59,Faith,Right.
865.67,867.03,Faith,How could we?
868.24,869.26,Angel,Take care of yourself.
872.31,874.94,Faith,Faith: Lifetime of practice.
882.02,884.95,Faith,Faith: It's not like
882.02,884.95,Faith,"I wasn't trying, OK?"
885.02,886.92,Mayor,There's no need
885.02,886.92,Mayor,to convince me.
886.99,888.55,Mayor,I'm sure you gave it
886.99,888.55,Mayor,your level best.
888.62,890.85,Mayor,I just don't understand
888.62,890.85,Mayor,what that boy could be thinking.
890.93,892.36,Faith,"Try Buffy Summers,"
892.43,894.83,Faith,"like in a big, fat, onetrack way."
894.9,897.06,Mayor,"Hey, come on!"
894.9,897.06,Mayor,Don't be discouraged.
897.13,899.07,Mayor,"You're a bright,"
897.13,899.07,Mayor,"young, energetic girl"
899.13,901.07,Mayor,"with a whole life ahead of her,"
901.14,902.57,Mayor,and I won't tolerate brooding.
902.64,905.8,Mayor,So you couldn't give him that
902.64,905.8,Mayor,one moment of true happiness.
905.87,907.97,Faith,I was thinking more along the lines
905.87,907.97,Faith,"of a long weekend, but OK."
908.04,909.47,Faith,And he spurned your advances.
909.47,909.91,Mayor,So be it.
909.98,912.07,Mayor,There's more than
909.98,912.07,Mayor,"one way to skin a cat,"
912.15,915.38,Mayor,and I happen to know
912.15,915.38,Mayor,that's factually true.
915.45,917.58,Mayor,We wanna take
915.45,917.58,Mayor,Angel's soul away.
917.65,920.59,Mayor,If we can't do it
917.65,920.59,Mayor,"by giving him happiness,"
920.66,923.59,Mayor,"well, by golly,"
920.66,923.59,Mayor,we'll just have to do it
923.66,926.02,Mayor,in the most painful way
923.66,926.02,Mayor,imaginable.
936.34,937.27,Wesley,Find anything?
937.34,939.77,Wesley,A sixcourse banquet
937.34,939.77,Wesley,of nothing
939.84,941.18,Giles,with a scoop of sod all
941.18,942.47,Wesley,as a palette cleanser.
942.54,944.27,Wesley,I've had no better luck.
946.18,948.61,Wesley,There must be something about
948.61,950.71,Giles,this ascension somewhere.
950.79,953.22,Giles,Perhaps I should
950.79,953.22,Giles,"contact the Council,"
953.29,955.19,Giles,maybe run
953.29,955.19,Giles,a search through...
955.26,956.55,Wesley,"No, I don't..."
956.63,958.39,Wesley,It should be I that...
959.96,963.8,Wesley,The Council isn't entirely aware
959.96,963.8,Wesley,that I'm letting you work for me.
965.9,968.2,Wesley,Uh... with me.
968.27,971.54,Wesley,I don't think they'd be very happy at
968.27,971.54,Wesley,the idea of the two of us collaborating.
971.61,975.37,Giles,"Well, I wasn't about to burst into"
971.61,975.37,Giles,glorious song about it myself.
975.44,977.38,Giles,Why don't you call them?
977.45,979.71,Wesley,I think the most
977.45,979.71,Wesley,expedient plan
979.78,982.22,Wesley,would be to find these
979.78,982.22,Wesley,Books of Ascension themselves.
982.28,987.69,Wesley,"Buffy, you and Faith"
982.28,987.69,Wesley,"must find this demon, and soon."
987.76,991.59,Buffy,"I'll go back to the scene,"
987.76,991.59,Buffy,see if I can track him.
991.66,992.92,Wesley,Wait for Faith.
992.99,994.66,Buffy,That could be hours.
994.73,997.49,Buffy,The girl makes Godot
994.73,997.49,Buffy,look punctual.
998.6,999.9,Buffy,I'll just go myself.
999.97,1003.9,Wesley,"Buffy, this is a job"
999.97,1003.9,Wesley,for the both of you.
1003.97,1006.17,Wesley,This demon could be anywhere.
1006.24,1010.74,Wesley,"If these books are as important as he says,"
1006.24,1010.74,Wesley,he has good reason to hide.
1010.81,1016.02,Wesley,Finding him's going to be
1010.81,1016.02,Wesley,extremely difficult.
1014.08,1015.21,Xander,Found your demon.
1015.28,1016.72,Buffy,"Fashion tip, Wes."
1016.79,1018.69,Buffy,Mouth looks better closed.
1018.75,1020.62,Xander,Got the address.
1020.69,1023.85,Xander,I beat it out of
1020.69,1023.85,Xander,Willie the Snitch personally.
1023.93,1025.69,Buffy,You beat up Willie?
1025.76,1026.73,Xander,Sure.
1026.8,1028.73,Xander,"Well, actually let's just say"
1028.8,1031.73,Xander,"I applied some pressure,"
1028.8,1031.73,Xander,"or more accurately,"
1031.8,1034.7,Xander,"that I asked politely,"
1031.8,1034.7,Xander,and then...
1034.77,1036.79,Xander,"OK, I bribed him."
1036.87,1038.2,Buffy,How much?
1038.27,1040.94,Xander,bucks. Does the Council
1038.27,1040.94,Xander,reimburse for that kind of stuff?
1043.02,1042.44,Giles,Did you get a receipt?
1042.51,1043.44,Xander,Damn!
1043.51,1044.64,Buffy,I know this.
1044.71,1047.15,Buffy,It's down by the bus station.
1047.22,1049.15,Buffy,Not the nicest part of town.
1049.22,1050.15,Giles,"Again, see?"
1049.22,1050.15,Giles,No standards.
1050.22,1051.65,Giles,Any selfrespecting demon
1051.72,1055.32,Giles,should be living
1051.72,1055.32,Giles,in a pit of filth or a nice crypt.
1055.39,1057.02,Buffy,I'll remember
1055.39,1057.02,Buffy,to mention that.
1058.29,1059.23,Faith,Mention what?
1059.29,1060.73,Faith,"Where we going, girlfriend?"
1060.8,1064.16,Buffy,"Actually, I can handle"
1060.8,1064.16,Buffy,this one solo.
1064.23,1066.43,Faith,Why should you get
1064.23,1066.43,Faith,to have all the fun?
1066.5,1068.77,Faith,"Share, share,"
1066.5,1068.77,Faith,"that's fair, right?"
1070.41,1073.77,Buffy,Right. Found our demon.
1075.28,1079.11,Faith,"Oh. Well, let's go"
1075.28,1079.11,Faith,look him up.
1084.65,1088.11,Xander,"Is it me, or did it just"
1084.65,1088.11,Xander,get really cold in here?
1093.73,1095.09,Buffy,"Faith, careful."
1095.16,1096.69,Faith,Right.
1102.2,1103.73,Buffy,Missed you last night.
1103.81,1105.17,Faith,"Yeah, I was patrolling."
1105.24,1109.14,Faith,No shortage of scum
1105.24,1109.14,Faith,"you gotta watch in Sunnydale, right?"
1109.21,1110.84,Buffy,So I've heard.
1119.39,1121.82,Buffy,Looks like somebody
1119.39,1121.82,Buffy,got here first.
1121.89,1125.29,Faith,"Bettin' they got the books, too."
1121.89,1125.29,Faith,Some hit.
1127.23,1129.16,Buffy,This wasn't just a hit.
1129.23,1131.66,Buffy,This is somebody's idea
1129.23,1131.66,Buffy,of a party.
1131.73,1134.46,Faith,Maybe the guy put up a fight.
1136.34,1137.67,Faith,We gotta get going.
1137.74,1140.47,Faith,Come on. Nothing
1137.74,1140.47,Faith,we can do here now.
1140.54,1141.67,Faith,You coming?
1150.59,1151.75,Mayor,Mint?
1153.46,1154.51,Mayor,Didn't think so.
1156.12,1159.06,Mayor,"Well, scheduling a man"
1156.12,1159.06,Mayor,of your talents
1159.13,1161.93,Mayor,"is quite the chore,"
1159.13,1161.93,Mayor,I'll tell you.
1162,1164.43,Mayor,Between the chanting
1162,1164.43,Mayor,"and the sacrifice,"
1164.5,1166.69,Mayor,my golf game is shot.
1166.77,1169.36,Mayor,But here... you are.
1169.44,1172.41,Mayor,You know why
1169.44,1172.41,Mayor,I've summoned you.
1172.47,1173.5,Mayor,Can you do it?
1175.08,1176.2,Mayor,Need anything from me?
1178.45,1179.91,Mage,You're not much of
1178.45,1179.91,Mage,"a people person, are you?"
1179.98,1183.21,Mage,You have risked great danger
1179.98,1183.21,Mage,in calling on me.
1183.28,1185.22,Mage,The deadliest magics
1183.28,1185.22,Mage,are needed
1185.29,1187.64,Mage,to rob this creature
1185.29,1187.64,Mage,of its soul.
1187.78,1188.57,Mayor,"Big job, all right."
1188.64,1191.24,Mage,And so it shall be done.
1191.31,1192.57,Mayor,"Oh, that's just swell."
1192.65,1193.98,Mayor,"Listen, are you sure"
1192.65,1193.98,Mayor,you don't want any?
1194.05,1195.16,Mayor,Cause they're
1195.16,1196.88,Willow,lowcalorie. Heh heh.
1196.95,1198.21,Willow,OK.
1205.46,1206.86,Willow,Are you OK?
1208.46,1210.9,Willow,You seem a little on edge.
1210.97,1213.09,Willow,Is there anything
1210.97,1213.09,Willow,that's wrong?
1213.17,1214.63,Buffy,It's nothing.
1216.07,1217.94,Buffy,It's nothing.
1220.02,1219.6,Buffy,"All right, all right."
1219.67,1222.11,Buffy,Stop with the third degree.
1222.18,1223.97,Willow,It's Faith.
1224.05,1226.17,Willow,What about her?
1226.25,1228.68,Buffy,"I went to Angel's last night,"
1228.75,1230.18,Buffy,and Faith was there.
1230.25,1232.05,Buffy,They looked sort of...
1232.12,1233.99,Buffy,intimate.
1234.06,1236.55,Willow,No way. I know what
1234.06,1236.55,Willow,"you're thinking,"
1236.62,1237.96,Willow,and no way!
1238.03,1241.29,Buffy,You're right.
1238.03,1241.29,Buffy,Faith would never do that.
1241.36,1243.3,Willow,Faith would totally do that.
1243.36,1245.13,Willow,Faith was built to do that.
1245.2,1246.83,Willow,She's the "Do that" girl.
1246.9,1248.06,Buffy,"Comfort, remember?"
1246.9,1248.06,Buffy,Comfort here.
1248.14,1249.47,Willow,"I mean, please."
1249.54,1252.7,Willow,Does Angel come up
1249.54,1252.7,Willow,to Faith's standards for a guy?
1252.77,1254.71,Willow,Let's see.
1252.77,1254.71,Willow,Is he breathing?
1254.78,1257.37,Buffy,"Actually, no."
1257.45,1258.88,Willow,"But, Buffy, Angel..."
1258.95,1261.88,Willow,There's no way he
1258.95,1261.88,Willow,would ever do that.
1261.95,1265.68,Buffy,You're the only thing
1261.95,1265.68,Buffy,in the world to him.
1265.75,1267.19,Buffy,Sometimes I wonder.
1267.26,1270.99,Buffy,Angel and Faith
1267.26,1270.99,Buffy,have a lot in common...
1273.16,1275.65,Buffy,and there's so much
1273.16,1275.65,Buffy,he doesn't tell me.
1275.73,1277.16,Willow,"But it's so clear,"
1277.23,1279.67,Willow,the way he feels about you.
1279.73,1283.67,Willow,"Buffy, I, too, know the love"
1279.73,1283.67,Willow,"of a taciturn man,"
1283.74,1287.17,Willow,and you have to look
1283.74,1287.17,Willow,at their actions.
1287.24,1289.23,Buffy,I was.
1289.31,1291.64,Willow,"Well, what did he say?"
1291.71,1297.98,Buffy,Say? You mean when I straightforwardly
1291.71,1297.98,Buffy,asked him what was going on?
1298.05,1299.18,Willow,So you bailed?
1299.25,1301.55,Buffy,I couldn't.
1299.25,1301.55,Buffy,"I mean, not then..."
1301.62,1302.55,Willow,"Hey, enough."
1302.62,1306.06,Willow,Stop with the crazy.
1302.62,1306.06,Willow,Go talk to Angel.
1306.13,1307.56,Buffy,But I just...
1307.63,1309.53,Willow,No. Go.
1307.63,1309.53,Willow,I give you leave to go.
1312.57,1314.16,Buffy,Thank you.
1325.15,1326.61,Angel,Faith.
1326.68,1327.61,Faith,Hey.
1327.68,1331.05,Faith,Sorry to bust in uninvited.
1331.12,1332.92,Angel,What do you want?
1332.99,1335.08,Faith,"Look, I'm not so good"
1332.99,1335.08,Faith,"at apologies,"
1335.16,1337.25,Faith,mostly 'cause I think
1335.16,1337.25,Faith,"the world's out to screw me,"
1337.33,1339.26,Faith,so I'm generally
1337.33,1339.26,Faith,more owed than owing.
1339.33,1341.3,Faith,But I've been thinking
1339.33,1341.3,Faith,"about last night,"
1341.36,1343.11,Faith,and I want you to know
1343.11,1344.46,Angel,I'm really sorry.
1344.53,1345.97,Angel,"It's all right, Faith."
1346.03,1347.97,Angel,"No, it's not all right."
1348.04,1350.97,Faith,"Yeah, I was freaked."
1348.04,1350.97,Faith,"I needed somebody,"
1351.04,1353.8,Faith,but you're with Buffy.
1351.04,1353.8,Faith,I should know better.
1353.88,1355.6,Angel,OK.
1359.58,1360.57,Faith,You don't trust me.
1360.65,1362.78,Angel,It's not that.
1362.85,1365.84,Faith,"Hey, no problem."
1362.85,1365.84,Faith,Join the club.
1368.62,1370.06,Angel,"Look, Faith..."
1370.12,1372.56,Angel,"Look, I know what"
1370.12,1372.56,Angel,"you're going through, all right?"
1372.63,1375.1,Angel,I know how hard it can be.
1375.16,1379.1,Angel,It's important that you have
1375.16,1379.1,Angel,"somebody who's been there, OK,"
1379.17,1381.6,Angel,who understands what
1379.17,1381.6,Angel,you're going through...
1384.51,1386.1,Angel,and I wanna trust you.
1386.17,1388.17,Faith,Chump.
1394.35,1400.08,Angel,"Yaa shay Tann, inna nafsak"
1394.35,1400.08,Angel,laa tatba'uk ba'd.
1400.15,1402.32,Angel,"Yaa rufukayl al'aZim,"
1400.15,1402.32,Angel,shattit nafsah fii anHaa'i...
1402.39,1403.62,Angel,Faith!
1403.69,1405.52,Angel,I wanted to do this
1403.69,1405.52,Angel,"the oldfashioned way,"
1405.59,1406.96,Angel,"but hey, your loss."
1407.03,1408.79,Angel,I got some tricks
1407.03,1408.79,Angel,Buffy don't know yet.
1408.86,1409.96,Angel,You don't have to do this.
1410.03,1411.97,Faith,"I know, but it's fun."
1412.03,1414.02,Faith,Now relax.
1412.03,1414.02,Faith,It'll all be over soon.
1414.1,1415.59,Faith,No!
1415.67,1419.7,Faith,Yaa ruuh idhhabii!
1415.67,1419.7,Faith,Yaa nafs idhhabii!
1419.77,1427.55,Faith,Utrukii ayyaah wa'trukiih
1419.77,1427.55,Faith,naHruuman wanajisan!
1427.62,1429.64,Faith,
1459.88,1461.82,Angel,Thanks... so much.
1464.12,1467.25,Angel,It's good to have the taste
1464.12,1467.25,Angel,of a slayer back in my mouth.
1467.32,1468.98,Angel,"It's like cigarettes,"
1467.32,1468.98,Angel,you know?
1469.06,1471.05,Angel,Just when I thought I'd quit.
1472.63,1474.72,Angel,"No, really."
1472.63,1474.72,Angel,Don't get up.
1476.8,1480.36,Angel,Ohh... it's good to be
1476.8,1480.36,Angel,back in Sunnydale.
1480.43,1481.73,Angel,Nice climate...
1481.8,1483.24,Angel,plenty to eat...
1483.3,1486.5,Angel,no tortured humanity
1483.3,1486.5,Angel,to hold me down.
1486.57,1488.57,Faith,But you know
1486.57,1488.57,Faith,what bothers me?
1490.34,1493.18,Angel,You don't seem to be getting
1490.34,1493.18,Angel,"the big picture here, Faith."
1493.25,1494.73,Angel,"Now, I don't know why"
1494.73,1495.72,Faith,"you turned me,"
1495.78,1497.75,Faith,but let me tell ya...
1497.82,1500.08,Angel,I'm just glad you did.
1501.76,1503.55,Faith,I got my reasons.
1503.62,1507.39,Angel,Let me guess. You summoned back
1503.62,1507.39,Angel,the true Angelus because...
1507.46,1509.19,Angel,you need a new boy toy.
1509.26,1511.93,Angel,Sorry. Doesn't work that way.
1515.34,1517.53,Faith,"You wanna be smart,"
1515.34,1517.53,Faith,you listen to me.
1517.61,1519.54,Angel,"Funny thing about vampires,"
1517.61,1519.54,Angel,Faith...
1519.61,1522.58,Angel,we don't establish
1519.61,1522.58,Angel,meaningful dialogue with slayers.
1522.64,1527.02,Faith,Not how Buffy tells it.
1527.35,1531.11,Angel,Heh heh heh. I should've known
1527.35,1531.11,Angel,you'd like it on top.
1531.19,1533.12,Faith,"You wanna listen,"
1531.19,1533.12,Faith,or you wanna die?
1533.19,1536.42,Angel,"Heh heh. As long as you're there,"
1533.19,1536.42,Angel,I mostly want you to wriggle.
1536.49,1537.58,Angel,But I'm listening.
1537.66,1538.85,Angel,"Last time you got like this,"
1538.93,1540.69,Angel,Buffy kicked your ass
1538.93,1540.69,Angel,all the way back to hell.
1540.76,1542.23,Angel,Do you wanna
1540.76,1542.23,Angel,do better this time?
1542.3,1544.32,Angel,Still listening.
1544.4,1545.52,Faith,Good boy.
1545.6,1551.02,Faith,"Now, all you gotta do"
1545.6,1551.02,Faith,"is play nice and call truce,"
1549.07,1551.1,Faith,and I'll hook you up with
1549.07,1551.1,Faith,the real power in this town.
1551.17,1552.1,Faith,Interested?
1552.17,1553.66,Angel,Very.
1553.74,1556.4,Faith,Then get ready
1553.74,1556.4,Faith,to meet the new boss.
1560.55,1562.19,Faith,Wesley: Our enemy has us
1562.19,1563.42,Wesley,at a disadvantage.
1563.48,1567.11,Wesley,We seem consistently
1563.48,1567.11,Wesley,to be one step behind him.
1567.19,1569.09,Wesley,Now he has
1567.19,1569.09,Wesley,the Books of Ascension.
1569.16,1571.35,Wesley,We must take definitive action.
1571.43,1573.22,Cordelia,You have the greatest voice.
1573.29,1576.53,Cordelia,Have you ever thought about
1573.29,1576.53,Cordelia,doing books on tape?
1576.6,1578.43,Xander,"Way to focus, C.C."
1578.5,1581.47,Wesley,"Yes, let's try to stay on track."
1581.54,1583.83,Wesley,We need everyone working
1581.54,1583.83,Wesley,together here. Where's Angel?
1583.9,1585.39,Buffy,I don't know.
1585.47,1589.41,Buffy,"I went to the mansion,"
1585.47,1589.41,Buffy,but he wasn't there.
1589.48,1591.1,Wesley,And Faith?
1591.18,1592.37,Buffy,"She's missing, too."
1592.45,1595.21,Willow,Which means nothing.
1592.45,1595.21,Willow,Two unconnected events.
1597.05,1598.61,Buffy,What should we do?
1598.69,1602.14,Giles,"Buffy, I think you should try"
1598.69,1602.14,Giles,to retrieve the Books of Ascension.
1602.22,1603.71,Giles,Check out the mayor's office.
1603.79,1606.73,Giles,But be damn careful.
1603.79,1606.73,Giles,Do not confront the mayor.
1606.79,1607.89,Giles,We don't know
1606.79,1607.89,Giles,a thing about him.
1607.96,1609.79,Buffy,I'll go home
1607.96,1609.79,Buffy,and stock up on weapons.
1609.86,1612.78,Buffy,Slip into something
1609.86,1612.78,Buffy,a little more breakandenterish.
1612.91,1614.47,Giles,"Right. Willow,"
1614.54,1617.1,Giles,how far did you get
1614.54,1617.1,Giles,with the mayor's files?
1617.18,1618.44,Cordelia,Excuse me.
1618.51,1620.98,Cordelia,I believe Wesley
1618.51,1620.98,Cordelia,is running this meeting.
1621.05,1624.71,Wesley,"It's, uh, it's quite all right."
1621.05,1624.71,Wesley,Willow?
1624.79,1626.72,Willow,It's all bad news.
1626.79,1628.72,Willow,By the time I got through
1626.79,1628.72,Willow,"the encryptions,"
1628.79,1630.35,Willow,the files were empty.
1630.43,1632.39,Willow,I guess he saw me coming.
1632.46,1633.93,Oz,What about
1632.46,1633.93,Oz,the Hall of Records?
1634,1635.29,Oz,Go to the source.
1635.36,1638.53,Wesley,Good idea. There must be
1635.36,1638.53,Wesley,information on the mayor there.
1638.6,1640.63,Giles,"Wesley, why don't you"
1638.6,1640.63,Giles,take the group
1640.7,1641.64,Giles,and start looking?
1641.7,1643.04,Wesley,Right.
1643.11,1645.9,Cordelia,I'm in Wesley's group.
1645.98,1647.67,Giles,There is just the one group.
1647.74,1650.23,Cordelia,"Yes, and I am in it."
1650.31,1652.91,Xander,Anyone mind
1650.31,1652.91,Xander,if I skip the trip?
1652.98,1654.81,Xander,"I'm gonna cruise town,"
1652.98,1654.81,Xander,keep my ear to the ground.
1654.88,1657.08,Xander,And I think 5's a crowd.
1657.15,1658.59,Cordelia,It really is.
1659.76,1661.28,Oz,I'll drive.
1661.36,1663.66,Willow,They liked your plan.
1666.5,1669.46,Giles,"Anyone finds anything,"
1666.5,1669.46,Giles,check in with me.
1671.5,1673.16,Giles,Be careful.
1677.94,1680.27,Faith,So... can I keep him?
1680.34,1683.54,Mayor,Let's just take things
1680.34,1683.54,Mayor,step by step for a moment.
1683.61,1686.74,Angel,"Now, then, Angelus..."
1683.61,1686.74,Angel,May I call you Angel?
1686.82,1689.81,Angel,"Well, actually, I'm thinking"
1686.82,1689.81,Angel,more along the lines
1689.89,1692.32,Angel,of you calling me Master.
1692.39,1693.64,Angel,"Ahh. You know, Angelus,"
1693.64,1695.32,Mayor,"attitude may get you attention,"
1695.39,1696.95,Mayor,but courtesy wins respect.
1697.03,1701.62,Mayor,Heh heh. I am the one responsible
1697.03,1701.62,Mayor,for your "new" attitude.
1701.7,1704.72,Angel,That's why I'm here.
1704.8,1708.36,Mayor,No trouble with the transition?
1704.8,1708.36,Mayor,No side effects?
1708.44,1712.31,Angel,Hmm. Had a soul.
1708.44,1712.31,Angel,Now I'm free.
1712.37,1717.02,Mayor,That's terrific.
1712.37,1717.02,Mayor,"Poetic, too."
1715.08,1717.1,Mayor,Not that I read much poetry.
1717.18,1719.61,Mayor,Except for those little ones
1717.18,1719.61,Mayor,in the Reader's Digest.
1719.68,1721.27,Angel,Some are quite catchy.
1721.35,1722.82,Angel,"Hey, I don't mean"
1721.35,1722.82,Angel,"to rush things here,"
1722.89,1725.48,Angel,but are you trying to get
1722.89,1725.48,Angel,to some kind of a point?
1725.55,1726.63,Angel,Heh. Kids today.
1726.63,1727.78,Mayor,"Rush, rush, rush."
1727.86,1732.79,Mayor,"The point, Angel, is you're a very"
1727.86,1732.79,Mayor,powerful young man. Good for Faith.
1732.86,1736.46,Mayor,And there just may be a future
1732.86,1736.46,Mayor,for you here in Sunnydale.
1736.53,1738.5,Mayor,I see you're admiring
1736.53,1738.5,Mayor,my letter opener.
1738.57,1742.53,Angel,"Actually, I was thinking of stabbing you"
1738.57,1742.53,Angel,through the heart with it.
1743.94,1745.37,Mayor,Please do.
1753.95,1755.88,Mayor,Nice shot.
1767.66,1771.57,Mayor,"You see, I'm what"
1767.66,1771.57,Mayor,you might call...
1771.63,1773.69,Mayor,impervious.
1773.77,1776.76,Mayor,Can't be killed or harmed
1773.77,1776.76,Mayor,in any way.
1776.84,1778.43,Mayor,And that's just
1776.84,1778.43,Mayor,a cornerstone
1778.51,1782.27,Mayor,in my plans for this
1778.51,1782.27,Mayor,great town of ours.
1782.34,1784.71,Angel,"Hmm. Can't be killed,"
1784.78,1786.84,Angel,but you don't like germs.
1786.92,1789.11,Mayor,Ew. Awful things.
1786.92,1789.11,Mayor,Unsanitary.
1789.19,1791.75,Mayor,"But my question is, now that"
1789.19,1791.75,Mayor,"Faith has brought you back,"
1791.82,1793.85,Mayor,what are your intentions?
1793.92,1795.62,Angel,"Well, gee, sir,"
1795.69,1798.59,Angel,I thought I'd find that slayer
1795.69,1798.59,Angel,that's giving you so much trouble
1798.66,1801.79,Angel,"and torture, maim,"
1798.66,1801.79,Angel,and kill her.
1802.87,1804.23,Mayor,Fine.
1804.3,1806.93,Mayor,It's nice to see you're not
1804.3,1806.93,Mayor,one of those slacker types
1809.02,1808.3,Mayor,running around town today.
1808.37,1809.56,Mayor,Heh heh heh heh.
1809.64,1811.37,Mayor,Torture Buffy.
1811.44,1813.2,Mayor,"Killing her's fine,"
1811.44,1813.2,Mayor,just make it a slow one.
1813.28,1814.57,Angel,My favorite kind.
1814.64,1815.8,Mayor,Wonderful. Wonderful.
1815.88,1818.24,Mayor,We don't want a replacement slayer
1815.88,1818.24,Mayor,anytime soon.
1818.31,1822.08,Mayor,They can't all turn out
1818.31,1822.08,Mayor,like my girl Faith. Heh heh.
1822.15,1823.31,Mayor,Have fun.
1823.39,1824.58,Faith,Let's do it.
1827.29,1831.35,Mayor,Uh... try to have her
1827.29,1831.35,Mayor,home by 11:00.
1836.97,1839.2,Mayor,
1839.27,1841.57,Mayor,She's not
1839.27,1841.57,Mayor,a little girl anymore.
1841.64,1843.5,Mayor,
1843.67,1845.47,Xander,"I love when you talk, Wesley."
1845.54,1847.91,Xander,"I love when you sing, Wesley."""
1847.98,1850.47,Xander,Can you say the words
1847.98,1850.47,Xander,"jail bait,"" Wesley?"
1850.55,1852.28,Xander,Limey bastard.
1852.35,1854.11,Xander,"Hey, guys."
1852.35,1854.11,Xander,"Man, where ya been?"
1854.18,1858.12,Xander,You gotta find Buffy.
1854.18,1858.12,Xander,She's going to her place and stock up...
1858.19,1860.95,Angel,That guy just bugs me.
1867.36,1868.52,Joyce,"Faith, Angel."
1868.6,1870.26,Angel,"Hi, Joyce."
1868.6,1870.26,Angel,Nice to see ya.
1870.33,1871.26,Angel,Is Buffy home?
1871.33,1873.2,Joyce,Upstairs.
1873.27,1875.83,Joyce,Please tell me it's not
1873.27,1875.83,Joyce,some vampire thing.
1875.9,1877.84,Angel,The only vampire here
1875.9,1877.84,Angel,"is me, Joyce."
1877.91,1883.02,Angel,Say... you change
1877.91,1883.02,Angel,your hair?
1882.08,1884.34,Joyce,Highlights.
1884.41,1886.51,Angel,It's nice.
1895.29,1897.28,Faith,"Knock, knock."
1900.13,1901.79,Buffy,Where have you guys been?
1901.86,1904.8,Angel,Lookin' for you. Good thing
1901.86,1904.8,Angel,we found you before you left.
1906.57,1908.8,Faith,We got the books.
1908.87,1910.3,Angel,They're at the mansion.
1910.37,1911.93,Faith,We'd take 'em
1910.37,1911.93,Faith,"to Giles ourselves,"
1914.02,1915,Faith,but I think strength in numbers
1914.02,1915,Faith,is the way to go. Come on.
1917.71,1919.94,Angel,Let me get those for you.
1929.39,1930.8,Angel,"OK, let's get the books"
1930.8,1931.72,Buffy,someplace safe.
1931.79,1932.92,Buffy,Where are they?
1933,1938.19,Angel,Actually... we have a slight
1933,1938.19,Angel,"change in plan, Buff."
1938.27,1940.2,Angel,Buff'?
1940.27,1941.26,Buffy,You just called...
1943.37,1944.96,Buffy,What's the matter with you?
1945.04,1947.8,Angel,"Nothing. Matter of fact,"
1947.88,1951.33,Angel,I haven't felt this good
1947.88,1951.33,Angel,in a long time.
1951.41,1953.18,Buffy,Angel?
1953.25,1955.91,Angel,"You know, I never"
1953.25,1955.91,Angel,properly thanked you
1955.98,1957.61,Angel,for sending me to hell.
1957.69,1958.62,Buffy,No...
1958.69,1960.18,Angel,"Yeah, and I'm just wondering."
1960.26,1964.28,Angel,Where do I start?
1960.26,1964.28,Angel,"Card? Fruit basket, huh?"
1964.36,1965.88,Angel,Evisceration?
1965.88,1966.23,Buffy,No.
1966.3,1966.74,Buffy,"Yeah, I know"
1966.74,1967.52,Angel,what you're thinking.
1967.6,1969.59,Angel,Maybe there's still some good
1967.6,1969.59,Angel,deep down inside of me
1969.67,1971.53,Angel,that remembers
1969.67,1971.53,Angel,"and loves you,"
1971.6,1973.57,Angel,if only you could
1971.6,1973.57,Angel,reach me.
1973.64,1976.23,Angel,"Then again,"
1973.64,1976.23,Angel,we have reality.
1977.67,1980.94,Buffy,I will kill you
1977.67,1980.94,Buffy,before I let you touch me.
1983.91,1986.57,Buffy,"Faith, we need to get"
1983.91,1986.57,Buffy,out of here. Now.
1986.65,1988.55,Faith,"Speak for yourself, B."
1988.62,1992.25,Faith,Me? I like it here.
2000.46,2002.73,Angel,One thing I learned
2000.46,2002.73,Angel,about Buffy...
2002.8,2005.27,Angel,she's so cute
2002.8,2005.27,Angel,when she's sleeping.
2005.33,2006.96,Cordelia,Hmm.
2012.88,2016.87,Cordelia,"Hey, I know a way to make investigating"
2012.88,2016.87,Cordelia,the mayor even more boring.
2018.85,2021.21,Cordelia,"On second thought,"
2018.85,2021.21,Cordelia,"no, I don't."
2021.28,2022.75,Oz,Hey... whoa.
2023.95,2026.48,Oz,"Whoa. Big ""Hey, whoa."""
2026.48,2028.89,Willow,"Guys, check this out."
2032.03,2033.77,Willow,"Wow. Like father, like son."
2033.77,2034.9,Willow,"Wow. Like father, like son."
2034.97,2038.41,Oz,How about like exact same guy
2034.97,2038.41,Oz,like exact same guy?
2038.48,2042.28,Wesley,Mayor Wilkins
2038.48,2042.28,Wesley,is over 100 years old.
2042.35,2044.07,Wesley,He's not human.
2044.15,2046.58,Xander,"I, uh, hate to"
2044.15,2046.58,Xander,"spoil the mood,"
2046.65,2049.21,Xander,but this is so much
2046.65,2049.21,Xander,worse than you think.
2049.29,2051.75,Willow,"Xander,"
2049.29,2051.75,Willow,what happened to you?
2051.82,2054.48,Xander,You know how some people
2051.82,2054.48,Xander,hate to say I told you so?
2054.56,2056.58,Xander,Not me. I told you so.
2056.66,2057.84,Wesley,"Angel's back,"
2057.84,2060.03,Xander,in the really bad sense.
2060.1,2062.12,Xander,"And, um, I told you so."
2062.2,2064.89,Wesley,Angelus has turned?
2064.97,2068.56,Wesley,"Xander, this is terribly serious."
2064.97,2068.56,Wesley,Are you sure?
2068.64,2069.94,Xander,"Gee, let me think."
2072.02,2071.67,Xander,Kinda hard to tell.
2071.74,2072.86,Xander,Last thing I remember
2072.86,2073.5,Wesley,is his fist.
2073.58,2075.48,Wesley,We must contact Giles
2073.58,2075.48,Wesley,immediately.
2075.55,2076.6,Xander,Good thinkin'.
2076.68,2078.87,Xander,Let's waste time
2076.68,2078.87,Xander,with a lively debate.
2078.95,2079.92,Xander,"Leave Buffy alone,"
2079.92,2081.11,Cordelia,see how dead she gets.
2081.18,2083.65,Cordelia,"Slow down, Xander."
2081.18,2083.65,Cordelia,This isn't Wesley's fault.
2083.72,2085.19,Xander,"Actually, it is."
2085.26,2087.52,Xander,Faith was your responsibility.
2087.59,2088.9,Xander,Guess who's Angel's
2088.9,2089.79,Willow,new playmate.
2089.86,2092.19,Willow,Faith and Angel? Together?
2092.26,2094.92,Xander,Imagine the possibilities.
2095,2097.16,Xander,
2099.84,2100.83,Xander,
2102.27,2103.93,Buffy,"Mornin', sleepyhead."
2106.02,2106.57,Buffy,You know what
2106.02,2106.57,Buffy,I just can't believe?
2106.64,2110.48,Buffy,"All of our time together,"
2106.64,2110.48,Buffy,we never tried chains.
2110.55,2113.41,Buffy,"Well, can't dwell on the past."
2113.48,2116.61,Buffy,Especially with
2113.48,2116.61,Buffy,the future we have ahead.
2118.96,2121.42,Buffy,Bondage looks good
2118.96,2121.42,Buffy,"on you, B."
2121.49,2123.46,Buffy,"The outfit's all wrong,"
2121.49,2123.46,Buffy,but hey...
2123.53,2125.72,Buffy,You don't know
2123.53,2125.72,Buffy,what you're doing.
2125.8,2128.99,Faith,"Really? Weird, 'cause something"
2125.8,2128.99,Faith,about all this just feels so right.
2129.07,2131.97,Faith,Maybe it's one of those
2129.07,2131.97,Faith,unhappy childhood things.
2132.04,2133.2,Angel,"See, when I was a kid,"
2133.2,2134.83,Buffy,I used to beg my mom for a dog.
2134.9,2136.87,Buffy,Didn't matter what kind.
2136.94,2139.28,Angel,"I just wanted, you know,"
2139.28,2141.04,Buffy,something to love.
2148.25,2150.08,Buffy,A dog's all I wanted.
2150.15,2153.32,Buffy,"Well, that and toys."
2156.06,2157.6,Buffy,"But Mom was so busy,"
2157.6,2158.29,Faith,"you know,"
2158.36,2160.49,Faith,enjoying the drinking and
2158.36,2160.49,Faith,passing out parts of life
2160.56,2161.65,Faith,that I never really
2161.65,2162.69,Buffy,got what I wanted.
2162.77,2164.36,Buffy,Until now.
2164.43,2165.48,Buffy,"Faith, listen to me"
2165.48,2166.2,,very closely.
2166.27,2168.43,,Angel's a killer.
2168.51,2171.03,,"When he's done with me,"
2168.51,2171.03,,he'll turn on you.
2171.11,2172.34,,She's right.
2172.41,2174.74,,I probably will.
2174.81,2176.37,,Yeah?
2176.45,2177.71,,Huh.
2177.78,2179.84,,Guess we'll just have to
2177.78,2179.84,,"keep you around a while, then."
2181.75,2184.55,,"Before we get started,"
2181.75,2184.55,,I just want you to know:
2184.62,2187.68,,"If you're a screamer,"
2184.62,2187.68,,feel free.
2187.76,2189.42,,"Why, Faith?"
2189.49,2190.96,,What's in it for you?
2191.03,2192.52,,What isn't?
2192.6,2194.96,,"You know, I come to"
2192.6,2194.96,,"Sunnydale, I'm a slayer,"
2195.03,2197,,I do my job kicking ass
2195.03,2197,,better than anyone.
2197.07,2199.36,,What do I hear about
2197.07,2199.36,,everywhere I go?
2199.44,2200.96,,Buffy.
2201.04,2203.03,,"So I slay, I behave,"
2203.11,2204.4,,I do the good little girl
2203.11,2204.4,,"routine,"
2204.47,2207.88,,and who does everybody
2204.47,2207.88,,thank? Buffy.
2207.94,2209.74,,That's not my fault.
2209.81,2211.25,,"Everyone always asks,"
2211.31,2213.41,,Why can't you
2211.31,2213.41,,be more like Buffy?"
2213.48,2215.88,,But did anyone ever ask
2213.48,2215.88,,if you could be more like me?
2215.95,2217.39,Angel,I know I didn't.
2219.29,2221.26,Faith,"You get the watcher,"
2221.32,2223.45,Faith,"you get the mom, you get"
2221.32,2223.45,Faith,the little Scooby gang.
2223.53,2224.89,Buffy,What do I get?
2223.53,2224.89,Buffy,Jack squat.
2224.96,2226.69,Buffy,This was supposed
2224.96,2226.69,Buffy,to be my town.
2226.76,2228.63,Buffy,"Faith, listen to me."
2228.7,2230.63,Faith,Why? So you can impart
2228.7,2230.63,Faith,some special Buffy wisdom?
2230.7,2231.72,Faith,That it?
2231.8,2233.79,Faith,Do you think you're
2231.8,2233.79,Faith,better than me? Do you?
2233.87,2236.07,Faith,Say it. You think
2233.87,2236.07,Faith,you're better than me.
2236.14,2237.5,Buffy,I am.
2240.81,2242.71,Buffy,Always have been.
2242.78,2246.08,Faith,"Um, maybe you"
2242.78,2246.08,Faith,didn't notice.
2246.15,2247.98,Faith,Angel's with me.
2249.49,2251.78,Buffy,And how did you
2249.49,2251.78,Buffy,"get him, Faith?"
2251.85,2253.34,Buffy,Magic?
2253.42,2255.62,Buffy,You cast some sort of spell?
2255.69,2257.92,Buffy,"Because in the real world,"
2257.99,2261.09,Buffy,"Angel would never touch you,"
2257.99,2261.09,Buffy,and we both know it.
2266.4,2268.96,Buffy,You had to tie me up
2266.4,2268.96,Buffy,to beat me.
2269.04,2271.73,Buffy,There's a word for people
2269.04,2271.73,Buffy,"like you, Faith."
2271.81,2272.83,Buffy,Loser.
2274.94,2279.28,Faith,Uhhuh. You're just trying
2274.94,2279.28,Faith,to make me mad so I'll kill you.
2279.35,2281.51,Buffy,But I'm too smart for that.
2281.58,2282.98,Faith,Stick around.
2284.39,2287.65,Buffy,For what? Your boss's
2284.39,2287.65,Buffy,lame ascension?
2287.72,2290.82,Buffy,Like I couldn't stop it.
2290.89,2292.62,Faith,You can't.
2292.7,2293.82,Buffy,I will.
2293.9,2296.49,Faith,Keep dreaming. No one
2293.9,2296.49,Faith,can stop the ascension.
2296.57,2297.66,Faith,"Mayor's got it wired, B."
2297.73,2299.9,Faith,He built this town
2297.73,2299.9,Faith,"for demons to feed on,"
2299.97,2302.16,Faith,"and come graduation day,"
2299.97,2302.16,Faith,he's gettin' paid.
2302.24,2304.47,Faith,I'll be sittin'
2302.24,2304.47,Faith,at his right hand.
2304.54,2307.34,Faith,Assuming he has hands
2304.54,2307.34,Faith,after the transformation.
2307.41,2308.97,Faith,I'm not too clear
2307.41,2308.97,Faith,on that part.
2309.05,2311.38,Faith,And all your little
2309.05,2311.38,Faith,lameass friends
2311.45,2312.81,Faith,are gonna be
2311.45,2312.81,Faith,kibbles and bits.
2312.88,2316.98,Faith,Think about that when
2312.88,2316.98,Faith,your boyfriend's cutting into you.
2317.05,2319.99,Buffy,I never knew you had
2317.05,2319.99,Buffy,so much rage in you.
2320.06,2321.89,Faith,What can I say?
2321.96,2324.69,Faith,I'm the world's best actor.
2324.76,2326.66,Angel,Second best.
2334.64,2337.11,Buffy,Graduation day.
2337.17,2341.02,Buffy,You think
2337.17,2341.02,Buffy,we missed anything?
2339.08,2341.37,Angel,I think we know
2339.08,2341.37,Angel,everything she knows.
2342.45,2344.61,Buffy,May I say something?
2346.02,2347.38,Buffy,
2347.45,2348.92,Buffy,Psych.
2348.99,2351.72,Faith,You played me.
2348.99,2351.72,Faith,You played me!
2367.94,2371.07,Faith,"What are you gonna do, B?"
2367.94,2371.07,Faith,Kill me?
2371.14,2373.54,Faith,You become me.
2373.61,2375.41,Faith,You're not ready for that.
2376.48,2377.41,Faith,Yet.
2382.69,2384.81,Willow,Are you OK?
2393.86,2395.89,Mage,The task is finished.
2395.97,2397.93,Giles,Yes. Thank you
2395.97,2397.93,Giles,for coming to me
2400.02,2400.9,Giles,and for that rather effective
2400.02,2400.9,Giles,light show you put on.
2400.97,2403.96,Mage,This restores the balance
2400.97,2403.96,Mage,"between us, Rupert Giles."
2404.04,2407.48,Mage,My debt to you
2404.04,2407.48,Mage,is now repaid in full.
2407.54,2409.67,Mage,Do not call upon me again.
2409.75,2410.94,Giles,I shan't.
2411.01,2412.5,Giles,Peace with you.
2412.58,2414.98,Mage,And with you.
2424.33,2426.99,Willow,His debt to you is repaid?
2424.33,2426.99,Willow,What did you do?
2427.06,2429.16,Giles,I introduced him
2427.06,2429.16,Giles,to his wife.
2430.23,2432.63,Wesley,"Well, I, for one, protest."
2432.7,2435.14,Wesley,You've pitted slayer
2432.7,2435.14,Wesley,against slayer
2435.2,2437.8,Wesley,in a dangerous charade that
2435.2,2437.8,Wesley,could've gotten them both killed.
2437.87,2439.71,Wesley,Without informing me!
2441.69,2443.28,Wesley,I'm telling the Council.
2443.36,2445.22,Giles,I think you should.
2445.29,2447.69,Giles,We have a rogue slayer
2445.29,2447.69,Giles,on our hands.
2447.76,2449.32,Giles,I can't think of anything
2447.76,2449.32,Giles,more dangerous.
2449.39,2451.16,Buffy,At least now we know.
2451.23,2455.36,Giles,And we know a little bit more
2451.23,2455.36,Giles,about the ascension.
2455.43,2457.26,Willow,Graduation day.
2457.34,2460.86,Willow,"There's a big, scary unfun."
2460.94,2463.74,Willow,At least Angel's
2460.94,2463.74,Willow,"not bad, though."
2463.81,2465.14,Willow,"That's good, right?"
2465.21,2467.84,Xander,Yes. I feel so much better
2467.91,2469.94,Xander,knowing that he broke my face
2467.91,2469.94,Xander,in the "good" way.
2470.02,2471.92,Xander,It's a "good" bruise.
2471.98,2476.02,Buffy,"He was only acting, Xander."
2475.95,2478.01,Buffy,It was just an act.
2478.09,2480.61,Mayor,"Mayor: Well, you win some,"
2478.09,2480.61,Mayor,you lose some.
2480.69,2483.66,Mayor,"From where I'm sitting,"
2480.69,2483.66,Mayor,it's batting average that counts.
2483.73,2486.13,Mayor,So you lost some friends.
2486.2,2489.13,Faith,I wouldn't exactly
2486.2,2489.13,Faith,call them friends.
2489.2,2490.79,Mayor,What are you worried
2489.2,2490.79,Mayor,about? Chin up.
2490.87,2493.06,Mayor,You don't see me looking
2490.87,2493.06,Mayor,"disappointed, do ya?"
2493.14,2494.2,Mayor,Heck no. You know why?
2494.27,2496.4,Mayor,Because I know you'll
2494.27,2496.4,Mayor,"always have me, Faith."
2496.47,2498.87,Mayor,"I'm the best, the most important"
2496.47,2498.87,Mayor,friend you'll ever have.
2498.94,2501.71,Mayor,"Besides, once"
2498.94,2501.71,Mayor,"the ascension starts,"
2501.78,2504.51,Mayor,the "in crowd" you're
2501.78,2504.51,Mayor,so concerned about? Whoo!
2504.58,2506.81,Mayor,They'll be lucky if there's enough
2504.58,2506.81,Mayor,of them left to fill a pothole.
2506.89,2507.87,Mayor,Promise.
2510.92,2513.48,Mayor,Still unhappy?
2513.56,2514.72,Mayor,Hmm.
2516.29,2517.56,Mayor,Okeydoke.
2517.63,2520.29,Mayor,I've got two words
2520.37,2523.66,Mayor,that are gonna make
2520.37,2523.66,Mayor,all the pain go away...
2524.97,2527.96,Mayor,Miniature... golf.
2548.66,2550.03,Angel,How you doin'?
2550.1,2551.65,Buffy,Been better.
2552.73,2554.43,Angel,Not hard to believe.
2554.5,2557.33,Angel,You were a real soldier
2554.5,2557.33,Angel,"last night, Buffy."
2557.4,2558.53,Buffy,That's me.
2558.6,2560.9,Buffy,One of the troops.
2560.97,2563.53,Angel,I know how hard
2560.97,2563.53,Angel,it was for you.
2563.61,2565.67,Buffy,I really doubt that.
2565.74,2569.18,Angel,If there's anything I can do
2565.74,2569.18,Angel,to make it better...
2570.88,2575.15,Buffy,"Look, I know you only"
2570.88,2575.15,Buffy,"did what I asked,"
2575.22,2577.52,Buffy,and we got what we wanted.
2577.59,2581.86,Angel,I never wanted it
2577.59,2581.86,Angel,to go that far.
2581.93,2583.45,Buffy,I know that.
2583.53,2587.56,Buffy,It's not even
2583.53,2587.56,Buffy,a question of that.
2587.63,2591.3,Buffy,It's just after...
2593.27,2596.14,Buffy,I need a little bit
2593.27,2596.14,Buffy,of a break.
2599.74,2601.74,Buffy,Please?
2610.62,2612.65,Angel,You still my girl?
2616.63,2618.22,,Always.
