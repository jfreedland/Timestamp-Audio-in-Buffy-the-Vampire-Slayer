15.95,21.42,XANDER,lt's a trigger. lt's a brainwashing term.
15.95,21.42,XANDER,lt's how the military makes sleeper agents.

983.02,985.95,WILLOW*/WARREN,There are other stories from kindergarten.
986.03,990.18,WILLOW*/WARREN,Nonyellowcrayon stories in which
986.03,990.18,WILLOW*/WARREN,you don't come out in such a good light.
990.27,994.11,WILLOW/WARREN*,An incident involving Aquaman underoos.
990.27,994.11,WILLOW/WARREN*,You want me to start talkin'?
994.19,995.61,XANDER,"Hey, Willow!"

997.35,1001.79,WILLOW/WARREN*,"l don't know. We were... there,"
997.35,1001.79,WILLOW/WARREN*,and then l looked like him.
1001.87,1003.34,ANYA,"Oh, like a glamour."
1003.34,1006.66,WILLOW/WARREN*,"Maybe, but l probably brought it on myself."
1006.75,1008.32,BUFFY,What makes you think that?
1008.32,1010.14,WILLOW/WARREN*,lt wouldn't be the first time.
1010.23,1013.7,WILLOW/WARREN*,l have a history with my subconscious
1010.23,1013.7,WILLOW/WARREN*,making things go kerfloofey.

1019.96,1021.39,WILLOW/WARREN*,"Yeah, all too aware."
1021.47,1026.15,BUFFY,Say you did do this to yourself. Why would
1021.47,1026.15,BUFFY,your subconscious turn you into Warren?
1026.23,1029.99,WILLOW/WARREN*,Obviously because l feel bad...
1026.23,1029.99,WILLOW/WARREN*,about killing him.
1031.67,1034.63,BUFFY,"Look, we'll deal. We'll get help."
1034.71,1036.42,WILLOW/WARREN*,"No, l can handle this."
1036.42,1037.75,BUFFY,On your own? Why?
1037.83,1041.9,WILLOW/WARREN*,l did it. l'll fix it. l don't want you
1037.83,1041.9,WILLOW/WARREN*,"seeing me this way, anyway."
1041.99,1044.35,BUFFY,lt's kind of a little late for that.

1062.75,1064.36,SPIKE,The chip fired again.
1064.36,1065.58,BUFFY,l kinda figured.
1066.71,1069.7,BUFFY,Maybe they'll call back.
1066.71,1069.7,BUFFY,Maybe they'll send help.
1069.79,1072.35,SPIKE,Maybe we can't wait.

1088,1088.83,KENNEDY,Come on.
1088.91,1091.9,KENNEDY,l mean... you turned into a guy.
1091.99,1097.15,KENNEDY,"lf you take a step back, seriously, there's"
1091.99,1097.15,KENNEDY,"a certain element of humour here, right?"
1097.23,1099.67,KENNEDY,"Well, a really, really big step."
1099.75,1103.51,WILLOW/WARREN*,l killed him. lt's hard to see the chuckles.
1105.63,1106.98,KENNEDY,So you got a plan?
1106.98,1109.91,WILLOW*/WARREN,"Yeah, gonna get some help reversing it."
1109.99,1111.86,KENNEDY,l thought you were gonna try it.
1111.86,1113.14,WILLOW*/WARREN,l did. lt didn't work.
1113.23,1114.52,WILLOW*/WARREN,Something's blocking me.
1114.52,1116.78,KENNEDY,All the more reason for me to go with you.
1116.87,1121.71,KENNEDY,"Plus, l was there with you when it happened."
1116.87,1121.71,KENNEDY,Let me come to try to help too.
1121.79,1124.72,WILLOW/WARREN*,l really think l'm fine with the handling.
1124.72,1125.91,KENNEDY,By yourself? Why?
1125.99,1128.46,WILLOW*/WARREN,l'm the one that killed him.
1131.59,1133.92,WILLOW*/WARREN,lt's hard to understand.

1134.59,1137.19,KENNEDY,How about l just tag along anyway?
1134.59,1137.19,KENNEDY,Keep you company.
1137.75,1139.6,KENNEDY,l'm taking that as a yes.
1139.6,1140.42,WILLOW/WARREN*,Fine. Come.
1140.51,1143.31,WILLOW*/WARREN,But try not to get in the way.
1144.47,1146.32,KENNEDY,You know where you're going?
1146.32,1148.43,WILLOW*/WARREN,To see some old friends of mine.
1148.51,1151.79,WILLOW*/WARREN,"Been a while, but maybe they can help."
1153.83,1156.71,SPIKE,Are you sure you still wanna go back
1153.83,1156.71,SPIKE,in this place with me?
1156.79,1159.39,BUFFY,"Uh, nothing good on TV tonight."

1175.35,1178.71,SPIKE,Worked pretty good when
1175.35,1178.71,SPIKE,the lnitiative held me captive here.
1179.63,1184.1,SPIKE,"Every time l'd get a little rambunctious,"
1179.63,1184.1,SPIKE,"the chip'd kick in,"
1184.19,1186.91,SPIKE,and l'd feel like my head was gonna explode.
1186.99,1192.38,SPIKE,"They'd dope me up, and everything"
1186.99,1192.38,SPIKE,would be all daffodils and teddy bears.
1192.47,1194.63,SPIKE,For a couple of hours anyway.
1194.63,1197.83,BUFFY,Maybe we should search for files and stuff.
1197.91,1201.51,BUFFY,Find out everything we can
1197.91,1201.51,BUFFY,about the chip. Shelf life.

1233.71,1237.26,ANDREW,This is Andrew speaking.
1233.71,1237.26,ANDREW,How can l help you?
1238.59,1239.82,XANDER,Loser.
1240.67,1243.87,ANDREW,"Hey, do we know"
1240.67,1243.87,ANDREW,some British guy named Robson?
1247.39,1252.15,XANDER,"He was attacked,"
1247.39,1252.15,XANDER,this... Robson guy in England.
1253.95,1256.59,XANDER,And Giles was there helpin' him.
1257.35,1259.79,XANDER,And there was a Bringer.
1259.79,1260.71,ANYA,Xander...
1260.79,1264.75,XANDER,"Robson blacked out, but the last thing"
1260.79,1264.75,XANDER,he remembers is Giles's head...
1264.83,1267.74,XANDER,about to get familiar
1264.83,1267.74,XANDER,with a Bringer's very sharp axe.
1267.83,1268.52,DAWN,"Oh, my God!"
1268.52,1270.66,ANYA,Giles never mentioned any of this.
1270.75,1274.11,XANDER,Robson said by the time he came to...
1274.19,1276.99,XANDER,there was no Giles.
1277.07,1279.02,DAWN,"So, what are we saying?"
1279.02,1282.91,XANDER,Maybe Giles just didn't want to talk about it.
1282.99,1287.3,ANYA,Or maybe he didn't make it.
1282.99,1287.3,ANYA,"Look, l'm not saying it's a happy scenario,"
1287.39,1290.78,ANYA,but we're dealing with the Big Bad
1287.39,1290.78,ANYA,that can be any dead person.
1290.87,1293.18,XANDER,To infiltrate the inner circle of the Slayer...
1293.27,1296.71,ANYA,You become the one person she trusts
1293.27,1296.71,ANYA,more than anybody else.
1296.79,1299.04,DAWN,But there's no way that we can know.
1299.04,1300.67,ANDREW,"Actually, that's not true."
1300.75,1304.19,ANDREW,"The First can't take corporeal form,"
1300.75,1304.19,ANDREW,so it can't touch anything.
1304.27,1306.25,ANDREW,"Well, it's not like Giles"
1306.25,1308.71,ANYA,"hasn't touched anything, right?"
1312.91,1317.51,ANYA,Has anyone seen Giles
1312.91,1317.51,ANYA,touch anything since he got back?
1319.39,1321.03,ANYA,Hold anything?
1322.63,1325.02,ANYA,Has anybody hugged him?
1325.71,1328.1,ANYA,Think very hard.
1332.19,1333.17,ANDREW,Where're you...?
1333.17,1334.75,XANDER,"The desert, to find Giles."
1334.83,1337.63,ANDREW,"Oh, good. Let me just get"
1334.83,1337.63,ANDREW,some tapes for the car.

1339.54,1340.27,ANDREW,What? Why?
1340.35,1342.71,ANDREW,Cos l used to be evil?
1342.79,1345.7,XANDER,"No, cos you're annoying,"
1342.79,1345.7,XANDER,but that's a good reason too.
1345.79,1350.58,ANDREW,"Wait, l... Don't leave me here all alone."
1345.79,1350.58,ANDREW,l keep getting attacked in this house.
1350.67,1351.27,DAWN,Actually...
1351.27,1353.06,ANDREW,What if this is part of the plan?
1353.15,1357.11,ANDREW,Drive you guys away so it can have
1353.15,1357.11,ANDREW,its way with me? Ever think of that?
1357.59,1358.57,XANDER,l'll risk it.
1358.57,1361.35,ANDREW,"OK, well, if you leave me here alone,"
1361.43,1364.66,ANDREW,"l'll do something evil, like..."
1364.75,1368.98,ANDREW,burning something
1364.75,1368.98,ANDREW,or... gluing things together.
1369.47,1375.94,ANYA,"For crying out loud, Harris, let's just take him."
