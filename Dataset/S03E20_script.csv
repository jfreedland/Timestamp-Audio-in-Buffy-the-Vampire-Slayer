17.21,18.8,,Hmm.
22.91,25.64,,What? Do I have funny
22.91,25.64,,bed hair or something?
25.72,28.31,Angel,Or something.
25.72,28.31,Angel,Hmm.
28.39,31.25,Buffy,I guess we got
28.39,31.25,Buffy,a little carried away...
31.32,35.28,Buffy,with the whole
31.32,35.28,Buffy,postslayage nap thing.
35.36,37.38,Angel,Hmm.
37.46,39.4,Angel,"Oh, not good."
39.46,40.62,Angel,Ha ha ha.
40.7,41.73,Angel,Where you going?
41.73,43.53,Buffy,To go kill a cat on my head.
43.6,45.16,Angel,No mirrors.
45.24,46.6,Angel,Oof.
46.67,49.47,Angel,"You know, this place really"
46.67,49.47,Angel,isn't girl friendly.
49.54,50.18,Angel,"No mirrors,"
50.18,51.17,Buffy,no natural light.
51.24,52.83,Angel,I think you look perfect.
52.91,55.34,Buffy,"Oh, yeah,"
52.91,55.34,Buffy,I really look... OK.
55.41,57.68,Buffy,Mmm. Mmm.
59.78,63.91,Buffy,Maybe we should think about
59.78,63.91,Buffy,getting a few mirrors.
63.99,68.62,Buffy,"And maybe a drawer, you know,"
63.99,68.62,Buffy,for some of my stuff.
68.69,70.68,Buffy,Because that's what couples do...
70.76,72.46,Buffy,they have drawers.
72.53,75.12,Angel,Hmm. That's right.
75.2,77.13,Buffy,"You know,"
75.2,77.13,Buffy,"II figure, that way,"
77.2,79.9,Buffy,sometimes I could
77.2,79.9,Buffy,spend the night.
79.97,81.87,Buffy,"Like, after the prom,"
81.94,84.57,Buffy,it would be nice
81.94,84.57,Buffy,to be able to just...
84.64,88.77,Buffy,come back here and spend
84.64,88.77,Buffy,some time together.
88.85,90.78,Angel,The prom?
90.85,93.41,Buffy,"End of high school,"
90.85,93.41,Buffy,rite of passage thingy.
93.48,96.75,Buffy,Think cotillion with spiked punch
93.48,96.75,Buffy,and electric slide.
96.82,98.08,Angel,Right.
98.16,100.15,Buffy,Don't worry.
98.16,100.15,Buffy,It's at night.
100.22,102.82,Buffy,And lots of girls
100.22,102.82,Buffy,have older boyfriends.
102.89,104.49,Buffy,You'll blend.
107.06,109.53,Angel,I think maybe you should
107.06,109.53,Angel,"get going, huh?"
109.6,113.13,Buffy,Hmm. There must be
109.6,113.13,Buffy,a few more hours before sunrise.
116.31,117.74,Buffy,Aah! Aah!
117.81,119.94,Buffy,Oh! Sorry.
122.02,122.27,Buffy,I guess it's later
122.02,122.27,Buffy,than we thought.
184.71,185.97,Anya,Xander.
186.04,189.95,Xander,"Well, hey, it's Demon Anya,"
186.04,189.95,Xander,punisher of evil males.
190.01,192.38,Xander,Still haven't got your powers back?
192.45,194.6,Xander,"You haven't, right?"
194.6,194.94,Anya,No.
195.02,197.49,Anya,"I will, though."
195.02,197.49,Anya,It's just a matter of time.
197.56,199.42,Xander,"So, now, how did that work?"
199.49,201.89,Xander,Women would wish horrible things
199.49,201.89,Xander,on their exboyfriends.
201.96,204.06,Xander,You'd show up and make it happen.
204.06,204.89,Anya,That's right.
204.96,208.69,Anya,The power of the wish made me a
204.96,208.69,Anya,righteous sword to smite the unfaithful.
208.77,211.89,Xander,"Well, hey, good luck with that."
208.77,211.89,Xander,Hope it works out for you.
211.97,213.9,Anya,"You know, you can laugh,"
211.97,213.9,Anya,but I have witnessed...
213.97,216.5,Anya,a millennium of treachery and oppression
213.97,216.5,Anya,"from the males of the species,"
216.57,219.37,Anya,and I have nothing but contempt
216.57,219.37,Anya,for the whole libidinous lot of them.
219.44,221.21,Xander,Then why are you talking to me?
224.05,226.02,Anya,I don't have a date
224.05,226.02,Anya,for the prom.
226.08,229.38,Xander,"Well, gosh,"
226.08,229.38,Xander,I wonder why not.
229.45,232.05,Xander,It couldn't possibly have anything
229.45,232.05,Xander,to do with your sales pitch.
232.12,235.35,Anya,Men are evil.
232.12,235.35,Anya,Will you go with me?
235.43,238.33,Xander,"One of us is very confused,"
235.43,238.33,Xander,and I honestly don't know which.
238.4,240.42,Anya,"You know, this happens"
238.4,240.42,Anya,to be all your fault.
240.5,241.9,Xander,My fault?
241.97,243.56,Anya,"You were unfaithful to Cordelia,"
243.63,246.97,Anya,so I took on the guise of a 12th grader
243.63,246.97,Anya,to tempt her with the wish.
247.04,249.37,Anya,"When I lost my powers,"
247.04,249.37,Anya,"I got stuck in this persona,"
249.44,251.37,Anya,and now I have
249.44,251.37,Anya,all these "feelings."
251.44,253.43,Anya,I don't understand it.
251.44,253.43,Anya,I don't like it.
253.51,256.88,Anya,All I know is I really wanna go to this
253.51,256.88,Anya,"dance, and I want someone to go with me."
256.95,261.88,Xander,"Be still, my heart. Oh, wait, it is."
256.95,261.88,Xander,How come I got the short straw?
261.95,265.98,Anya,YYou're not quite as obnoxious as most
261.95,265.98,Anya,of the alpha males around here.
266.06,267.64,Anya,Plus I know you don't have a date.
267.64,269.12,Xander,I haven't settled on anyone yet.
269.19,271.79,Anya,"Fine. Look, I know"
269.19,271.79,Anya,you find me attractive.
271.86,274.23,Anya,I've seen you looking
271.86,274.23,Anya,at my breasts.
274.3,277.76,Xander,"Nothing personal, but when a guy does"
274.3,277.76,Xander,"that, just means his eyes are open."
277.84,278.93,Anya,Whatever.
281.02,281.63,Anya,"Look, do you wanna go"
281.02,281.63,Anya,with me or not?
283.87,286.57,Oz,"Anya, huh?"
283.87,286.57,Oz,Interesting choice.
286.64,289.84,Xander,Choice is kind of a broad term
286.64,289.84,Xander,for my situation.
289.91,294.54,Xander,"See, it's either Anya or"
289.91,294.54,Xander,the sock puppet of love for this boy.
294.62,294.62,Oz,
294.62,296.48,Xander,"I love you, Xander."
296.55,298.92,Xander,I'll never leave you.
298.99,302.76,Willow,"If Anya tries to get you killed,"
298.99,302.76,Willow,put me down for a big "I told you so."
302.83,306.26,Xander,Who's this Anya?
302.83,306.26,Xander,Is she prettier than me?
306.33,309.77,Willow,"She just better not try to cross me,"
306.33,309.77,Willow,that's all I'm saying.
309.83,312.27,Buffy,"Well, at least we all have someone"
309.83,312.27,Buffy,to go with now.
312.34,315.67,Buffy,"Some of us are going with demons, but"
312.34,315.67,Buffy,I think that's a valid lifestyle choice.
315.74,319.23,Buffy,"More importantly,"
315.74,319.23,Buffy,I have the kick dress.
319.31,320.74,Willow,"Ooh, the pink one?"
320.81,324.11,Buffy,"Angel's gonna lose it,"
320.81,324.11,Buffy,but not his soul.
324.18,326.45,Buffy,"I mean, he's gonna lose it."
324.18,326.45,Buffy,His it.
337.9,340.16,Buffy,
351.94,355.02,Angel,Ms. Summers.
353.08,354.6,Joyce,"I'm sorry to, uh..."
354.68,357.48,Joyce,"Well, I would have called,"
354.68,357.48,Joyce,but I don't have your number.
357.55,359.52,Angel,Please.
357.55,359.52,Angel,You're always welcome.
360.85,364.51,Joyce,My goodness.
360.85,364.51,Joyce,Your place is amazing.
364.59,366.11,Angel,Yeah. I like a lot of space.
366.19,368.11,Angel,I don't get out much in the day.
368.11,369.13,Joyce,"No, you wouldn't."
372.26,374.56,Angel,Can I get you something?
372.26,374.56,Angel,I don't have any coffee.
374.63,377.33,Joyce,"Oh, no, thank you. I..."
377.4,380.04,Joyce,You don't drink?
377.4,380.04,Joyce,"Beverages, I mean."
380.17,381.6,Angel,"No, I do."
381.67,383.97,Angel,It's just the caffeine.
381.67,383.97,Angel,It makes me jittery.
384.04,385.47,Joyce,Oh.
387.91,390.14,Joyce,I understand
387.91,390.14,Joyce,Buffy spent the night.
390.21,392.61,Angel,I'm sorry about that.
390.21,392.61,Angel,We came back after patrolling...
392.68,394.71,Joyce,I'm... I'm not interested
392.68,394.71,Joyce,in the details.
394.78,396.25,Joyce,That's not why I'm here.
397.25,398.45,Angel,OK.
398.52,401.46,Joyce,I'm here because
398.52,401.46,Joyce,I'm worried about you two.
401.52,403.15,Joyce,In general.
403.23,406.06,Angel,"What happened before, when I changed,"
403.23,406.06,Angel,it won't happen again.
406.13,409.39,Joyce,That's not all
406.13,409.39,Joyce,I'm concerned about.
409.46,412.66,Joyce,I don't have to tell you that you
409.46,412.66,Joyce,and Buffy are from different worlds.
412.73,415.53,Angel,"No, you don't."
415.6,417.8,Joyce,"She's had to deal with a lot,"
417.87,419.53,Joyce,grow up fast.
419.61,423.77,Joyce,Sometimes even I forget
419.61,423.77,Joyce,that she's still just a girl.
423.85,426.31,Angel,I'm old enough
423.85,426.31,Angel,to be her ancestor.
426.38,429.51,Joyce,She's just starting
426.38,429.51,Joyce,out in life.
429.58,431.02,Angel,I know.
432.99,436.25,Angel,I think about it more now
432.99,436.25,Angel,that she's staying in Sunnydale.
437.73,439.09,Joyce,Good.
439.16,441.1,Joyce,Because when it
439.16,441.1,Joyce,"comes to you, Angel,"
441.16,444.26,Joyce,she's just like
441.16,444.26,Joyce,any other young woman in love.
444.33,447.43,Joyce,"You're all she can see of tomorrow,"
447.5,450.7,Joyce,but I think we both know
447.5,450.7,Joyce,that there are some hard choices ahead.
450.77,454.71,Joyce,"If she can't make them,"
450.77,454.71,Joyce,you're gonna have to.
457.61,459.94,Joyce,I know you care about her.
460.02,462.28,Joyce,I just hope you care enough.
463.85,465.99,Buffy,So it was blue and sort of short?
465.99,467.41,Willow,Not too short. Medium.
467.49,471.52,Willow,And it had this weird sort
467.49,471.52,Willow,"of, uh, fringy stuff on its arms."
471.59,474.89,Giles,"What's that, a demon?"
471.59,474.89,Giles,A prom dress Wil was
471.59,474.89,Giles,thinking of getting.
474.96,477.3,Giles,Can't you ever get your mind
474.96,477.3,Giles,out of the Hellmouth?
477.37,479.96,Giles,"I'd be delighted to, however"
477.37,479.96,Giles,the day of the mayor's ascension...
480.04,482.83,Giles,"is fast approaching,"
480.04,482.83,Giles,and we don't know what to expect.
482.9,485.03,Giles,What about the pages Wil stole
482.9,485.03,Giles,from the mayor's book?
485.11,487.34,Giles,"She put her life on the line there, pal."
485.11,487.34,Giles,Don't tell me they're useless.
487.41,488.84,Giles,"On the contrary, no."
488.91,491.9,Giles,WeWeWe know that
488.91,491.9,Giles,the ascension refers to...
491.98,493.91,Giles,a human transforming
491.98,493.91,Giles,"into a demon,"
493.98,495.57,Buffy,becoming the living embodiment
495.57,497.54,Giles,"of an immortal, and graduation day..."
497.62,499.55,Giles,our Mayor Wilkins
497.62,499.55,Giles,is scheduled to do just that.
499.62,502.35,Wesley,The trouble is we don't know
499.62,502.35,Wesley,which demon he's going to become.
502.42,504.74,Giles,There are thousands of species.
504.74,506.38,Wesley,So it's safe to say...
506.46,509.83,Wesley,we shouldn't waste any time on such
506.46,509.83,Wesley,trifling matters as a school dance.
509.9,511.87,Cordelia,Cordelia:
509.9,511.87,Cordelia,"Well, that's too bad,"
511.93,515.56,Cordelia,because I bet you would look way
511.93,515.56,Cordelia,double07 in a tux.
515.64,518.37,Wesley,Except of course
515.64,518.37,Wesley,"on the actual night,"
518.44,521.53,Wesley,when I will be aiding Mr. Giles
518.44,521.53,Wesley,in his chaperoning duties.
521.61,525.91,Giles,What? Excuse me?
521.61,525.91,Giles,"Fine, fine, fine."
525.98,528.21,Buffy,We'll get you a dress.
525.98,528.21,Buffy,"You know, we should check April Fools."
528.28,530.34,Cordelia,Don't go there.
530.42,531.78,Cordelia,I shop there.
531.85,535.38,Xander,"I, myself, am dipping"
531.85,535.38,Xander,into my hardearned road trip fund...
535.46,538.45,Xander,"to procure a shiny new tux,"
535.46,538.45,Xander,so look for me to dazzle.
538.53,540.46,Giles,And I shall be wearing
538.53,540.46,Giles,"pink taffeta,"
540.53,542.46,Giles,as Chenille will not
540.53,542.46,Giles,go with my complexion.
542.53,545.02,Giles,Can we please
542.53,545.02,Giles,talk about the ascension?
545.1,547.76,Buffy,"Giles, we get it."
545.1,547.76,Buffy,Miles to go before we sleep.
547.84,551.1,Buffy,But especially if we're all going to
547.84,551.1,Buffy,"vaporize or something on graduation day,"
551.17,553.2,Buffy,we deserve a little "promy" fun.
553.28,556.27,Buffy,"One night of glory,"
553.28,556.27,Buffy,not too much to ask.
582.6,585.77,Priest,"Into this holy estate,"
582.6,585.77,Priest,these two persons present...
585.84,587.71,Priest,now come to be joined.
587.78,589.94,Priest,If any man can show
587.78,589.94,Priest,just cause...
592.02,592.34,Priest,why they should not
592.02,592.34,Priest,"be lawfully joined together,"
592.41,594.08,Priest,let him speak now...
594.15,597.68,Priest,or else here and after
594.15,597.68,Priest,hold his peace.
597.75,599.58,Priest,"Bless, O Lord, this ring,"
599.65,602.68,Priest,that he who gives it
599.65,602.68,Priest,and she who wears it...
602.76,604.49,Priest,shall abide in thy peace...
604.56,606.29,Priest,and continue in thy favor...
606.36,608.3,Priest,through Christ our Lord.
608.36,609.59,Buffy,Amen.
668.26,670.16,Buffy,Angel?
695.15,698.68,Buffy,I always say patrol's not complete
695.15,698.68,Buffy,without a trip to the stinky sewers.
698.75,700.81,Angel,I'm sure I saw him
698.75,700.81,Angel,come down here.
700.89,703.12,Buffy,Couldn't we just let this
700.89,703.12,Buffy,be the vamp that got away?
703.19,705.13,Buffy,We could say he was this big.
705.19,707.16,Angel,What can I say?
705.19,707.16,Angel,I need closure.
707.23,710.36,Buffy,You need clothes.
707.23,710.36,Buffy,"You don't have a tux, do you?"
710.43,713.4,Angel,Since when did patrolling
710.43,713.4,Angel,go black tie?
713.47,715.8,Buffy,"For the prom, silly."
715.87,719.43,Angel,We have more important things to think
715.87,719.43,Angel,"about right now than a dance, Buffy."
719.51,721.34,Buffy,"Sorry, Giles."
719.51,721.34,Buffy,I'll just be quiet.
722.41,725.35,Angel,Come on.
722.41,725.35,Angel,Don't be that way.
726.31,728.81,Buffy,Not now.
728.88,731.08,Buffy,I'm not being that way.
731.15,735.15,Buffy,"Every time I say the word ""prom,"""
731.15,733.61,Buffy,you get grouchy.
733.61,735.15,Angel,I'm sorry.
735.22,738.39,Angel,I'm just worried that you're getting
735.22,738.39,Angel,too invested in this whole thing.
738.46,740.02,Buffy,What whole thing?
740.1,742.96,Buffy,Isn't this the stuff that I'm supposed
740.1,742.96,Buffy,to get invested in...
743.03,745.83,Buffy,"going to a formal,"
743.03,745.83,Buffy,"graduating, growing up?"
746.97,748.37,Angel,I know.
751.14,753.97,Buffy,Then what?
751.14,753.97,Buffy,What's with the dire?
759.58,761.95,Angel,"It's, uh..."
762.02,763.13,Angel,It's nothing.
763.13,765.68,Buffy,No. You have "something" face.
767.59,769.52,Angel,I think we need to talk.
770.86,773.15,Angel,"But not now, not here."
773.28,776.71,Buffy,No. No. If you have
773.28,776.71,Buffy,"something to say, then say it."
779.65,782.71,Buffy,"Angel, drop the cryptic."
779.65,782.71,Buffy,You're scaring me.
785.36,788.45,Angel,I've been thinking
785.36,788.45,Angel,about our future.
790.66,792.99,Angel,"And the more I do,"
790.66,792.99,Angel,"the more I feel like us,"
793.07,796.33,Angel,"you and me being together,"
796.4,798.8,Angel,is unfair to you.
798.87,801.47,Buffy,Is this about
798.87,801.47,Buffy,what the mayor said?
801.54,804.98,Buffy,Because he was just
801.54,803.7,Buffy,trying to shake us up.
803.7,804.98,Angel,He was right.
805.04,809.07,Buffy,"No. No, he wasn't."
805.04,809.07,Buffy,He's the bad guy.
815.75,817.59,Buffy,
817.66,820.32,Angel,You deserve more.
820.39,824.59,Angel,You deserve something outside
820.39,824.59,Angel,of demons and darkness.
826.43,828.33,Angel,"I mean,"
828.4,831.84,Angel,you should be with someone
828.4,831.84,Angel,"who can take you into the light,"
833.51,835.44,Angel,someone who can
833.51,835.44,Angel,make love to you.
835.51,837.27,Buffy,I don't care about that.
837.34,839.71,Angel,You will.
837.34,839.71,Angel,And children.
839.78,843.51,Buffy,Children? Can you say jumping the gun?
839.78,843.51,Buffy,I kill my goldfish.
843.58,847.02,Angel,"Today, but you have no idea"
843.58,847.02,Angel,"how fast it goes, Buffy."
847.09,850.11,Angel,"Before you know it,"
847.09,850.11,Angel,you'll want it all... a normal life...
850.19,851.99,Buffy,I'll never have a normal life.
852.06,852.89,Buffy,"Oh, right."
852.89,855.03,Angel,"You'll always be a slayer,"
855.09,857.72,Angel,but that's all the more reason why
855.09,857.72,Angel,you should have a real relationship...
857.8,859.89,Angel,instead of this...
857.8,859.89,Angel,this freak show.
864.2,866.64,Angel,I didn't mean that.
866.71,868.9,Buffy,I'm gonna go.
868.97,872.34,Angel,I'm sorry.
868.97,872.34,Angel,"All right, Buffy?"
872.41,878.02,Angel,You know how much I love you.
872.41,878.02,Angel,It kills me to say this.
876.08,879.64,Buffy,Then don't. Who are you
876.08,879.64,Buffy,to tell me what's right for me?
879.72,882.31,Buffy,You think I haven't
879.72,881.48,Buffy,thought about this?
881.48,882.31,Angel,Have you?
882.39,884.24,Angel,Rationally?
884.24,884.75,Buffy,No.
884.82,888.02,Buffy,"No, of course not. I'm just some"
884.82,888.02,Buffy,"swoony little schoolgirl, right?"
888.09,890.03,Angel,I'm trying to do
888.09,890.03,Angel,"what's right here, OK?"
890.1,892.26,Angel,I'm trying to think with my head
890.1,892.26,Angel,instead of my heart.
892.33,893.2,Angel,Heart?
893.2,895.66,Buffy,You have a heart?
895.73,897.86,Buffy,It isn't even beating.
900.17,903.63,Angel,Don't.
900.17,903.63,Angel,Don't what? Don't love you?
903.71,907.67,Buffy,I'm sorry. You know what? I didn't know
903.71,907.67,Buffy,that I got a choice in that.
907.75,910.77,Buffy,I'm never gonna change.
907.75,910.77,Buffy,I can't change.
914.35,916.79,Buffy,I want my life to be with you.
919.49,919.49,Buffy,
919.49,921.55,Angel,I don't.
925.03,927.06,Angel,You don't wanna be with me?
933.21,935.94,Buffy,I can't believe
933.21,935.94,Buffy,you're breaking up with me.
939.28,941.25,Angel,It doesn't mean
939.28,941.25,Angel,that I don't...
951.99,954.98,Buffy,How am I supposed
951.99,954.98,Buffy,to stay away from you?
957.06,958.72,Angel,I'm leaving.
960.67,962.4,Angel,After the ascension.
964.17,966.93,Angel,After it's finished
964.17,966.93,Angel,"with the mayor and Faith,"
968.67,971.11,Angel,"if we survive, I'll go."
974.41,975.85,Buffy,Where?
977.08,978.57,Angel,I don't know.
988.36,991.16,Buffy,Is this really happening?
1034.21,1036.64,Willow,"So, that's it?"
1037.71,1039.14,Willow,That's it.
1039.21,1041.98,Buffy,Assuming we survive
1039.21,1041.98,Buffy,"this ascension thing,"
1042.05,1044.24,Buffy,he's gonna leave town.
1045.58,1048.14,Buffy,"Oh, he's a fool."
1048.22,1052.92,Willow,"He's just a big, dumb jerk person,"
1048.22,1052.92,Willow,if you ask me.
1052.99,1055.32,Willow,And he's a supermaxi jerk...
1055.39,1057.33,Willow,for doing it right
1055.39,1057.33,Willow,before the prom.
1057.4,1059.46,Buffy,That's not his fault.
1059.53,1061.33,Buffy,He's 243 years old.
1061.4,1063.43,Buffy,He doesn't exactly get the prom.
1064.57,1066.45,Willow,But he should if he...
1066.45,1067.56,Buffy,"Wil, it's OK."
1068.67,1070.7,Buffy,You don't have to
1068.67,1070.7,Buffy,make him the bad guy.
1070.78,1074.08,Willow,"But that's the best friend's job,"
1074.15,1076.17,Willow,vilifying and grousing.
1076.25,1079.05,Buffy,"Usually, yeah."
1079.12,1081.45,Buffy,But he's right.
1081.52,1085.89,Buffy,"I mean, I think maybe,"
1081.52,1085.89,Buffy,"in the long run, that he's right."
1087.73,1091.96,Willow,"Yeah, I think he is."
1092.03,1095.09,Willow,"I mean, I tried to hope"
1092.03,1095.09,Willow,"for the best, but..."
1096.5,1098.26,Willow,I'm sorry.
1098.34,1100.46,Willow,It must be horrible.
1102.27,1105.18,Buffy,I think horrible
1102.27,1105.18,Buffy,is still coming.
1105.24,1107.18,Buffy,"Right now, it's worse."
1108.88,1111.87,Buffy,"Right now, I'm just trying"
1108.88,1111.87,Buffy,to keep from dying.
1112.95,1114.58,Willow,"Oh, Buffy."
1117.46,1119.82,Buffy,"I can't breathe, Wil."
1119.89,1122.29,Buffy,I feel like I can't breathe.
1164.84,1168.14,Xander,OK. How long does it take you
1164.84,1168.14,Xander,to buy a damn dress?
1168.21,1172.02,Cordelia,Xander!
1170.08,1173.74,Cordelia,"I, uh... I'm considering things"
1170.08,1173.74,Cordelia,a little more carefully nowadays.
1173.81,1176.94,Cordelia,I don't want to get stuck
1173.81,1176.94,Cordelia,with another dud.
1177.02,1178.61,Xander,"Well, this should work for you."
1178.68,1181.35,Xander,It positively screams nympho.
1181.42,1183.18,Salesgirl,Is this a customer or a friend?
1183.26,1186.16,Xander,Neither. Just stopped by
1183.26,1186.16,Xander,for my daily helping of bile.
1186.22,1188.25,Salesgirl,So you better get back to work
1186.22,1188.25,Salesgirl,and quit goofing.
1188.33,1191.56,Salesgirl,Mrs. Finkle so has it in for you.
1194.1,1198.02,Xander,You work here?
1194.1,1198.02,Xander,
1196.07,1198.73,Cordelia,"Yes. Yes, I work here."
1198.81,1201.57,Xander,"But, uh, why?"
1201.64,1203.87,Cordelia,I'm trying to buy a dress.
1205.35,1207.28,Xander,But don't you already
1205.35,1207.28,Xander,have all the dresses?
1207.35,1210.41,Cordelia,"I have nothing, OK?"
1207.35,1210.41,Cordelia,"No dresses,"
1210.48,1212.42,Cordelia,"no cell phone, no car."
1212.49,1214.11,Cordelia,Everything has been taken away...
1214.19,1217.28,Cordelia,because Daddy made
1214.19,1217.28,Cordelia,a little mistake on his taxes...
1217.36,1220.05,Cordelia,for the last 12 years.
1220.13,1223.29,Cordelia,Satisfied?
1220.13,1223.29,Cordelia,Are you a happy Xander now?
1223.36,1224.69,Cordelia,I'm broke.
1224.76,1228.56,Cordelia,I can't go to any of the colleges
1224.76,1228.56,Cordelia,"that accepted me,"
1228.64,1231.2,Cordelia,and I can't stay home
1228.64,1231.2,Cordelia,because we no longer have one.
1234.11,1236.08,Xander,"Uh, wow."
1236.14,1237.8,Cordelia,"Yeah, neato!"
1237.88,1241.18,Cordelia,Now you can run along and tell all of
1237.88,1241.18,Cordelia,your friends how Cordy finally got hers.
1241.25,1245.08,Cordelia,How she has to work parttime just
1241.25,1245.08,Cordelia,to get a lousy prom dress on layaway!
1247.22,1249.15,Cordelia,And how she has
1247.22,1249.15,Cordelia,to wear a name tag.
1249.22,1252.56,Cordelia,"Oh, I'm a nametag person."
1249.22,1252.56,Cordelia,Don't leave that out.
1252.63,1254.75,Cordelia,The story just wouldn't
1252.63,1254.75,Cordelia,have the same punch.
1285.49,1288.86,Cordelia,And you say the creature
1285.49,1288.86,Cordelia,just stopped?
1288.93,1290.56,Cordelia,Yeah.
1290.63,1291.86,Xander,Right there.
1291.93,1293.99,Xander,"See, it's like he just realized..."
1294.07,1296.43,Xander,he forgot to put money
1294.07,1296.43,Xander,in the meter or something.
1296.5,1299.47,Cordelia,The other part that totally weirded
1296.5,1299.47,Cordelia,"me out, that thing had good taste."
1299.54,1302.3,Cordelia,He chucked Xander
1299.54,1302.3,Cordelia,and went right for the formal wear.
1302.38,1306.04,Xander,That's right. He left behind his copy
1302.38,1306.04,Xander,of Monster's Wear Daily.
1306.11,1309.31,Cordelia,I'm serious. Look at the outfit
1306.11,1309.31,Cordelia,that Xander's wearing.
1309.38,1312.15,Cordelia,Now look at the kid that
1309.38,1312.15,Cordelia,the monster went after.
1312.22,1314.29,Cordelia,"Very smooth lines,"
1314.29,1316.71,,till he was shredded.
1316.71,1316.71,Xander,
1316.79,1318.85,Buffy,I don't wanna see it again.
1318.93,1321.42,Buffy,"Buffy, it's horrible,"
1321.49,1324.09,Buffy,but you're gonna
1321.49,1324.09,Buffy,hunt this creature.
1324.16,1327,Buffy,You should study it.
1324.16,1327,Buffy,Think I got it.
1327.07,1331.02,Willow,She's right.
1327.07,1331.02,Willow,"I mean,"
1329.07,1332.47,Willow,you've seen one big hairy bringer
1329.07,1332.47,Willow,"of death, you've seen them all."
1332.54,1333.87,Wesley,Not really.
1333.94,1336.37,Wesley,"If I'm not mistaken,"
1333.94,1336.37,Wesley,this is a hellhound.
1336.44,1339.5,Giles,Yes. It's particularly vicious.
1339.58,1343.21,Giles,It's a sort of
1339.58,1343.21,Giles,a demon foot soldier...
1343.28,1346.98,Giles,bred during the Mahkash wars.
1347.05,1349.92,Giles,"Trained solely to kill, they..."
1349.99,1352.36,Giles,feed off the brains
1349.99,1352.36,Giles,of their foes.
1352.43,1354.11,Cordelia,Look! Right there! Zoom in on that.
1354.11,1354.92,Xander,It's a videotape.
1355,1357.59,Cordelia,So? They do it on television
1355,1357.59,Cordelia,all the time.
1357.66,1359.43,Xander,"Not with a regular VCR,"
1357.66,1359.43,Xander,they don't.
1359.5,1362.76,Wesley,Perhaps we could stay
1359.5,1362.76,Wesley,on the topic for once.
1362.84,1365.43,Wesley,"What, uh, were you"
1362.84,1365.43,Wesley,doing with Xander?
1365.51,1367.03,Wesley,Cordelia:
1365.51,1367.03,Wesley,What?
1367.11,1370.08,Cordelia,"Um, I was..."
1370.14,1372.51,Xander,Burning a hole
1370.14,1372.51,Xander,"in Daddy's wallet, as usual."
1372.58,1375.84,Xander,I just bumped into her
1372.58,1375.84,Xander,during my tuxedo hunt.
1377.15,1379.18,Oz,What's that?
1377.15,1379.18,Oz,"Hey, pause it."
1379.25,1381.55,Xander,"Guys, it's just a normal VCR."
1379.25,1381.55,Xander,It doesn't...
1381.62,1383.78,Xander,"Oh, wait."
1383.86,1386.22,Xander,It can do pause.
1387.29,1388.92,Xander,Xander:
1387.29,1388.92,Xander,"Hello, hellhound raiser."
1389,1389.27,Xander,Oz:
1389.27,1392.59,Oz,Tucker Wells." He was in my chem lab.
1394.87,1397.6,Wesley,Let me guess.
1394.87,1397.6,Wesley,"He was quiet, kept to himself,"
1397.67,1399.6,Wesley,but always seemed like
1397.67,1399.6,Wesley,a nice young man.
1399.67,1402.8,Oz,"Well, he didn't seem"
1399.67,1402.8,Oz,"the murderous type, anyway."
1402.88,1404.94,Oz,Something must've happened to him.
1407.31,1410.08,Xander,"How's it going over there, Buff?"
1411.08,1412.45,Buffy,Fine.
1412.52,1414.68,Xander,"Well, I just wanted to say"
1412.52,1414.68,Xander,that your impersonation...
1414.75,1417.05,Xander,of an inanimate object
1414.75,1417.05,Xander,is really coming along.
1417.12,1418.82,Buffy,Thanks.
1420.66,1423.22,Willow,"Ooh, ooh! I got into"
1420.66,1423.22,Willow,Tucker's Email account.
1427.2,1429.46,Willow,Listen to this message
1427.2,1429.46,Willow,Tucker sent to this kid...
1429.54,1432.06,Willow,David Metz at school last week.
1432.14,1434.77,Willow,The Sunnydale High lemmings
1432.14,1434.77,Willow,have no idea what awaits them.
1434.84,1438.5,Willow,Their big night will be
1434.84,1438.5,Willow,their last night."
1438.58,1442.51,Giles,So we have a threat against
1438.58,1442.51,Giles,"the students on their big night,"
1442.58,1446.95,Giles,a hellhound trained to attack people
1442.58,1446.95,Giles,in formal wear...
1447.02,1450.39,Cordelia,Oh. Are we all
1447.02,1450.39,Cordelia,catching up now?
1450.46,1453.69,Giles,This Tucker is planning
1450.46,1453.69,Giles,to attack the prom tonight.
1453.76,1456.92,Oz,Once again the Hellmouth puts
1453.76,1456.92,Oz,the special in special occasion.
1457,1459.69,Xander,Why do I even buy tickets
1457,1459.69,Xander,"for these things, I ask you?"
1459.77,1462.43,Willow,I wonder if I can
1459.77,1462.43,Willow,take my dress back?
1462.5,1463.82,Buffy,Don't you dare.
1463.82,1465.67,Willow,But Tucker's gonna...
1465.74,1470.18,Buffy,"No! You guys are gonna have a prom,"
1465.74,1470.18,Buffy,the kind of prom everyone should have.
1471.81,1475.8,Buffy,I'm gonna give you all
1471.81,1475.8,Buffy,"a nice, fun, normal evening,"
1475.88,1479.18,Buffy,if I have to kill every single person
1475.88,1479.18,Buffy,on the face of the earth to do it.
1481.35,1483.29,Xander,Yea?
1485.19,1487.13,Buffy,"OK, Wes, why don't you go"
1485.19,1487.13,Buffy,to Tucker's house?
1487.19,1489.35,Buffy,"He's probably not there,"
1487.19,1489.35,Buffy,but it's worth a shot.
1489.43,1491.76,Wesley,All right.
1489.43,1491.76,Wesley,Perhaps strength in numbers...
1491.83,1493.77,Buffy,You can take Cordy.
1493.83,1496.06,Wesley,"If that's your plan, all right."
1493.83,1496.06,Wesley,All right.
1496.14,1498.66,Wesley,What about the others?
1498.74,1501.37,Buffy,"Oz, you said you know this David kid"
1498.74,1501.37,Buffy,that Tucker Emailed?
1501.44,1504.24,Buffy,You and Wil track him down.
1501.44,1504.24,Buffy,"See what he knows, if he's involved."
1504.31,1505.16,Willow,We're on it.
1505.16,1507.91,Buffy,And could you two check the Magic Shop?
1507.98,1508.74,Wesley,Magic Shop?
1508.74,1511.31,Buffy,It's next to the dress store on Main.
1511.38,1514.68,Xander,I can swing that one.
1511.38,1514.68,Xander,What's the mission?
1514.75,1517.52,Buffy,See if anyone's been in buying supplies
1514.75,1517.52,Buffy,to raise a hellhound.
1517.59,1518.14,Buffy,Got ya.
1518.14,1519.65,Xander,Or check and see...
1519.73,1521.85,Xander,who's been stocking up
1519.73,1521.85,Xander,on hellhound Snausages.
1521.93,1524.33,Xander,I hear those pups do anything
1521.93,1524.33,Xander,for a tasty treat.
1526.07,1528.5,Buffy,"Giles, you say"
1526.07,1528.5,Buffy,this thing eats brains.
1528.57,1532.02,Buffy,Any brains?
1530.07,1532.29,Giles,"Um, I suppose..."
1532.43,1535.26,Buffy,Then Tucker must be
1532.43,1535.26,Buffy,"feeding it, right?"
1535.33,1539.39,Packer,"Yeah, yeah. This kid orders cow brains"
1535.33,1539.39,Packer,a couple times a week.
1539.47,1543.66,Packer,"Oh, uh, it goes to this address."
1545.04,1547.3,Packer,Good luck.
1545.04,1547.3,Packer,He's a weird kid.
1547.37,1549.81,Buffy,Thanks.
1547.37,1549.81,Buffy,Thanks a lot.
1568.33,1571.35,Angel,What are you doing here?
1571.43,1574.06,Buffy,Hello to you too.
1574.13,1577.16,Angel,"Sorry, I..."
1574.13,1577.16,Angel,I'm just surprised.
1578.54,1581.06,Buffy,Me too.
1578.54,1581.06,Buffy,"I don't know why, though."
1581.14,1584.17,Buffy,"I mean, where did I think"
1581.14,1584.17,Buffy,"you get your blood, McPlasma's?"
1589.75,1591.04,Angel,How are you?
1591.04,1592.55,Buffy,Right as rain.
1592.62,1594.61,Buffy,Whatever that means.
1596.19,1600.32,Buffy,Don't look at me like that.
1596.19,1600.32,Buffy,I can lie to you if I want to now.
1600.39,1601.46,Buffy,"We're ex, remember?"
1601.46,1603.33,Angel,"If it means anything, I miss you."
1603.4,1606.63,Angel,"Can we not, please?"
1606.7,1611.3,Buffy,"When I think about us, I have"
1606.7,1611.3,Buffy,"this tendency to sort of go catatonic,"
1611.37,1613.6,Buffy,and I really can't afford
1611.37,1613.6,Buffy,to do that right now.
1613.67,1616.51,Buffy,I've gotta stop a crazy
1613.67,1616.51,Buffy,from pulling a Carrie at the prom.
1618.04,1620.1,Angel,You're still planning to go?
1620.18,1623.95,Buffy,"Strictly in a chaperone capacity,"
1620.18,1623.95,Buffy,but it's fine.
1624.02,1627.98,Buffy,"I mean, I'm cool with going stag."
1628.05,1632.39,Buffy,I'm over the whole "Buffy gets
1628.05,1632.39,Buffy,"one perfect highschool moment"" thing,"
1632.46,1634.95,Buffy,but I'm certainly not gonna
1632.46,1634.95,Buffy,let some subhuman ruin it...
1635.03,1636.96,Buffy,for the rest
1635.03,1636.96,Buffy,of the senior class.
1637.03,1638.95,Angel,Let me help you.
1638.95,1639.79,Buffy,I'm OK.
1639.87,1641.15,Angel,If you ever need my help...
1641.15,1641.86,Buffy,"Look, I got it."
1646.97,1648.5,Buffy,Thanks.
1661.99,1663.98,Salesgirl,"Hey, don't forget your dress."
1664.06,1666.15,Salesgirl,Aren't you wearing it tonight?
1666.23,1670.16,Cordelia,"As much as I hate to admit it,"
1666.23,1670.16,Cordelia,I haven't finished paying for it yet.
1670.23,1672.03,Salesgirl,"Well, somebody did."
1672.1,1674.62,Cordelia,What? Who?
1687.02,1687.28,Xander,"Zeroes all around, Buff."
1687.28,1687.34,Willow,Sorry.
1687.41,1691.21,Buffy,Make not with the long faces.
1687.41,1691.21,Buffy,I got the address.
1691.28,1693.62,Buffy,The prom starts in a little.
1691.28,1693.62,Buffy,"I want you guys to go on,"
1693.69,1696.12,Buffy,and I will catch up
1693.69,1696.12,Buffy,as soon as I put a lid on this jerk.
1696.19,1697.16,Xander,What? No way.
1697.16,1699.39,Willow,"We can't just leave you, Buff."
1699.46,1701.02,Giles,"Buffy, they're right."
1699.46,1701.02,Giles,You need...
1701.09,1703.43,Buffy,To see taillights.
1701.09,1703.43,Buffy,Hit the door.
1703.5,1705.07,Buffy,I have everything under control.
1705.07,1706.4,Oz,"Buffy, it makes sense to..."
1706.47,1709.73,Buffy,Have... a nice time.
1710.8,1711.89,Willow,"OK, then."
1711.89,1712.74,Xander,See ya.
1715.68,1718.8,Buffy,I want you at the gym.
1715.68,1718.8,Buffy,Keep an eye on them till I get there.
1720.38,1723.32,Giles,I don't have to tell you
1720.38,1723.32,Giles,you're being rather rash.
1724.62,1727.71,Giles,Finding an address hardly
1724.62,1727.71,Giles,adds up to case closed.
1727.79,1729.22,Buffy,"Look, it's done."
1729.29,1731.72,Buffy,You wanna go after them
1729.29,1731.72,Buffy,and tell them they can't go?
1731.79,1735.45,Buffy,That all of their planning
1731.79,1735.45,Buffy,and dreaming was for nothing?
1735.53,1738.52,Buffy,That they can't spend tonight
1735.53,1738.52,Buffy,with their honeys of all nights?
1738.6,1740.19,Buffy,
1746.64,1748.87,Giles,"Angel's not taking you,"
1746.64,1748.87,Giles,is he?
1751.14,1754.64,Buffy,Angel's leaving me.
1751.14,1754.64,Buffy,He's leaving town.
1757.65,1759.31,Giles,"Buffy, I'm sorry."
1764.09,1766.42,Giles,I don't really know
1764.09,1766.42,Giles,what to say.
1766.49,1769.09,Giles,"Um, I understand that"
1766.49,1769.09,Giles,this sort of thing...
1769.16,1772.1,Giles,requires ice cream of some kind.
1774.1,1776.43,Buffy,Ice cream will come.
1776.5,1778.8,Buffy,"First, I wanna"
1776.5,1778.8,Buffy,take out psycho boy.
1778.87,1780.67,Giles,You sure?
1780.74,1784.3,Buffy,Great thing about being a slayer...
1780.74,1784.3,Buffy,kicking ass is comfort food.
1790.22,1792.15,Buffy,
1802.16,1805.53,Anya,So she wished her husband's head
1802.16,1805.53,Anya,"would explode, which was great,"
1805.6,1808.26,Anya,except we were standing
1805.6,1808.26,Anya,three feet from him at the time.
1808.33,1810.5,Anya,"What a mess. Of course,"
1808.33,1810.5,Anya,"you know, during the plague,"
1810.57,1811.95,Anya,it was always parts
1811.95,1813.33,Wesley,"falling off, but..."
1813.41,1816.9,Wesley,that got pretty old since really
1813.41,1816.9,Wesley,"they pretty much were anyway, and..."
1818.38,1821.07,Wesley,"I must say,"
1818.38,1821.07,Wesley,this is all rather odd to me.
1821.15,1825.28,Giles,"Being at an allmale preparatory,"
1821.15,1825.28,Giles,we didn't go in for this sort of thing.
1825.35,1827.65,Wesley,"No, of course not."
1827.72,1830.19,Wesley,Unless you count the nights
1827.72,1830.19,Wesley,you made the lowerclassmen...
1830.26,1832.55,Wesley,get up as girls
1830.26,1832.55,Wesley,and watched them...
1835.3,1837.23,Wesley,"Dip is tasty, isn't it?"
1843.77,1846.33,Wesley,
1849.68,1851.87,Wesley,Salsa's hot.
1857.18,1858.62,Wesley,Very hot.
1884.49,1887.05,Willow,We got in.
1884.49,1887.05,Willow,Maybe we should dance...
1887.12,1890.09,Willow,"before we get besieged,"
1887.12,1890.09,Willow,bedeviled or beheaded or something.
1890.16,1892.02,Oz,It's not gonna happen.
1892.09,1894.03,Willow,You're not even a little nervous?
1894.1,1896.29,Oz,You think Buffy's gonna let us down?
1896.37,1898.7,Willow,Wanna enjoy some punch?
1896.37,1898.7,Willow,Yes.
1909.24,1914.02,Wesley,May I say you look... smashing?
1913.45,1915.38,Cordelia,It's a start.
1917.45,1921.39,Anya,"So then this one time, a girl wished"
1917.45,1921.39,Anya,that her ex would cannibalize himself.
1921.46,1922.66,Anya,Even I had a hard time
1922.66,1923.65,Xander,watching that one.
1923.73,1925.82,Xander,Cordelia. Wesley.
1925.89,1927.95,Xander,"My God in heaven,"
1925.89,1927.95,Xander,it's good to see you.
1928.03,1930.19,Xander,How are you both?
1928.03,1930.19,Xander,"And details, please."
1930.27,1932.15,Wesley,"Very well, thank you."
1932.15,1933.5,Cordelia,"Yes, thank you."
1933.57,1936.2,Xander,It looks good on you.
1936.27,1938.54,Cordelia,"Well, duh!"
1973.21,1974.48,Tucker,You ready to go...
1974.48,1975.61,Buffy,Sorry. New plan!
1976.95,1979.78,Buffy,"The prom's a go, and you're pathetic."
1979.78,1980.24,Tucker,Maybe.
1983.19,1985.55,Tucker,Maybe not.
1989.86,1991.79,Buffy,So that's how you did it?
1991.86,1994.62,Buffy,That's how you brainwashed the hounds
1991.86,1994.62,Buffy,to go psycho on prom?
1994.7,1995.5,Tucker,"Neat, huh?"
1995.5,1996.69,Buffy,I don't get it.
1996.77,2000.46,Buffy,What kind of sicko wants to destroy
1996.77,2000.46,Buffy,the happiest night of a senior's life?
2000.54,2002.73,Tucker,I have my reasons.
2002.8,2005.05,Tucker,You want to go to the prom with me?
2005.05,2005.24,Girl,No.
2006.54,2009.24,Buffy,Whatever.
2006.54,2009.24,Buffy,Every maladjust has his reasons.
2009.31,2011.61,Buffy,"Luckily for me,"
2009.31,2011.61,Buffy,you're an incompetent maladjust.
2017.72,2019.91,Buffy,Up. OK.
2019.99,2022.92,Buffy,"Now I'm gonna lock you in here,"
2019.99,2022.92,Buffy,and I'm gonna party like it's 19...
2022.99,2026.43,Tucker,Gotta have a redundancy system.
2026.5,2029.9,Tucker,Any "incompetent" knows that.
2029.97,2034.27,Tucker,My three fiercest babies
2029.97,2034.27,Tucker,are on their way to the dance right now.
2034.34,2037.07,Tucker,You think formal wear
2034.34,2037.07,Tucker,makes them crazy?
2037.14,2039.73,Tucker,Wait till they see
2037.14,2039.73,Tucker,the mirror ball.
2046.58,2048.52,Buffy,
2050.52,2052.61,Buffy,
2059.36,2061.92,Buffy,That's right.
2059.36,2061.92,Buffy,Follow Buffy. Good dogs.
2070.97,2073.91,Buffy,
2077.95,2080.14,Buffy,"Oh, come on."
2077.95,2080.14,Buffy,That song sucks.
2103.91,2105.81,Buffy,Get back!
2112.75,2114.44,Buffy,
2117.85,2119.18,Student,Bathroom?
2121.39,2123.26,Student,ThThThTh...
2123.33,2125.32,Buffy,You're welcome.
2128.66,2130.1,Buffy,Eww.
2189.33,2191.02,Willow,"Buffy, you look awesome."
2191.1,2192.46,Buffy,So do you.
2192.53,2194.26,Oz,Everything cool?
2194.33,2197.56,Buffy,Coolest. Devil dogs are history.
2194.33,2197.56,Buffy,How's the prom?
2197.63,2200.9,Oz,Strangely affecting. I got all teared up
2197.63,2200.9,Oz,when they played "We Are Family."
2200.97,2202.56,Willow,Everything's perfect.
2202.64,2204.63,Willow,
2209.02,2209.04,Announcer,And the award for
2209.02,2209.04,Announcer,Sunnydale High's...
2209.11,2213.24,Announcer,class clown for 1999
2209.11,2213.24,Announcer,goes to... Jack Mayhew.
2220.86,2224.56,Xander,Please! Anybody can
2220.86,2224.56,Xander,be a prop class clown.
2224.63,2227.5,Xander,"You know, none of the people"
2224.63,2227.5,Xander,who vote for these things are funny.
2245.02,2247.88,Jonathan,We have one more award
2245.02,2247.88,Jonathan,to give out.
2247.95,2250.75,Jonathan,Is Buffy Summers here tonight?
2251.82,2254.12,Jonathan,"DDid she, um..."
2258.13,2260.26,Jonathan,This is actually a new category.
2261.83,2263.53,Jonathan,First time ever.
2263.6,2266.13,Jonathan,I guess there were a lot
2263.6,2266.13,Jonathan,of writein ballots.
2266.2,2271.37,Jonathan,"Um, well, the prom committee"
2266.2,2271.37,Jonathan,asked me toto read this.
2276.21,2277.84,Jonathan,We're not good friends.
2277.92,2281.21,Jonathan,Most of us never found the time
2277.92,2281.21,Jonathan,to get to know you.
2281.29,2284.35,Jonathan,But that doesn't mean
2281.29,2284.35,Jonathan,we haven't noticed you.
2284.42,2286.36,Jonathan,"We don't talk about it much,"
2286.42,2288.45,Jonathan,but it's no secret
2286.42,2288.45,Jonathan,that Sunnydale High...
2288.53,2291.22,Jonathan,isn't really like
2288.53,2291.22,Jonathan,other high schools.
2291.3,2293.13,Jonathan,A lot of weird stuff
2291.3,2293.13,Jonathan,happens here."
2293.2,2295.17,Crowd outbursts,Student On Floor: Zombies!
2293.2,2295.17,Crowd outbursts,Hyena people!
2295.23,2296.32,Crowd outbursts,Third Student:
2295.23,2296.32,Crowd outbursts,Snyder!
2300.94,2305.17,Jonathan,But whenever there was a problem
2300.94,2305.17,Jonathan,"or something creepy happened,"
2305.24,2307.18,Jonathan,you seemed to show up
2305.24,2307.18,Jonathan,and stop it.
2307.24,2310.51,Jonathan,Most of the people here
2307.24,2310.51,Jonathan,have been saved by you...
2310.58,2313.68,Jonathan,or helped by you
2310.58,2313.68,Jonathan,at one time or another.
2313.75,2316.41,Jonathan,We're proud to say
2313.75,2316.41,Jonathan,that the class of'99...
2316.49,2319.55,Jonathan,has the lowest mortality rate
2316.49,2319.55,Jonathan,of any graduating class...
2319.62,2321.15,Jonathan,in Sunnydale history.
2328.67,2332,Jonathan,And we know at least
2328.67,2332,Jonathan,part of that is because of you.
2333.2,2335.83,Jonathan,So the senior class
2333.2,2335.83,Jonathan,offers its thanks...
2335.91,2339.67,Jonathan,"and gives you,"
2335.91,2339.67,Jonathan,"uh, uh, this."""
2347.15,2349.38,Jonathan,It's from all of us.
2349.45,2351.68,Jonathan,And it has written here...
2351.76,2352.78,Jonathan,"Buffy Summers,"
2353.99,2355.86,Jonathan,Class Protector."
2355.93,2357.86,Willow,
2394.4,2396.39,Willow,
2404.94,2406.37,Wesley,Mr. Giles.
2410.01,2411.48,Wesley,I'd like your opinion.
2413.68,2416.48,Wesley,While the last thing I wish to do
2413.68,2416.48,Wesley,is model bad behavior...
2416.55,2419.18,Wesley,"in front of impressionable youth,"
2419.26,2421.75,Wesley,I wonder if asking
2419.26,2421.75,Wesley,Miss Chase to dance...
2421.83,2425.49,Giles,"For God's sake, man, she's 18."
2425.56,2428.33,Giles,And you have the emotional maturity
2425.56,2428.33,Giles,of a blueberry scone.
2429.67,2433.16,Giles,"Just have at it, would you?"
2429.67,2433.16,Giles,And stop fluttering about.
2434.24,2435.83,Wesley,"Right, then."
2437.51,2439.1,Wesley,Thanks for that.
2467.84,2469.43,Anya,This isn't bad.
2491.46,2493.39,Giles,"You did good work tonight, Buffy."
2494.96,2496.93,Buffy,And I got a little toy surprise.
2497,2498.13,Giles,Heh heh. Yes.
2498.2,2501.03,Giles,I had no idea that children...
2498.2,2501.03,Giles,en masse...
