195.02,197.58,Xander ,Uh... inbreeding?
197.66,200.12,Cordelia ,"So very funny. Any minute,"
197.66,200.12,Cordelia ,I'm sure to laugh.
200.19,204.15,Cordelia ,I just got off the phone
200.19,204.15,Cordelia ,with him. He could hardly
200.19,204.15,Cordelia ,"speak, he was so upset."
204.23,206.59,Cordelia ,He said that there was
204.23,206.59,Cordelia ,something about a fight...

223.42,225.11,Giles ,Buffy no longer
223.42,225.11,Giles ,needs a watcher.
225.18,227.91,Cordelia ,"Well, does he have"
225.18,227.91,Cordelia ,to leave the country?
227.99,231.42,Cordelia ,"I mean, you got fired,"
227.99,231.42,Cordelia ,and you still hang around
227.99,231.42,Cordelia ,like a big loser.
231.49,233.75,Cordelia ,Why can't he?
233.82,237.39,Xander ,Cordelia! We're trying
233.82,237.39,Xander ,to stop a massacre here.

245.94,248.96,Xander ,That's just such
245.94,248.96,Xander ,a Buffy thing to do.
250.34,251.48,Willow ,She's always
251.48,253.37,Xander ,thinking of herself.
265.02,266.85,Willow ,You're awake.
266.92,269.83,Angel ,You... You've been
266.92,269.83,Angel ,watching over me?
274.63,278.59,Angel ,
278.67,281.3,Willow ,"Well, we've been taking turns."
281.37,286.17,Angel ,I thought... I thought
281.37,286.17,Angel ,I'd never see you again.
289.05,291.81,Angel ,I can't leave you.
291.88,295.44,Angel ,I... I... I was wrong.

327.92,330.08,Oz ,Any change?
330.15,332.21,Willow ,He's delirious.
332.29,334.15,Willow ,He thought I was Buffy.
334.15,335.28,Oz ,"You, too, huh?"
335.36,338.09,Willow ,I hope she gets here soon.
338.16,340.65,Willow ,"She'd better, if..."
340.73,342.72,Oz ,Yeah.
343.7,345.64,Willow ,I feel so...
345.7,349.01,Willow ,I feel so guilty.
349.01,350.37,Oz ,Guilty?
350.44,353.6,Willow ,"Well, things are so terrible..."
353.68,355.84,Willow ,and everything's coming apart...
355.91,358.51,Oz ,and I'm just...
358.58,359.95,,"In some ways, it's"
359.95,361.92,Willow ,the best night of my life.
365.02,368.72,Willow ,The best?
365.02,368.72,Willow ,The best.
381.59,384.99,Willow ,I just checked on him
381.59,384.99,Willow ,just now. We're watching.
388.09,390.65,Oz ,Did you find Faith?
392.26,395.76,Willow ,You didn't...
392.26,395.76,Willow ,She's not here?
397.44,399.37,Buffy ,How is he?
399.44,401.63,Oz ,He comes in and out.
403.24,408.11,Oz ,I think the pain
403.24,408.11,Oz ,is less... now.
410.55,412.74,Buffy ,Would you guys...
412.82,415.45,Buffy ,I'd like to be alone with him.
415.52,417.58,Oz ,Of course.
421.33,424.19,Willow ,We'll try to find
421.33,424.19,Willow ,another cure.
424.26,426.25,Buffy ,Thanks.

444.32,446.25,Buffy ,it's you?
446.32,449.31,Buffy ,It's me.
452.02,455.05,Angel ,I didn't want to go
452.02,455.05,Angel ,without seeing you.
456.93,459.64,Buffy ,"Angel, I can cure you."
459.64,460.87,Angel ,It's okay.
462.87,463.96,Angel ,I'm ready.
463.96,467.03,Buffy ,"Angel, listen to me. Sit up."
471.61,476.38,Buffy ,You're gonna live.

495.3,497.3,Buffy ,It's the only way.
497.37,499.6,Buffy ,Get away.
499.67,501.32,Buffy ,It'll save you.
501.32,502.97,Angel ,It'll kill you.
503.04,506.84,Buffy ,"Maybe not, not if you"
503.04,506.84,Buffy ,don't take it all.
506.91,508.85,Angel ,You can't ask me to do this.
508.91,512.68,Buffy ,I won't let you die.
508.91,512.68,Buffy ,I can't.
512.75,515.88,Buffy ,"Angel, the blood of a slayer"

704.84,706.87,Angel ,"but the head trauma, it's..."
708.11,711.21,Angel ,"Well, it's simply too severe."
711.28,714.51,Angel ,"You know, it's a wonder she's"
711.28,714.51,Angel ,alive at all with the blood loss.
717.66,719.59,Angel ,"I'm sorry, sir."
719.66,721.72,Angel ,There's almost no chance...
721.79,724.19,Angel ,that she's ever going
721.79,724.19,Angel ,to regain consciousness.
741.45,743.44,Mayor ,It's your day.
746.25,748.45,Nurse ,We have another

836.94,841.04,Angel ,"No, it's okay, folks."

841.11,845.14,Angel ,"The show's not over,"

848.92,850.95,Angel ,All kinds of excitement.
853.06,855.05,Angel ,I'll be there.

866.97,868.4,Angel ,She's fine.
868.47,869.43,Angel ,She's asleep.
869.43,871.64,Oz ,"Well, you seem all right, too."

872.54,874.71,Xander ,What happened?
874.77,876.74,Willow ,"When we left her,"
874.77,876.74,Willow ,she was fine. Did Faith...
876.81,883.02,Angel ,Faith's out of the picture.
876.81,883.02,Angel ,Buffy put her in a coma.
881.08,886.21,Angel ,And?
881.08,886.21,Angel ,Buffy cured me.
886.29,887.52,Angel ,Made me...
887.52,889.48,Giles ,You fed off her.
891.59,892.51,Angel ,Yes.
892.51,894.58,Giles ,How much?
894.66,896.8,Angel ,She's going to be fine.
896.8,898.93,Willow ,She won't be a vampire?
899,901.06,Angel ,No. She didn't feed off me.
901.13,904.5,Xander ,"Well, it's just good to know"
901.13,904.5,Xander ,that when the chips are down
901.13,904.5,Xander ,and things look grim...
904.57,907.2,Xander ,you'll feed off the girl who
904.57,907.2,Xander ,loves you to save your own ass.
909.11,911.7,Giles ,"You better go, Angel."
909.11,911.7,Giles ,We'll watch over her.
911.78,912.79,Angel ,I don't want to...
912.79,914.14,Giles ,The sun will be up soon.
926.66,928.96,Xander ,"Gosh, I'm really gonna"

956.66,959.09,Faith ,And aren't these things...
959.16,962.13,Faith ,supposed to take care
959.16,962.13,Faith ,of themselves?
962.19,964.63,Buffy ,A higher power guiding us?
964.7,967.06,Faith ,I'm pretty sure
964.7,967.06,Faith ,that's not what I meant.
969.84,972.36,Buffy ,There's something
969.84,972.36,Buffy ,I'm supposed to be doing.
972.44,975.43,Faith ,"Oh, yeah. Miles to go."
976.61,979.37,Faith ,Little Miss Muffet

984.22,987.38,Faith ,It's my head.

995.49,997.43,Faith ,Scar tissue.
997.5,999.62,Faith ,It fades. It all fades.
1002.4,1004.37,Buffy ,You want to know the deal?
1005.57,1010.24,Buffy ,Human weakness.
1005.57,1010.24,Buffy ,It never goes away. Even his.
1012.28,1014.3,Buffy ,Is this your mind or mine?
1015.65,1018.34,Faith ,Beats me.
1020.22,1023.71,Faith ,Getting towards that time.
1023.79,1025.98,Buffy ,How are you gonna
1023.79,1025.98,Buffy ,fit all this stuff?
1026.06,1029.26,Faith ,Not gonna. It's yours.
1029.33,1031.85,Buffy ,"Oh, I can't use all of this."
1033.03,1035.02,Faith ,Just take what you need.
1037.67,1039.3,Faith ,You ready?
1109.14,1109.88,Willow ,Buffy!
1109.88,1111.47,Xander ,Are you okay?
1111.54,1113.57,Giles ,How do you feel?
1113.65,1115.34,Buffy ,Is Angel here?
1115.34,1116.91,Oz ,He had to go.
1115.34,1116.91,Oz ,It got kind of sunny.
1116.98,1120.32,Buffy ,Get him.
1116.98,1120.32,Buffy ,Get everyone.
1120.39,1121.49,Xander ,What exactly is up?
1121.49,1122.58,Giles ,"Buffy, are you sure"
1121.49,1122.58,Giles ,you're all right?
1123.66,1125.45,Buffy ,I'm ready.
1125.52,1127.92,Willow ,Ready for what?
1129.23,1131.22,Buffy ,War.
1156.42,1159.12,Buffy ,That's the basic plan.
1159.19,1161.25,Buffy ,"So, am I crazy?"
1161.33,1165.82,Willow ,"Well, ""crazy""is"
1161.33,1163.07,Willow ,such a strong word.
1163.07,1165.82,Giles ,"Let's not rule it out, though."
1165.9,1168.67,Buffy ,You don't think it can be done?
1168.67,1170.63,Giles ,"Uh, I didn't say that."
1168.67,1170.63,Giles ,"I might, but not yet."
1170.7,1174.16,Cordelia ,I personally don't think
1170.7,1174.16,Cordelia ,it's possible to come up
1170.7,1174.16,Cordelia ,with a crazier plan.
1174.24,1180.02,Oz ,We attack the mayor
1174.24,1180.02,Oz ,with hummus.
1178.08,1179.79,Cordelia ,I stand corrected.
1179.79,1181.6,Oz ,Just keeping things
1179.79,1181.6,Oz ,in perspective.
1181.68,1183.67,Cordelia ,Thank you.
1183.75,1185.74,Cordelia ,"My point, however is,"
1183.75,1185.74,Cordelia ,crazy or not...
1185.82,1187.79,Cordelia ,it's pretty much
1185.82,1187.79,Cordelia ,the only plan.
1187.85,1190.85,Cordelia ,"Besides, it's Buffy's,"
1187.85,1190.85,Cordelia ,and she's slaygal...
1190.92,1194.62,Xander ,"you know, little"
1190.92,1194.62,Xander ,"Miss LikesToFight, so..."
1194.69,1197.16,Xander ,I think there was
1194.69,1197.16,Xander ,a "yea" vote buried
1194.69,1197.16,Xander ,in there somewhere.
1197.23,1198.74,Xander ,I'm gonna need every
1198.74,1200.79,Buffy ,"single one of you on board,"
1198.74,1200.79,Buffy ,"especially you, Xander."
1200.87,1203.1,Buffy ,You're sort of
1200.87,1203.1,Buffy ,the key figure here.
1203.17,1205.5,Xander ,Key? Me?
1207.14,1210.11,Xander ,"Okay, pride, humility..."
1210.18,1213.61,Xander ,and here's
1210.18,1213.61,Xander ,the mindnumbing fear...
1210.18,1213.61,Xander ,what do I have to do?
1213.68,1216.61,Buffy ,Do you remember any of your
1213.68,1216.61,Buffy ,military training from when
1213.68,1216.61,Buffy ,you became soldier guy?
1216.68,1219.28,Xander ,Ooh! Rocket launcher?
1219.35,1220.19,Xander ,Rocket launcher
1220.19,1221.41,Buffy ,not gonna get it done.
1221.49,1224.15,Buffy ,"I mean, it took a volcano to kill"
1221.49,1224.15,Buffy ,one of these things last time.
1224.22,1229.13,Giles ,"Um, Buffy, uh,"
1224.22,1229.13,Giles ,all this is rather dependent...
1229.19,1232.63,Giles ,on your being able
1229.19,1232.63,Giles ,to control the mayor.
1232.7,1237.53,Buffy ,Faith told me to play
1232.7,1235.57,Buffy ,on his human weakness.
1235.57,1237.53,Willow ,Faith told you?
1237.6,1240.07,Willow ,Was that before or after
1237.6,1240.07,Willow ,you put her in a coma?
1240.14,1243.39,Buffy ,After.
1243.39,1245.02,Willow ,Oh.
1243.08,1244.99,Giles ,His weakness?
1244.99,1245.87,Buffy ,Right.
1245.94,1248.04,Giles ,Which is?
1248.11,1250.17,Buffy ,"You know, I do"
1248.11,1250.17,Buffy ,all this planning...
1250.25,1253.18,Buffy ,"I'm in charge here, even though"
1250.25,1253.18,Buffy ,I'm really not at my best...
1253.25,1258.02,Giles ,"Well, uh, let'slet's,"
1253.25,1258.02,Giles ,"um, let's think."
1258.09,1260.06,Oz ,"Well, Angel, you hung"
1258.09,1260.06,Oz ,with him the most.
1260.13,1262.18,Oz ,Was there something
1260.13,1262.18,Oz ,that he's... afraid of?
1262.26,1264.35,Angel ,"Well, he's not crazy"
1262.26,1264.35,Angel ,about germs.
1264.48,1268.11,Cordelia ,Of course. That's it!
1264.48,1268.11,Cordelia ,We'll attack him with germs!
1268.18,1270.78,Buffy ,"Great! We'll get him cornered,"
1268.18,1270.78,Buffy ,and then you can sneeze on him.
1270.85,1274.15,Cordelia ,"No! No, we'll get"
1270.85,1274.15,Cordelia ,a container of Ebola virus...
1274.22,1277.75,Cordelia ,"andand, uh... or it doesn't"
1274.22,1277.75,Cordelia ,even have to be real.
1277.83,1280.3,Cordelia ,We can just get a box
1277.83,1280.3,Cordelia ,that says "Ebola" on it...
1280.36,1282.73,Cordelia ,"and, um... chase him."
1285.3,1287.24,Cordelia ,With the box.
1287.3,1290.64,Xander ,I'm starting to lean towards
1287.3,1288.79,Xander ,the hummus offensive.
1288.79,1290.64,Oz ,He'll never see it coming.
1290.71,1293.97,Angel ,Faith.
1290.71,1293.97,Angel ,Faith?
1294.04,1296.27,Angel ,"At the hospital, he was"
1294.04,1296.27,Angel ,"grieving, seriously crazed..."
1296.35,1299.94,Angel ,"and not just in a homicidal,"
1296.35,1299.94,Angel ,I want to be a demon" way.
1300.02,1302.38,Buffy ,She's his weak link.
1302.45,1305.82,Buffy ,Faith. I can work that.
1305.89,1307.91,Wesley ,You haven't an enormous
1305.89,1307.91,Wesley ,amount of time.
1307.99,1310.39,Xander ,"Hey, it's Mr. StatesTheObvious."
1311.66,1313.63,Buffy ,The Council
1311.66,1313.63,Buffy ,is not welcome here.
1313.7,1315.69,Buffy ,I have no time for orders.
1315.77,1318.23,Buffy ,If I need someone
1315.77,1318.23,Buffy ,"to scream like a woman,"
1315.77,1318.23,Buffy ,I'll give you a call.
1318.3,1320.29,Wesley ,I'm not here
1318.3,1320.29,Wesley ,for the Council.
1321.4,1323.4,Wesley ,Just tell me how I can help.
1325.31,1329.44,Cordelia ,That is so classy.
1325.31,1329.44,Cordelia ,Isn't he just so classy?
1332.88,1334.65,Buffy ,It's a start.
1334.72,1336.88,Wesley ,So there is something
1334.72,1336.88,Wesley ,I can do?
1338.12,1340.09,Wesley ,Besides scream like a woman.
1340.32,1343.38,Buffy ,There's plenty.
1340.32,1343.38,Buffy ,There's chores for everyone.
1343.46,1344.93,Buffy ,"Okay, this is how it's..."
1344.93,1346.05,Wesley ,It's gonna lay out.
1346.13,1349.46,Mayor ,The transformation
1346.13,1349.46,Mayor ,should begin at exactly 3:28.
1349.53,1351.47,Mayor ,I'll just be
1349.53,1351.47,Mayor ,finishing my speech...
1351.53,1354.09,Mayor ,"You know, it's too bad you fellas"
1351.53,1354.09,Mayor ,are gonna have to miss that...
1354.17,1356.43,Mayor ,cause I think it speaks
1354.17,1356.43,Mayor ,to every one of us.
1356.51,1358.7,Mayor ,"I mean, heck, I've been working"
1356.51,1358.7,Mayor ,on it for a hundred years.
1358.78,1361.07,Mayor ,Better be good.
1361.07,1361.07,Wesley ,
1361.14,1363.08,Mayor ,"They'll try to run,"
1361.14,1363.08,Mayor ,of course...
1363.15,1366.27,Mayor ,and that's when I need
1363.15,1366.27,Mayor ,you boys in flanking position.
1366.35,1368.11,Vampire ,"But, sir, the sun."
1368.11,1369.48,Mayor ,Not a problem.
1369.55,1372.75,Wesley ,Darkness will follow.
1369.55,1372.75,Wesley ,The day becomes night."
1372.82,1374.01,Buffy ,An eclipse.
1374.01,1375.95,Wesley ,Standard procedure
1374.01,1375.95,Wesley ,for an ascension.
1376.03,1378.99,Angel ,That puts me
1376.03,1378.99,Angel ,back in the game.
1376.03,1378.99,Angel ,"Yeah, it does."
1379.06,1382,Buffy ,You and Xander are gonna
1379.06,1382,Buffy ,have to work together now.
1379.06,1382,Buffy ,Can you guys handle that?
1382.07,1384.62,Xander ,"I'm still key guy, right?"
1384.62,1385.23,Buffy ,Right.
1385.3,1388.86,Xander ,"Great. Then Angel, in his nonkey"
1385.3,1388.86,Xander ,"guy capacity, can work with me."
1388.94,1390.87,Angel ,What fun.
1388.94,1390.87,Angel ,"Hey, key guy's still talking."
1390.94,1393.43,Buffy ,That's good. Start bickering.
1390.94,1393.43,Buffy ,That's gonna work great for us.
1393.51,1395.5,Buffy ,You guys are like
1393.51,1395.5,Buffy ,little old ladies.
1396.61,1397.39,Buffy ,You'll come up

1398.82,1401.65,Mayor ,The important thing is
1398.82,1401.65,Mayor ,containment. I'll need to feed.
1401.72,1404.85,Mayor ,"It's crucial,"
1401.72,1404.85,Mayor ,"in the first few minutes,"
1401.72,1404.85,Mayor ,to sustain the change.
1404.92,1408.76,Mayor ,What does that mean? No snacking.
1404.92,1408.76,Mayor ,I see blood on your lips...
1408.83,1411.56,Mayor ,it's a visit to the woodshed
1408.83,1411.56,Mayor ,for you boys.
1411.63,1413.69,Mayor ,Kill. Don't feed.
1413.76,1415.7,Buffy ,So how are we
1413.76,1415.7,Buffy ,on volcano detail?
1415.77,1417.33,Oz ,I think we can work it out.
1417.33,1418.43,Willow ,Fun with chemistry.
1418.5,1420.77,Buffy ,Xander said he should be
1418.5,1420.77,Buffy ,able to get the materials.
1420.84,1422.69,Oz ,Who's gonna stoke it up?
1422.69,1424.07,Giles ,You feel up to it?
1424.14,1426.11,Giles ,I suppose it should be I.
1426.18,1428.11,Giles ,"Strangely fitting,"
1426.18,1428.11,Giles ,in a grotesque fashion.
1428.18,1430.11,Buffy ,"Okay, guys, start reaching out."
1430.18,1432.11,Buffy ,"Giles... weapons,"
1430.18,1432.11,Buffy ,"weapons, weapons."

1487.54,1489.8,Wesley ,I'll be going back to England.
1494.24,1496.23,Cordelia ,I know.
1497.65,1501.52,Wesley ,With Buffy no longer
1497.65,1501.52,Wesley ,working for the Council...
1501.58,1504.85,Wesley ,there's really no place
1501.58,1504.85,Wesley ,for me here.
1508.11,1510.97,Cordelia ,I guess not.
1513.98,1517.71,Wesley ,No... reason to stay.
1519.79,1522.72,Cordelia ,No.
1519.79,1522.72,Cordelia ,No.
1522.79,1527.12,Wesley ,No cause to hope that...

1622.19,1624.97,Oz ,"I sound pretty sure, don't I?"
1624.97,1625.45,Willow ,Yeah.
1625.52,1627.96,Oz ,"Well, then I must be sure."
1628.03,1631.89,Willow ,Is that just a comforting way
1628.03,1631.89,Willow ,of not answering the question?
1641.64,1644.58,Willow ,How long till graduation?
1644.64,1646.63,Oz ,Little while.
1652.98,1654.69,Angel ,You get what you needed?
1654.69,1655.54,Buffy ,"Yeah, I did."
1655.62,1657.59,Buffy ,This isn't gonna be enough.

1855.39,1859.69,Mayor ,"There's been achievement,"
1855.39,1859.69,Mayor ,"joy, good times..."
1861.53,1864.26,Mayor ,and there's been grief.
1864.33,1866.49,Mayor ,There's been loss.
1868.87,1875.02,Mayor ,Some people who should
1868.87,1875.02,Mayor ,be here today... aren't.
1876.11,1878.27,Mayor ,But we are.
1878.35,1880.34,Mayor ,Journey's end.
1880.42,1884.68,Mayor ,And what is a journey?
1880.42,1884.68,Mayor ,Is it just distance traveled?
1884.75,1887.15,Mayor ,Time spent? No.
1887.22,1890.78,Mayor ,It's what happens on the way.
1887.22,1890.78,Mayor ,It's the things that shape you.
1890.86,1895.3,Mayor ,"At the end of the journey,"
1890.86,1895.3,Mayor ,you're not the same.
1890.86,1895.3,Mayor ,Today is about change.
1895.36,1898.63,Mayor ,Graduation doesn't just mean
1895.36,1898.63,Mayor ,your circumstances change.
1898.7,1900.97,Mayor ,It means you do.
1898.7,1900.97,Mayor ,You ascend...
1901.04,1903.03,Mayor ,to a higher level.
1905.04,1908.31,Mayor ,Nothing will ever be the same.
1908.38,1910.37,Mayor ,Nothing.
1916.95,1919.08,Buffy ,
1923.33,1926.92,Then ,"And so, as we look back on..."
1932.33,1935.6,Then ,On the events that have
1932.33,1935.6,Then ,brought us to this day...
1936.71,1938.67,Buffy ,Come on.
1938.67,1939.9,Mayor ,We...
1941.18,1943.87,Mayor ,We must all...
1941.18,1943.87,Mayor ,
1948.52,1951.42,Mayor ,It has begun... my destiny.
1953.36,1955.62,Mayor ,It's a little sooner
1953.36,1955.62,Mayor ,than I expected.
1955.69,1958.96,Mayor ,I had this whole section
1955.69,1958.96,Mayor ,on civic pride...
1960.36,1963.49,Mayor ,but I guess we'll just
1960.36,1963.49,Mayor ,skip to the big finish.
1986.22,1989.21,Mayor ,
1995.8,1998.1,Mayor ,
2021.52,2023.22,Buffy ,Now!
2031.1,2033.07,Buffy ,Flame units!
2040.21,2042.7,Xander ,First wave!
2042.78,2044.68,Xander ,Fire!
2044.75,2046.98,,Go! Go! Go!
2055.12,2058.42,,This is... This is
2055.12,2058.42,,simply unacceptable.
2070.77,2071.74,Oz ,Xander!
2071.74,2072.71,Xander ,Bowmen!
2081.15,2082.85,Xander ,Fire!
2090.49,2092.09,Buffy ,Fall back!
2092.09,2092.89,Xander ,Fire!
2130.57,2134.16,Snyder ,This is not orderly.
2130.57,2134.16,Snyder ,This is not disciplined.
2134.24,2136.1,Mayor ,"You're on my campus, buddy..."
2136.17,2139.04,Snyder ,and when I say
2136.17,2139.04,Snyder ,"I want quiet, I mean..."
2142.41,2145.9,Buffy ,Fall back!
2142.41,2145.9,Buffy ,Get back!
2145.98,2146.44,Buffy ,Go.
2146.44,2147.97,Willow ,Good luck.
2148.98,2150.87,Buffy ,"Xander, take 'em down."
2153.02,2153.53,Xander ,"Everyone, handtohand!"
2153.61,2156.84,Xander ,Go! Go! Go!
2153.61,2156.84,Xander ,Move! Move!
2166.26,2168.66,One ,Get the kids!
2178.4,2180.39,One ,
2182.87,2182.87,One ,
2182.87,2186.21,Xander ,"Right flank, close that up!"
2186.28,2188.33,Xander ,Close!
2188.41,2191.17,Xander ,"Jason and Doug, you guys"
2188.41,2191.17,Xander ,are the right flank.
2202.06,2204.39,Wesley ,Get some help here?
2207.1,2209.06,V ,Hey!
2211.4,2214.1,V ,You remember this?
2214.17,2218.47,V ,I took it from Faith.
2214.17,2218.47,V ,Stuck it in her gut.
2220.24,2222.87,V ,Just slid in her
2220.24,2222.87,V ,like she was butter.
2224.78,2228.94,V ,You want to get it
2224.78,2228.94,V ,back from me... Dick?
2269.66,2271.49,Mayor ,"Well, gosh."
2294.98,2297.48,Mayor ,
2301.16,2303.62,Wesley ,If... If I could just
2301.16,2303.62,Wesley ,get something for the pain.
2303.69,2306.68,Wesley ,ItIt's rather a lot
2303.69,2306.68,Wesley ,"of pain, actually."
2306.76,2310.89,Wesley ,An aspirin? Anyone? Ohh.
2310.97,2313.7,Wesley ,Perhaps I could just
2310.97,2313.7,Wesley ,be knocked unconscious.
2313.77,2317.57,Xander ,Ohh. Ohh!
2323.88,2326.71,Xander ,"Got off pretty cheap, considering."
2326.71,2328.21,Buffy ,Seems like we did.
2337.29,2339.23,Xander ,He made it through the fight.
2341.83,2346.24,Xander ,Guess maybe he...
2341.83,2346.24,Xander ,he took off after.
2357.55,2359.78,Giles ,Good job.
2362.36,2366.09,Giles ,Are you all right?
2362.36,2366.09,Giles ,I'm a little tired.
2366.16,2369.72,Giles ,I should imagine so.
2366.16,2369.72,Giles ,It's quite a couple of days.
2369.8,2373.17,Buffy ,I haven't processed
2369.8,2373.17,Buffy ,everything yet.
2373.24,2376.9,Buffy ,My brain isn't really
2373.24,2376.9,Buffy ,functioning on the higher levels.
2376.97,2379.91,Buffy ,"It's pretty much,"
2376.97,2379.91,Buffy ,"fire bad, tree pretty."""
2379.98,2381.91,Giles ,Understandable.
2381.98,2385.44,Giles ,"Well, when it's working"
2381.98,2385.44,Giles ,"again, congratulate it"
2381.98,2385.44,Giles ,on a good campaign.
2385.51,2387.68,Giles ,You did very well.
2387.68,2389.85,Buffy ,Thank you. I will.
2389.92,2393.01,Giles ,"I, uh, I ferreted this"
2389.92,2393.01,Giles ,out of the wreckage.
2393.09,2395.22,Giles ,"It may not interest you,"
2393.09,2395.22,Giles ,"but, uh..."
2397.23,2399.22,Giles ,I'd say you earned it.
2406.34,2408.3,Giles ,"There's a certain, um..."
2408.37,2411.74,Giles ,dramatic irony
2408.37,2411.74,Giles ,attached to all this...
2411.81,2417.04,Giles ,synchronicity that borders on
2411.81,2417.04,Giles ,"predestination, one might say."
2417.11,2419.51,Cordelia ,Fire bad. Tree pretty.
2419.58,2421.55,Cordelia ,"Oh, yes. Sorry."
2421.62,2423.55,Cordelia ,I'll go and attend to Wesley.
2423.62,2426.25,Giles ,"See if he's still,"
2423.62,2426.25,Giles ,"um, whimpering."
2501.5,2505.76,Cordelia ,"Well, that was"
2501.5,2505.76,Cordelia ,the most fun you can have
2501.5,2505.76,Cordelia ,without having any fun.
2505.84,2509.2,Willow ,What about the part where
2505.84,2509.2,Willow ,we kicked some demon ass?
2509.27,2510.53,Willow ,I didn't hate that.
2510.53,2511.26,Xander ,"Hear, hear."
2512.54,2514.98,Buffy ,You guys want to take off?
2515.04,2519.67,Buffy ,I think we've pretty much
2515.04,2518.17,Buffy ,done everything we can.
2518.17,2519.67,Cordelia ,I'm for it.
2519.75,2521.91,Buffy ,Are you okay?
2525.62,2528.28,Buffy ,Yeah. I'm okay.
2529.49,2532.55,Buffy ,I could use
2529.49,2532,Buffy ,"a little sleep, though."
2532,2532.55,Willow ,Yeah.
2532.63,2537.57,Buffy ,If someone could just wake me
2532.63,2537.57,Buffy ,"when it's time to go college,"
2532.63,2537.57,Buffy ,that'd be great.
2537.63,2540.63,Oz ,"Guys, take a moment"
2537.63,2540.63,Oz ,to deal with this.
2540.7,2542.97,Oz ,We survived.
2545.27,2547.04,Buffy ,It was a hell of a battle.
2547.11,2549.54,,Not the battle.
2550.78,2553.04,,High school.
2556.75,2558.74,,We're taking a moment.
2560.72,2563.21,,And we're done.
2568.7,2570.69,,Why do demons
2568.7,2570.69,,even come here?
