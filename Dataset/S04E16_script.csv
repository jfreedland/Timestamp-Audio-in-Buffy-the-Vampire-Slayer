2.21,4.17,Engleman,The project. It escaped.
4.25,6.05,Narrator/Giles,Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
6.13,9.33,Buffy,The Initiative created this.
6.13,9.33,Buffy,"They can't stop it, but we will."
9.41,11.37,Buffy,It's Faith. She's awake.
13.69,14.85,Joyce,Are you all right?
14.85,15.68,Faith,Five by five.
15.77,17.92,Mayor,Open the box. Surprise!
19.61,22.23,Joyce,You sure you're OK?
22.23,24.02,Buffy,Five by five.
28.73,32.61,Plainclothes officer,We've been looking for this girl
28.73,32.61,Plainclothes officer,since she broke out of hospital.
32.69,33.86,Joyce,What'll happen to her?
33.86,35.25,Plainclothes officer,We'll get her checked out.
35.33,40.41,Joyce,"If she's stable, she goes to jail, pending trial."
35.33,40.41,Joyce,I just hope she gets some kind of help.
40.49,46.02,Plainclothes officer,The first thing is to keep her
40.49,46.02,Plainclothes officer,from hurting anybody else.

55.53,57.43,Faith,You'll be safe now. We may have
57.43,59.69,Plainclothes officer,a couple of questions in the morning.
59.77,60.66,Joyce,Of course.
60.66,62.08,Plainclothes officer,"Thank you, both."
62.17,64.46,Plainclothes officer,I'm glad we finally got the kid.
64.46,65.61,Buffy,She's not a kid.
65.69,68.14,Buffy,I just mean that she's very strong.
68.14,68.49,Plainclothes officer,Yeah.
68.69,71.49,Plainclothes officer,This Faith chick? Definitely dangerous.
81.17,83.16,Buffy,She truly is.
142.33,144.61,Joyce,Faith.
145.53,147.92,Joyce,Why do you think she's like that?
150.17,153.17,Buffy [shrugs],"Well, you know. She's a nutjob."
153.65,157.61,Joyce,I don't understand what could drive
153.65,157.61,Joyce,a person to that kind of behaviour.
158.73,160.77,Buffy,How do you know she got drove?
160.85,164.69,Joyce,"I mean, maybe she likes being that way."
160.85,164.69,Joyce,I'll never believe that.
164.89,166.96,Joyce,I think she's horribly unhappy.
168.81,173.02,Buffy,"Well, could be things are lookin' up."
171.09,174.56,Buffy,"A little stint in the poky,"
171.09,174.56,Buffy,show her the error of her ways.
174.65,179.25,Buffy,I'm sure there's some big old bertha waitin'
174.65,179.25,Buffy,to shower her ripe little self with affection.
179.41,181.21,Joyce,Buffy.
182.89,185.12,Buffy,"I'm sorry, Mom."
185.21,186.81,Buffy,It's just
186.89,190.57,Buffy,when I think about
186.89,190.57,Buffy,"how she might've hurt you, I just..."
191.53,193.33,Buffy,I can't stand it.
199.25,200.85,Joyce,Sorry.
200.93,203.93,Buffy,"No, I'm just sore from the fight."
205.05,206.24,Joyce,I've missed you.
206.24,209.21,Buffy,"Cos I haven't visited, right? I knew it."
209.29,212.44,Joyce,I know how it is.
209.29,212.44,Joyce,You've got so much in your life now.
213.01,218.67,Buffy,I'm a busy little beaver. College and all.
218.67,220.02,Joyce,Of course.
218.09,221.88,Joyce,But maybe we could
218.09,221.88,Joyce,spend some time together soon?
222.85,225.65,Faith,Some night when I'm not being
225.65,229.02,Willow,held hostage by a raving psychotic.
229.57,230.8,Buffy,Count on it.
233.01,237.02,,I'm gonna take a bath.
270.05,273.84,,"Why, yes, I would be Buffy. May I help you?"
275.01,276.97,,Buffy.
279.45,282.13,,You can't do that. It's wrong.
282.65,286.25,,You can't do that because it's naughty.
287.33,289.37,,Because it's wrong.
289.45,291.73,,Because it's wrong.
292.73,297.2,,You can't do that. It's wrong.
292.73,297.2,,I'll kick your ass. I'm gonna kill you.
300.89,303.41,,Let me go!
300.89,303.41,,"Get me a sedative, now!"
303.49,306.05,,Hold her.
303.49,306.05,,I have to go home. She's with my mother!
306.13,308.28,,No!
306.13,308.28,,Just lie still.
308.37,310.81,,You don't understand.
308.37,310.81,,Keep holding her.
310.89,313.69,,She's taken my body.
316.65,319.65,,I wonder where she is.
316.65,319.65,,"Who, Faith?"
320.25,322.24,,Yeah.
322.33,327.45,,I wish she would make a move.
322.33,327.45,,She's making my stomach all acidy.
327.53,329.68,,But you think Buffy can handle her?
331.53,333.49,,I think so.
334.61,338.29,,But that doesn't mean
334.61,338.29,,Faith won't hurt someone else.
339.01,342.24,,"Well, you should be safe."
339.01,342.24,,Nobody knows you're here.
342.33,345.37,,"I mean, they don't even know I exist, right?"
346.49,349.29,,"I know all about them, but..."
351.25,355.49,,"I mean, that's totally cool."
351.25,355.49,,"I mean, it's good. It's better."
355.57,359.77,,"Tara, it's not like I don't want"
355.57,359.77,,my friends to know you. It's just...
361.41,365.2,,"Well, Buffy's, like, my best friend"
361.41,365.2,,and she's really special.
365.65,370.89,,And there's this whole bunch of us
365.65,370.89,,and we sort of have this group thing
370.97,373.12,,that revolves around the slaying.
373.21,375.85,,And I really want you to meet them.
376.33,384.21,,But I just kinda like having something
376.33,384.21,,"that's just, you know, mine."
388.29,392.05,,And I usually don't use so many words
388.29,392.05,,"to say stuff that little,"
392.13,394.73,,but do you get it at all?
397.25,399.24,,I do.
403.77,407.56,,"I should check in with Giles,"
403.77,407.56,,get a situation update.
408.73,411.09,,"I am, you know."
411.17,412.97,,What?
413.93,415.89,,Yours.
430.09,432.08,,Not too bad.
440.73,442.53,,Score.
444.05,447.44,,"six, four, four, seven."
448.25,450.64,,"Expiration, 5/01."
453.81,455.8,,Yeah.
456.81,459.41,,am's your earliest flight? I'll take it.
463.25,465.24,,What are you doing?
466.17,468.77,Buffy,Just getting my mail.
468.85,473.09,Joyce,That was Giles on the other line.
468.85,473.09,Joyce,He wanted you to meet your friends there.
473.17,475.16,Joyce,Said he had news.
476.65,479.33,Buffy,Yeah. I got some time to kill.
480.37,485.02,Buffy,I'll go see the gang. All my friends.
483.09,485.79,Buffy,You don't mind if I steal this?
485.79,487.45,Joyce,Is that the Harlot?
487.53,487.92,Buffy,Yeah.
487.92,490.53,Joyce,That's the same one Faith picked.
492.01,496.02,Buffy,Burn it.
503.41,506.61,Policeman,She's coming to.
503.41,506.61,Policeman,"Man, I want this kid's constitution."
508.09,509.85,Faith,Faith.
509.93,512.4,Policeman,Move it. I wanna get her in before she's 100Â°%.
528.17,532.53,Weatherby,"By order of the Watcher's Council, you are"
528.17,532.53,Weatherby,being taken into custody until such time...
532.61,534.6,Collins,Skip the speech.
541.41,542.81,Collins,Let's go.
550.69,552.68,Giles,Buffy. Good.
553.77,555.6,Buffy,The Scooby gang's all here.
555.69,558.13,Giles,"Willow, Xander and..."
559.05,560.65,Buffy,everybody.
560.73,563.41,Giles,What's up?
560.73,563.41,Giles,"It's about Faith, not surprisingly."
563.49,566.41,Buffy,Didn't Joyce tell you?
563.49,566.41,Buffy,I already kicked that ass.
566.49,568.27,Xander,I feel a highfive comin' on.
568.27,569.09,Willow,Where is she?
569.17,572.53,Buffy,On her way to the big house.
569.17,572.53,Buffy,Cops took her off my hands an hour ago.
572.97,574.96,Buffy,Poetic justice.
575.05,577.12,Anya,How's that?
577.21,580.49,Buffy,"Well, she did all those crimes"
577.21,580.49,Buffy,and now she's being arrested.
583.01,584.96,Giles,I guess that's just regularjustice.
584.96,585.97,Buffy,"It's cool, anyway."
586.05,590.05,Giles,"Unless I'm mistaken,"
586.05,590.05,Giles,Faith is no longer in police custody.
591.93,593.76,Buffy [stands],What are you talking about?
593.85,598.48,Giles,The Watcher's Council.
593.85,598.48,Giles,They sent a retrieval team to capture Faith.
599.49,602.8,Buffy,"Well, yeah, cos it worked"
599.49,602.8,Buffy,so well when Wesley tried it.
603.57,608.73,Giles,This is a special operations unit.
603.57,608.73,Giles,They handle the Council's trickierjobs:
608.81,611.22,Giles,"smuggling, interrogation, wet works."
611.22,612.36,Willow,What's wet works?
612.45,613.59,Xander,Scubatype stuff.
613.59,615.29,Anya,I thought it was murder.
616.25,620.29,Xander,"Well, yeah. But there could be"
616.25,620.29,Xander,"underwater murder, with snorkels."
620.37,622.4,Buffy,So they're taking her to England?
622.4,625.24,Giles,"It'll be a long, long time before she returns."
630.89,633.69,Giles,I'm sorry. It's just...
634.29,636.22,Buffy,I'm happy. Faith is evil.
636.22,639.32,Willow,Yeah. I hope they throw the book at her.
639.41,642,Giles,I'm not sure there is a book for this.
642,644.04,Willow,They could throw other things.
644.13,646.61,Buffy,I forgot how much you don't like Faith.
646.61,648.45,Willow,After what she's done to you?
648.53,652.89,Buffy,I wish those council guys would let me
648.53,652.89,Buffy,have an hour alone in the room with her.
653.33,655.77,Buffy,If I was larger and had grenades.
656.05,658.49,Buffy,I bet I know what Faith would say to that.
662.49,667.45,Anya,So you're saying everything's fine?
667.45,668.02,Giles,Yes.
666.09,670.64,Anya,I'm glad you called us here because that
666.09,670.64,Anya,information can never be conveyed by phone.
670.73,671.29,Willow [to Buffy],What's up?
671.29,673.53,Giles,I just thought it was best to convene...
673.61,676.57,Buffy [to Willow],I'd never let her hurt you.
676.65,677.27,Willow [to Buffy],I know.
677.27,679.49,Giles,"But if you're keen to go,"
679.57,681.18,Giles,"please, by all means, go."
681.18,683.81,Xander,We kinda have a romantic evening planned.
683.89,687.28,Anya,We were gonna light a bunch of candles
683.89,687.28,Anya,and have sex near them.
687.37,690.22,Buffy,We don't wanna cut into that seven minutes.
690.22,690.49,Anya,Hey.
690.57,693.04,Xander,I believe that's my "hey". Hey!
694.21,697.21,Buffy,Lighten up. We're outta danger.
697.61,698.73,Buffy,Everything's good.
698.73,700.92,Giles,We still have Adam to take care of.
701.01,703.21,Buffy,Yeah.
703.29,704.89,Giles,Adam.
704.97,706.89,Buffy,What's up with him?
706.89,708.41,Giles,I wish we knew.
708.61,713.05,Buffy,"Well, don't worry about it."
708.61,713.05,Buffy,I'll patrol tonight as long as it takes.
713.13,716.41,Buffy,You guys have your fun.
713.13,716.41,Buffy,I'll be out there doing my job.
738.01,739.81,Spike,You.
739.89,741.49,Buffy,And you.
741.81,743.8,Spike,What? Are you keepin' tabs on me?
743.8,745.85,Buffy,You gonna give me a hard time now?
746.97,750.39,Buffy,Do I usually give you a hard time?
750.39,751.49,Spike,Very funny.
752.61,755.37,Spike,"Well, you don't have to worry"
752.61,755.37,Spike,about me drinking.
755.45,758.37,Spike,Unless you're here to protect innocent beers.
761.85,764.85,Buffy,You're a vampire.
764.85,765.56,Spike,Was.
765.93,770.13,Spike,And as soon as I get this chip
765.93,770.13,Spike,"out of my head, I'll be a vampire again."
770.21,775.29,Spike,But until then I'm just as helpless as
770.21,775.29,Spike,"a kitten up a tree, so why don't you sod off?"
775.37,777.41,Buffy,OK.
777.49,779.64,Spike [angry],Fine. Throw it in my face.
779.73,783.28,Spike [angry],"Spike's not a threat any more,"
779.73,783.28,Spike [angry],I'll turn my back. He can't hurt me.
783.37,785.17,Spike [angry],Spike?
786.37,788.17,Spike [angry],Spike.
788.93,792.77,Buffy,William the Bloody with a chip in his head.
788.93,792.77,Buffy,I kinda love this town.
792.85,797.8,Spike,God. You know why
792.85,797.8,Spike,"I really hate you, Summers?"
797.89,801.28,Buffy,Cos I'm a stuckup tightass
797.89,801.28,Buffy,with no sense of fun?
801.37,804.84,Spike,"Well, yeah. That covers a lot of it."
804.93,810.49,Buffy,Cos I could do anything and instead I choose
804.93,810.49,Buffy,to pout and feel the burden of slayerness?
810.57,813.93,Buffy,"I mean, I could be rich. I could be famous."
814.01,818.02,Buffy,I could have anything.
817.29,819.09,Buffy,Anyone.
822.29,824.52,Spike,"Even you, Spike."
824.61,828.61,Spike,I could ride you at a gallop until
824.61,828.61,Spike,your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up.
829.01,831.53,Spike,I've got muscles
829.01,831.53,Spike,you've never even dreamed of.
831.61,834.97,Spike,I could squeeze you
831.61,834.97,Spike,until you popped like warm champagne
835.05,838.17,Spike,and you'd beg me
835.05,838.17,Spike,to hurt you just a little bit more.
838.25,840.85,Spike,And you know why I don't?
846.09,848.29,Spike,Because it's wrong.
853.93,858.37,Spike,"I get this chip out, you and me"
853.93,858.37,Spike,are gonna have a confrontation.
858.89,863.02,Buffy,Count on it.
870.77,876.25,Vampire,It's too crowded. We gotta hold out for
870.77,876.25,Vampire,"a few hours, pick up a straggler. Some drunk."
876.33,878.4,Vampire,Can't be calling attention to...
879.01,880.1,Vampire,ourselves.
880.1,882.16,Adam,I've been thinking.
883.57,885.69,Adam,About vampires.
886.13,889.52,Vampire,This is my place.
886.13,889.52,Vampire,Your place.
889.61,891.6,Adam,Yes. The sewers.
893.13,896.73,Adam,"You hide from them, crawl about in their filth,"
896.81,898.8,Vampire,scavenging like rats.
899.57,901.56,Vampire,What do you fear?
902.29,904.89,Vampire,Kill this guy already.
907.69,911.61,Adam,"You fear the cross, the sun, fire,"
912.69,914.68,Adam,"and, oh, yes..."
919.93,922.56,Adam,I believe decapitation is a problem as well.
922.56,923.93,Vampire,You can have the place.
924.01,926.69,Vampire,We don't have to stay here any more.
926.69,927.8,Adam,You fear death.
927.89,932.13,Adam,"Being immortal, you fear it more"
927.89,932.13,Adam,than those to whom it comes naturally.
933.81,936.2,Adam,Vampires are a paradox.
936.29,939.76,Vampire,OK. We're a paradox. That's cool.
940.09,941.89,Adam,Demon in a human body.
942.33,945.33,Adam,You walk in both worlds
942.33,945.33,Adam,and belong to neither.
947.53,949.52,Weatherby,I can relate.
950.69,953.33,Adam,Come. We have a lot to talk about.
961.17,963.16,Weatherby,"Well, it's awake."
964.73,966.19,Faith,Who are you?
966.19,967.17,Weatherby,Council.
967.25,970.2,Weatherby,We're taking you back to the mother country.
970.2,972.41,Faith,Seems you've been a naughty girl.
973.49,976.37,Faith,Listen to me. You've made a mistake.
976.57,978.69,Faith,I am not Faith.
980.05,982.32,Faith,I'm Buffy Summers. Faith performed
982.32,985.25,Collins,some kind of spell. She switched our bodies.
985.33,988.72,Collins,Congratulations. No one's
985.33,988.72,Collins,ever tried that one on me before.
989.17,991.29,Faith,You have to find Faith.
991.37,994.17,Faith,Call Giles. Just get him here.
994.61,999.81,Collins,Giles doesn't work for the Council any more.
994.61,999.81,Collins,"For that matter, neither does Buffy Summers."
999.89,1003.73,Collins,"And what you are, miss, is the package."
999.89,1003.73,Collins,I deliver the package.
1003.85,1005.84,Collins,I don't much care what's inside.
1007.13,1009.12,Collins,Come on.
1010.13,1012.93,Weatherby,"He may not care, but I do."
1013.29,1016.29,Weatherby,The Watcher's Council
1013.29,1016.29,Weatherby,used to mean something.
1016.37,1018.17,Weatherby,You perverted it.
1018.77,1022.13,Weatherby,You're trash. We should have
1018.77,1022.13,Weatherby,killed you while you were asleep.
1037.53,1042.53,Willow,I can't believe you've never been here.
1037.53,1042.53,Willow,The Bronze is the coolest place in Sunnydale.
1042.61,1045.29,Willow,"Of course, there's not a lot of competition."
1045.37,1046.97,Willow,I think the vending machine
1046.97,1048.57,Tara,at Bergen's came in second.
1048.65,1050.6,Tara,You used to come here a lot?
1050.6,1051.57,Willow,We lived here.
1051.65,1053.56,Willow,"Me, Xander,"
1053.65,1055.45,Willow,Buffy?
1059.05,1062.09,Willow,Wow. I didn't think she'd be here.
1064.01,1068.02,Willow,"Come on, I want you to meet her."
1066.09,1069.48,Buffy,Back off.
1066.09,1069.48,Buffy,You're nothing but a disappointment.
1070.81,1072.46,Willow,"Hey, Buffy."
1072.46,1074.41,Buffy,Willow and...
1074.49,1076.15,Willow,"Buffy, this is Tara."
1076.15,1076.4,Tara,Hi.
1077.69,1079.68,Buffy,So we've never met?
1080.37,1083.29,Willow,Cool. Just having a thing with names.
1083.69,1086.16,Willow,Tara was in my Wicca group.
1088.37,1092.25,Willow,"So, what's up? Patrol a nogo?"
1092.65,1096.49,Buffy,"Got tired. You know, the whole Faith thing."
1092.65,1096.49,Buffy,I let off some steam.
1096.57,1099.96,Willow,Good for you.
1096.57,1099.96,Willow,You shouldn't work yourself too hard.
1100.73,1102.8,Buffy,That's my philosophy.
1103.93,1105.92,Willow,Anyone want a soda?
1106.01,1110.02,Tara [looks at Willow],Water.
1120.09,1122.69,Buffy,"So, you guys been hanging out a lot lately?"
1123.37,1126.05,Tara,Yeah. She's... she's really cool.
1129.25,1131.97,Buffy [grins],So Willow's not driving stick any more.
1132.05,1133.93,Buffy [grins],Who would have thought?
1134.01,1138.61,Buffy [grins],I guess you never really know someone
1134.01,1138.61,Buffy [grins],until you've been inside their skin.
1138.69,1141.77,Buffy [grins],And Oz is out of the picture?
1141.85,1144.65,Buffy [grins],I've never seen two people so much in love.
1144.73,1150.02,Buffy [grins],She just couldn't get enough of old Oz.
1148.09,1151.72,Tara,She said he www...
1152.21,1155.68,Buffy,Wwwhat? You gonna get
1152.21,1155.68,Buffy,that sentence out some time tonight?
1158.89,1160.88,Willow,"Buffy, guy in the corner."
1163.49,1165.45,Buffy,Yeah. Good call.
1165.53,1166.44,Tara,What?
1166.44,1167.89,Willow,Vampire.
1170.53,1172.41,Buffy,It's wicked obvious.
1176.29,1178.41,Buffy,So I should slay him.
1178.65,1179.65,Willow,You want help?
1179.65,1180.64,Buffy,"Nah, I got it."
1208.97,1210.96,Buffy,You'll live.
1211.69,1213.24,Girl,He was so strong.
1213.24,1215.61,Buffy,"Yeah, well, he's gone now."
1218.85,1220.84,Girl,Thank you.
1222.41,1224.61,Girl,Thank you.
1226.93,1228.92,Buffy,Yeah. It's cool.
1237.85,1239.68,Willow,Everything poofed?
1239.77,1242.21,Buffy,All is well in the world.
1242.29,1245.33,Willow,Tara's not feeling well.
1242.29,1245.33,Willow,I'm gonna walk her home.
1246.69,1249.89,Buffy,Yeah. You give her whatever she needs.
1249.97,1253.57,Willow,"Are you gonna be in later,"
1249.97,1253.57,Willow,or are you going over to Riley's?
1265.65,1267.64,Smith,This'll bloody keep you quiet.
1275.13,1278.49,Faith,How about this?
1275.13,1278.49,Faith,I'll be quiet and you can scream.
1280.57,1286.09,Faith,"Now, you unchain me very slowly"
1280.57,1286.09,Faith,"and politely, or I kill this guy."
1286.89,1292.81,Collins,When we go on ajob we always put
1286.89,1292.81,Collins,"our affairs in order first, in case of accident."
1295.45,1296.17,Smith,Collins!
1296.17,1297.44,Collins,"Sorry, Smithy."
1300.93,1302.63,Collins,She's starting to bother me.
1302.63,1305.29,Weatherby,Getting her across the border'll be trouble.
1305.37,1308.89,Collins,If the Council can even get us passage.
1305.37,1308.89,Collins,I'll call 'em.
1308.97,1311.44,Collins,It's time for a contingency plan.
1327.73,1329.72,Buffy,"Hi, baby."
1337.25,1339.64,Willow,I'm sorry you're feeling all bleghy.
1340.45,1345.65,Willow,But we'll get together with Buffy another
1340.45,1345.65,Willow,time soon. I think you'll really like her.
1347.93,1349.92,Tara,She's not your friend.
1350.01,1355.02,Willow,I may have overestimated
1350.01,1355.02,Willow,the "you liking her" factor.
1353.09,1355.08,Tara,"No, no. I mean, I don't..."
1356.01,1359.21,Tara,I don't think she's her.
1360.17,1361.49,Willow,You lost me.
1361.49,1366.33,Tara,"Well, a person's energy has a flow, a unity."
1367.77,1370.89,Willow,Buffy's was fragmented.
1370.97,1373.24,Willow,It grated like something forced in
1373.24,1374.85,Tara,where it doesn't belong.
1374.93,1378.32,Tara,"Plus, she was kind of mean."
1379.13,1384.05,Willow,So you think Buffy's not herself?
1379.13,1384.05,Willow,Like she's been possessed or something?
1385.17,1385.95,Tara,I'm not sure.
1385.95,1388.4,Willow,"You didn't sense a hyena energy, did you?"
1388.49,1391.69,Willow,Because hyena possession
1388.49,1391.69,Willow,is just unpleasant.
1393.65,1396.11,Tara,Do you have anything of hers?
1396.11,1397.04,Willow,Of Buffy's?
1398.37,1400.6,Willow,This ring.
1400.69,1403.08,Tara,I think there's a way we can...
1407.73,1410.2,Tara,The passage to the Nether Realm.
1410.29,1414.37,Tara,"There's a ritual. If you can find Buffy there,"
1410.29,1414.37,Tara,you should be able to see.
1415.01,1419.02,Willow,If it'll help her.
1419.53,1421.33,Willow,What?
1421.41,1424.09,Tara,The Nether Realm exists
1421.41,1424.09,Tara,beyond the physical world.
1424.17,1429.37,Tara,Accessing it is kind of like
1424.17,1429.37,Tara,astral projection. It's very intense.
1430.61,1433.53,Tara,"I'd have to be your anchor,"
1430.61,1433.53,Tara,keep you on this plane.
1434.41,1435.13,Willow [nods],I trust you.
1435.13,1437.61,Tara,It's not like anything that we've ever...
1437.69,1439.68,Willow [smiles],I trust you.
1442.13,1444.33,Buffy,You miss me?
1444.89,1448.2,Riley,"I did, actually. Everything's OK?"
1449.93,1451.76,Buffy,Everything's great.
1451.85,1453.11,Riley,What about Faith?
1453.11,1456.09,Buffy,Faith has won a fabulous trip to England
1456.17,1462.02,Riley,"and I got the consolation prize, which is you."
1461.65,1464.57,Riley,So I don't have to worry
1461.65,1464.57,Riley,about Faith showing up?
1464.65,1468.04,Riley,"Though I have to admit,"
1464.65,1468.04,Riley,I was kind of curious to meet her.
1469.41,1472.42,Riley,Or I was until about 30 seconds ago.
1472.42,1474.93,Buffy,You wouldn't have liked Faith.
1475.01,1477.89,Buffy,"She's not proper and joyless,"
1475.01,1477.89,Buffy,like a girl should be.
1478.29,1481.57,Buffy,She has a tendency
1478.29,1481.57,Buffy,to give in to her animal instincts.
1486.33,1488.79,Riley,Door's open.
1488.79,1489.41,Buffy,So?
1489.49,1495.02,Riley,So my fantasies don't include
1489.49,1495.02,Riley,a bunch of marines starin' at me.
1493.09,1495.56,Buffy,Maybe they could learn something.
1501.61,1502.76,Buffy,You're hurt?
1502.76,1504.97,Riley,"Not that bad, actually."
1505.05,1510.69,Riley,The drugs the professor gave me really did
1505.05,1510.69,Riley,make me stronger. I'm healin' pretty quick.
1510.77,1512.97,Buffy,Maybe we should take you for a test drive.
1515.09,1517.21,Riley,I wouldn't say no.
1518.17,1521.45,Buffy,"So, how do you want me?"
1523.25,1524.26,Riley,How do I...?
1524.26,1527.69,Buffy,Yeah. What d'you wanna do with this body?
1527.77,1530.4,Riley,What nasty little desire
1530.4,1534.02,Buffy,have you been itching to try out?
1532.09,1534.29,Riley,Am I a bad girl?
1534.37,1536.41,Buffy,D'you wanna hurt me?
1538.81,1543.02,Riley,What are we playin' at here?
1542.65,1544.64,Buffy,I'm Buffy.
1544.73,1546.72,Riley,OK. Then I'll be Riley.
1548.89,1551.31,Buffy,"Well, if you don't wanna play..."
1551.31,1553.28,Riley,Right. I don't wanna play.
1581.97,1584.17,Riley,The sightless sea
1584.25,1587.85,Riley,Ayala flows through the river in me
1587.93,1591.56,Riley,"The inward eye, the sightless sea"
1591.65,1595.28,Riley,Ayala flows through the river in me
1595.37,1598.6,Riley,"The inward eye, the sightless sea"
1598.69,1601.92,Riley,Ayala flows through the river in me
1659.17,1661.16,Riley,I love you.
1667.53,1669.44,Buffy,Get off.
1669.53,1670.93,Buffy,No.
1671.01,1673.08,Buffy,No. No. Get off.
1673.17,1675.05,Buffy,No. Off me.
1675.13,1676.04,Buffy,Get off.
1676.04,1676.73,Riley,Buffy?
1676.81,1678.8,Riley,No. No. Get...
1683.89,1685.88,Riley,"Buffy, what?"
1687.05,1689.52,Riley,What's wrong?
1689.61,1692.89,Buffy,Who are you? What do you want from her?
1695.89,1697.72,Riley,Should I not have...?
1697.81,1699.8,Buffy,This is meaningless.
1704.01,1708.02,Riley,You're shaking.
1712.21,1714.2,Riley,What happened?
1717.17,1718.97,Buffy,Nothing.
1723.09,1724.89,Buffy,Nothing.
1734.77,1737.16,Adam,"I have a gift no man has,"
1738.17,1740.69,Adam,no demon has ever had.
1741.25,1743.16,Adam,I know why I'm here.
1743.53,1745.52,Adam,I was created to kill.
1746.57,1749.29,Adam,To extinguish life wherever I find it.
1749.37,1751.73,Adam,And I have accepted that responsibility.
1752.49,1756.73,Adam,You have lived in fear and desperation
1752.49,1756.73,Adam,"because you didn't have that gift,"
1756.81,1761.02,Adam,but it's time to face your fear.
1761.01,1763.21,Vampire,Tell us what to do.
1764.41,1766.8,Adam,You are here to be my first.
1767.53,1769.73,Adam,To let them know that I am coming.
1771.01,1772.73,Vampire,We're ready.
1772.73,1777.02,Adam,Then ask yourself: what is it?
1775.85,1779.24,Adam,More than man. More than anything else.
1779.93,1782.37,Adam,What is the thing you fear?
1805.41,1807.61,Forrest,Hope you left him alive.
1809.49,1809.81,Buffy,What?
1809.81,1811.48,Forrest,Boy should be on the mend.
1811.57,1815.57,Buffy,I don't see you lettin' him get much rest.
1811.57,1815.57,Buffy,Stay out of other people's lives.
1815.65,1816.6,Forrest,We've got a mission.
1816.6,1818.37,Buffy,When Riley could think for himself...
1818.45,1822.33,Buffy,A mission? I've been fighting demons
1818.45,1822.33,Buffy,since before you could shave.
1822.57,1824.37,Forrest,"Yeah, you're a killer."
1824.89,1827.28,Buffy,I am not a killer.
1828.45,1830.52,Buffy,I am the Slayer.
1830.61,1832.74,Buffy,You don't know the first thing about me.
1832.74,1834.29,Forrest,You really care what I think?
1837.09,1839.13,Buffy,No.
1839.21,1841.2,Buffy,I don't care.
1842.53,1844.89,Buffy,"God, I don't care."
1853.61,1855.97,Collins,They can't get us passage.
1853.61,1855.97,Collins,They've ordered the kill.
1856.05,1857.19,Weatherby,Torch the place?
1857.19,1858.04,Collins,Get the gas.
1861.89,1864.49,Smith,She could've killed me. She didn't.
1865.33,1866.93,Collins,Lucky you.
1876.41,1878.21,Smith [running away],Weatherby!
1883.45,1884.89,Faith,"Keys, keys."
1885.53,1887.52,Weatherby,"Stop her, you ponce."
1895.21,1897.2,Faith,OK. I'm good at this.
1899.45,1900.85,Faith,Drive.
1922.17,1924.37,Woman,"OK, there you go."
1924.45,1925.25,Buffy,Thank you.
1925.25,1926.44,Woman,You're welcome.
1932.57,1933.41,Faith,Giles!
1933.41,1933.97,Giles,God!
1934.05,1935.49,Faith,Don't move.
1935.73,1939.73,Faith,"OK, Giles, you have"
1935.73,1939.73,Faith,to listen to me very carefully.
1940.53,1941.65,Faith,I'm not Faith.
1941.65,1942.21,Giles,Really?
1942.29,1944.6,Giles,Really.
1942.29,1944.6,Giles,Cos the resemblance is striking.
1944.73,1948.61,Faith,"I know. Giles, you just have to..."
1944.73,1948.61,Faith,Stop inching. You were inching.
1948.97,1951.71,Giles,"Look, I know what you're going to say and..."
1951.71,1952.33,Faith,I'm Buffy.
1952.53,1955.84,Giles,"OK, I didn't know what you were"
1952.53,1955.84,Giles,"going to say, but you're still crazy."
1956.25,1960.69,Faith,"Faith switched. I mean, she had some device."
1956.25,1960.69,Faith,She switched our bodies.
1962.85,1965.05,Faith,"Giles, I swear."
1965.13,1966.77,Faith,It's me.
1969.25,1971.24,Giles,"If you are Buffy,"
1972.61,1976.77,Faith,"you'll let me tie you up, without killing me,"
1976.85,1979.81,Faith,until we find out
1976.85,1979.81,Faith,whether you're telling the truth.
1980.01,1984.29,Faith,"Giles, Faith has taken my body and, for"
1980.01,1984.29,Faith,"all I know, she's taken it to Mexico by now."
1984.37,1986.52,Faith,I don't have time for bondage fun.
1988.57,1991.37,Faith,Ask me a question. Ask me anything.
1992.25,1993.14,Giles,Who's President?
1993.14,1995.53,Faith,"We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion."
1996.13,1998.73,Giles,Yes. All right.
1996.13,1998.73,Giles,This is...
1998.81,2001.77,Faith,"Giles, you turned into a demon"
1998.81,2001.77,Faith,and I knew it was you.
2001.85,2004.03,Faith,Can't you just look in my eyes
2004.03,2005.56,Giles,and be all intuitive?
2006.21,2010.29,Giles,How did I turn into a demon?
2006.21,2010.29,Giles,Cos of Ethan Rayne.
2010.69,2012.73,Faith,And you have a girlfriend named Olivia.
2012.81,2017.73,Faith,And you haven't had ajob since we blew up
2012.81,2017.73,Faith,"the school, which is valid, lifestylewise."
2017.81,2020.93,Faith,"I mean, it's not like"
2017.81,2020.93,Faith,"you're a slacker type, but..."
2021.85,2028.02,Faith,When I had psychic power I heard Mom
2021.85,2028.02,Faith,think you were like a stevedore during sex.
2026.09,2027.41,Faith,Do you want me to continue?
2027.41,2028.77,Giles,"Actually, I beg you to stop."
2028.85,2030.15,Faith,What's a stevedore?
2030.15,2033.17,Giles,All right. I need you to explain everything.
2033.25,2035.56,Faith,"And I will, after we get Faith."
2035.65,2036.72,Willow,Giles!
2036.72,2037.61,Faith,Will.
2037.69,2038.37,Willow,"Oh, my God."
2038.37,2040.53,Faith,"Willow, wait. You don't understand."
2040.61,2044.29,Willow,You're Buffy. You and Faith
2040.61,2044.29,Willow,switched bodies through a Katra spell.
2044.45,2046.57,Giles [to himself],She understands it better than I do.
2046.65,2048.2,Faith,How did you...?
2048.2,2048.72,Willow,Tara.
2048.81,2052.48,Willow,"Tara, this is Buffy. Only really, this time."
2052.48,2052.73,Tara,Hi.
2052.81,2054.48,Willow,Tara's a powerful witch.
2054.48,2055.25,Tara,Not really.
2055.33,2057.93,Willow,"No, really. She knew"
2055.33,2057.93,Willow,right away you weren't you.
2058.25,2063.65,Willow,So we connected with the Nether Realms to
2058.25,2063.65,Willow,find out what happened and we conjured this.
2065.69,2066.82,Faith,What is...?
2066.82,2068.16,Willow,It's a Katra.
2068.25,2070.08,Willow,Or the homeconjured version.
2070.37,2074.73,Willow,"It should switch you back,"
2070.37,2074.73,Willow,if you can get ahold of Faith.
2075.29,2077.28,Faith,Thank God.
2078.41,2080.4,Giles,I'll get it.
2081.37,2081.78,Giles,Hello.
2081.78,2083.6,Faith,Do you know where Faith is?
2084.05,2087.93,Giles,"Yes. Buffy's here with me. Actually, she's..."
2088.49,2090.13,Giles,All right.
2090.21,2094.05,Giles,"Xander. Apparently,"
2090.21,2094.05,Giles,there's a report on the television.
2094.13,2097.92,News announcer,and barricaded themselves
2094.13,2097.92,News announcer,in the church with 20 parishioners.
2098.13,2104.05,News announcer,One of the few who escaped described
2098.13,2104.05,News announcer,"the three men as disfigured, almost inhuman."
2104.13,2107.49,News announcer,So far one escapee
2104.13,2107.49,News announcer,has since died of severe neck wounds.
2107.89,2114.02,News announcer,There is no report on the condition
2107.89,2114.02,News announcer,"of the parishioners still inside,"
2112.09,2117.77,News announcer,but their assailants have vowed to kill all
2112.09,2117.77,News announcer,of them if police attempt to storm the church.
2120.49,2122.48,Vampire,It's hard to believe.
2123.93,2128.17,Vampire,I've been avoiding this place
2123.93,2128.17,Vampire,for so many years and it's nothing.
2128.53,2130.6,Vampire,It's nice.
2130.69,2134.73,Vampire,"It's got the pretty windows, the pillars,"
2135.85,2137.65,Vampire,lots of folks to eat.
2139.53,2142.53,Vampire,Where's the thing I was so afraid of?
2143.37,2145.36,Vampire,"You know, the Lord?"
2146.41,2149.53,Vampire,He was supposed to be here.
2146.41,2149.53,Vampire,He gave us this address.
2151.61,2155.93,Vampire,"Well, we'll just have"
2151.61,2155.93,Vampire,to start killing off his people.
2156.01,2157.89,Vampire,See if he shows up.
2162.25,2163.49,Riley,What did he say?
2163.49,2166.45,Policeman,He said I should defer command to you.
2166.53,2169.68,Riley,Wait till the reserves arrive.
2166.53,2169.68,Riley,This is a military situation.
2169.77,2172.34,Policeman,"What, they got bombs in there?"
2172.34,2176.02,Riley,Your men aren't prepared to deal with them.
2182.01,2183.65,Riley,Buffy.
2183.73,2185.02,Buffy,How many are in there?
2185.02,2186.37,Riley,We think there's three.
2186.45,2187.6,Buffy,I can do three.
2187.6,2188.36,Riley,Not alone.
2188.45,2190.21,Riley,Wait for the troops to get here.
2190.21,2191.25,Buffy,They're mobilising.
2191.33,2192.98,Buffy,How did you respond so fast?
2192.98,2195.17,Riley,I didn't. I was just late for church.
2196.41,2199.41,Buffy,When the troops get here
2196.41,2199.41,Buffy,"send them in, but I'm going."
2199.49,2201.46,Riley,I don't want you risking...
2201.46,2203.28,Buffy,Don't tell me what to do.
2204.29,2207.73,Buffy,I'm Buffy. I have to do this.
2208.77,2210.76,Riley,Then I'm coming with.
2214.29,2216.28,Buffy,I can't use you.
2217.69,2220.3,Buffy,"Someone comes out, you get 'em to safety,"
2220.3,2221.89,Vampire,unless they've got fangs.
2232.45,2238.53,Vampire,"I told the cops, they send anyone in,"
2232.45,2238.53,Vampire,I start the whole massacre thing.
2239.97,2241.96,Buffy,"Well, I'm not the cops."
2242.05,2244.25,Buffy,I just come to pray.
2246.05,2248.04,Vampire,Now's a good time to start.
2249.69,2252.08,Buffy,You're not gonna kill these people.
2253.89,2255,Vampire,Why not?
2255,2257.65,Buffy,Because it's wrong.
2265.77,2267.57,Vampire,You're the Slayer.
2268.93,2271.05,Buffy,The one and only.
2279.29,2280.87,Policeman,"You people, get outta here."
2280.87,2282.21,Willow,We've gotta get inside.
2282.29,2285.61,Policeman,The police are handling this. Back off now.
2285.61,2288.32,Willow,But we can't. You don't understand.
2288.41,2289.92,Policeman,You have to clear the area.
2289.92,2291.93,Giles [yelling],"Damn it, man! We have to get inside!"
2292.01,2296.02,Vampire,Our...
2294.09,2299.17,Vampire,Our families are in there.
2294.09,2299.17,Vampire,"Our mothers, and tiny, tiny babies."
2300.13,2302.52,Vampire,You think we're afraid of you?
2303.49,2305.96,Vampire,We're not afraid of anything any more.
2306.05,2310.33,Buffy,"Then let all these people go,"
2306.05,2310.33,Buffy,and all three of you can take me on.
2310.41,2312.13,Vampire,I got a better idea.
2346.13,2347.9,Riley,Forgot your coat.
2347.9,2348.52,Faith,Riley.
2349.53,2351.97,Riley,"It's OK, miss. Get yourself out of harm's way."
2352.05,2354.36,Faith,"Riley, it's me."
2355.25,2358.1,Faith,Never mind. How many are in there?
2358.1,2358.69,Riley,Well...
2358.77,2359.76,Riley,Who are you?
2361.69,2364.25,Vampire,I have strength you couldn't dream of.
2365.25,2368.29,Vampire,Adam has shown me the way
2365.25,2368.29,Vampire,and there is nothing...
2390.21,2391.23,Faith,You can't win this.
2391.23,2393.33,Buffy,Shut up. D'you think I'm afraid of you?
2394.65,2396.45,Real Buffy,You're nothing.
2396.53,2398.89,Buffy,"Disgusting, murderous bitch."
2398.97,2400.8,Real Buffy,You're nothing.
2402.49,2404.93,Buffy,You're disgusting.
2431.25,2433.45,Real Buffy,She's gone.
2433.53,2435.52,Real Buffy,Not a trace.
2436.65,2440.04,Riley,Giles said the council guys
2436.65,2440.04,Riley,"have cleared out, too."
2442.33,2444.32,Riley,I don't understand.
2444.41,2447.37,Riley,How could she have...?
2444.41,2447.37,Riley,"I mean, how's it possible?"
2448.65,2450.25,Real Buffy,Magic.
2451.65,2454.85,Riley,I knew there was something.
2451.65,2454.85,Riley,I should've picked up on it.
2454.93,2456.92,Riley,I should've just...
2465.45,2467.84,Real Buffy,You slept with her.
2472.69,2475.08,Riley [looks down],I slept with you.
2482.89,2485.12,Riley,"Man, would I like to get my hands on her."
2485.21,2487.28,Real Buffy,Not in a sex way.
2489.53,2491.58,Real Buffy,I don't think she's coming back.
2491.58,2493.24,Riley,I guess she's had her fun.
2496.17,2497.97,,Yeah.
2498.85,2500.65,,Fun.
