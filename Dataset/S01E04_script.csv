2.06,4.46,,In every generation there is a Chosen One.
4.46,10.09,,"She alone will stand against the vampires,"
4.46,10.09,,the demons and the forces of darkness.
10.09,12.62,,She is the Slayer.
29.37,31.66,Xander,May I cut in?
40.84,42.08,Xander,You all right?
42.08,43.68,Buffy,"Oh, thanks to you."
46.05,49.27,Buffy,You hurt your hand.
46.05,49.27,Buffy,Will you still be able to...
49.35,52.69,Xander,Finish my solo and kiss you
49.35,52.69,Xander,like you've never been kissed before?
89.86,91.94,Buffy,You're drooling.
92.99,95.07,Buffy,Xander!
95.16,97.03,Buffy,You've got a little...
97.12,100.29,Dr. Gregory,Their ancestors were here
97.12,100.29,Dr. Gregory,long before we were.
100.37,103.37,Dr. Gregory,Their progeny will be here
100.37,103.37,Dr. Gregory,long after we are gone.
103.46,106.59,Dr. Gregory,The simple and ubiquitous ant.
109.05,114.51,Dr. Gregory,"Now, if you read the homework,"
109.05,114.51,Dr. Gregory,you should know the two ways
114.51,117.47,Dr. Gregory,that ants communicate.
119.06,121.35,Dr. Gregory,Miss Summers?
121.44,123.52,Buffy,Ways that ants communicate?
124.94,126.82,Buffy,With other ants?
127.61,130.66,Dr. Gregory,"From the homework,"
127.61,130.66,Dr. Gregory,ants are communicating...
134.7,136.37,,Touch
136.45,139.37,,"and, um..."
141.63,143.5,,BO?
143.59,146.34,,Thank God someone finally
143.59,146.34,,found the courage to mention that.
147.22,150.01,,"That would be touch and smell,"
150.01,151.22,Dr. Gregory,Miss Summers?
152.64,155.89,Dr. Gregory,Is there anything else Miss Rosenberg
152.64,155.89,Dr. Gregory,would like to tell you?
157.52,161.53,Dr. Gregory,All right. Chapters six through eight
157.52,161.53,Dr. Gregory,"by tomorrow, people!"
161.61,163.9,Dr. Gregory,Can I see you for a moment?
165.24,167.91,Dr. Gregory,I gather you had a few problems
165.24,167.91,Dr. Gregory,at your last school.
167.99,170.08,Buffy,"Well, what teenager doesn't?"
170.16,172.58,Dr. Gregory,"Cut school, get in fights,"
172.66,174.75,Dr. Gregory,burn down the gymnasium.
175.71,178.04,Dr. Gregory,Principal Flutie showed me
178.04,180.02,Buffy,your permanent record.
178.09,182.3,Buffy,"Well, that fire, there was"
178.09,182.3,Buffy,major extenuating circumstances.
182.38,184.03,Buffy,"Actually, it's kind of funny."
184.03,186.3,Dr. Gregory,I can't wait to see what you'll do here.
187.52,189.89,Buffy,"Destructo Girl, that's me."
189.98,192.42,Dr. Gregory,But I suspect it's gonna be great.
192.42,194.57,Buffy,You mean "great" in a bad way.
196.61,199.39,Buffy,You have a firstrate mind
196.61,199.39,Buffy,and can think on your feet.
199.39,201.9,Buffy,Imagine what you could accomplish
199.39,201.9,Buffy,if you actually did the...
201.93,203.62,Buffy,The homework thing?
204.24,205.83,Buffy,The homework thing.
205.91,209.33,Dr. Gregory,I understand you probably have
205.91,209.33,Dr. Gregory,a good excuse for not doing it.
209.42,211.59,Dr. Gregory,"Amazingly enough, I don't care."
212.79,216.79,Dr. Gregory,I know you can excel in this class
212.79,216.79,Dr. Gregory,and so I expect no less.
216.79,219.11,Dr. Gregory,Is that clear?
219.15,220.93,Buffy,Yeah.
221.01,221.54,Buffy,Sorry.
221.54,223.73,Dr. Gregory,Don't be sorry. Be smart.
225.6,227.36,Dr. Gregory,And please don't listen to
227.37,233.02,Dr. Gregory,the Principal or anyone else's
227.37,233.02,Dr. Gregory,negative opinion about you.
231.07,233.36,Dr. Gregory,Let's make him eat that permanent record.
234.74,236.62,Dr. Gregory,What do you say?
236.7,238.66,Buffy,OK.
238.74,240.83,Buffy,Thanks.
242.66,244.92,Dr. Gregory,Chapters six through eight.
396.02,395.93,Blayne,"Seven, including Cheryl."
395.94,398.15,Blayne,"I tell you though, her sister"
395.94,398.15,Blayne,was lookin' to make it eight.
398.18,400.69,Boy,Ooh! Cheryl's sister? The one in college?
400.77,403.73,Blayne,Home for the holidays and looking for love.
403.81,407.57,Blayne,"She's not my type, though. A girl's really"
403.81,407.57,Blayne,gotta have something to go with me.
407.65,409.95,Xander,Something like a lobotomy?
410.41,413.03,Blayne,"Xander, how many times've you scored?"
413.12,414.37,Xander,"Well, uh..."
414.37,416.75,Blayne,It's just a question.
417.66,419.96,Xander,Are we talking today or the whole week?
422.96,425.13,Xander,Ooh! Duty calls.
426.68,428.76,Xander,Babes!
431.01,432.08,Buffy,What are you doing?
432.08,433.1,Xander,Work with me here.
433.18,435.12,Xander,Blayne had the nerve
433.18,435.12,Xander,to question my manliness.
435.12,437.99,Xander,I'm just gonna give him a visual.
437.99,439.29,Willow,We'll show him!
441.49,442.94,Buffy,I don't believe it.
442.94,445.61,Xander,I know. And after all my conquests.
446.62,447.55,Xander,Who's that?
447.55,450.09,Willow,That must be Angel... I think.
450.12,452.49,Xander,That weird guy that warned her
450.12,452.49,Xander,about all the vampires?
452.49,454.33,Willow,"That's him, I'll bet you."
454.37,458.05,Xander,"Well, he's buff. She never said"
454.37,458.05,Xander,anything about him being buff.
458.13,459.42,Willow,You think he's buff?
459.42,462.77,Xander,He's a very attractive man.
459.42,462.77,Xander,How come that never came up?
463.84,466.12,Buffy,"Well, look who's here."
466.12,466.43,Angel,Hi.
466.51,470.1,Buffy,"I'd say it's nice to see you,"
466.51,470.1,Buffy,but then we'd both know that's a big fib.
470.19,471.94,Angel,I won't be long.
472.02,475.64,Buffy,"No, you'll just give me a cryptic warning"
472.02,475.64,Buffy,"about some exciting new catastrophe,"
475.64,477.98,Buffy,and then disappear into the night. Right?
477.99,479.08,Angel,You're cold.
479.08,480.53,Buffy,You can take it.
480.61,483.74,Angel,I mean... you look cold.
486.33,488.62,Xander,"Oh, right. Give her your jacket."
488.71,491.63,Xander,It's a balmy night. No one needs
488.71,491.63,Xander,to be trading clothing out there!
491.84,493.96,Buffy,It's a little big on me.
496.8,499.51,Angel,What happened?
496.8,499.51,Angel,I didn't pay attention.
499.6,501.61,Buffy,To somebody with a big fork?
501.61,502.47,Angel,He's coming.
502.56,503.8,Buffy,The fork guy?
503.8,506.19,Angel,Don't let him corner you.
506.27,510.59,Angel,Don't give him a moment's mercy.
506.27,510.59,Angel,He'll rip your throat out.
510.63,513.57,Buffy,OK. I'll give you
510.63,513.57,Buffy,improved marks for that one.
513.65,517.62,Buffy,Ripping a throat out
513.65,517.62,Buffy,is a strong visual. It's not cryptic.
518.03,520.33,Angel,I have to go.
522.58,524.67,Buffy,"Sweet dreams to you, too."
529.88,532.38,Giles,That's all he said? "Fork guy"?
532.47,534.97,Buffy,That's all Cryptic Guy said  "fork guy".
535.05,539.18,Giles,There are too many guys in your life!
535.05,539.18,Giles,I'll see what I can find out.
540.98,543.06,Giles,"God, every day here is the same."
543.15,546.61,Buffy,"Bright, sunny, beautiful."
543.15,546.61,Buffy,How ever can we escape this torment?
546.69,549.2,Giles,Really! Morning.
546.69,549.2,Giles,Morning.
549.28,552.28,Xander,Guess what I just heard in the office.
549.28,552.28,Xander,No Dr Gregory today.
552.37,555.87,Xander,"Ergo, those of us who blew off"
552.37,555.87,Xander,our homework aren't as dumb as we look.
555.95,557.11,Buffy,What happened? Is he sick?
557.11,558.72,Xander,They didn't say anything about sick.
558.75,560.86,Xander,Something about... missing.
560.9,561.79,Buffy,He's missing?
561.79,563.09,Xander,"Well, let me think."
563.17,566.93,Xander,The cheerleaders were modelling
563.17,566.93,Xander,their new short skirts. I kinda got...
566.93,569.6,Xander,"Yeah. Yeah, they said: ""missing."""
571.35,572.45,Xander,Which is bad?
572.45,574.73,Buffy,"If something's wrong, yeah."
574.81,578.56,Willow,He's one of the only teachers
574.81,578.56,Willow,that doesn't think Buffy's a felon.
579.4,581.78,Xander,I'm really sorry. I'm sure he'II...
608.31,610.39,Natalie,Could you help me?
610.73,613.65,Xander,Uh... yes.
613.73,616.28,Natalie,I'm looking for Science 109.
616.73,618.82,Xander,"Oh, it's um..."
620.95,623.03,Xander,I go there every day.
624.37,626.75,Xander,"Oh, God, where is it?"
626.83,630.84,Blayne,Hi. Blayne Mall.
626.83,630.84,Blayne,I'm goin' there right now.
630.92,634.38,Blayne,It's not far from the varsity field
630.92,634.38,Blayne,where I took allcity.
634.46,636.55,Natalie,"Oh, thank you, Blayne."
642.89,647.97,Xander,It's funny how the earth never opens up
642.89,647.97,Xander,and swallows you when you want it to.
656.7,658.37,Willow,What's wrong?
658.45,662.62,Buffy,"If Dr Gregory dropped his glasses,"
658.45,662.62,Buffy,why wouldn't he pick them up?
666.67,670.63,Natalie,My name is Natalie French.
666.67,670.63,Natalie,I'll be substituting for Dr Gregory.
670.72,672.98,Buffy,Do you know when he's coming back?
672.98,674.64,Natalie,"No, I don't, um... Buffy."
674.72,677.15,Natalie,They just tell me where they want me.
677.15,679.18,Blayne,I'll tell you where I want you.
680.14,682.02,Natalie,"Excuse me, Blayne?"
682.1,684.04,Blayne,"Uh, I was just wondering if you were"
684.04,686.19,Natalie,gonna pick up where Dr Gregory left off.
687.4,692.37,Natalie,Yes. His notes tell me
687.4,692.37,Natalie,you were right in the middle of insect life.
693.24,697.96,Natalie,"The praying mantis is a fascinating creature,"
693.24,697.96,Natalie,forced to live alone.
698.04,700.34,Natalie,Who can tell me why?
700.42,701.88,Natalie,Buffy?
701.96,705.87,Buffy,"Well, the words ""bugugly"""
701.96,705.87,Buffy,kind of spring to mind.
705.93,709.22,Natalie,There is nothing ugly
705.93,709.22,Natalie,about these unique creatures.
709.3,712.82,Natalie,The reason they live alone is because they're cannibals.
713.52,717.36,Natalie,"Well, it's hardly their fault."
713.52,717.36,Natalie,It's the way nature designed them.
717.44,721.24,Natalie,"Noble, solitary and prolific."
721.32,723.82,Natalie,Over 1800 species worldwide.
723.9,728.95,Natalie,And in nearly all of them the female is larger
723.9,728.95,Natalie,and more aggressive than the male.
729.04,731.75,Blayne,Nothing wrong with an aggressive female.
733.79,740.55,Natalie,The California mantis lays her eggs
733.79,740.55,Natalie,and then finds a mate to fertilise them."
741.84,745.93,Natalie,"Once he's played his part,"
741.84,745.93,Natalie,she covers the eggs in a protective sac
746.01,749.27,Natalie,and attaches it to a leaf or twig out of danger.
749.35,751.65,Natalie,"Now, if she's done her job correctly,"
751.73,755.23,Natalie,in a few months
751.73,755.23,Natalie,she'll have several hundred offspring.
755.73,760.07,Natalie,"You know, we should make"
755.73,760.07,Natalie,some model egg sacs for the science fair.
760.16,762.89,Natalie,Who would like to help me
760.16,762.89,Natalie,do that after school?
767.21,768.67,Natalie,Good.
772.09,774.88,Buffy,"Hot Dog Surprise. Be still, my heart."
774.97,778.64,Willow,Call me oldfashioned.
774.97,778.64,Willow,I want no more surprises in my hot dogs.
778.72,780.6,Xander,I wonder what she sees in me.
780.68,785.14,Xander,"It's probably the quiet good looks,"
780.68,785.14,Xander,coupled with a certain smoky magnetism.
785.23,786.57,Xander,Miss French.
786.57,788.3,Xander,You two are probably
786.57,788.3,Xander,a little too young to understand
788.3,790.21,Xander,what an older woman
788.3,790.21,Xander,would see in a younger man.
790.23,792.49,Buffy,"Oh, I understand."
792.49,793.15,Xander,Good.
793.24,796.78,Buffy,A younger man is too dumb to wonder why an
793.24,796.78,Buffy,older woman can't find someone her own age
796.87,798.28,Buffy,and too deperate to care about
798.28,799.5,Xander,the surgical improvements.
799.58,801.61,Xander,What surgical improvements?
801.61,802.96,Willow,"Well, he is young."
803.04,805.17,Buffy,And so terribly innocent.
805.25,807.58,Xander,"Hey, those that can, do."
807.58,811.69,Xander,"Those that can't,"
807.58,811.69,Xander,laugh at those who... can do.
811.88,815.46,Blayne,Gotta carb up for my oneonone
811.88,815.46,Blayne,with Miss French today. When's yours?
815.51,819.81,Blayne,"Oh, right. Tomorrow."
815.51,819.81,Blayne,You came in second. I came in first.
819.89,823.61,Blayne,Guess that's
819.89,823.61,Blayne,what they call natural selection.
823.69,827.31,Xander,Guess it's what they call a rehearsal.
823.69,827.31,Xander,Rehearsal.
830.24,832.12,Cordelia,Excuse you!
832.2,835.24,Cordelia,Medically prescribed lunch.
832.2,835.24,Cordelia,My doctor ships it daily...
835.24,838.19,Cordelia,I'll only be here
835.24,838.19,Cordelia,as long as I can hold my breath.
842.21,845.76,Cordelia,His head! His head!
842.21,845.76,Cordelia,"Oh, my God! Where's his head?!"
856.02,857.9,Cordelia,Here.
858.32,860.19,Giles,Drink this.
860.28,862.36,Buffy,"No, thank you."
862.78,866.98,Xander,I've never seen...
862.78,866.98,Xander,I mean... I've never seen anything like...
867.6,869.33,Xander,That was new.
869.36,872.5,Willow,Who would want to hurt Dr Gregory?
872.53,875.72,Giles,He didn't have any enemies
872.53,875.72,Giles,on the staff that I'm aware of.
875.72,879.57,Giles,He was a... civilised man.
875.72,879.57,Giles,I liked him.
880.05,882.14,Buffy,So did I.
882.22,886.6,Willow,We're gonna find out who did this.
882.22,886.6,Willow,We'll find them and we'll stop them.
886.68,887.88,Buffy,Count on it.
887.88,889.48,Giles,What do we know?
889.56,893.98,Buffy,"Not a lot. He was killed on campus,"
889.56,893.98,Buffy,I'm guessing the last day we saw him.
894.07,895.73,Giles,How do you work that out?
895.73,897.73,Buffy,He didn't change his clothing.
897.76,900.78,Xander,This is a question that
897.76,900.78,Xander,no one particularly wants to hear.
900.82,902.7,Xander,But... Where did they put his head?
902.79,906.08,Willow,Good point. I didn't want to hear that.
906.16,909.41,Buffy,Angel. He warned me
906.16,909.41,Buffy,that something was coming.
909.44,912.96,Giles,"Yes. Yes, he did, didn't he?"
909.44,912.96,Giles,I wish I knew what he meant.
913.05,916.4,Giles,I've been trying to gather
913.05,916.4,Giles,"more information about the Master, our..."
916.4,918.32,Giles,local vampire king.
918.36,921.49,Giles,There was one oblique reference to
918.36,921.49,Giles,"a, a, a vampire who..."
921.49,923.97,Giles,displeased the Master
921.49,923.97,Giles,and cut his hand off in penance.
926.02,926.37,Buffy,Cut off his hand
926.02,926.37,Buffy,and replaced it with a fork?
926.37,927.83,Giles,I don't know what he replaced it with.
927.87,930.07,Xander,So why would he come after a teacher?
930.07,931.44,Giles,I'm not certain he did.
931.53,934.99,Giles,There was an incident two nights ago
935.07,938.2,Giles,involving a homeless person
935.07,938.2,Giles,in Weatherly Park.
938.29,942.79,Giles,"He was practically shredded,"
938.29,942.79,Giles,but... nothing like Dr Gregory.
942.87,944.79,Buffy,Fork Guy doesn't do heads?
944.79,946.04,Giles,Not historically.
946.13,948.1,Buffy,And Dr Gregory's blood wasn't drained.
948.13,951.68,Xander,So there's something else out there
948.13,951.68,Xander,besides Silverware Man?
951.76,954.22,Xander,"Oh, this is fun. We're on Monster Island."
954.31,958.43,Buffy,We're on a Hellmouth.
954.31,958.43,Buffy,It's a centre of mystical convergence.
958.52,960.4,Buffy,Guess it's the same thing.
960.48,962.98,Giles,Unpleasant things
960.48,962.98,Giles,"do gravitate here, it's true."
963.06,965.67,Giles,But we don't know there's anything
963.06,965.67,Giles,besides this chap.
965.67,967.72,Giles,He's still our likely suspect.
967.76,969.82,Buffy,Where was that guy killed?
967.76,969.82,Buffy,Weatherly Park?
969.82,972.12,Giles,"Buffy, I know you're upset,"
972.15,975.07,Giles,but this is no time to go hunting.
972.15,975.07,Giles,Not until we know more.
975.07,977.67,Giles,"Please, promise me"
975.07,977.67,Giles,you won't do anything rash.
977.7,979.72,Buffy,Cross my heart.
1016.21,1018.89,Bum,"Shouldn't be out here at night,"
1016.21,1018.89,Bum,little lady.
1018.89,1021.18,Bum,It's dangerous.
1095.1,1097.6,Voices,Hold it! Police!
1101.15,1104.78,Voices,I heard it. Spread out!
1101.15,1104.78,Voices,Let's go over here. This way.
1149.54,1152.28,Giles,You went hunting last night?
1152.28,1152.67,Buffy,Yes.
1152.75,1154.13,Giles,When you assured me you wouldn't?
1154.13,1157.23,Buffy,"Yes, I lied. I'm a bad person."
1154.13,1157.23,Buffy,Let's move on.
1158.26,1160.65,Giles,Did you see someone with a fork?
1160.65,1162.36,Buffy,More like a jumbo claw.
1163.39,1164.81,Giles,Oh.
1164.89,1166.46,Giles,At least you're not hurt.
1166.46,1168.03,Buffy,And I saw something else.
1168.07,1171.77,Buffy,Something much more interesting than your
1168.07,1171.77,Buffy,average runofthemill killer vampire.
1171.81,1172.9,Giles,Oh?
1172.94,1175.4,Buffy,"Do you know Miss French, the teacher"
1172.94,1175.4,Buffy,that's subbing for Dr Gregory?
1175.4,1177.17,Giles,"Yes. Yes, she's lovely."
1177.49,1180.66,Giles,"In a common,"
1177.49,1180.66,Giles,extremely wellproportioned way.
1180.74,1184.87,Buffy,"Well, I'm chasing Claw Guy last night and"
1180.74,1184.87,Buffy,Miss WellProportioned is heading home.
1184.95,1190.02,Buffy,The Claw Guy takes one look at her
1184.95,1190.02,Buffy,and runs screaming for cover.
1188.08,1189.93,Giles,He what? Ran away?
1189.93,1191.67,Buffy,He was petrified.
1191.75,1193.09,Giles,Of Miss French?
1193.09,1193.63,Buffy,Uhhuh.
1193.72,1197.66,Buffy,"So, I'm an undead monster"
1193.72,1197.66,Buffy,that can shave with my hand.
1197.66,1199.43,Giles,How many things am I afraid of?
1199.47,1202.18,Giles,"Not many, and not"
1199.47,1202.18,Giles,"substitute teachers, as a rule."
1202.27,1203.41,Buffy,So what's her deal?
1203.41,1207.12,Giles,I think perhaps it would be a good idea
1203.41,1207.12,Giles,if we kept an eye on her.
1207.16,1209.11,Buffy,Then I'd better get to class.
1213.49,1216.2,Mr. Flutie,You were there.
1213.49,1216.2,Mr. Flutie,"You saw Dr Gregory, didn't you?"
1216.28,1219.5,Buffy,"Um... You mean yesterday,"
1216.28,1219.5,Buffy,"in the cafeteria, when we found him..."
1219.58,1222.21,Mr. Flutie,"Don't say ""dead"" or ""decapitated"","
1219.58,1222.21,Mr. Flutie,or "decomposing".
1222.21,1223.67,Mr. Flutie,I'd stay away from Dwords altogether.
1223.7,1225.67,Mr. Flutie,"But you witnessed the event,"
1223.7,1225.67,Mr. Flutie,"so this way, please."
1225.7,1227.09,Buffy,"No, I'm gonna be late for biology."
1227.09,1227.71,Mr. Flutie,Extremely late.
1227.75,1232.21,Mr. Flutie,You have to see a counsellor. Everyone who
1227.75,1232.21,Mr. Flutie,saw the body must see a crisis counselor.
1232.21,1233.32,Buffy,I really don't need...
1233.32,1235.03,Mr. Flutie,We all need help with our feelings
1235.06,1238.81,Mr. Flutie,otherwise we bottle them up and before you
1235.06,1238.81,Mr. Flutie,know it powerful laxatives are involved.
1238.85,1242.94,Mr. Flutie,I really believe if we all reach out
1238.85,1242.94,Mr. Flutie,"to one another, we can beat this thing."
1243.02,1244.26,Mr. Flutie,I'm always here if you need a hug.
1244.26,1245.28,Buffy,"But not a real hug,"
1245.28,1246.78,Mr. Flutie,because there's no touching.
1246.81,1248.47,Mr. Flutie,This school is sensitive to wrong touching.
1248.47,1250.16,Buffy,"But I really, really..."
1250.16,1250.38,Mr. Flutie,No!
1250.42,1253.51,Mr. Flutie,You have to talk to a counsellor
1250.42,1253.51,Mr. Flutie,and start the healing. You have to heal.
1253.59,1256.26,Buffy,"But, Mr Flutie, I don't..."
1256.26,1256.77,Mr. Flutie,Heal!
1260.3,1262.66,Cordelia,I don't know what to say.
1260.3,1262.66,Cordelia,It was really... I mean...
1262.66,1266.64,Cordelia,"One minute you're in your normal life,"
1262.66,1266.64,Cordelia,and then who's in the fridge?
1266.97,1269.05,Cordelia,"It really gets to you, a thing like that."
1269.6,1271.36,Cordelia,It was...
1271.36,1274.47,Cordelia,Let's just say I haven't been able
1271.36,1274.47,Cordelia,to eat a thing since yesterday.
1274.89,1277.25,Cordelia,I think I lost like
1274.89,1277.25,Cordelia,seven and a half ounces.
1277.25,1280.67,Cordelia,Way swifter than that socalled diet
1277.25,1280.67,Cordelia,that quack put me on.
1280.69,1283.53,Cordelia,"Oh, I'm not saying that we should"
1280.69,1283.53,Cordelia,kill a teacher every day
1283.53,1285.89,Cordelia,just so I can lose weight.
1283.53,1285.89,Cordelia,I'm just saying
1285.92,1289.54,Cordelia,"when tragedy strikes, we have to"
1285.92,1289.54,Cordelia,look on the bright side. You know?
1289.62,1293.58,Cordelia,Like how even used Mercedes
1289.62,1293.58,Cordelia,still have leather seats.
1294.46,1298.21,Natalie,Keep your eyes straight ahead
1294.46,1298.21,Natalie,on your own test.
1305.39,1309.35,Natalie,I think you meant "pollination"
1305.39,1309.35,Natalie,for number 14.
1313.32,1315.69,Natalie,I'll see you here after school.
1318.03,1321.02,Buffy,"Oh, great. A pop quiz."
1333.92,1338.35,Buffy,"No, I'm not saying she craned her neck."
1333.92,1338.35,Buffy,We are talking fullon "Exorcist" twist.
1338.43,1338.94,Willow,Ouch.
1338.94,1340.9,Buffy,Which reminds me...
1340.94,1344.19,Buffy,"How come Blayne, who worked with her"
1340.94,1344.19,Buffy,"oneonone yesterday, isn't here today?"
1344.27,1346.15,Willow,Inquiring minds wanna know.
1346.23,1347.9,Buffy,Any luck?
1347.98,1351.99,Giles,I've not found a creature as yet
1347.98,1351.99,Giles,that strikes terror in a vampire's heart.
1352.27,1356.16,Buffy,Try looking under "Things That Can
1352.27,1356.16,Buffy,Turn Their Heads All The Way Around".
1356.24,1359.71,Giles,Nothing human can do that.
1356.24,1359.71,Giles,"No, nothing human."
1359.79,1362.67,Buffy,But there are some insects that can.
1362.75,1365.71,Buffy,"Whatever she is,"
1362.75,1365.71,Buffy,I'm gonna be ready for her.
1366.22,1368.33,Giles,What are you going to do?
1368.42,1371.48,Buffy,My homework.
1376.02,1378.1,Buffy,Where are the books on bugs?
1383.69,1385.69,Xander,Hi.
1383.69,1385.69,Xander,"Oh, hi."
1385.78,1388.61,Natalie,I was just grabbing a snack.
1385.78,1388.61,Natalie,Can I fix you something?
1388.7,1392.58,Xander,"No, thanks. I never eat"
1388.7,1392.58,Xander,when I'm making egg sacs.
1392.66,1394.81,Xander,"If this were real, the bugs would be..."
1394.81,1395.58,Natalie,As big as you.
1395.66,1398.75,Xander,"Yeah. So, where do we start?"
1398.83,1403.72,Natalie,"Oh, Xander,"
1398.83,1403.72,Natalie,I've done something really stupid.
1403.8,1405.35,Natalie,I hope you can forgive me.
1405.35,1407.14,Xander,Forgiveness is my middle name.
1407.22,1412.35,Xander,"Actually, it's LaVelle, and I'd appreciate it"
1407.22,1412.35,Xander,if you'd guard that secret with your life.
1412.43,1414.59,Natalie,I have a teachers' conference
1412.43,1414.59,Natalie,in half an hour
1414.59,1418.78,Natalie,and... I left
1414.59,1418.78,Natalie,the paint and papermâché at home.
1419.19,1423.18,Natalie,I don't suppose you'd like to come
1419.19,1423.18,Natalie,to my place tonight to work on it there?
1424.41,1427.33,Xander,"Come to, uh... your place?"
1429.7,1431.37,Natalie,Seven thirty?
1431.46,1433.54,Natalie,Here's my address.
1437.09,1441.07,Natalie,I'll see you tonight.
1441.07,1442.02,Xander,Yeah.
1445.52,1447.6,Xander,"Ooh, yes!"
1467.38,1470.15,Buffy,Dig this. "The praying mantis can
1470.18,1475.71,Buffy,rotate its head 180 degrees while waiting
1470.18,1475.71,Buffy,for its next meal to walk by." Huh!
1477.6,1480.02,Willow,"Well, come on, guys. Hah!"
1480.1,1483.35,Willow,"Well, Miss French is sort of big for a bug."
1483.44,1486.31,Giles,"And she is, by and large, womanshaped."
1486.4,1491.19,Buffy,OK. Factoid one: only the praying mantis
1486.4,1491.19,Buffy,can rotate its head like that.
1491.28,1494.62,Buffy,Factoid two: a pretty whackedout vampire
1491.28,1494.62,Buffy,is scared to death of her.
1494.7,1497.83,Buffy,Factoid three:
1494.7,1497.83,Buffy,her fashion sense screams predator.
1497.91,1499.52,Willow,It's the shoulder pads!
1499.52,1500.08,Buffy,Exactly.
1500.16,1506.02,Giles,"If you're right, then she'd have to be"
1500.16,1506.02,Giles,a shapeshifter or a perceptiondistorter.
1504.09,1507.38,Giles,Half a mo. I had a chum at Oxford. Carlyle.
1507.46,1510.18,Giles,Advanced degrees
1507.46,1510.18,Giles,in entomology and mythology.
1510.26,1512.16,Buffy,Entomo... who?
1512.16,1515.02,Giles,Bugs and fairy tales.
1513.1,1514.35,Buffy,I knew that.
1514.89,1518.39,Giles,"If I recall correctly, poor old Carlyle,"
1514.89,1518.39,Giles,"just before he went mad,"
1518.4,1520.16,Giles,claimed there was some beast...
1520.2,1521.86,Willow,"Buffy, 911."
1521.94,1524.58,Willow,Blayne's mom called the school.
1521.94,1524.58,Willow,He never came home last night.
1524.62,1526.35,Giles,The boy who
1524.62,1526.35,Giles,worked with Miss French yesterday?
1526.39,1528.75,Willow,Yeah. If Miss French is responsible for...
1528.79,1531.37,Willow,Xander's supposed
1528.79,1531.37,Willow,to be helping her right now!
1531.45,1533.54,Willow,He's got a crush on a giant insect!
1533.62,1535.42,Buffy,"OK, don't panic.  I'll warn him."
1535.42,1537.59,Buffy,But I need you to hack on
1535.42,1537.59,Buffy,to the Coroner's Office for me.
1537.63,1539.53,Willow,Whoa. What are we looking for?
1539.53,1540.92,Buffy,Autopsy on Dr Gregory.
1543.02,1543.34,Buffy,I've been trying to figure out
1543.02,1543.34,Buffy,these marks that I saw on his corpse.
1543.34,1545.84,Buffy,I'm thinking they were teeth. And...
1545.87,1549.31,Buffy,these cuddlies should
1545.87,1549.31,Buffy,definitely be brushing after every meal.
1550.27,1552.68,Buffy,And you were saying something about a beast?
1552.73,1557.69,Giles,"Oh, yeah. I just need to make"
1552.73,1557.69,Giles,one transatlantic telephone call.
1557.9,1560.54,Giles,Um...This computer invasion
1560.54,1562.55,Giles,Willow's performing on the Coroner's Office
1562.55,1563.96,Willow,One assumes is entirely legal?
1563.99,1564.72,Buffy,Of course.
1564.72,1565.38,Willow,Entirely.
1565.4,1570.29,Giles,"Right. Wasn't here, didn't see it,"
1565.4,1570.29,Giles,couldn't have stopped you.
1570.75,1572.83,Buffy,Good idea.
1575.59,1577.67,Buffy,Hey.
1575.59,1577.67,Buffy,Hey.
1577.76,1580.18,Buffy,So how'd it go with Miss French?
1580.26,1582.74,Xander,"Oh, it's a bit demanding being her"
1580.26,1582.74,Xander,"absolute favourite guy in the universe,"
1582.74,1584.94,Xander,but I'll muddle through.
1584.97,1587.2,Buffy,"Xander, she's not what she seems."
1587.2,1589.02,Xander,I know. She's so much more.
1589.1,1591.85,Buffy,"OK, um... I'm gonna have to"
1589.1,1591.85,Buffy,tell you something about her and
1591.85,1595.08,Buffy,"I'm gonna need you to really listen, OK?"
1595.12,1596.82,Xander,OK?
1596.9,1598.87,Buffy,I don't think she's human.
1598.88,1601.72,Xander,"I see. So if she's not human, she's..."
1601.74,1604.57,Buffy,Technically? A big bug.
1604.61,1606.39,Buffy,This sounds really weird.
1604.61,1606.39,Buffy,I'm aware of that.
1606.39,1608.64,Xander,It doesn't sound weird at all.
1606.39,1608.64,Xander,I completely understand.
1608.67,1610.94,Xander,I've met someone and you're jealous.
1610.94,1611.25,Buffy,What?
1611.34,1612.66,Xander,"Look, there's nothing I can do about it."
1612.66,1614.92,Xander,There's just this certain chemical thing
1612.66,1614.92,Xander,between Miss French and me.
1614.96,1618.15,Buffy,I know. I read all about it.
1614.96,1618.15,Buffy,It's called a... um... a pheromone.
1618.18,1620.78,Buffy,It's a chemical attractant
1618.18,1620.78,Buffy,insects give off.
1620.85,1623.39,Xander,"She's not an insect! She's a woman, OK?"
1623.48,1625.07,Xander,"And, hard as that may be"
1623.48,1625.07,Xander,"for you to conceive,"
1625.07,1627.84,Xander,an actual woman finds me attractive.
1627.9,1630.58,Xander,"I realise, it's no mystery guy"
1627.9,1630.58,Xander,handing out leather jackets.
1630.62,1632.14,Xander,"And while we're on the subject,"
1632.14,1634.24,Buffy,"what kind of a girly name is Angel, anyway?"
1634.32,1635.91,Buffy,What does that have to do...
1635.91,1637.66,Xander,Nothing! It just kinda bugs me.
1637.74,1639.83,Xander,"Look, I really gotta..."
1660.81,1663.11,Natalie,Hi. Come on in.
1664.28,1666.36,Natalie,Should I change? Is this too...
1666.45,1671.03,Xander,No! No. It's the most beautiful chest...
1666.45,1671.03,Xander,dress I've ever seen.
1671.74,1674.04,Natalie,Thank you. That's sweet.
1674.62,1676.5,Natalie,Martini?
1681.02,1681.71,Natalie,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1681.02,1681.71,Natalie,Would you like something else?
1682.97,1686.59,Natalie,I just need to relax a little.
1682.97,1686.59,Natalie,I'm kind of nervous around you.
1687.6,1689.81,Natalie,You're probably cool as a cucumber.
1690.64,1693.94,Xander,"I like cucumbers,"
1690.64,1693.94,Xander,like in that Greek salad with yoghurt.
1694.02,1696.41,Xander,Do you like Greek food?
1694.02,1696.41,Xander,"I'm exempting Schwarma, of course,"
1696.41,1699.33,Xander,"I mean, what's that all about?"
1696.41,1699.33,Xander,It's a big meat hive.
1706.49,1707.95,Xander,Hello!
1708.29,1710.37,Natalie,Cheers.
1712.08,1714.46,Natalie,Can I ask you a personal question?
1720.34,1722.85,Natalie,Have you ever been with a woman before?
1723.35,1726.06,Xander,"You mean like in, uh... the same room?"
1726.68,1728.77,Natalie,You know what I mean.
1729.19,1732.61,Xander,"Oh, that. Well, let me think."
1733.48,1735.57,Xander,"Yeah, there was several."
1736.36,1739.7,Xander,"I mean, and... uh, quite a few times."
1740.91,1745.42,Xander,And then there was...
1740.91,1745.42,Xander,"Oh, she was incredibly..."
1745.54,1748.54,Natalie,No. Uhuh.
1745.54,1748.54,Natalie,I know.
1748.92,1750.32,Natalie,I can tell.
1750.32,1751.34,Xander,You can?
1751.42,1753.3,Natalie,"Oh, I like it."
1753.47,1756.51,Natalie,You might say I need it.
1756.59,1758.84,Natalie,"i> Oh, well, needs should, you know,"
1758.84,1760.15,,Somebody help me!</i>
1760.18,1761.47,Xander,needs should definitely
1760.18,1761.47,Xander,be met as long as
1761.47,1762.62,Xander,i>  it doesn't require ointments
1761.47,1762.62,Xander,I'm down here!</i>
1762.65,1766.3,Xander,the next day or... Do you hear?
1766.3,1766.65,Natalie,No.
1766.73,1768.7,Xander,It sounds like someone cry...
1768.7,1770.19,Natalie,I don't hear anything.
1770.28,1773.49,Natalie,Your hands are so hot!
1774.2,1776.08,Buffy,"Oh, you hurt your hand."
1780.71,1782.96,Xander,Buffy.
1783.04,1785.13,Xander,I love Buffy.
1785.75,1789.15,Xander,"Wow. So that's a martini, huh?"
1789.15,1789.72,Natalie,Mmhm.
1790.39,1792.47,Xander,Do you hear?
1792.55,1795.52,Natalie,Would you like to touch me
1792.55,1795.52,Natalie,with those hands?
1798.06,1800.36,Xander,Your hands are s...
1801.19,1803.74,Xander,really serrated.
1804.24,1806.65,Xander,"Oh, wow, that martini. I..."
1806.74,1809.32,Xander,really think I have to...
1857.97,1860.68,Xander,Miss French?
1861.51,1863.81,Natalie,"Please, call me Natalie."
1865.93,1868.94,Giles,"Frankly, madam, I haven't the faintest idea"
1865.93,1868.94,Giles,"what time it is, nor do I care!"
1869.02,1872.05,Giles,"Now, unlock his cell, unstrap him"
1869.02,1872.05,Giles,and bring him to the telephone immediately!
1872.05,1874.68,Giles,This is a matter of life and death!
1874.69,1880.37,Willow,Got it. Coroner's report
1874.69,1880.37,Willow,complete with  yuck  colour pictures.
1880.83,1882.3,Willow,"They are teeth marks,"
1882.3,1885.79,Buffy,which match perfectly
1882.3,1885.79,Buffy,the one insect that nips off its prey's head.
1885.83,1887.73,Willow,"OK, I don't like this."
1887.77,1893.02,Buffy,That's the way they feed. Head first.
1887.77,1893.02,Buffy,It's also the way they mate.
1891.09,1893.15,Buffy,The female bites off the male's head
1891.09,1893.15,Buffy,while they're...
1893.15,1897.43,Willow,"No, no, no! See, Xander's..."
1893.15,1897.43,Willow,I like his head.
1897.47,1901.14,Willow,It's where you find his eyes
1897.47,1901.14,Willow,and his hair and his adorable smile.
1901.23,1905.15,Buffy,"Hey, hey, take it easy, Will."
1901.23,1905.15,Buffy,Xander is not in any immediate danger.
1905.23,1909.11,Buffy,I saw him leave school.
1905.23,1909.11,Buffy,He's probably safe at home right now.
1916.2,1916.81,Xander,Blayne!
1916.81,1918.29,Blayne,"Oh, God. Oh, God."
1918.37,1920.21,Xander,Are you all right?
1920.29,1924.09,Blayne,You gotta get me outta here. You gotta.
1920.29,1924.09,Blayne,She... she... she gets you and...
1924.17,1926.71,Blayne,What? What does she do?
1924.17,1926.71,Blayne,She... she...
1926.8,1929.26,Blayne,"Oh, God. Oh, no."
1929.34,1932.85,Blayne,"Blayne, what does she do?"
1929.34,1932.85,Blayne,She... she...
1932.93,1935.48,Blayne,"She... she takes you out of the cage,"
1932.93,1935.48,Blayne,and... she ties you up
1935.56,1942.57,Blayne,and... and she starts movin' and throbbin'
1935.56,1942.57,Blayne,and these eggs come shootin' out of her.
1942.65,1943.85,Blayne,And then... and then...
1943.85,1944.69,Xander,What? Then what?
1945.36,1947.66,Blayne,she mates with you.
1948.45,1948.91,Xander,She...?
1948.91,1950.63,Blayne,That's not the worst part.
1950.66,1952.26,Xander,That's not?
1952.26,1955.02,Blayne,You seen her teeth?
1953.04,1956,Blayne,"While she's... you know,"
1953.04,1956,Blayne,right in the middle of...
1956.08,1958.32,Blayne,I saw her do it!
1958.35,1960.61,Blayne,I don't wanna die like that.
1960.61,1962.38,Xander,"Blayne. Blayne, chill."
1962.47,1965.8,Xander,That's good. It's gonna be OK.
1962.47,1965.8,Xander,We'll get out of this.
1965.89,1968.6,Blayne,You got a plan? What is it?
1969.22,1971.82,Xander,"Just, uh, let me perfect it."
1971.82,1972.56,Blayne,"Oh, God."
1972.64,1975.15,Blayne,"Oh, God. Oh, God."
1976.61,1978.73,Giles,"I understand, Carlyle."
1978.82,1981.82,Giles,"Yes, I'll take every precaution."
1981.91,1985.83,Giles,Absolutely. It sounds exactly
1981.91,1985.83,Giles,like the creature you described.
1985.91,1988.91,Giles,"You were right all along, about everything."
1990.29,1994.46,Giles,"No, you weren't right about your mother"
1990.29,1994.46,Giles,"coming back as a Pekinese, but..."
1994.55,1998.22,Giles,"Try to rest, old man. Yes. Tata."
1998.8,2000.26,Giles,Bye now.
2000.59,2005.14,Giles,Dr Ferris Carlyle spent years
2000.59,2005.14,Giles,transcribing a lost preGermanic language.
2005.22,2009.41,Giles,"What he discovered he kept to himself,"
2005.22,2009.41,Giles,until several teenage boys were
2009.41,2012.48,Giles,murdered in the Cotswolds.
2009.41,2012.48,Giles,Then he went hunting for it.
2012.57,2013.87,Buffy,It" being...?
2013.87,2016.36,Giles,He calls her a SheMantis.
2016.45,2021.7,Giles,"This type of creature, the kleptesvirgo"
2016.45,2021.7,Giles,"or virginthief, appears in many cultures."
2021.79,2024.09,Giles,"The Greek sirens,"
2021.79,2024.09,Giles,the Celtic sea maidens who
2024.09,2025.87,Giles,tore the living flesh from the bones of...
2025.91,2028.63,Buffy,"Giles, while we're young."
2028.71,2032.88,Giles,"Well, basically the SheMantis"
2028.71,2032.88,Giles,assumes the form of a beautiful woman...
2032.97,2036.04,Giles,and then lures
2032.97,2036.04,Giles,innocent virgins back to her nest.
2036.04,2037.7,Giles,Virgins?
2037.81,2041.98,Buffy,"Well, Xander's not a... a..."
2042.52,2044.88,Buffy,"I mean, he's probably..."
2044.88,2045.86,Willow,Gonna die.
2047.9,2052.45,Buffy,"OK, OK. So this thing is breeding"
2047.9,2052.45,Buffy,and we need to find it and snuff it.
2052.53,2054.62,Buffy,Any tips on the snuffing part?
2054.7,2058.02,Giles,Carlyle recommends cleaving
2054.7,2058.02,Giles,all body parts with a sharp blade.
2058.8,2059.56,Buffy,Slice and dice.
2059.56,2061.12,Giles,"Whatever you do, it'd better be"
2061.12,2063.84,Giles,sudden and swift. This beast is
2061.12,2063.84,Giles,extremely dangerous.
2063.88,2066.52,Buffy,"Well, your buddy, Carlyle, faced it"
2063.88,2066.52,Buffy,and he's still around.
2066.55,2069.97,Giles,"Yes, in a straitjacket,"
2066.55,2069.97,Giles,howling his innards out day and night.
2070.05,2072.7,Buffy,"OK, Admiral, way to inspire the troops."
2072.7,2073.11,Giles,Sorry.
2073.19,2074.57,Willow,Xander's not home.
2074.57,2076.89,Willow,He told his mom he was
2074.57,2076.89,Willow,going to his teacher's house
2076.89,2079.46,Willow,to work on a science project.
2076.89,2079.46,Willow,He didn't tell her where.
2079.5,2082.4,Buffy,See if you can get her address
2079.5,2082.4,Buffy,off the substitute rolls.
2082.48,2084.99,Buffy,"And you need to record bat sonar, and fast."
2085.07,2086.81,Giles,Bat sonar. Right. What?
2086.85,2091.08,Buffy,"Bats eat them. A mantis hears sonar,"
2086.85,2091.08,Buffy,its entire nervous system goes kaplooie.
2091.16,2092.25,Giles,Where am I gonna find...
2092.25,2093.11,Buffy,In the vid library.
2093.14,2098.42,Buffy,"There're no books, but it's dark and musty."
2093.14,2098.42,Buffy,You'll feel right at home. Go!
2100.46,2102.55,Buffy,I guess I'll handle the armoury.
2103.76,2106.16,Blayne,Don't do anything to make her mad.
2111.23,2113.76,Blayne,"Hey, all right! Now I can get out of my cage!"
2113.87,2117.17,Blayne,Into yours. What'd you do that for?
2117.17,2118.02,Xander,A weapon.
2118.95,2121.44,Blayne,I think you're gonna need it.
2128.7,2130.65,Willow,Getting the address.
2130.65,2131.91,Buffy,Great. Giles?
2131.99,2136.34,Giles,Recording bat sonar is something soothingly
2131.99,2136.34,Giles,akin to having one's teeth drilled.
2136.42,2138.51,Buffy,Let's roll.
2138.59,2142.09,Willow,According to Miss French's
2138.59,2142.09,Willow,"personnel records, she was born in 1907."
2142.17,2146.52,Giles,"She's, like, 90 years old."
2142.17,2146.52,Giles,And extremely wellpreserved.
2146.75,2149.02,Blayne,"Oh, God!"
2151.07,2153.9,Blayne,He did that. He broke the cage.
2151.07,2153.9,Blayne,"Take him, not me. Take him!"
2165.17,2168.21,Giles,What now?
2165.17,2168.21,Giles,We can't just kick the door down.
2168.29,2170.59,Buffy,"Yeah, that would be wrong!"
2171.59,2173.72,Miss French,"Hello, dear. I thought I heard..."
2175.3,2179.27,Miss French,Are you selling something?
2175.3,2179.27,Miss French,"Because I'd like to help you out,"
2179.35,2182.44,Miss French,"but, you see, I'm on a fixed income."
2182.52,2184.56,Buffy,I'm looking for Miss French.
2184.56,2185.73,Miss French,I'm Miss French.
2186.15,2188.9,Buffy,"Natalie French,"
2186.15,2188.9,Buffy,the substitute biology teacher?
2189.4,2191.61,Miss French,"Goodness, that's me!"
2191.7,2194.62,Miss French,I taught for over 30 years.
2194.7,2197.71,Miss French,I retired in 1972.
2197.72,2200.01,Buffy,I can't believe this!
2197.72,2200.01,Buffy,She used Miss French's records
2200.01,2202.15,Buffy,to get into the school.
2200.01,2202.15,Buffy,She could be anywhere.
2202.22,2208.02,Miss French,"No, dear. I'm right here."
2206.34,2208.18,Xander,What's she doing?
2208.26,2210.34,Blayne,I think it's
2211.02,2215.56,Blayne,"eeny, meany, miney"
2218.03,2220.31,Xander,Mo?
2237.43,2239.71,Xander,I'm comin'. I'm comin'.
2260.44,2261.49,Willow,What do we do now?
2261.49,2263.98,Giles,Abject prayer and supplication
2261.49,2263.98,Giles,would spring to mind.
2264.02,2266.09,Buffy,I saw her walking past this park
2264.02,2266.09,Buffy,with her grocery bags.
2266.09,2267.67,Buffy,She lives in this neighborhood.
2267.71,2268.95,Willow,I'm gonna bang on doors.
2268.95,2270.96,Buffy,Wait! No. We do not have time for that.
2271.04,2273.23,Willow,We have to do something!
2273.23,2273.96,Buffy,We will.
2281.8,2283.89,Buffy,I won't be long.
2285.35,2287.44,Giles,Buffy?
2292.98,2294.93,Blayne,"Oh, yeah, here it comes."
2294.93,2296.31,Xander,What's happening?
2296.39,2298.78,Blayne,"How do you like your eggs, bro,"
2296.39,2298.78,Blayne,over easy or sunnyside up?
2298.87,2301.58,Xander,Eggs? She's gonna lay some...
2302.97,2306.04,Natalie,The Californian mantis lays her eggs
2306.04,2310.48,Natalie,and then finds a mate to fertilise them."
2311.71,2313.47,Willow,"Come on, Buffy!"
2319.98,2322.6,,You!
2319.98,2322.6,,Me.
2322.82,2325.42,,Come on! Come on! Where is she?
2325.46,2329.49,,Which house is it?
2325.46,2329.49,,I know you're afraid of her. I saw you!
2329.57,2331.66,,"Come on, come on."
2332.33,2336.04,,What? What is it?
2332.33,2336.04,,"This is her, isn't it? This is her house."
2336.08,2339.17,,This is it! Better than radar!
2340.96,2342.29,,Buffy!
2356.65,2359.44,,Kiss me.
2360.27,2362.53,,Kiss me.
2360.27,2362.53,,Can I say one thing?
2362.57,2364.4,,Help!
2364.43,2366.36,,Help!
2369.16,2372.66,,"Uh, hey! Oover here!"
2369.16,2372.66,,Hello! In the cage!
2373.11,2375.12,,Let him go!
2390.33,2392.6,,Help me!
2390.33,2392.6,,Get them out of here.
2394.77,2396.86,,Help me! Help me!
2398.54,2401.12,,Remember Dr Gregory?
2398.54,2401.12,,You scarfed his head.
2401.16,2404.47,,"Yeah, well, he taught me:"
2401.16,2404.47,,"you do your homework, you learn stuff."
2404.5,2407.58,,Like what happens to your nervous system
2404.5,2407.58,,when you hear this.
2407.61,2410.18,,Extremely important to file
2407.61,2410.18,,not simply alphabetically..."
2410.21,2412.98,,Giles!
2410.21,2412.98,,It's the wrong side!
2441.54,2445.46,,Bat sonar. Makes your
2441.54,2445.46,,whole nervous system go to hell.
2445.54,2447.42,,You can go there with it.
2472.3,2474.85,,"Well, I'd say it's deceased."
2474.85,2476.4,,And dissected.
2476.41,2479.29,,You OK?
2476.41,2479.29,,Yeah.
2479.37,2481.65,,"Just for the record, you were right."
2481.65,2485.29,,"I'm an idiot, and God bless you."
2486.31,2489.13,,"And thank you guys, too."
2486.31,2489.13,,"Yeah, really."
2489.16,2491.92,,Pleasure.
2489.16,2491.92,,I'm really glad you're OK.
2491.96,2495.76,,It's so unfair
2491.96,2495.76,,how she only went after virgins.
2497.17,2498.72,,What?
2498.72,2500.96,,"I mean, here you guys are,"
2498.72,2500.96,,"doing the right thing,"
2500.96,2503.77,,"the smart thing,"
2500.96,2503.77,,when a lot of other boys your age...
2503.81,2508.02,,"Flag down on that play, babe."
2503.81,2508.02,,I am not...
2506.04,2508.69,,"Well, you see,"
2506.04,2508.69,,that's the SheMantis' modus operandi.
2508.69,2510.63,,"Uh, she only preys on the pure."
2510.66,2513.72,,"Well, isn't this a perfect ending"
2510.66,2513.72,,to a wonderful day!
2513.75,2514.92,,My dad's a lawyer.
2514.92,2516.49,,"If anybody repeats this to anybody,"
2516.49,2518.74,,they're gonna find themselves
2516.49,2518.74,,facing a lawsuit.
2518.77,2521.21,,"Blayne, shut up!"
2521.24,2525.47,,I don't think it's bad.
2521.24,2525.47,,I think it's really... sweet.
2525.51,2529.14,,But it's certainly nothing
2525.51,2529.14,,I'll ever bring up again.
2535.47,2538.87,,i></i>
2542.97,2547.17,,"i># It's ladies choice snowball,"
2542.97,2547.17,,the guys are in line</i>
2547.17,2550.84,,i># he knows who he's waiting for</i>
2550.87,2554.71,,i># and she goes and picks somebody else</i>
2554.74,2558.09,,"i># then a stranger finds him, he says,</i>"
2558.13,2559.69,,I heard a rumour there was
2559.69,2564.27,,"one less vampire walking round,"
2559.69,2564.27,,making a nuisance of himself.
2564.31,2568.05,,There is. I guess
2564.31,2568.05,,I should thank you for the tip.
2568.08,2569.71,,The pleasure's mine.
2569.74,2573.89,,"Of course, it would be easier"
2569.74,2573.89,,if I knew how to get in touch with you.
2573.92,2575.86,,I'll be around.
2575.95,2578.05,,Or who you were.
