3.89,8.72,BUFFY,"Spike, this is the Hellmouth."
3.89,8.72,BUFFY,You have a soul? Fine. Show me.
8.81,10.1,BUFFY,Get out of this basement.
10.1,11.8,SPIKE,I don't have anywhere else to go.
11.89,16.56,D'HOFFRYN,There will always be vengeance demons.
11.89,16.56,D'HOFFRYN,"But now you, Anya, you're out."
16.65,19.88,XANDER,Whatever's between us... it doesn't matter.
19.97,22.14,XANDER,You shouldn't be alone in this.
22.14,23.12,ANYA,"Yes, I should."
27.05,28.04,4 INT. XANDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT,You'll live in there.
28.04,30.12,XANDER,"It looks like a closet, but it's a room now."
30.21,34.96,XANDER,Don't touch my food. I take the first shower.
30.21,34.96,XANDER,"If I use all the hot water, tough noogies."
35.05,36.53,XANDER,And I hate this plan.
36.61,40.88,XANDER,"Keeping up, or do you need an English"
36.61,40.88,XANDER,to Constant Pain In My Ass translation?
40.97,42.32,BUFFY,Invitation?
42.41,46.92,XANDER,Is there something more emphatic
42.41,46.92,XANDER,than "hate"? Can I "revile" the plan?
49.02,48.76,XANDER,Fine.
48.85,52,SPIKE,I invite you in. Nimrod.
52.09,54.84,SPIKE,Don't want your sodding food anyway.
54.93,57.03,XANDER,I don't understand when his problems
57.03,58.32,SPIKE,became yours  or mine.
58.41,61.8,BUFFY,The school basement is making him crazy.
58.41,61.8,BUFFY,We can't leave him there.
61.89,68.02,XANDER,Why not? Crazy Basement Guy
61.89,68.02,XANDER,is better than Stalking Buffy Guy.
66.09,68.4,DAWN,It's true. You guys aren't...?
68.49,71.14,DAWN,You're not starting again with the whole...?
71.14,72.88,BUFFY,No. A thousand gallons of no.
72.97,76.93,BUFFY,It's just things are different now.
72.97,76.93,BUFFY,He has a soul.
79.02,80.56,XANDER,I'm sure that'll be a comfort
79.02,80.56,XANDER,when he soulfully attacks you again.
80.65,85.72,DAWN,"Yeah, what does that mean exactly?"
80.65,85.72,DAWN,That Spike is all soulhaving?
85.81,89.77,BUFFY,"I don't know. But he's been through a lot, OK?"
85.81,89.77,BUFFY,And nobody is attacking...
89.85,91.56,SPIKE,Buffy...
91.65,93.13,SPIKE,Sorry.
93.21,94.67,BUFFY,"No, it's me. I just..."
94.67,96.32,SPIKE,I'll go. This can't work.
96.41,99.05,BUFFY,It will. It already is.
99.13,104.15,BUFFY,You've been out for half an hour and you've
99.13,104.15,BUFFY,already stopped talking to invisible people.
104.25,105.57,SPIKE,Bollocks.
105.65,107.4,BUFFY,There was that episode in the car.
107.4,108.84,SPIKE,Bollocks to the whole thing.
108.93,111.28,SPIKE,I don't need your mollycoddling.
111.28,112.6,BUFFY,It's not coddling.
113.29,115.88,BUFFY,Now go to your closet.
117.85,119.28,DAWN,i></i> So what is it?
119.28,120.57,BUFFY,i></i> What's what?
120.65,124.72,DAWN,"i></i> Last night, you said you weren't"
120.65,124.72,DAWN,helping Spike out of pity. What is it?
124.81,127.4,BUFFY,i></i> That's a good question.
128.77,133.2,DAWN,Is sitting there drinking soda
128.77,133.2,DAWN,some kind of a Zen nonanswer?
135.41,137.6,BUFFY,"No, I just..."
138.77,140.92,BUFFY,I don't know what I'm feeling.
143.02,144.76,BUFFY,"I think I can't stand him,"
143.02,144.76,BUFFY,but then sometimes...
145.89,147.77,DAWN,You love him?
147.77,148.2,BUFFY,No.
148.29,151.08,BUFFY,I... I feel for him.
152.49,154.85,DAWN,"Feel what, exactly?"
154.85,155.72,BUFFY,Dawn...
155.81,159.56,DAWN,"No, I'm just trying to understand."
159.65,162.08,DAWN,"I mean, none of it makes sense."
162.17,165.8,DAWN,"First you say Spike disgusts you,"
162.17,165.8,DAWN,but you're doing it like bunnies.
165.89,170.64,DAWN,"And then Spike says he'd die for you,"
165.89,170.64,DAWN,but he tries to rape you.
170.73,176.36,BUFFY,"For the record, Spike knew how wrong it was."
170.73,176.36,BUFFY,That's why he went away.
176.45,179.88,DAWN,But to get a soul?
176.45,179.88,DAWN,Like that would make him a better man?
179.97,182.92,DAWN,Xander had a soul
179.97,182.92,DAWN,"when he stood Anya up at the altar,"
185.02,185.8,DAWN,and now he says he still wants her?
186.93,190.89,DAWN,I just don't think it's the school basement
186.93,190.89,DAWN,that's making people crazy.
190.97,193.54,BUFFY,I should really get back. You coming with?
193.54,195.68,DAWN,I just don't see why people bother.
195.77,200,DAWN,"I mean, you put all this energy into"
195.77,200,DAWN,chasing and having and brooding and...
200.09,203.04,DAWN,I don't get these relationships
200.09,203.04,DAWN,where you do insane things.
203.13,204.03,BUFFY,"Bye, Rant Girl."
204.03,206.44,DAWN,"You could, like, paint a beautiful mural"
206.53,208.68,DAWN,on every ugly wall in the world.
208.77,213.24,DAWN,Then you could paint a beautiful mural
208.77,213.24,DAWN,on every ugly mural in the wor...

295.49,298.21,ANYA,Maybe I'm not the right Anyanka.
295.49,298.21,ANYA,Ever think about that?
298.29,303.08,ANYA,There's tons of Anyankas out there.
298.29,303.08,ANYA,Maybe one of them pissed off this...
303.17,305.66,ANYA,What did you say his name was?
305.66,307.16,BUFFY,D'Hoffrynfefeffer?
311.25,317.02,BUFFY,Good thing I stopped by
311.25,317.02,BUFFY,and heard screaming.
316.69,320.2,BUFFY,"So, I guess D'Hoffryn"
316.69,320.2,BUFFY,decided to take you out after all?
320.29,322.16,ANYA,Yeah.
322.25,326.48,ANYA,"He's, uh... not Head of Vengeance for nothing."
328.53,331.76,ANYA,"Well, thank you for the generous lifesaving."
331.85,334.6,ANYA,"Now, please go away."
342.02,343.08,ANYA,"Look, I don't need anyone's help."
343.17,345.73,ANYA,"Or, OK, clearly I do,"
345.81,350.28,ANYA,"but I don't want to need anyone's help,"
345.81,350.28,ANYA,so stop helping.
354.02,356.96,BUFFY,"I get it. After last week, you feel"
354.02,356.96,BUFFY,you need to be all renegade and broody.
357.97,359.43,BUFFY,Taking yourself out of the loop.
359.43,360.8,ANYA,I need to figure out who I am.
360.89,363.28,BUFFY,Another something bad is happening.
364.33,368.64,BUFFY,I don't want my friends
364.33,368.64,BUFFY,"out there alone right now, OK?"
375.69,378.8,ANYA,"Well, I guess you guys"
375.69,378.8,ANYA,could use my help.
379.21,384.52,ANYA,Willow's not very good with the practical
379.21,384.52,ANYA,strategising. Except when she's evil.
384.61,386.72,ANYA,And Dawn... she's not good for anything.

449.37,451.52,DAWN,What a drag.
451.61,454.15,R.J.,I actually kinda liked him.

490.73,493.19,R.J.,You think Coach'd start you at quarterback?
493.19,493.88,JOCK FRIEND,Just saying.
493.97,496.36,DAWN,The quarterback is
493.97,496.36,DAWN,the most important member.
496.45,499.32,DAWN,He is like the rudder that guides the ship.
501.73,504.49,R.J.,Right. Could I give you a hand with that?

617.69,620.15,BUFFY,gonna be good for videos.
620.25,624.48,XANDER,"Right, with the wailing and the crying."
620.25,624.48,XANDER,Still better than a cosy evening with Spike.
624.57,628.35,XANDER,Shall I order a pizza?
624.57,628.35,XANDER,Don't teens in a snit like pizza?
628.45,630.56,DAWN,It is not a snit!
630.65,634.48,DAWN,"I finally met him  the guy of my dreams,"
630.65,634.48,DAWN,OK?  and I blew it.
634.57,637.08,DAWN,RJ hates me now.
637.17,639.4,BUFFY,"Dawn, what is that?"
639.49,641.72,DAWN,Just the end of my life.
648.25,653.56,XANDER,Remember when she used to have a crush
648.25,653.56,XANDER,on me? I miss the much cuter "me" crush.
653.65,656.72,BUFFY,i></i>
660.93,662.89,BUFFY,You shredded my outfit.
662.89,664.84,DAWN,I'll buy you a new one.

664.93,668.24,BUFFY,I don't want a new cheerleading outfit.
668.33,670.44,XANDER,"Now, now, let's not be hasty."
670.53,672.92,XANDER,Not the right time.
679.13,681.88,BUFFY,"Dawn, I'm sorry that you feel so bad, OK?"
681.97,684.84,BUFFY,But in the morning
681.97,684.84,BUFFY,this won't seem so terrible.
684.93,687.8,BUFFY,You don't even know this RJ. Not really.
688.85,690.88,DAWN,I do know him.
690.97,695.02,DAWN,I know his soul.
693.09,696.72,BUFFY,"Really? Dawn, he wasn't even"
693.09,696.72,BUFFY,on your radar yesterday.
696.81,701.72,XANDER,It's the jacket. It's true. The big letter on the
696.81,701.72,XANDER,chest makes girls get all swoony and crushy.
701.81,707.56,XANDER,I saw it all the time in school. You couldn't
701.81,707.56,XANDER,just pin a felt letter to your coat and get play.
707.65,709.29,XANDER,Not that I tried.
709.29,710.92,DAWN,It isn't a crush.
713.02,712.96,DAWN,It's love.
713.05,715.08,DAWN,I love RJ.

719.05,724.02,DAWN,I don't feel what I feel?
722.09,725.97,BUFFY,"No, of course not."
722.09,725.97,BUFFY,I believe that you think it's real.
726.05,728.64,BUFFY,"It seems real, to you."
729.97,734.88,DAWN,Know what? Maybe I don't want advice
729.97,734.88,DAWN,from the dysfunction queen.
734.97,737.76,DAWN,You have no idea how I feel.
738.73,741.52,DAWN,You have no idea what real love is.
742.49,744.84,DAWN,"Maybe if you did,"
742.49,744.84,DAWN,you wouldn't make fun of me.
744.93,748.12,BUFFY,"Dawn, I'm not making fun of you."
748.12,748.92,DAWN,Just go.

761.65,765.4,R.J.,"I told you, all those fumbles in practice "
761.65,765.4,R.J.,he was gonna come down on you.
765.49,768.16,JOCK FRIEND,I'm starting on Saturday.
768.53,771.28,R.J.,Great. Who knew fumbling
768.53,771.28,R.J.,all the time was the key?
771.37,775.56,JOCK FRIEND,It's just time to let someone else have a turn.
771.37,775.56,JOCK FRIEND,And you knew this was comin'.
775.65,777.64,R.J.,Yeah. Sure.
785.97,787.63,DAWN,You can't do this to RJ.
787.63,788.88,JOCK FRIEND,"Oh, hey, it's you."
788.97,791.4,JOCK FRIEND,Nice cheering the other day.
791.49,793.88,DAWN,It isn't fair. He works so hard.
793.97,796.48,JOCK FRIEND,What do you care?
793.97,796.48,JOCK FRIEND,This is how the game is played.
796.57,799.76,JOCK FRIEND,"It's dog eat dog, may the best man win."
799.85,802.44,DAWN,But nobody's better than RJ.
803.41,806.72,JOCK FRIEND,"Yeah, well, that's not really"
803.41,806.72,JOCK FRIEND,"up to you, is it? Hm?"
821.41,823.4,DAWN,It all happened so fast.
823.49,827.92,DAWN,"One minute he was walking,"
823.49,827.92,DAWN,and the next he stumbled and... and he fell.
828.69,831.88,PRINCIPAL,Why would he say
828.69,831.88,PRINCIPAL,you pushed him down the stairs?
831.97,834.32,DAWN,I don't know.
831.97,834.32,DAWN,Maybe he was just embarrassed.
834.41,842.02,DAWN,"It's hard being clumsy, especially"
834.41,842.02,DAWN,when you're popular and athletic. I'd bet.
840.09,843.97,PRINCIPAL,"To be candid, it wouldn't be the first time"
840.09,843.97,PRINCIPAL,I caught O'Donnell in a lie.
844.05,846.48,BUFFY,It'd be nice if they didn't involve my sister.
846.48,848.12,DAWN,I'll have to call Coach Wheeler
848.21,850.72,PRINCIPAL,and tell him the bad news.
850.81,853.25,PRINCIPAL,Not a conversation I really wanna have.
853.25,855.76,DAWN,At least he's still got RJ to take over.
855.85,858.49,PRINCIPAL,Yeah. I think we have
855.85,858.49,PRINCIPAL,everything we need for now.
858.57,862.04,PRINCIPAL,I'm sorry you had
858.57,862.04,PRINCIPAL,"to get involved in this, Dawn."

888.85,894.08,DAWN,"God, it's like I have a disease or something."
888.85,894.08,DAWN,It was really no big deal.
894.17,896.81,R.J.,No. It was.
896.89,899.61,R.J.,I think it's cool that you faced him. Wood.
900.17,904.76,DAWN,We just talked. He just wanted me

906.05,907.37,R.J.,Yeah.
907.45,911.2,R.J.,It sucks when these things

1614.73,1617.32,R.J.,"Hey, guy. It's called knocking."
1617.69,1621.8,XANDER,I'm sorry. Checkout time was an hour ago.
1617.69,1621.8,XANDER,We were hoping to make up the bed.
1621.89,1627.02,XANDER,"And also, it's a classroom,"
1621.89,1627.02,XANDER,you chowderhead!
1625.09,1628.64,XANDER,"Now get off the boy, Buffy."
1625.09,1628.64,XANDER,We're going home.
1629.93,1633.44,BUFFY,"Dawn, please stop crying. Please?"
1633.77,1636.41,BUFFY,Crying isn't gonna make
1633.77,1636.41,BUFFY,his love for me go away.
1636.49,1639.16,XANDER,You're under a love spell.
1636.49,1639.16,XANDER,That's what this has to be.
1639.25,1642.32,BUFFY,You're right. He's right.
1642.41,1645.4,BUFFY,You're under a spell.
1642.41,1645.4,BUFFY,"Oh, poor little Dawnie."
1645.49,1647.92,WILLOW,But we're working on it.
1645.49,1647.92,WILLOW,It'll be better soon.
1650.02,1652.32,ANYA,Yes. Soon neither one of you
1650.02,1652.32,ANYA,will be in love with this boy.
1652.41,1653.25,BUFFY,He's not a boy.
1653.25,1655.05,DAWN,What do you know about our love?
1655.13,1659.12,DAWN,It's true and real.
1655.13,1659.12,DAWN,This isn't magic. This is my heart.
1659.97,1660.57,ANYA,Fine.
1660.57,1662.61,XANDER,We'll be working.
1663.61,1668.36,WILLOW,"Look, I know this feels terrible,"
1663.61,1668.36,WILLOW,but it isn't real. Try to hold on to that.
1668.45,1670.96,BUFFY,Did you hear that? It isn't real.
1671.05,1672.65,BUFFY,You're just crazy.
1672.65,1674.96,DAWN,It is so real! I love him.
1675.05,1680.07,DAWN,"You knew how I felt, like I'd finally"
1675.05,1680.07,DAWN,"found something, and you betrayed me."
1680.17,1685.32,BUFFY,I betrayed you? <i>You</i> constructed this
1680.17,1685.32,BUFFY,elaborate fantasy about you and my lover.
1685.41,1687.53,DAWN,Your lover? Your lover?!
1687.53,1688.68,WILLOW,"Guys, guys..."
1688.77,1690.4,BUFFY,I tried to get you to back away.
1690.4,1691.88,DAWN,That's right! You lied to me!
1691.97,1694.43,BUFFY,Did you want me to tell you
1691.97,1694.43,BUFFY,he's in love with me?
1694.53,1697.03,BUFFY,That your little crush is hopeless?
1697.03,1698.24,DAWN,It's not a crush!
1698.33,1701.32,DAWN,Stop. You're not supposed to do this!
1701.32,1701.64,BUFFY,Why?
1701.73,1705.72,BUFFY,"Because he's younger than me? You know,"
1701.73,1705.72,BUFFY,I'm extremely youthful. And peppy.
1705.81,1708.16,DAWN,No.
1708.25,1711.36,DAWN,Cos you were the one I trusted.
1713.73,1716.32,BUFFY,"Dawn, wait!"
1713.73,1716.32,BUFFY,i></i>
1717.85,1719.55,ANYA,"Crazy lust puppies, aren't they?"
1719.55,1721.2,XANDER,At least the yelling went away.
1721.29,1723.93,XANDER,It started to sound
1721.29,1723.93,XANDER,like Christmas with my family.
1726.02,1726.6,WILLOW,Love spells. People forget
1726.02,1726.6,WILLOW,how dangerous they can be.
1726.69,1728.28,XANDER,"Hey, been there."
1728.37,1730.32,XANDER,Xander!
1728.37,1730.32,XANDER,Xander!
1730.73,1732.88,XANDER,Stop it! Stop!
1734.73,1735.98,XANDER,Good times.
1735.98,1737.8,WILLOW,Here. Something.
1738.21,1741.36,BUFFY,She's locked her door.
1738.21,1741.36,BUFFY,That spell has her good and loopy.
1741.45,1742.73,WILLOW,Info on one RJ Brooks.
1742.73,1744.76,BUFFY,"Oh, let me see. Is there a picture?"
1744.85,1749.56,XANDER,"Family stuff. Hey, I knew his brother."
1744.85,1749.56,XANDER,He was a big jock at Sunnydale High too.
1749.65,1753.24,XANDER,Couple of years ahead of us.
1749.65,1753.24,XANDER,He used to stick chewing gum in my hair.
1753.33,1756.32,WILLOW,Hm.
1753.33,1756.32,WILLOW,What are you thinking?
1756.41,1762.4,XANDER,I think my relationship with RJ's brother was
1756.41,1762.4,XANDER,"complex at best, but maybe he's a way in."
1762.49,1764.44,BUFFY,Now look for a picture.
1765.81,1772.02,XANDER,We're tangling with a powerful spell here
1765.81,1772.02,XANDER,"and we don't know what the deal is,"
1770.09,1777.02,XANDER,so keep an eye out if this guy looks twitchy.
1770.09,1777.02,XANDER,"And don't let this guy charm you, either."
1775.09,1780.4,XANDER,He had everyone around him practically
1775.09,1780.4,XANDER,kissing his ring back in high school.
1785.49,1787.24,BROTHER,Yeah?
1789.93,1791.96,BROTHER,"Construction, huh? That's awesome."
1791.96,1792.68,XANDER,i></i> Yeah.
1792.77,1797.04,BROTHER,"So, what's up with RJ?"
1792.77,1797.04,BROTHER,How's he doing at the old alpha mater?
1797.13,1802.84,XANDER,Good. It's just... I know a girl that might be
1797.13,1802.84,XANDER,going out with him and I was wondering...
1802.93,1805.16,XANDER,"God, and you wanna know if he's a good guy."
1805.16,1806.4,BROTHER,"Truth is, he's the best."
1806.49,1811.24,BROTHER,Following in my footsteps. You might not
1806.49,1811.24,BROTHER,"know it now, with a couple of extra pounds,"
1811.33,1814.28,BROTHER,"but back then, I was quite the guy."
1814.37,1817.44,XANDER,"Yeah, I gather that RJ is pretty popular too."
1817.93,1821.6,BROTHER,"I gotta tell ya, there was a time"
1817.93,1821.6,BROTHER,I was worried about RJ.
1821.69,1826.71,BROTHER,"He used to be all into comic books,"
1821.69,1826.71,BROTHER,"Model UN, geek stuff  no offence, Harris."
1826.81,1830.08,BROTHER,"One time, I found"
1826.81,1830.08,BROTHER,all this poetry under his bed.
1830.17,1833.04,BROTHER,"Turns out, he wrote it."
1833.13,1837.48,BROTHER,"Then he, uh... what do you call it?"
1833.13,1837.48,BROTHER,Blossomed. That's what it was like.
1838.73,1843.56,XANDER,"And do you have any idea why he, you know,"
1838.73,1843.56,XANDER,burst into a flower all of a sudd...?
1843.65,1847.8,SPIKE,i></i> You're wearing your brother's jacket.
1843.65,1847.8,SPIKE,"Here, in this picture."
1847.89,1849.54,SPIKE,"No, he's wearing mine. That jacket"
1849.54,1851.67,BROTHER,was with me all the way through high school.
1851.77,1855.6,BROTHER,"Gave it to him when I graduated,"
1851.77,1855.6,BROTHER,right before I started at the Pizza Barn.
1855.69,1859.8,XANDER,I'm in the management programme.
1855.69,1859.8,XANDER,"So, Lance, where did <i>you</i> get the jacket?"
1859.89,1862.68,LANCE/BROTHER,"Oh, Dad gave it to me."
1859.89,1862.68,LANCE/BROTHER,Made a big deal about it too.
1862.77,1866.55,LANCE/BROTHER,How he met Mom wearing that jacket.
1862.77,1866.55,LANCE/BROTHER,She was a former Miss Arkansas.
1866.65,1868.28,LANCE/BROTHER,Very hot in her day.
1868.28,1870.08,XANDER,"Wow, that's wonderful."
1870.17,1871.5,XANDER,"Boy, it's getting late."
1871.5,1873.36,LANCE,You guys don't have to take off.
1873.45,1876.88,LANCE,I got sort of a rumpus room
1873.45,1876.88,LANCE,set up in the basement.
1876.97,1880.2,LANCE,There's air hockey and a mini fridge.
1880.29,1882.16,LANCE,We could party.
1882.25,1884.71,MRS. BROOKS (O.S.),i></i> Lance?
1882.25,1884.71,MRS. BROOKS (O.S.),Do you have guests?
1884.81,1887.16,MRS. BROOKS (O.S.),There's boxes of raisins
1884.81,1887.16,MRS. BROOKS (O.S.),if you want snacks.
1887.25,1889.04,XANDER,We really gotta go.
1890.21,1894.36,WILLOW,Damn love spell. I have tried
1890.21,1894.36,WILLOW,every antilove spell spell I can find.
1894.45,1900.28,ANYA,"Even if you found the right one, he'd probably"
1894.45,1900.28,ANYA,just do an antiantilove spell spell... spell.
1900.37,1902.2,WILLOW,What?
1900.37,1902.2,WILLOW,i> </i>
1902.29,1907.16,WILLOW,I'll get it. Maybe it's Xander
1902.29,1907.16,WILLOW,with some answers from the brother.
1909.41,1910.86,WILLOW,"Oh, you have to be..."
1910.86,1913.48,R.J.,I was looking for Buffy. Miss Summers.
1913.57,1917.2,WILLOW,Buffy's not here. Go away!
1917.2,1919.02,R.J.,Are you sure?
1917.09,1919.76,ANYA,No Buffy for you. Leave quickly now.
1919.85,1921.84,R.J.,Uh... OK.
1922.57,1924.72,R.J.,Tell her to call me.
1925.49,1927.48,WILLOW,Man!
1927.57,1930.52,ANYA,Good thing Buffy and Dawn are upstairs.
1930.61,1932.8,ANYA,i>(# "Theme From A Summer Place"</i>
1932.8,1934.08,WILLOW,i>by Percy Faith)</i>
1943.45,1944.94,WILLOW,But you don't even know him!
1944.94,1947.33,ANYA,"Yes, I do. I looked into him. I saw his soul."
1947.41,1950.6,WILLOW,"He was walking away,"
1947.41,1950.6,WILLOW,so unless his soul is in his ass...
1950.69,1953.08,ANYA,AJ is my best friend
1950.69,1953.08,ANYA,and my dearest darling.
1953.17,1957.64,WILLOW,It's RJ. And what you were picking up on
1953.17,1957.64,WILLOW,was his deep caring and devotion to me.
1957.73,1958.62,DAWN,What's going on?
1958.62,1960.8,ANYA,"Willow's in love with my boyfriend, RJ."
1960.89,1963.8,DAWN,What? No! You two can't do this.
1963.89,1966.64,BUFFY,"Willow, you're a gay woman. And he isn't."
1966.73,1970.56,WILLOW,This isn't about his physical presence.
1966.73,1970.56,WILLOW,It's about his heart.
1970.65,1972.55,ANYA,His physical presence has a penis!
1972.55,1973.72,WILLOW,I can work around it!
1973.81,1976.2,DAWN,This isn't fair!
1973.81,1976.2,DAWN,How can you all do this to me?
1976.29,1981,BUFFY,"OK, wait. Everyone wait. Just calm down,"
1976.29,1981,BUFFY,OK? I think I know what this is.
1981.37,1985.8,BUFFY,"Clearly, you've both been affected"
1981.37,1985.8,BUFFY,by the same love spell that got Dawn.
1985.89,1988.76,DAWN,This isn't a spell.
1985.89,1988.76,DAWN,He owns my heart.
1988.85,1991.41,BUFFY,"Dawn, be quiet."
1988.85,1991.41,BUFFY,We don't need you interfering.
1991.49,1994.92,WILLOW,There's a simple answer to this.
1991.49,1994.92,WILLOW,Think about who loves him the most.
1997.02,1999.32,WILLOW,"Clearly I do, since I'm willing"
1997.02,1999.32,WILLOW,to look past the whole orientation thing.
1999.41,2000.02,DAWN,I need him.
2000.02,2002.28,ANYA,You're gonna have to do better than that.
2002.37,2003.56,ANYA,I'd kill for him.
2003.56,2005.72,WILLOW,You'd kill for a chocolate bar.
2005.81,2007.76,BUFFY,No.
2005.81,2007.76,BUFFY,Yes!
2007.85,2010.92,BUFFY,Kill for him.
2007.85,2010.92,BUFFY,I'm the Slayer. Slayer means kill.
2011.93,2014.57,BUFFY,"Oh, I'll kill the principal."
2014.65,2016.21,ANYA,That is hard to top.
2016.21,2018.24,WILLOW,"Yeah, well, I have skills."
2018.33,2020.34,WILLOW,I can prove my love with magic.
2020.34,2021.12,ANYA,"Yeah, right."
2021.21,2024.28,ANYA,"What're you gonna do,"
2021.21,2024.28,ANYA,use magic to make him into a girl?
2024.37,2026.16,ANYA,Damn!
2026.93,2029.96,ANYA,"i></i> Wait, I know what he'll like."
2034.65,2038.69,BUFFY,"Sorry, Dawnie."
2034.65,2038.69,BUFFY,You're never gonna get him.
2038.77,2040.84,DAWN,No.
2040.93,2042.2,DAWN,Never.
2095.05,2098.2,WILLOW,"Oh, Hecate, I call on you."
2098.29,2100.8,WILLOW,I humbly ask your will be done.
2100.89,2104.32,WILLOW,"Hear my request, a simple change."
2104.41,2107.08,WILLOW,Create a daughter from a s...
2108.41,2111.52,WILLOW,"Oh, man! Now I've gotta start all over."
2108.41,2111.52,WILLOW,Hecate hates that.
2111.61,2113.5,XANDER,What the hell are you doing?
2113.5,2115.32,WILLOW,Proving I love RJ the most.
2115.41,2117.12,WILLOW,"Will, honey."
2118.89,2121.04,WILLOW,RJ's a guy.
2118.89,2121.04,WILLOW,"I did notice that, yeah."
2121.13,2125.52,WILLOW,"That's why I'm doing my spell, cos"
2121.13,2125.52,WILLOW,he doesn't have to be. Hand me my crystals.
2125.61,2127.84,WILLOW,I don't have much time.
2125.61,2127.84,WILLOW,Before what?
2127.93,2131.32,WILLOW,"Before Buffy, Anya and Dawn"
2127.93,2131.32,WILLOW,prove they love RJ the most.
2131.41,2132.79,XANDER,How are they gonna do that?
2132.79,2134.64,WILLOW,Buffy's gonna kill Principal Wood...
2134.73,2136.44,XANDER,"Fine, OK, let's start there."
2163.89,2165.48,38 INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT,Hey!
2168.57,2170.31,BUFFY,What are you guys doing?
2170.31,2173.36,WILLOW,Locator spell. Human variety. Almost done.
2173.73,2178.2,BUFFY,I've got a principal to kill.
2173.73,2178.2,BUFFY,What's going on? Who are we looking for?
2178.29,2180.28,BUFFY,i></i>
2193.02,2193.8,BUFFY,You realise Anya's probably
2193.02,2193.8,BUFFY,seducing RJ as we speak?
2193.89,2194.83,WILLOW,God. You think so?
2194.83,2196.24,BUFFY,I wouldn't put it past her.
2196.33,2198.02,BUFFY,"She's recently evil, you know."
2198.02,2199.76,WILLOW,So am I. Why should I miss out?
2199.85,2202.16,XANDER,"Hey, crazy chicks, look."
2202.25,2203.92,BUFFY,Dawn?
2206.02,2205.87,BUFFY,Dawn!

2243.45,2245.67,BUFFY,What were you doing? What is this?
2245.67,2246.84,DAWN,It doesn't matter.
2246.93,2250.32,BUFFY,This is a plan?
2246.93,2250.32,BUFFY,You're gonna steal RJ by being trisected?
2250.41,2252.4,DAWN,What am I? Gonna compete with you?
2252.49,2256.16,DAWN,You're older and hotter
2252.49,2256.16,DAWN,and have sex that's rough and kill people.
2256.25,2260.44,DAWN,I don't have any of that stuff.
2256.25,2260.44,DAWN,"But if I did this, then his whole life he'd know"
2260.53,2263.92,DAWN,there was someone that loved him
2260.53,2263.92,DAWN,so much they'd give up their life.
2266.02,2265.44,BUFFY,Dawn...
2266.21,2269.44,DAWN,"And it would be true, forever."
2269.93,2272.44,BUFFY,No guy is worth your life. Not ever.
2272.97,2276.75,DAWN,RJ is. And don't say he isn't.
2272.97,2276.75,DAWN,Look what you were willing to do.
2277.13,2280.48,BUFFY,"Dawn, I would give him to you"
2277.13,2280.48,BUFFY,in a second if I could.
2280.57,2283.32,BUFFY,That's how much you're scaring me.
2284.37,2288.36,DAWN,But I thought you wanted him... for you.
2289.73,2291.32,BUFFY,Nah.
2292.33,2294.32,BUFFY,"Well, yeah."
2295.29,2297.75,BUFFY,"My God, that boy is hot."
2298.65,2300.13,BUFFY,Sorry.
2300.21,2303.53,BUFFY,I think I might be under a spell here.
2303.53,2304.4,DAWN,I hear ya.
2313.73,2316.82,XANDER,"Now, you're sure you understand the plan?"

2334.49,2339.92,BUFFY,"Xander, be honest. You didn't think about"
2334.49,2339.92,BUFFY,slipping that jacket on just a little bit?
