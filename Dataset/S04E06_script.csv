387.61,389.28,Oz ,Bad dream?
389.28,390.61,Willow ,I guess.
391.37,394.05,Willow ,But the wakingup part makes up for it.
395.93,398.81,Oz ,It's always so busy in there.
398.89,400.88,Willow ,Not always.

440.73,443.61,Willow ,Are you sure? You can lock yourself up?
443.69,448.29,Willow ,It's only this one month. After orientation

448.37,450.36,Oz ,I'll be fine.

455.09,458.85,Oz ,The only thing I mind
455.09,458.85,Oz ,is being away from you for three nights.
472.17,475.17,Walsh ,"Ms Summers, I want you to prepare"
472.17,475.17,Walsh ,to lead a discussion group

481.05,484.49,Walsh ,"If you have any questions,"
481.05,484.49,Walsh ,bring them up with one of the TAs.
489.53,491.52,Willow ,Are you OK? How'd you do?
493.09,496.17,Willow ,"This is good. I mean, this is excellent."
496.97,499.85,Willow ,You did better than me. This is so unfair.
501.17,504.93,Willow ,You made me jealous of you
501.17,504.93,Willow ,academically. Buffy!
506.13,508.04,Buffy ,I know. Can you believe it?
508.13,514.02,Willow ,Wow. I guess Professor Walsh
508.13,514.02,Willow ,isn't so ogrey after all.
512.09,515.29,Buffy ,And she wants me
512.09,515.29,Buffy ,to lead a discussion group next class.
515.37,519.65,Buffy ,"That means more work, right?"
515.37,519.65,Buffy ,Shouldn't she have a better reward system?
519.73,523.57,Buffy ,"You know, like a cookie"
519.73,523.57,Buffy ,"or a toy surprise, like at the dentist?"
523.65,526.49,Willow ,She wants you to lead a discussion group?
526.57,528.61,Willow ,OK. Jealous again.
528.69,531.08,Willow ,"Jealous, jealous... OK, I'm back."
531.17,534.29,Willow ,"Hey, I'm meeting Oz at the caf√©."

536.81,539.96,Buffy ,Great. I'm TAbound now
536.81,539.96,Buffy ,and then I will catch up with you guys.
540.05,542.04,Willow ,Cool.
552.29,554.85,Veruca ,"What are you gonna do, sit on the ground?"
554.93,557.04,Oz ,My girlfriend's comin'.
557.04,558.24,Veruca ,There's room.
566.85,568.73,Oz ,Big lunch.
568.81,572.69,Veruca ,"I like to eat. I hate chicks who are, like,"
568.81,572.69,Veruca ,Does it have dressing on it?"
572.77,574.37,Oz ,Agreed.
576.45,578.22,Oz ,You guys were tight last night.
578.22,578.68,Veruca ,I guess.
578.77,582.04,Veruca ,The amps still sound dirty to me.
582.04,585.02,Oz ,What are you using? 50 or 120?
591.97,594.69,Willow ,Hey.
591.97,594.69,Willow ,Hey.
595.13,596.96,Willow ,Hey.
597.05,599.04,Oz ,You wanna sit down?
609.33,614.2,Oz ,So you should be using a 50. Blue Voodoo 
609.33,614.2,Oz ,not your best bet unless you dig the distort.
614.29,619.49,Willow ,"Music talk, huh? Cool."
614.29,619.49,Willow ,I love to listen to Oz talk about the biz.
619.97,622.28,Veruca ,What do you like again? I know you told me.
622.37,624.89,Oz ,There's a couple of good ones.
622.37,624.89,Oz ,The Johnson Mil.
624.97,626.12,Oz ,The No.1 is Redbone.
626.12,628.2,Veruca ,No.1? No. I gotta go with Hound Dog.
628.29,632.65,Willow ,Me too. That's a great song.
628.29,632.65,Willow ,"I mean, Elvis, what a guy."
633.33,634.62,Veruca ,You a big Elvis fan?
634.62,635.4,Willow ,The biggest.
635.49,637.85,Willow ,"Well, I mean, after Dingoes, of course."
638.69,643.13,Oz ,We're actually talking amps. But it's easy
638.69,643.13,Oz ,"to get confused, the names they give 'em."
650.25,653.45,Oz ,"You know, I gotta bail. I'll call you later."
665.05,667.04,Veruca ,"I should go, too."
668.85,670.84,Veruca ,Good shirt.
675.37,677.93,Buffy ,Check out the rapid exits. Was it me?
678.57,681.49,Willow ,Me. I don't speak musicianese.
682.69,684.69,Willow ,How come you didn't tell me I look like
684.69,686.53,Buffy ,a crazy birthday cake in this shirt?
686.61,690.05,Buffy ,I thought that was the point.
686.61,690.05,Buffy ,He thinks she's sexy.
690.13,694.17,Buffy ,He gets this blushy thing
690.13,694.17,Buffy ,going on behind his ears.
695.17,698.56,Buffy ,That's for me only.
695.17,698.56,Buffy ,It doesn't mean anything.
698.65,701.85,Buffy ,So Oz checks out another girl. He loves you.
701.93,704.03,Buffy ,I know. I know. And I don't
704.03,705.97,Willow ,wanna be the kind of girl
706.05,709.89,Willow ,who freaks every time
706.05,709.89,Willow ,my boyfriend notices somebody else.
709.97,713.97,Willow ,"I mean, I have wrong feelings"
709.97,713.97,Willow ,"about other guys sometimes,"
714.05,717.6,Willow ,but I feel guilty and I flog and punish.
717.69,722.05,Buffy ,Exactly. I'm sure Oz
717.69,722.05,Buffy ,is flogging and punishing himself...
722.13,725.17,Buffy ,This is sounding wrong before I even finish.
725.25,729.57,Buffy ,"Look, I promise you, in a couple of days"
725.25,729.57,Buffy ,it's gonna be like "Veruca who?"
729.89,731.11,Willow ,You think?
731.11,732.45,Buffy ,Absolutely.
733.25,735.29,Buffy ,Oz just isn't the type to stray.
736.37,739.52,Buffy ,"Not tonight, anyways."
736.37,739.52,Buffy ,He'll be locked in a cage.
784.09,786.08,Oz ,Hello?
809.13,810.49,Veruca ,"Oh, God!"
853.41,855.4,Veruca ,Morning.
864.21,867.52,Veruca ,That was some night.
870.13,872.2,Oz ,So it appears.
872.29,874.6,Veruca ,Right. You don't remember.
876.65,881.44,Veruca ,"It's like that at first, but then little bits"
876.65,881.44,Veruca ,and pieces'll start coming back to you.
882.01,883.02,Oz ,So you're a...
883.02,884.24,Veruca ,Werewolf groupie.
885.09,887.56,Veruca ,Nobody else gets it done for me.
887.65,888.65,Oz ,What?
888.65,890.25,Veruca ,Kidding.
892.17,894.16,Veruca ,You know what I am.
896.73,899.53,Veruca ,You've known
896.73,899.53,Veruca ,since the first time you saw me.
902.53,904.44,Veruca ,"Now, you..."
904.53,907.29,Veruca ,need to relax.
907.37,909.36,Oz ,Not a possibility.
913.93,916.49,Veruca ,So what do you wanna do?
920.05,921.53,Veruca ,God!
921.61,925.05,Veruca ,The kids in this dorm
921.61,925.05,Veruca ,need Fashion 101 in a big way.
926.89,929.77,Veruca ,Or we could start right here at home.
931.17,933.24,Veruca ,I'm not making a statement.
933.33,936.93,Oz ,"Just wanna get back to my place,"
933.33,936.93,Oz ,figure out why we got out of our cages.
937.01,939.1,Veruca ,You have a cage?
939.1,940.4,Oz ,Don't you?
940.89,945.57,Veruca ,Yeah. It has a little wheel with
940.89,945.57,Veruca ,a plastic ball and a cute little bell in it.
946.85,949.41,Veruca ,God! Somebody's domesticated
946.85,949.41,Veruca ,the hell out of you.
949.49,952.21,Oz ,It's my choice. I don't wanna hurt anybody.
952.29,956.97,Veruca ,Maybe. Or maybe you just don't
952.29,956.97,Veruca ,wanna admit what happened to you.
957.05,959.89,Veruca ,Maybe you just wanna pretend
957.05,959.89,Veruca ,like you're a regular guy.
959.97,963.17,Oz ,"Well, I am."
959.97,963.17,Oz ,I'm only a wolf three nights a month.
963.25,967.41,Veruca ,"You're the wolf all the time,"
963.25,967.41,Veruca ,and this human face is just your disguise.
967.49,969.69,Veruca ,"You ever think about that, Oz?"
969.77,973.05,Oz ,"I'm going to check the paper,"
969.77,973.05,Oz ,see if we did any damage last night.
973.13,975.12,Oz ,We did.
976.53,978.52,Veruca ,But only to each other.
979.09,982.05,Veruca ,I know some part of you remembers that.
983.89,988.21,Veruca ,It doesn't take a full moon.
983.89,988.21,Veruca ,We could do it again...
988.29,990.2,Veruca ,right here.
993.97,996.33,Oz ,We aren't going to.
996.41,998.77,Oz ,This ends right now.
998.85,1000.92,Veruca ,"I can help you, Oz."
1001.01,1003.29,Veruca ,"You're scared. I was, too."
1003.37,1009.02,Veruca ,"But then I accepted it, the animal."
1003.37,1009.02,Veruca ,It's powerful.
1007.09,1012.33,Veruca ,Inside me all the time. Soon you just
1007.09,1012.33,Veruca ,start to feel sorry for everybody else
1012.41,1016.45,Veruca ,because they don't know what
1012.41,1016.45,Veruca ,it's like to be as alive as we are.
1017.45,1019.17,Veruca ,As free.
1022.89,1024.88,Oz ,Free to kill people?
1026.21,1028.2,Oz ,I won't do that.
1028.29,1030.57,Oz ,You shouldn't.
1030.65,1032.64,Veruca ,You don't understand.
1033.49,1035.48,Veruca ,But you will.
1035.57,1037.96,Veruca ,You'll see that we belong together.
1038.89,1043.21,Oz ,No. I know where I belong.
1048.37,1050.76,Veruca ,See ya tonight.
1051.09,1055.96,Walsh ,Two of them. It was unbelievable.
1051.09,1055.96,Walsh ,The fact that I survived at all is a miracle.
1056.05,1060.02,Buffy ,"Excuse me, Ms Walsh."
1058.09,1060.69,Walsh ,Be careful when you walk
1058.09,1060.69,Walsh ,around campus after dark.
1060.77,1063.13,Walsh ,I was attacked by wild dogs last night.
1063.13,1063.73,Buffy ,Wild dogs?
1063.81,1064.06,Buffy ,Two.
1064.06,1065.93,Walsh ,Biggest things I've ever seen.
1066.01,1069.53,Walsh ,"The first one was... well, for a moment"
1066.01,1069.53,Walsh ,I thought it was a gorilla.
1069.61,1071.68,Walsh ,"Did you have a question, Buffy?"
1071.77,1075.29,Buffy ,"No. No, I was just sayin' howdy."
1075.37,1077.52,Walsh ,Fine. See you in class.

1117.17,1119.48,Oz ,I didn't notice anything.
1119.97,1124.25,Willow ,Really? Cos I felt all spazzy.
1126.25,1128.64,Oz ,No.
1129.49,1133.73,Oz ,Good. Guess it was just me
1129.49,1133.73,Oz ,worrying for nothin' again.
1134.61,1139.37,Willow ,"Me and my busy head,"
1134.61,1139.37,Willow ,"always thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'."
1141.65,1145.53,Oz ,"Well, now you can stop. Everything's fine."
1146.25,1149.17,Willow ,Maybe you could help me stop.
1150.61,1154.93,Willow ,"I'd really, really appreciate"
1150.61,1154.93,Willow ,anything you could do.
1164.61,1167.13,Willow ,What? What's wrong?
1169.17,1171.56,Oz ,"Sorry, I..."
1173.85,1175.23,Willow ,You don't want to?
1175.23,1177.53,Oz ,It's not that. I do. I just...
1178.85,1182.16,Oz ,"I didn't get any sleep, I guess."
1182.49,1184.77,Oz ,I'm really beat.
1184.85,1186.84,Willow ,Right.
1187.77,1190.61,Willow ,Busy wolf night. I get it.
1190.69,1193.29,Willow ,It's totally OK.
1193.89,1196.25,Oz ,"Willow, you don't have to..."
1196.25,1199.37,Willow ,"No, I should. I don't have much time."
1199.45,1201.65,Willow ,I'll see you later.
1206.33,1209.09,Willow ,treaty of 1648
1206.33,1209.09,Willow ,that ended the Thirty Years' War?
1209.17,1211.57,Giles ,Peace of Westphalia.
1211.57,1212.29,Contestant,Yalta?
1212.37,1214.65,Giles ,You moron!
1212.37,1214.65,Giles ,That's incorrect.
1214.73,1216.93,Giles ,That dinette set should be mine.
1224.33,1227.41,Giles ,Buffy! Excellent! Come in.
1228.53,1231.13,Buffy ,Hi.
1228.53,1231.13,Buffy ,Can I get you anything? Tea?
1231.21,1234.84,Giles ,I made a very interesting moussaka
1231.21,1234.84,Giles ,"last night, if you're hungry."
1234.93,1237.77,Buffy ,"Pass on the tea. And the... moose, thank you."
1238.21,1240.01,Giles ,"You come on business, I hope?"
1240.01,1242.49,Buffy ,"Yes. Lucky you, people may be in danger."
1242.57,1245.69,Giles ,I only meant that I'm at the ready.
1245.69,1247.12,Buffy ,Here's the deal.
1247.21,1251.97,Buffy ,One of my professors said that she was
1247.21,1251.97,Buffy ,almost attacked by two wild dogs last night
1252.05,1254.09,Buffy ,under the light of a nearly full moon.
1254.17,1256.35,Giles ,Werewolves. Two of them?
1256.35,1257.17,Buffy ,Could be.
1258.33,1263.33,Buffy ,"Well, I've not seen anything about"
1258.33,1263.33,Buffy ,the attacks in the newspapers or on the news.
1263.41,1266.4,Giles ,Have you spoken with Oz?
1266.4,1268.02,Buffy ,My next stop.
1266.09,1267.42,Giles ,Right. Get right on it.
1267.42,1269.09,Buffy ,I'll see what I can find out.
1269.17,1271.22,Giles ,And you report back to me.
1271.22,1272.32,Buffy ,ASAP. Promise.
1279.85,1282.38,Xander ,"Hey, Will. Mom let you in?"
1282.38,1284.13,Willow ,She seemed cranky.
1284.21,1289.24,Xander ,Yeah. We're having a little landlordtenant
1284.21,1289.24,Xander ,"dispute, so I'm withholding rent."
1289.33,1292.05,Xander ,"An effective, and might I add, thrifty tactic."
1292.13,1292.34,Willow ,Why?
1292.34,1294.36,Xander ,She won't let me put a lock on my door.
1294.45,1297.33,Xander ,I suspect she's afraid
1294.45,1297.33,Xander ,I'll start having "the sex".
1297.41,1299.85,Willow ,Yeah. Parents wait
1297.41,1299.85,Willow ,till you're out of the house.
1299.93,1302.53,Xander ,Or under it.
1299.93,1302.53,Xander ,"Or under it,"
1302.61,1305.45,Willow ,to start worrying about stuff like that.
1305.53,1307.73,Xander ,It's mostly too late.
1309.13,1314.29,Xander ,"So, I know why I'm sitting in a dank,"
1309.13,1314.29,Xander ,sunless little room. But why are you?
1314.37,1316.76,Willow ,"Well, things with Oz are weird."
1316.85,1321.45,Willow ,"And I talked to Buffy about it,"
1316.85,1321.45,Willow ,but I think we're in guyville here.
1321.53,1324.21,Willow ,I need a translator from the "Y" side of things.
1324.29,1327.33,Xander ,"Well, last time I checked,"
1324.29,1327.33,Xander ,I had the creds. Hit me.
1330.09,1334.45,Willow ,What does it mean
1330.09,1334.45,Willow ,when a girl wants to... you know...
1334.97,1338.36,Xander ,"If you're doing it,"
1334.97,1338.36,Xander ,I think you should be able to say it.
1340.21,1341.09,Willow ,Make love.
1341.09,1342.49,Xander ,Wild monkey love
1342.57,1344.64,Xander ,or tender Sarah McLachlan love?
1344.73,1348.49,Willow ,Any kind. But what if the girl wants to
1348.57,1351.09,Willow ,and the guy doesn't?
1351.17,1353.52,Willow ,"That's a bad sign, right?"
1353.52,1354.37,Xander ,Could be.
1354.45,1359.89,Xander ,Or she caught him in one of the seven
1354.45,1359.89,Xander ,annual minutes he's too preoccupied to do it.
1359.97,1362.61,Willow ,"Well, say the girl's been noticing..."
1362.61,1365.61,Xander ,"Will, I've deciphered your ingenious code."
1365.69,1370.97,Willow ,OK. Say I've been noticing
1365.69,1370.97,Willow ,Oz notice someone else.
1371.81,1372.39,Willow ,A woman.
1372.39,1374.73,Xander ,And is this chick noticing back?
1375.05,1377.12,Willow ,Most definitely.
1377.21,1380.41,Xander ,Well... have you asked Oz about it?
1381.29,1385.45,Willow ,"Well, I thought about it, but then"
1381.29,1385.45,Willow ,he'll think I'm all jealous and worry.
1385.69,1388.13,Xander ,"But you are. And odds are, he feels it."
1388.21,1391.57,Xander ,I'll bet that's all there is
1388.21,1391.57,Xander ,to the weird you're feeling.
1391.65,1395.77,Xander ,"You guys should talk things out, Will."
1391.65,1395.77,Xander ,You'll both feel better.
1409.01,1410.16,Buffy ,Hey.
1410.93,1412.37,Buffy ,"Got out, huh?"
1412.37,1412.92,Oz ,Yeah.
1413.89,1417.54,Buffy ,Any news about attacks?
1417.54,1418.02,Oz ,No.
1417.53,1421.45,Buffy ,But I did hear about a woman
1417.53,1421.45,Buffy ,being chased by two wild dogs.
1422.37,1423.52,Oz ,Two? Really?
1423.61,1427.32,Buffy ,You don't remember anything
1423.61,1427.32,Buffy ,"like that, do you? Another wolf?"
1427.41,1431.88,Oz ,"No. When the change comes,"
1427.41,1431.88,Oz ,it's like... I'm gone. Total blackout.
1431.97,1434.72,Oz ,"Well, if I find werewolf No.2 out on patrol"
1434.72,1437.41,Buffy ,"tonight, you might have a roomie in there."
1441.37,1443.28,Buffy ,Oz?
1443.37,1445.93,Buffy ,"Oz, are you OK?"
1446.01,1450.21,Buffy ,"And if it's possible,"
1446.01,1450.21,Buffy ,you seem more monosyllabic than usual.
1451.81,1453.61,Oz ,I'm OK. Thanks.
1455.93,1461.8,Veruca ,I step out of my skin
1463.01,1467.25,Veruca ,You wouldn't know me now
1469.13,1473.6,Veruca ,Couldn't you go away?
1474.69,1478.24,Veruca ,Shouldn't I?
1480.33,1485.97,Veruca ,Leave me the hard part
1486.85,1491.37,Veruca ,It's all I want
1494.17,1497.4,Veruca ,I need
1502.29,1504.73,Veruca ,I won't be
1505.45,1508.41,Veruca ,Your soft one
1509.13,1513.97,Veruca ,I won't be encircled
1514.93,1519.45,Veruca ,You might become
1520.53,1525.97,Veruca ,Something I need
1529.93,1533.45,Veruca ,To destroy
1535.61,1537.97,Veruca ,So this is why you called me here?
1539.01,1543.02,Veruca ,To see your Habitrail?
1543.45,1547.45,Veruca ,"Right before sunset,"
1543.45,1547.45,Veruca ,"I get a little buzzed, you know?"
1547.53,1549.13,Oz ,Come here.
1549.21,1553.45,Veruca ,"I'm not getting in that stupid cage with you,"
1549.21,1553.45,Veruca ,if that's what this is all about.
1553.53,1555.52,Veruca ,We belong outside.
1557.53,1561.89,Oz ,You can't run loose tonight. And not
1557.53,1561.89,Oz ,just because you might hurt somebody.
1561.97,1567.02,Oz ,I know people that'll be
1561.97,1567.02,Oz ,"out there, hunting for us."
1565.09,1568.61,Veruca ,So you're saying I should spend
1565.09,1568.61,Veruca ,the whole night with you.
1568.69,1574.02,Veruca ,Alone. Locked in a cage.
1572.49,1574.93,Oz ,You'll be safe.
1575.01,1576.89,Veruca ,Not from you.
1578.53,1582.13,Veruca ,Isn't that the point
1578.53,1582.13,Veruca ,of this cosy little arrangement?
1585.57,1588.21,Veruca ,It's coming. Do you feel it?
1589.37,1592.45,Veruca ,It's like blood boiling.
1592.45,1593.73,Oz ,I feel it.
1594.33,1597.13,Veruca ,I've wanted you even before I ever saw you.
1598.09,1602.21,Veruca ,I sensed you. Did you sense me?
1604.69,1606.27,Oz ,Come in here.
1606.27,1607.25,Veruca ,Did you?
1649.09,1650.52,Oz ,Willow.
1650.52,1652.77,Willow ,"Oh, my God."
1658.37,1660.17,Willow ,"Oh, my God."
1662.65,1665.04,Oz ,I know what you saw. It wasn't...
1668.69,1672.57,Oz ,I had to. I had to lock her in there with me.
1672.93,1674.89,Willow ,I bet.
1674.97,1677.36,Oz ,She's like me. A wolf.
1678.81,1682.17,Willow ,"Well, I knew you two"
1678.81,1682.17,Willow ,"had a lot in common, but..."
1682.25,1684.93,Willow ,Don't touch me!
1687.13,1690.97,Oz ,She was gonna hurt somebody.
1687.13,1690.97,Oz ,I didn't have a choice.
1691.45,1694.65,Willow ,But you did. You could've told somebody.
1695.45,1700.13,Willow ,Your solution... just put you two
1695.45,1700.13,Willow ,together in a room all night?
1700.89,1703.5,Veruca ,Girl's got a point.
1703.5,1704.33,Oz ,Leave.
1704.69,1706.32,Veruca ,I'm just sayin'...
1706.32,1706.68,Oz ,Now!
1714.53,1716.2,Oz ,I'm sorry.
1716.2,1717.37,Willow ,I knew.
1719.41,1721.29,Willow ,"I knew, you jerk."
1723.05,1726.89,Willow ,And you sat there
1723.05,1726.89,Willow ,and you told me everything was fine?
1727.85,1733.02,Willow ,And that's as bad as... as...
1731.81,1734.17,Oz ,I know how it feels. I remember.
1736.37,1740.81,Willow ,"So, what, this is payback? I had this coming?"
1741.37,1742.45,Oz ,"No, it's not..."
1742.45,1745.13,Willow ,Because I thought that was behind us.
1746.25,1750.25,Willow ,"And you know, what happened with Xander,"
1746.25,1750.25,Willow ,it doesn't compare.
1752.09,1760.02,Willow ,Not with what you and I had. Not with
1752.09,1760.02,Willow ,whatever you've been doing with her.
1758.09,1760.29,Oz ,I don't know what Veruca and I have done.
1760.37,1764.92,Oz ,"When I change, it's like..."
1760.37,1764.92,Oz ,it's like I'm gone and the wolf takes over.
1765.69,1769.85,Willow ,"But before this, when you were regular Oz,"
1771.33,1773.85,Willow ,"you had feelings for her, didn't you?"
1773.93,1776.93,Oz ,"No. I could sense something, but..."
1777.01,1781.02,Willow ,But you wanted her.
1779.73,1782.57,Willow ,"Like, in an animal way?"
1785.25,1788.56,Willow ,"Like, more than you wanted me?"
1817.13,1818.69,Oz ,Willow!
1823.41,1827.09,Buffy ,"Willow, are you OK?"
1823.41,1827.09,Buffy ,Thank you. I was too far away.
1827.89,1829.88,Riley ,It was lucky. She almost got hit.
1830.01,1834.02,Buffy ,"Willow, what's the matter?"
1833.37,1835.36,Riley ,Maybe you should take her home.
1838.61,1842.16,Riley ,"Whatever it is,"
1838.61,1842.16,Riley ,it's not worth hurting yourself over.
1847.93,1850.08,Buffy ,I have to go.
1850.17,1853.32,Buffy ,I have to find Veruca before the sun sets.
1853.41,1857.57,Buffy ,"I will, though."
1853.41,1857.57,Buffy ,"When I do, this thing stops. She's bad news."
1862.29,1865.37,Buffy ,Do you want me to get you
1862.29,1865.37,Buffy ,something before I take off?
1865.45,1869.02,Buffy ,Kleenex?
1867.09,1869.4,Buffy ,Chocolaty... chocolate anything?
1870.33,1871.69,Willow ,No.
1871.77,1874.81,Buffy ,I'll come back as soon as this is finished.
1874.89,1877.69,Buffy ,"I just want you to take it easy, OK?"
1877.77,1879.76,Willow ,Riley was right.
1879.89,1882.81,Willow ,The main thing is
1879.89,1882.81,Willow ,put the blame where it belongs.
1882.89,1885.85,,Don't hurt yourself.
1882.89,1885.85,,OK.
1885.93,1887.92,,OK.
1889.53,1890.78,,You're OK?
1890.78,1893.29,Willow ,I'm fine. I promise.
1893.65,1895.64,Buffy ,I love you.
1904.77,1907.16,Willow ,Put the blame where it belongs."
1917.33,1919.32,Oz ,So you haven't seen her around?
1919.89,1921.88,Oz ,"OK. Thanks, man."
1927.77,1928.6,Buffy ,Where is she?
1928.6,1931.48,Oz ,I don't know. I checked all the usual haunts.
1931.57,1935.09,Oz ,But I know the areas we're drawn to.
1931.57,1935.09,Oz ,I'm sure I can follow her scent.
1935.17,1936.5,Buffy ,"We'll try that, then."
1936.5,1938.77,Oz ,"Look, Buffy, you should know that..."
1938.85,1943.05,Buffy ,Oz. Now might be a good time
1938.85,1943.05,Buffy ,for your trademark stoicism.
1953.73,1959.37,Willow ,I conjure thee...
1953.73,1959.37,Willow ,"by Borabis, by Satanis and the devil."
1960.69,1965.24,Willow ,"As thou art burning, let Oz and Veruca's"
1960.69,1965.24,Willow ,deceitful hearts be broken.
1976.29,1978.09,Willow ,This way!
1978.45,1981.28,Willow ,"I conjure thee, by the Saracen Queen"
1981.28,1983.16,Oz,and in the name of Hell.
1984.33,1986.93,Willow ,Let them find no love or solace.
1987.01,1991.02,Oz,Let them find no peace as well.
1995.09,1997.05,Oz,She's near here.
1997.13,1999.12,Oz,I can smell her.
1999.65,2002.57,Buffy ,Or the dirty pile of clothing
1999.65,2002.57,Buffy ,she left on the ground.
2002.65,2006.41,Oz ,They could be from the other night
2002.65,2006.41,Oz ,when she turned into a werewolf.
2007.81,2010.96,Buffy ,Unless she wanted to throw you off the scent.
2011.45,2013.76,Oz ,Willow!
2022.49,2024.69,Willow ,Let this image seal his fate.
2024.77,2027.37,Willow ,"Not to love, only hate."
2043.05,2044.38,Willow ,For a minute I thought
2044.38,2046.2,Veruca ,you might actually play rough.
2049.13,2051.52,Veruca ,"Sometimes you have to, you know?"
2052.21,2055.84,Veruca ,"To keep what's yours,"
2052.21,2055.84,Veruca ,sometimes you have to kill.
2059.77,2064.24,Veruca ,"Well, how about that?"
2059.77,2064.24,Veruca ,The sun's almost down.
2080.29,2084.29,Veruca ,Can't say I'm surprised
2080.29,2084.29,Veruca ,you didn't go through with your little hex.
2084.37,2085.99,Veruca ,You don't have the teeth.
2085.99,2087.73,Willow ,You don't know what I have.
2087.81,2090.06,Willow ,You don't know anything about me.
2090.06,2091.49,Veruca ,I know what you love.
2093.05,2095.77,Veruca ,I have his scent on me right now.
2100.93,2102.77,Oz ,Don't touch her again.
2102.77,2103.85,Veruca ,Come stop me.
2104.65,2106.64,Veruca ,"I like it rough, remember?"
2108.93,2112.16,Oz ,"You wanna hurt me, hurt me."
2108.93,2112.16,Oz ,You leave her out of this.
2112.25,2115.61,Veruca ,How can I? She's the reason
2112.25,2115.61,Veruca ,you're living in cages.
2116.21,2120.97,Veruca ,"She's blinding you. When she's gone,"
2116.21,2120.97,Veruca ,you'll be able to admit what you are.
2124.85,2127.85,Oz ,You don't wanna find out what I am.
2127.93,2129.92,Veruca ,You're an animal.
2134.53,2136.89,Veruca ,Animals kill.
2138.13,2140.12,Oz ,You're right.
2140.21,2142.25,Oz ,We kill.
2181.77,2183.76,Willow ,Oz?
2228.13,2230.97,Giles ,I'm not quite sure I understand.
2231.05,2233.69,Buffy ,There was just so much
2231.05,2233.69,Buffy ,going on with Oz and Willow.
2233.77,2236.61,Buffy ,There still is.
2233.77,2236.61,Buffy ,But I just thought you should know.
2236.69,2240.21,Giles ,"This fellow in the woods,"
2236.69,2240.21,Giles ,he was in military garb?
2240.29,2242.52,Buffy ,And he was toting some serious weaponry.
2242.61,2246.45,Buffy ,"The thing is, I saw some guys dressed"
2242.61,2246.45,Buffy ,exactly like him on Halloween night.
2246.53,2248.76,Buffy ,I just assumed they were in costume.
2249.13,2252.6,Buffy ,But maybe they were working.
2249.13,2252.6,Buffy ,I wanna know what's up.
2252.69,2256.69,Buffy ,The guy got in my way.
2252.69,2256.69,Buffy ,I almost didn't catch up with Oz in time.
2257.93,2260.37,Buffy ,"And as it was, I was too late to..."
2260.37,2261.56,Giles ,You saved Willow.
2261.85,2264.24,Buffy ,Right now she wishes I hadn't.
2265.41,2270.02,Buffy ,"Giles, I've never seen her like this."
2269.41,2272.37,Buffy ,It's like it hurts too much to form words.
2272.97,2277.25,Giles ,You've felt that way yourself
2272.97,2277.25,Giles ,and you got through it.
2277.33,2281.41,Buffy ,Yeah. I ran away and went to hell
2277.33,2281.41,Buffy ,and then got through it.
2282.37,2285.22,Buffy ,I'm hoping she doesn't use me as a model.
2285.22,2286.05,Giles ,Fair enough.
2287.13,2290.33,Buffy ,I just don't know
2287.13,2290.33,Buffy ,how they're gonna deal with this.
2303.37,2305.57,Willow ,Hello.
2305.97,2307.8,Oz ,Hi.
2313.29,2314.97,Willow ,What are you doing?
2318.45,2320.44,Oz ,I'm going.
2323.09,2325.08,Willow ,Now?
2327.21,2329.27,Willow ,That's your solution?
2329.27,2331.13,Oz ,That's my decision.
2332.73,2335.33,Willow ,Don't I get any say in this?
2335.33,2335.61,Oz ,No.
2340.69,2343.92,Oz ,Veruca was right about something.
2344.01,2346.85,Oz ,The wolf is inside me all the time.
2348.45,2352.24,Oz ,And I don't know where that line
2348.45,2352.24,Oz ,"is any more, between me and it."
2354.29,2356.89,Oz ,"And until I figure out what that means,"
2358.73,2361.12,Oz ,I shouldn't be around you.
2361.49,2363.72,Oz ,Or anybody.
2363.81,2365.93,Willow ,"Well, that could be a problem."
2366.01,2370.8,Willow ,Cos people... kind of a planetary epidemic.
2372.89,2374.88,Oz ,I'll find someplace.
2376.13,2378.25,Willow ,"Well, how long?"
2379.33,2381.77,Oz ,I don't know.
2382.73,2384.77,,"Oz,"
2384.85,2387.45,,don't you love me?
2388.97,2392.25,,My whole life...
2388.97,2392.25,,I've never loved anything else.
2407.93,2411.61,,"Oh, God. Oz."
