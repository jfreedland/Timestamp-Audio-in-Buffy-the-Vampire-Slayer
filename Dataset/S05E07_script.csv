2.21,4.93,,Spike. He's known as William the Bloody.
5.49,11.02,,Earned his nickname by torturing
5.49,11.02,,his victims with railroad spikes.
9.09,11.65,,Spike has fought two slayers
9.09,11.65,,in the last century
11.73,14.12,,and he's killed them both.
21.81,24.09,,I can't bite anyone.
21.81,24.09,,I can't even hit people.
24.17,27.56,,I've got this cute little
24.17,27.56,,government chip in my head.
29.49,32.45,,She's everywhere. She's haunting me.
34.53,37.25,,"Buffy, I love you. God, I love you so much."
38.77,40.05,,"God, no."
40.33,45.49,,I need to know more about where
40.33,45.49,,"I come from, about the other slayers."
45.85,51.17,,"Maybe if I can learn to control this thing,"
45.85,51.17,,"I could be stronger, I could be better."

62.61,66.45,,"of my business, but I just gotta ask."
68.77,73.02,BUFFY,Did you smell this bad when you were alive?
71.61,74.41,BUFFY,"Cos if it's a postmortem thing,"
71.61,74.41,BUFFY,"then boy, is my face red."
74.49,76.09,BUFFY,"But, just so you know,"
77.01,83.02,BUFFY,the field of personal grooming has come
77.01,83.02,BUFFY,a long way since you became a vampire.
161.17,163.32,ROCKER VAMPIRE,You're going?
163.41,165.93,ROCKER VAMPIRE,But you were havin'
163.41,165.93,ROCKER VAMPIRE,so much fun a minute ago.
190.41,192.4,RILEY,Buffy. What happened?
200.57,203.88,BUFFY,I can't believe I passed out.
200.57,203.88,BUFFY,Do you think I'm a total wuss now?
203.97,208.33,RILEY,Yeah. I like a girl who can play a few
203.97,208.33,RILEY,hard sets of tennis with a major stab wound.
208.41,210.3,BUFFY,You said it wasn't that bad.
210.3,213.33,RILEY,I said I've seen worse. There's a difference.
213.41,215.79,BUFFY,"Well, at least no major organs got kebabbed."
215.79,218.17,RILEY,I still think you need to see a real doctor.
218.25,220.04,RILEY,"Then I'd be in a real hospital, which"
220.04,221.93,BUFFY,would get my real mom real freaked out.
222.01,224.29,BUFFY,I can't do it. Don't worry.
224.37,227.76,BUFFY,Accelerated healing powers
224.37,227.76,BUFFY,come with the slayer package.
227.85,230.32,BUFFY,And the boyfriend with
227.85,230.32,BUFFY,combat medical training?
230.41,232.8,BUFFY,That's just a Buffy Summers bonus.
232.89,236.68,RILEY,So tell me about the bad guy or guys.
232.89,236.68,RILEY,What do you think they were?
236.77,237.65,BUFFY,Vampire.
237.65,238.65,RILEY,How many?
240.09,242.08,BUFFY,One.
242.57,245.37,RILEY,"So, what? He was"
242.57,245.37,RILEY,a supervampire or somethin'?
246.53,249.45,BUFFY,"No, he was the regular kind."
249.53,251.36,BUFFY,He just beat me.
253.41,255.4,RILEY,That ever happen before?
256.21,260.45,BUFFY,I'm in the best physical shape of my life.
256.21,260.45,BUFFY,"If you're asking how it happened, I don't..."
260.53,260.8,BUFFY,Dawn.
260.8,262.65,DAWN,Sorry to interrupt the sexcapades.
262.73,266.44,DAWN,I just wanted to tell you that Mom's coming.
267.01,267.72,JOYCE,"Hi, Riley."
267.72,270.37,RILEY,"Hey, Mrs Summers. How're you feelin'?"
270.45,275.24,JOYCE,"Fine. Bordering on chipper and,"
270.45,275.24,JOYCE,"tomorrow, planning on being obnoxious."
275.93,277.13,RILEY,Glad to hear it.
277.21,279.03,RILEY,"Buffy, when you have a minute I'd like"
279.03,281.05,JOYCE,to go over the grocery list for next week.
281.13,282.29,BUFFY,You got it.
282.29,285.57,JOYCE,Are you disinfecting something?
286.01,287.49,JOYCE,Mine.
287.57,291.09,JOYCE,Some nail polish experiments
287.57,291.09,JOYCE,are doomed before they even begin.
291.17,293.64,JOYCE,"But you keep pushing the envelope, honey."
296.73,300.17,DAWN,Did I just pull a slayerrelated
296.73,300.17,DAWN,Mom coverup thing?
301.49,304.05,DAWN,"Come on, who's the man?"
301.49,304.05,DAWN,You are.
304.25,306.32,BUFFY,"A very short, annoying man."
309.89,313.09,BUFFY,"If I show you something,"
309.89,313.09,BUFFY,you promise you won't tell?
316.13,318.25,DAWN,Cool.
318.33,319.67,DAWN,"I mean, gross."
319.67,321.96,BUFFY,And Mom cannot know. OK?
322.17,324.32,BUFFY,You'll help me with the household stuff?
324.41,326.93,DAWN,I save your butt and you
324.41,326.93,DAWN,dump all your chores on me?
327.01,328.65,RILEY,Dawn.
329.57,334.73,DAWN,I got it. You're covered. We're good.
329.57,334.73,DAWN,Just lucky it's not bikini season.
335.81,340.05,RILEY,"So, Dawn takes household duty."
335.81,340.05,RILEY,I'll take tonight's patrol.
340.13,341.32,BUFFY,By yourself?
341.32,342.6,RILEY,Just a sweep.
343.61,346.25,BUFFY,Do me a favour?
343.61,346.25,BUFFY,Will you take the gang along with?
347.33,349.8,RILEY,OK. I will patrol with the group tonight.
349.93,351.39,DAWN,When do I get to patrol?
351.39,352.97,BUFFY,Not until you're... Never.
373.13,376.92,XANDER,What's with the hand move?
373.13,376.92,XANDER,D'you see that? Does it mean somethin'?
377.17,379.08,XANDER,It's code. I think it
379.08,381.45,WILLOW,breaks down to "choochoo".
381.53,383.52,ANYA,It probably means to follow him.
384.53,387.33,ANYA,"That, or wait here for him."
392.01,393.84,WILLOW,Ask.
394.05,397.89,WILLOW,Riley! What's the... all about?
397.97,402.25,WILLOW,It means yell real loud so the vampires who
397.97,402.25,WILLOW,don't know we're comin' will have a chance.
402.33,404.56,WILLOW,"See, now he's all mad and sarcastic."
404.65,407.73,WILLOW,"Because you were doin' all the yellin',"
404.65,407.73,WILLOW,Mr Stealthy Pants.
407.81,411.04,ANYA,It's their fault.
407.81,411.04,ANYA,"If we split up, we could cover more ground."
411.41,414.49,ANYA,"I'll take the cemeteries,"
411.41,414.49,ANYA,you guys get the Bronze.
414.57,416.61,ANYA,Are we not being covert enough?
416.69,418.4,XANDER,We're sorry.
418.4,419.25,WILLOW,Sorry.
419.33,421.48,XANDER,We'll be sneakier. Promise.
422.37,425.81,RILEY,OK. Just ditch the chips and watch my back.
426.49,428.48,WILLOW,Done.
431.65,436.36,XANDER,You know what he's like? He's like a cat.
431.65,436.36,XANDER,"You know, a big jungle cat."
436.45,439.33,XANDER,How come I'm not like that? It's just so cool.
440.29,442.28,XANDER,I think you're cool.
447.89,451.17,GILES,Here's another one.
447.89,451.17,GILES,Early 18thcentury slayer.
451.25,454.53,BUFFY,Good. Let's hope she'll be
451.25,454.53,BUFFY,more helpful than this last one.
454.61,455.86,GILES,Why? What does it say?
455.86,457.17,BUFFY,Same as all the others.
457.25,461.72,BUFFY,"Slayer called, blah, blah. Great protector,"
457.25,461.72,BUFFY,"blah, blah. Scary battles, blah, blah."
461.81,464.53,BUFFY,Oops. She's dead. Where are the details?
464.61,466.37,BUFFY,Details?
466.45,470.24,GILES,"Well, it says this slayer"
466.45,470.24,GILES,forged her own weapons.
472.13,476.97,BUFFY,Gotta love a gal with an anvil. But where
472.13,476.97,BUFFY,are the details of the Slayer's last battle?
477.05,480.6,BUFFY,"You know, what made that fight special?"
477.05,480.6,BUFFY,Why did she lose?
481.17,484.53,GILES,"You didn't lose last night, Buffy. You just..."
484.53,485.77,BUFFY,Got really close.
486.05,490.57,BUFFY,"I slipped up, Giles. I've been training"
486.05,490.57,BUFFY,harder than ever and still I...
491.09,495.09,BUFFY,And there's nothing in any of these books
491.09,495.09,BUFFY,to help me understand why.
495.81,501.41,BUFFY,"I mean, I realise that every slayer comes"
495.81,501.41,BUFFY,with an expiration mark on the package.
501.49,504.69,BUFFY,But I want mine to be a long time from now.
504.77,506.57,BUFFY,Like a Cheeto.
506.65,510.49,BUFFY,If there were just a few good descriptions
506.65,510.49,BUFFY,"of what took out the other slayers,"
510.57,514.49,BUFFY,maybe it would help me understand
510.57,514.49,BUFFY,"my mistake, to keep it from happening again."
514.57,521.05,GILES,"Yes, well, the problem"
514.57,521.05,GILES,"is that after a final battle,"
521.85,528.41,GILES,it's difficult to get any...
521.85,528.41,GILES,"Well, the Slayer's not... She's rather..."
528.49,530.37,BUFFY,"It's OK to use the Dword, Giles."
530.45,533.97,GILES,Dead. And hence not very forthcoming.
534.25,538.33,BUFFY,Why didn't the watchers keep fuller
534.25,538.33,BUFFY,accounts of it? The journals just stop.
538.41,542.73,GILES,"I suppose if they're anything like me,"
538.41,542.73,GILES,they just find the whole subject too...
542.85,545.16,BUFFY,Unseemly?
545.77,549.53,BUFFY,"Damn. Love ya, but you watchers"
545.77,549.53,BUFFY,are such prigs sometimes.
550.37,552.49,GILES,"Painful, I was going to say."
557.33,561.37,GILES,But you're right. Accounts of
557.33,561.37,GILES,the final battles would be very helpful.
561.45,564.73,GILES,But there's no one left to tell the tales.
568.13,569.12,GILES,What?
569.93,571.65,SPIKE,Ow.
571.73,575.85,SPIKE,"Wait. Not ow. Are you feelin' all right,"
571.73,575.85,SPIKE,Slayer? This stuff usually hurts.
576.65,578.34,BUFFY,"Don't even start, Spike."
578.34,579.53,SPIKE,What do you want?
579.61,582.33,BUFFY,Slayers. You killed two of them.
584.49,586.93,SPIKE,I did.
587.01,589.29,BUFFY,You're gonna show me how.
597.21,600.52,SPIKE,There are quite a few American
597.21,600.52,SPIKE,beers that are highly underrated.
600.61,602.73,SPIKE,"This, unfortunately, is not one of them."
602.81,606.65,BUFFY,"Update, Spike. We're not here"
602.81,606.65,BUFFY,to discuss the fine choice of hops.
606.73,610.85,BUFFY,It's about two slayers: one in China during
606.73,610.85,BUFFY,"the Boxer Rebellion, one in New York."
610.93,613.37,BUFFY,Both got killed by you.
613.45,615.76,BUFFY,"Tell the tale, you get the cash."
615.85,620.05,SPIKE,Right. You wanna learn all about how I
615.85,620.05,SPIKE,bested the Slayers and you wanna learn fast.
620.13,626.02,SPIKE,"Right, then. We fought."
620.13,626.02,SPIKE,I won. The end. Pay up.
624.09,625.23,BUFFY,That's not what I...
625.23,627.05,SPIKE,What did you want? A quick demo?
627.13,630.13,SPIKE,A blowforblow description
627.13,630.13,SPIKE,you can map out and memorise?
630.21,632.44,SPIKE,"It's not about the moves, love."
632.53,637.93,SPIKE,"And since I agreed to your little proposition,"
632.53,637.93,SPIKE,we can do this my way. Wings.
638.69,639.18,BUFFY,What?
639.18,641.13,SPIKE,Spicy buffalo wings.
641.21,643.52,SPIKE,Order me up a plate. I'm feelin' peckish.
647.81,649.61,BUFFY,Excuse me...
650.97,654.68,SPIKE,As I thought.
650.97,654.68,SPIKE,Some nasty thing got a taste of you.
655.89,658.09,BUFFY,Don't get all excited. I'm fine.
658.17,662.53,SPIKE,"Right. Stuck with a creature you loathe,"
658.17,662.53,SPIKE,"diggin' up past uglies, cos you're fine."
662.65,664.78,BUFFY,Just tell me what I wanna know.
664.78,665.53,SPIKE,I told you.
665.61,667.97,SPIKE,No one's narrating
665.61,667.97,SPIKE,on an empty stomach here.
669.21,671.88,BUFFY,Were you born this big a pain in the ass?
671.88,673.97,SPIKE,"Well, what can I tell you, baby?"
674.05,676.36,SPIKE,I've always been bad.
678.29,681.33,SPIKE,Luminous. No.
681.93,685.93,SPIKE,Irradiant's better.
688.25,690.4,WAITER,"Care for an hors d'oeuvre, sir?"
690.49,695.49,SPIKE,Quickly. I'm the very spirit of vexation.
690.49,695.49,SPIKE,What's another word for "gleaming"?
696.49,702.52,SPIKE,"It's a perfectly perfect word as words go,"
696.49,702.52,SPIKE,"but the bother is nothing rhymes, you see."
711.77,713.41,SPIKE,Cecily.
727.97,730.54,ARISTOCRAT #2,"I merely point out that it's a mystery,"
730.54,733.17,ARISTOCRAT #1,and the police should keep an open mind.
733.25,736.09,ARISTOCRAT #2,"William, favour us with your opinion."
736.17,739.37,ARISTOCRAT #2,What do you make of this rash
736.17,739.37,ARISTOCRAT #2,of disappearances in our town?
739.45,741.49,ARISTOCRAT #2,Animals or thieves?
741.57,744.65,ARISTOCRAT #2,"I prefer not to think of such dark,"
741.57,744.65,ARISTOCRAT #2,ugly business at all.
744.73,746.64,ARISTOCRAT #2,That's what the police are for.
749.49,753.09,ARISTOCRAT #2,I prefer placing my energies
749.49,753.09,ARISTOCRAT #2,into creating things of beauty.
753.17,755.93,ARISTOCRAT #3,"I see. Well, don't withhold, William."
755.93,758.17,ARISTOCRAT #1,Rescue us from a dreary topic.
758.25,759.81,SPIKE,Careful.
760.81,763.93,SPIKE,The inks are still wet.
760.81,763.93,SPIKE,"Please, it's not finished."
764.01,768.02,SPIKE,Don't be shy.
766.41,770.41,SPIKE,My heart expands.
766.41,770.41,SPIKE,"Tis grown a bulge in it,"
770.49,773.93,SPIKE,"Inspired by your beauty, effulgent."""
774.49,776.48,SPIKE,Effulgent?
785.85,787.14,SPIKE,And that's actually
787.14,789.24,ARISTOCRAT #2,one of his better compositions.
789.33,794.09,ARISTOCRAT #1,Have you heard? They call him William the
789.33,794.09,ARISTOCRAT #1,Bloody because of his bloody awful poetry.
794.17,800.65,ARISTOCRAT #3,It suits him. I'd rather have a spike through
794.17,800.65,ARISTOCRAT #3,my head than listen to that awful stuff.
803.41,805.61,SPIKE,Cecily?
806.69,808.68,CECILY,Leave me alone.
811.57,815.69,SPIKE,They're vulgarians.
811.57,815.69,SPIKE,They're not like you and I.
816.05,818.04,SPIKE,You and I?
819.29,824.45,SPIKE,I'm going to ask you a very personal question
819.29,824.45,SPIKE,and I demand an honest answer.
824.53,826.52,SPIKE,Do you understand?
828.49,830.77,SPIKE,"Your poetry, it's..."
830.85,834.89,CECILY,"They're not written about me, are they?"
835.93,837.92,SPIKE,They're about how I feel.
838.73,840.72,CECILY,"Yes, but are they about me?"
844.57,846.62,SPIKE,Every syllable.
846.62,847.17,CECILY,God.
848.41,851.72,SPIKE,I know. It's sudden and...
853.25,855.77,SPIKE,"Please, if they're no good,"
853.25,855.77,SPIKE,"they're only words,"
855.85,859.4,SPIKE,but the feeling behind them...
860.33,862.23,SPIKE,"I love you, Cecily."
862.23,863.53,CECILY,"Please, stop."
863.61,868.61,SPIKE,"I know I'm a bad poet, but I'm a good man"
869.41,874.85,SPIKE,and all I ask is that you try to see me...
874.97,878.65,CECILY,I do see you. That's the problem.
880.05,882.04,CECILY,"You're nothing to me, William."
887.57,889.25,CECILY,You're beneath me.
909.25,911.24,SPIKE,Watch where you're going.
930.41,935.89,DRUSILLA,And I wonder what possible catastrophe
930.41,935.89,DRUSILLA,"came crashing down from heaven,"
936.77,940.56,DRUSILLA,and brought this dashing stranger to tears?
940.85,944.29,SPIKE,Nothing. I wish to be alone.
944.97,946.96,DRUSILLA,I see you.
947.05,950.68,DRUSILLA,A man surrounded by fools
947.05,950.68,DRUSILLA,"who cannot see his strength,"
951.01,954.21,DRUSILLA,"his vision, his glory."
956.49,960.2,DRUSILLA,That and burning baby fish
956.49,960.2,DRUSILLA,swimming all around your head.
960.53,963.13,SPIKE,That's quite close enough.
964.25,969.37,SPIKE,I've heard tales of London pickpockets.
964.25,969.37,SPIKE,"You'll not be getting my purse, I tell you."
970.25,972.24,DRUSILLA,Don't need a purse.
974.29,979.89,DRUSILLA,Your wealth lies here and here.
981.25,987.44,DRUSILLA,In the spirit and imagination.
989.09,994.09,DRUSILLA,You walk in worlds
989.09,994.09,DRUSILLA,the others can't begin to imagine.
995.41,997.21,DRUSILLA,Yes.
999.89,1002.12,DRUSILLA,"I mean, no."
1002.21,1005.21,SPIKE,"I mean, Mother's expecting me."
1007.25,1009.53,DRUSILLA,I see what you want.
1009.61,1012.97,DRUSILLA,Something glowing and glistening.
1013.05,1015.04,DRUSILLA,Something...
1017.17,1018.97,DRUSILLA,effulgent.
1025.97,1027.88,DRUSILLA,Do you want it?
1029.45,1030.6,SPIKE,Yes.
1036.61,1038.37,SPIKE,"God, yes."
1073.37,1075.36,RILEY,Guys.
1075.93,1077.01,XANDER,What you got?
1077.01,1077.92,RILEY,That's him.
1080.49,1082.48,RILEY,Let's go.
1128.41,1129.67,XANDER,It sounds like a party.
1129.67,1130.88,RILEY,Forget about crashing.
1130.97,1134.89,RILEY,There's too many of 'em. We'll come back
1130.97,1134.89,RILEY,"at daybreak, when they're asleep."
1135.01,1138.69,RILEY,It's OK. We can kill 'em
1135.01,1138.69,RILEY,just as dead in the morning.
1141.61,1143.6,CUT TO,Nine in the corner.
1144.33,1146.69,BUFFY,So you traded up on the food chain.
1144.33,1146.69,BUFFY,Then what?
1146.77,1149.08,SPIKE,"No, please."
1149.17,1153.29,SPIKE,Don't make it sound like something
1149.17,1153.29,SPIKE,you'd flip past on the Discovery Channel.
1153.37,1157.41,SPIKE,Becoming a vampire is
1153.37,1157.41,SPIKE,a profound and powerful experience.
1158.89,1161.73,SPIKE,I could feel this new strength
1158.89,1161.73,SPIKE,coursing through me.
1161.81,1165.41,SPIKE,Getting killed made me feel alive
1161.81,1165.41,SPIKE,for the very first time.
1166.97,1169.85,SPIKE,I was through living by society's rules.
1170.49,1172.48,SPIKE,Decided to make a few of my own.
1173.33,1175.48,SPIKE,"Course, in order to do that,"
1179.77,1181.84,SPIKE,I had to get myself a gang.
1181.93,1185.24,ANGELUS,Perhaps it's my advancing years
1181.93,1185.24,ANGELUS,that makes me so forgetful.
1185.33,1188.45,ANGELUS,Remind me. Why don't we kill you?
1190.53,1191.81,ANGELUS,What's that?
1195.69,1198.21,SPIKE,It's Spike now.
1199.21,1201.14,SPIKE,"You'd do well to remember it, mate."
1201.14,1202.13,ANGELUS,I'm not your mate.
1202.41,1204.62,ANGELUS,And when did you start talking like that?
1204.62,1206.73,DARLA,We barely got out alive because of you.
1206.81,1209.33,DARLA,"Everywhere we go,"
1206.81,1209.33,DARLA,it's the same story and now...
1209.41,1212.93,DARLA,You've got me and my women
1209.41,1212.93,DARLA,hiding in the luxury of a mine shaft 
1213.01,1217.09,DARLA,all because William the Bloody
1213.01,1217.09,DARLA,likes the attention.
1218.57,1221.33,DARLA,This is not a reputation we need.
1221.41,1225.2,SPIKE,I'm sorry. Did I sully our good name?
1221.41,1225.2,SPIKE,We're vampires.
1225.37,1227.82,ANGELUS,All the more reason to use finesse.
1227.82,1228.45,SPIKE,Bollocks.
1228.53,1233.85,SPIKE,That stuff's for the frilly cuffsandcollars
1228.53,1233.85,SPIKE,crowd. I'll take a good brawl any day.
1235.69,1238.21,ANGELUS,"And every time you do,"
1235.69,1238.21,ANGELUS,we become the hunted.
1238.89,1241.36,DARLA,I think our boys are going to fight.
1241.45,1244.37,DRUSILLA,The King of Cups expects a picnic.
1245.17,1248.1,DRUSILLA,But this is not his birthday.
1248.1,1249.21,DARLA,Good point.
1249.29,1253.25,ANGELUS,"Yeah, you know what I prefer"
1249.29,1253.25,ANGELUS,to being hunted? Getting caught.
1254.09,1257,ANGELUS,That's a brilliant strategy. Pure cunning.
1257,1257.56,SPIKE,Sod off.
1260.89,1263.45,SPIKE,"Come on, when was"
1260.89,1263.45,SPIKE,the last time you unleashed it?
1263.53,1268.61,SPIKE,"Allout fight in a mob, back against the wall,"
1263.53,1268.61,SPIKE,nothing but fists and fangs?
1268.69,1270.38,SPIKE,Don't you ever get tired of fights
1270.38,1271.37,ANGELUS,you know you'll win?
1271.53,1277.02,ANGELUS,"No. A real kill, a good kill "
1271.53,1277.02,ANGELUS,it takes pure artistry.
1275.09,1277.16,ANGELUS,"Without that, we're just animals."
1277.25,1279.16,SPIKE,Poofter.
1289.77,1291.76,SPIKE,Now you're gettin' it.
1293.73,1295.93,ANGELUS,You can't keep this up forever.
1298.45,1302.53,ANGELUS,"If I can't teach you,"
1298.45,1302.53,ANGELUS,maybe someday an angry crowd will.
1302.61,1306.05,SPIKE,That or the Slayer.
1309.37,1310.65,SPIKE,What's a slayer?
1312.17,1314.16,SPIKE,"After that, I was obsessed."
1315.01,1320.25,SPIKE,"To most vampires, the Slayer was the subject"
1315.01,1320.25,SPIKE,of cold sweat and frightened whispers.
1321.97,1323.96,SPIKE,But I never hid.
1324.69,1326.68,SPIKE,"Hell, I sought her out."
1326.77,1330.81,SPIKE,"If you're looking for fun, there's death,"
1326.77,1330.81,SPIKE,"there's glory and sod all else, right?"
1330.89,1331.78,SPIKE,I was young.
1331.78,1333.41,BUFFY,So how'd you kill her?
1335.29,1337.28,SPIKE,Funny you should ask.
1340.25,1342.29,SPIKE,Lesson the first:
1342.37,1344.89,SPIKE,a slayer must always reach for her weapon.
1348.45,1350.25,SPIKE,I've already got mine.
1359.61,1361.65,SPIKE,"Good thing, too."
1361.73,1366.68,SPIKE,"Become a vampire, you got"
1361.73,1366.68,SPIKE,nothing to fear. Nothing but one girl.
1367.69,1369.68,SPIKE,"That's you, honey."
1370.29,1372.28,SPIKE,"Back then,"
1373.69,1375.68,SPIKE,it was her.
1406.57,1409.29,SPIKE,Just like I pictured it. This good for you?
1470.73,1472.96,SPIKE,"I'm sorry, love,"
1473.05,1475.12,SPIKE,I don't speak Chinese.
1481.45,1483.84,SPIKE,A fella could get used to this.
1491.61,1496.93,SPIKE,"Spike, look at the wonderful"
1491.61,1496.93,SPIKE,mess you've made.
1497.37,1499.57,SPIKE,That's a slayer you've done in.
1500.13,1504.65,SPIKE,"Naughty, wicked Spike."
1526.09,1531.57,SPIKE,You ever hear them say the blood
1526.09,1531.57,SPIKE,of a slayer is a powerful aphrodisiac?
1535.45,1540.48,SPIKE,"Here, now. Have a taste."
1583.77,1585.65,DARLA,So where have you two been?
1585.65,1586.41,DRUSILLA,May I tell?
1586.49,1588.72,SPIKE,No need to be humble.
1588.81,1592.04,ANGEL,My little Spike just killed himself a slayer.
1597.57,1600.53,ANGEL,Congratulations.
1597.57,1600.53,ANGEL,I guess that makes you one of us.
1601.41,1605.73,SPIKE,"Don't be so glum, mate. The way you tell it,"
1601.41,1605.73,SPIKE,"one slayer snuffs it, another one rises."
1605.81,1608.85,SPIKE,I figure there's a new Chosen One
1605.81,1608.85,SPIKE,getting chosen as we speak.
1608.93,1614.72,SPIKE,"I'll tell you what, when and if this new bird"
1608.93,1614.72,SPIKE,"does show up, I'll give you first crack at her."
1617.49,1620.17,DRUSILLA,I smell fear.
1620.25,1622.87,ANGEL,"Yeah, this whole place reeks of it."
1622.87,1624.21,DRUSILLA,It's intoxicating.
1624.29,1630.02,ANGEL,Let's get outta here.
1624.29,1630.02,ANGEL,This rebellion's startin' to bore me.
1654.69,1657.41,SPIKE,It was the best night of my life.
1658.97,1660.96,SPIKE,And I've had some sweet ones.
1662.89,1664.88,BUFFY,What are you lookin' at?
1665.25,1667.53,BUFFY,You got off on it.
1667.61,1671.05,BUFFY,"Well, yeah. I suppose"
1667.61,1671.05,BUFFY,you're telling me you don't?
1674.49,1676.96,BUFFY,How many of my kind
1674.49,1676.96,BUFFY,do you reckon you've done?
1677.05,1679.04,BUFFY,Not enough.
1680.25,1685.53,BUFFY,And we just keep comin'. But you can kill a
1680.25,1685.53,BUFFY,"hundred, a thousand, a thousand thousand,"
1685.61,1691.37,BUFFY,and the armies of Hell besides
1685.61,1691.37,BUFFY,and all we need is for one of us
1691.45,1695.24,BUFFY,sooner or later to have the thing
1691.45,1695.24,BUFFY,we're all hoping for.
1696.05,1698.04,BUFFY,And that would be what?
1701.85,1704.21,SPIKE,One good day.
1706.33,1708.8,BUFFY,You asked and I'm tellin'.
1708.89,1712.25,BUFFY,The problem with you is you got
1708.89,1712.25,BUFFY,so good you think you're immortal.
1712.33,1715.48,BUFFY,Not really. I just know I can handle myself.
1716.65,1718.37,SPIKE,Then how do you explain this?
1725.61,1728.49,BUFFY,So that's it? Lesson over?
1728.57,1730.56,SPIKE,Not even close.
1731.21,1732.57,SPIKE,Come on.
1737.41,1739.64,ROCKER VAMPIRE,Killed with her own weapon.
1739.89,1742.17,ROCKER VAMPIRE,They ought to put this in a museum.
1742.25,1747.02,RILEY,You know what they put in museums?
1745.13,1747.17,RILEY,Mostly dead things.
1769.69,1771.41,BUFFY,Give it to me.
1777.85,1778.34,BUFFY,What?
1778.34,1782.56,SPIKE,Lesson the second: ask the right questions.
1782.65,1784.64,SPIKE,You want to know how I beat 'em?
1786.65,1791.12,SPIKE,The question isn't "How'd I win?".
1786.65,1791.12,SPIKE,The question is "Why'd they lose?".
1791.21,1794.44,BUFFY,What's the difference?
1794.73,1797.17,SPIKE,"There's a big difference, love."
1799.17,1801.57,BUFFY,How'd you kill the second one?
1801.57,1802.85,SPIKE,A bit like this.
1805.25,1806.64,BUFFY,That didn't hurt?
1806.64,1808.93,SPIKE,I knew I couldn't touch you.
1809.73,1815.33,SPIKE,"If there's no intent to hurt you, then that chip"
1809.73,1815.33,SPIKE,they shoved up my brain never activates.
1815.41,1817.48,SPIKE,"lf, on the other hand..."
1823.69,1825.09,SPIKE,"See? Now, that hurt."
1825.09,1826.57,BUFFY,"Yeah? This hurt, too?"
1829.01,1831.16,BUFFY,Definite pain there.
1831.25,1833.45,BUFFY,"How'd you kill 'em, Spike?"
1838.85,1840.91,SPIKE,You're not ready to know.
1840.91,1841.73,BUFFY,I'm ready.
1842.01,1844.48,SPIKE,"OK, then. Went like this."
1856.17,1860.37,SPIKE,"The first one was all business, but"
1856.17,1860.37,SPIKE,"the second, she had a touch of your style."
1896.17,1900.61,SPIKE,"She was cunning, resourceful."
1896.17,1900.61,SPIKE,And did I mention? Hot.
1900.97,1904.25,SPIKE,I could've danced all night with her.
1904.25,1906.02,BUFFY,Think we're dancing?
1904.09,1905.73,SPIKE,That's all we've ever done.
1908.61,1913.61,SPIKE,"And the thing about the dance is,"
1908.61,1913.61,SPIKE,you never get to stop.
1914.05,1918.68,SPIKE,"Every day you wake up, the same question"
1914.05,1918.68,SPIKE,haunts you: "Is today the day I die?"
1924.33,1928.21,SPIKE,"Death is on your heels, baby,"
1924.33,1928.21,SPIKE,and sooner or later it's gonna catch you.
1932.65,1937.93,SPIKE,And part of you wants it.
1932.65,1937.93,SPIKE,"Not only to stop the fear and uncertainty,"
1938.01,1940.81,SPIKE,but because you're just
1938.01,1940.81,SPIKE,a little bit in love with it.
1956.25,1962.02,SPIKE,Death is your art. You make it
1956.25,1962.02,SPIKE,"with your hands, day after day."
1960.37,1966.37,SPIKE,That final gasp. That look of peace.
1960.37,1966.37,SPIKE,Part of you is desperate to know:
1966.45,1970.45,SPIKE,What's it like? Where does it lead you?"
1970.89,1973.36,SPIKE,"And now, you see, that's the secret."
1973.45,1976.53,SPIKE,Not the punch you didn't throw
1973.45,1976.53,SPIKE,or the kicks you didn't land.
1976.61,1982.4,SPIKE,She merely wanted it.
1976.61,1982.4,SPIKE,Every slayer has a death wish.
1987.65,1989.64,SPIKE,Even you.
2008.29,2013.24,SPIKE,The only reason you've lasted as long
2008.29,2013.24,SPIKE,as you have is you've got ties to the world.
2014.09,2018.25,SPIKE,"Your mum, your brat kid sister, the Scoobies."
2018.57,2022.69,SPIKE,"They all tie you here,"
2018.57,2022.69,SPIKE,but you're just puttin' off the inevitable.
2024.57,2027.85,SPIKE,"Sooner or later, you're gonna want it."
2029.13,2033.17,SPIKE,"And the second that happens,"
2033.81,2036.37,SPIKE,you know I'll be there.
2036.45,2038.65,SPIKE,I'll slip in.
2038.73,2041.25,SPIKE,Have myself a real good day.
2046.57,2049.09,SPIKE,Here endeth the lesson.
2049.69,2052.21,SPIKE,I just wonder if you'll like it
2049.69,2052.21,SPIKE,as much as she did.
2052.29,2055.09,BUFFY,"Get out of my sight, Spike. Now."
2057.05,2059.36,BUFFY,Did I scare ya?
2059.45,2063.16,BUFFY,You're the Slayer.
2059.45,2063.16,BUFFY,Do somethin' about it. Hit me.
2064.53,2067.81,BUFFY,Come on. One good swing.
2064.53,2067.81,BUFFY,You know you want to.
2067.89,2069.29,BUFFY,I mean it.
2069.29,2070.41,SPIKE,So do I.
2070.49,2072.72,SPIKE,"Give it me good, Buffy. Do it."
2072.81,2074.8,BUFFY,Spike.
2078.49,2081.05,BUFFY,What the hell are you doing?
2083.33,2086.41,SPIKE,"Come on. I can feel it, Slayer."
2087.93,2090.37,SPIKE,You know you wanna dance.
2092.49,2094.13,BUFFY,Say it's true.
2096.33,2098.61,BUFFY,Say I do want to.
2101.69,2104.57,BUFFY,"It wouldn't be you, Spike."
2105.77,2107.89,BUFFY,It would never be you.
2113.49,2115.8,BUFFY,You're beneath me.
2156.65,2158.7,HARMONY,"Spike, what are you doing?"
2158.7,2159.65,SPIKE,Beneath me"?
2159.73,2164.02,SPIKE,I'll show her.
2162.09,2164.48,SPIKE,Put her six bloody feet beneath me.
2166.77,2169.05,SPIKE,Hasn't got a death wish?
2169.93,2172.45,SPIKE,Bitch won't need one.
2178.05,2182.68,SPIKE,"OK, I'm trying to be supportive here,"
2178.05,2182.68,SPIKE,so don't drive a stake through my heart.
2182.77,2186.45,SPIKE,But you can't kill Buffy.
2186.53,2189.17,SPIKE,She's the Slayer.
2186.53,2189.17,SPIKE,She is so gonna kick your ass.
2189.25,2191.93,SPIKE,I've got two barrels here
2189.25,2191.93,SPIKE,that'll prove you wrong.
2192.01,2195.53,HARMONY,I knew you'd take this personally.
2192.01,2195.53,HARMONY,You are so sensitive.
2196.45,2199.01,HARMONY,How are you gonna kill her? Think.
2199.09,2202.77,HARMONY,"The second you even point that thing at her,"
2199.09,2202.77,HARMONY,you're gonna be all...
2203.01,2209.02,HARMONY,Then you'll get bitchslapped up and
2203.01,2209.02,HARMONY,down Main Street unless she stakes you.
2207.09,2210.8,SPIKE,"Sure, it'll hurt like hell for about two hours,"
2211.17,2214.88,SPIKE,but she'll be dead
2211.17,2214.88,SPIKE,just a little longer than that.
2214.97,2217.97,HARMONY,Fine. But don't come
2214.97,2217.97,HARMONY,crying to me when you fail.
2218.09,2221.88,HARMONY,You couldn't kill her before you got the chip.
2218.09,2221.88,HARMONY,You had plenty of chances.
2222.41,2224.07,DRUSILLA,Why can't you kill her?
2224.07,2227.04,SPIKE,You're the one who keeps bringin' her up.
2227.13,2230.33,SPIKE,I haven't said a word about
2227.13,2230.33,SPIKE,the Slayer since we left California.
2230.41,2232.61,SPIKE,"She's on the other side of the planet, Dru."
2232.73,2235.09,DRUSILLA,But you're lying.
2235.17,2239.37,DRUSILLA,I can still see her floating
2235.17,2239.37,DRUSILLA,"all around you, laughing."
2241.17,2244.8,DRUSILLA,Why? Why won't you push her away?
2244.89,2247.53,SPIKE,"But I did, pet. I did it for you."
2248.29,2250.93,SPIKE,You keep punishing me.
2251.01,2253.24,SPIKE,Carrying on with creatures like this.
2255.33,2260.2,CHAOS DEMON,"OK, you guys obviously have"
2255.33,2260.2,CHAOS DEMON,a thing going on here.
2261.29,2263.6,DRUSILLA,"I have to find my pleasures, Spike."
2264.89,2268.68,DRUSILLA,You taste like ashes.
2264.89,2268.68,DRUSILLA,So this is my fault now?
2271.25,2273.93,DRUSILLA,I didn't know she was seein' somebody.
2275.57,2279.57,SPIKE,I should take off.
2275.57,2279.57,SPIKE,"Yeah, why don't you do that?"
2283.61,2286.08,DRUSILLA,"You can't blame the girl, Spike."
2287.21,2289.97,DRUSILLA,You're all covered with her.
2290.89,2293.61,DRUSILLA,"I look at you,"
2293.69,2296.21,DRUSILLA,all I see is the Slayer.
2301.41,2304.36,BUFFY,I put together that grocery list for you.
2304.36,2305.73,JOYCE,"Great. Thanks, hon."
2307.13,2308.69,BUFFY,Are you OK?
2308.69,2309.97,JOYCE,I'm fine.
2310.05,2312.21,JOYCE,Have you seen my conditioner?
2312.21,2314.29,BUFFY,Did you look under the sink?
2321.21,2323.73,BUFFY,Where are you going?
2323.81,2326.2,JOYCE,"I was hoping to put this off, but..."
2327.09,2331.56,JOYCE,You know the "nothing" that I've been
2327.09,2331.56,JOYCE,dealing with for the last couple of weeks?
2331.65,2333.8,JOYCE,It might not be nothing.
2335.13,2336.61,BUFFY,What is it?
2337.73,2343.13,JOYCE,I'm staying overnight at the hospital
2337.73,2343.13,JOYCE,for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan.
2345.45,2347.49,JOYCE,It's only one night.
2347.57,2353.17,JOYCE,"And they say, even if there is something,"
2347.57,2353.17,JOYCE,it's still very early if they didn't see it before.
2355.49,2357.4,BUFFY,I'm gonna be fine.
2358.89,2361.2,BUFFY,I know you will.
2414.21,2416.65,BUFFY,What do you want now?
2426.61,2428.57,SPIKE,What's wrong?
2432.29,2434.28,BUFFY,I don't wanna talk about it.
2442.97,2445.33,SPIKE,Is there something I can do?
