11.74,12.9,,"Oh, look!"
12.99,16.45,,It's Buffy and all her friends.
12.99,16.45,,That's witty.
16.53,19.83,,Do you ever wonder why nobody cool
16.53,19.83,,ever wants to hang out with you?
19.91,20.99,Buffy,Just thankful.
21.08,24.79,Rhonda,Were you this popular at your old school
21.08,24.79,Rhonda,before you got kicked out?
26.25,29.09,Tor,Careful. She might beat you up.
38.09,39.95,Xander,Hey! Buffy!
39.99,40.88,Willow,You missed it.
40.88,41.64,Buffy,Missed what?
41.67,44.78,Xander,We just saw the zebras mating!
41.67,44.78,Xander,Thank you. Very exciting.
44.81,47.31,Willow,"It was like the Heimlich, with stripes!"
47.39,51.44,Buffy,And I missed it. Yet somehow
47.39,51.44,Buffy,I'll find the courage to live on.
51.52,52.25,Willow,Where were you?
52.25,53.82,Buffy,"Uh, I was looking at the fishes."
53.9,55.05,Willow,Was it cool?
55.05,56.4,Buffy,It was fishes.
56.43,59.91,Xander,I'm feeling that you're not
56.43,59.91,Xander,in the fieldtrip spirit here.
59.99,63.15,Buffy,"Well, it would... It's nothing, I..."
63.19,66.84,Buffy,We did the same zoo trip at my old school
63.19,66.84,Buffy,every year. Same old same old.
66.87,69.12,Xander,"Buffy, this isn't just about"
66.87,69.12,Xander,looking at a bunch of animals.
69.16,71.68,Xander,This is about not being in class!
71.68,73.44,Buffy,"You know, you're right."
73.47,77.63,Buffy,Suddenly the animals look shiny and new.
77.63,80.02,Xander,Gotta have perspective.
83.72,84.89,Kyle,Lance!
85.81,87.74,Kyle,How's it going?
87.74,89.02,Lance,"Hey, Kyle."
89.1,92.1,Kyle,"So, is this like a, uh, family reunion?"
92.56,92.8,Lance,No.
92.8,96.11,Kyle,I think it's a family reunion. It's so...
96.65,99.82,Kyle,touching. Doesn't anybody have a camera?
99.9,101.9,Rhonda,Hey! Does your mom still
99.9,101.9,Rhonda,"pick out your lice,"
101.9,103.93,Lance,or are you old enough
101.9,103.93,Lance,to do that yourself now?
103.97,105.08,Lance,Quit it.
105.24,106.99,Lance,"Hey! Guys, come on!"
107.08,109.33,Lance,It's got my notes in there!
109.33,111.08,Mr. Flutie,What's going on here?
111.16,113.5,Mr. Flutie,I've had it up to here with you four.
113.58,115.58,Mr. Flutie,What are you doing?
115.58,116.42,Kyle,Nothing.
116.5,118.37,Mr. Flutie,Did I ask you to speak?
118.41,121.92,Mr. Flutie,"OK, I guess I did."
118.41,121.92,Mr. Flutie,But I want the truth. Lance?
124.8,127.85,Lance,They weren't doing anything.
127.93,130.98,Lance,Really. We were just playing around.
131.31,133.27,Mr. Flutie,All right.
135.56,138.06,Mr. Flutie,I'll be watching you.
142.11,144.32,Mr. Flutie,You...
145.24,146.7,Kyle,came through big time.
146.78,148.87,Rhonda,"Way to go, Lance!"
148.95,151.43,Tor,Flutie's been looking for a reason
148.95,151.43,Tor,to come down on us.
151.46,152.31,Lance,It's OK.
152.31,154.68,Kyle,"Come on, we're gonna"
152.31,154.68,Kyle,check out the Hyena House.
154.72,156.68,Lance,But I think it's off limits.
156.68,159.27,Kyle,"And therein, my friend, lies the fun."
173.39,176.52,Willow,What are Kyle and his buds
173.39,176.52,Willow,doing with Lance?
176.6,179.35,Xander,"Oh, playing with him"
176.6,179.35,Xander,as a cat plays with a mouse.
179.44,181.91,Buffy,What is it with those guys?
181.91,185.02,Willow,They're obnoxious. Professionally.
183.04,185.46,Xander,"Well, every school has 'em."
183.04,185.46,Xander,"So, you start a new school,"
185.49,189.1,Xander,"you get your desks,"
185.49,189.1,Xander,some blackboards and some mean kids.
189.13,190.95,Buffy,"Yeah, well, I'd better extract Lance..."
190.95,191.65,Xander,I'll handle it.
191.68,194.87,Xander,This job doesn't require actual slaying.
198.16,199.82,Buffy,You don't think we should follow?
199.82,201.32,Willow,"Kyle and those guys are jerks,"
201.36,203.42,Willow,but they're all talk.
203.5,204.18,Willow,Mostly.
204.18,205.75,Buffy,Why don't we...?
205.8,207.92,Willow,"Yeah, why don't we."
208.67,211.97,Zookeeper,"Hold it, hold it."
208.67,211.97,Zookeeper,Are you blind or are you just illiterate?
212.05,214.32,Zookeeper,Because hyenas are
212.05,214.32,Zookeeper,very quick to prey on the weak.
214.35,215.21,Buffy,We were just...
215.21,216.7,Zookeeper,You're not going in there.
216.73,218.44,Zookeeper,Anyone that does is in a world of trouble.
218.44,221.28,Willow,No. No one's going in there.
221.85,222.96,Buffy,Why is it off limits?
222.96,223.91,Zookeeper,It's a quarantine.
223.95,228.18,Zookeeper,"These hyenas just came in from Africa,"
223.95,228.18,Zookeeper,so keep out.
228.49,230.24,Zookeeper,Even if they call your name.
230.24,231.93,Buffy,What are you talking about?
231.96,236.32,Zookeeper,A Masai tribesman told me that hyenas
231.96,236.32,Zookeeper,are capable of understanding human speech.
236.35,239.56,Zookeeper,"They follow humans around by day,"
236.35,239.56,Zookeeper,learning their names.
239.59,243.47,Zookeeper,"At night, when the campfire dies,"
239.59,243.47,Zookeeper,they call out to a person.
243.81,246.94,Zookeeper,"And once they separate him,"
246.98,252.05,Zookeeper,the pack... devours them.
264.35,266.06,Kyle,Cool!
275.2,277.28,Lance,I don't see any hyenas.
279.74,282.73,Lance,OK. Now we've seen it.
282.76,283.94,Rhonda,It looks cute.
283.94,285.96,Kyle,I think it looks hungry.
286.39,288.4,Tor,"Come on, Spot! Suppertime!"
288.4,289.56,,Stop... Guys...
290.05,293.69,Lance,Stop! It's not funny!
293.72,295.73,Lance,Stop it! It's not funny!
295.82,297.73,Xander,Why don't you pick on
295.82,297.73,Xander,someone your own species?
297.73,300.69,Kyle,"What, are you gonna get in my face?"
392.58,398.41,Willow,b>"The Pack"</b>
402.17,404.8,Willow,I thought Xander would be here by now.
404.88,407.63,Buffy,That'd make him on time.
404.88,407.63,Buffy,We couldn't have that.
407.72,410.97,Willow,Did he seem upset at all
407.72,410.97,Willow,on the bus back from the zoo?
411.15,412.45,Buffy,About what?
412.83,415.16,Willow,I don't know. He was quiet.
415.46,417.33,Buffy,I didn't notice anything.
417.54,422.42,Buffy,But then again I'm not as hyperaware of him
417.54,422.42,Buffy,"as, oh, say, for example, you."
422.5,423.46,Willow,Hyperaware?
423.55,428.05,Buffy,"I'm not constantly monitoring his health,"
423.55,428.05,Buffy,"his moods, his blood pressure."
428.09,429.94,Willow,over 80.
430.05,432.01,Buffy,"You got it bad, girl."
432.1,438.02,Willow,He makes my head go tingly.
432.1,438.02,Willow,You know what I mean?
436.05,437.06,Buffy,I dimly recall.
437.06,439.56,Willow,But it hasn't happened to you lately?
440.43,441.94,Buffy,Not of late.
442.02,445.65,Willow,Not even for a dangerous
442.02,445.65,Willow,and mysterious older man
445.74,448.43,Willow,whose leather jacket
445.74,448.43,Willow,you're wearing right now?
448.46,450.12,Buffy,It goes with the shoes.
450.12,450.7,Willow,Come on!
450.78,453.95,Willow,Angel pushes your buttons.
450.78,453.95,Willow,You know he does.
454.7,459.38,Buffy,I suppose some girls
454.7,459.38,Buffy,might find him goodlooking.
459.42,462.63,Buffy,If they have eyes.
459.42,462.63,Buffy,"All right, he's a honey, but"
462.66,465.14,Buffy,"it's just... he's never around, and,"
465.17,469.3,Buffy,"when he is, all he wants to do"
465.17,469.3,Buffy,is talk about vampires and I...
469.38,471.25,Buffy,I just can't have a relationship...
471.25,471.89,Willow,There he is!
471.97,473.03,Buffy,Angel?
473.03,474.26,Willow,Xander.
481.19,482.44,Xander,Girls!
482.44,483.27,Buffy,Boy!
483.48,487.19,Xander,Sorry I'm late. I... just forgot
483.48,487.19,Xander,that we were gonna be here.
487.27,488.37,Willow,Hungry!
488.37,491.54,Willow,"Xander, you still want me"
488.37,491.54,Willow,to help you with geometry tomorrow?
491.58,493.95,Xander,We can work after class.
493.99,496.12,Xander,Yeah. What is this crap?
496.33,499.03,Buffy,"Well, it was my buttery croissant."
499.03,502.79,Xander,"Man, I need some food. Birds live on this."
506.76,508.2,Xander,What?
508.23,509.33,Buffy,What's up with you?
509.33,510.43,Willow,Is something wrong?
510.47,511.73,Willow,Did I do something?
511.73,513.52,Xander,What could you possibly do?
513.55,516.85,Xander,That's crazy talk. I'm just... restless.
516.94,519.94,Willow,"Well, we could go to the icecream place."
519.94,521.07,Xander,I like it here.
524.77,526.23,Buffy,"OK, now what?"
526.23,528.02,Xander,You took a bath.
528.11,531.78,Buffy,Yeah. I often do.
528.11,531.78,Buffy,I'm actually known for it.
531.86,533.32,Xander,That's OK.
534.99,539.16,Buffy,And the weirdbehavior award goes to...

585.29,588.21,Xander,The kid's fat!
603.56,608.22,Giles,Right! That's enough training for one day.
608.25,610.9,Buffy,That last roundhouse was kinda sloppy.
608.25,610.9,Buffy,Are you sure you don't wanna do it again?
610.94,613.77,Giles,"No! No, no, that's fine."
613.81,616.52,Giles,You just... run along to class.
618.48,622.1,Giles,While I wait for the feeling
618.48,622.1,Giles,to return to my arms.
625.41,626.53,Mr. Flutie,"Oh, my God!"
628.66,629.95,Mr. Flutie,Look out!
630.04,632.58,Mr. Flutie,Stop! Whoa! Get it! Get it!
637.21,640.76,Mr. Flutie,"Lordy, Herbert!"
637.21,640.76,Mr. Flutie,"Gave Mr. Flutie quite a scare, didn't he?"
640.84,646.02,Mr. Flutie,"Students, I'd like you all to meet Herbert,"
644.09,647.22,Mr. Flutie,our new mascot
644.09,647.22,Mr. Flutie,for the Sunnydale High Razorbacks!
650.93,652.97,Buffy,He's so cute!
650.93,652.97,Buffy,He's not cute!
652.97,657.3,Mr. Flutie,No! He's a fierce razorback!
657.33,659.67,Buffy,"He doesn't look mean, Mr. Flutie."
659.67,662.37,Mr. Flutie,"He's mean. He's ready for action, see?"
662.4,666.95,Mr. Flutie,Here are the tusks... A scary razorback.
667.03,670.28,Buffy,You're right. He's a fine mascot
667.03,670.28,Buffy,and will engender school spirit.
670.32,672.53,Mr. Flutie,He'd better.
670.32,672.53,Mr. Flutie,Costs a fortune to feed him.
672.54,677.03,Mr. Flutie,"All right, let's get you"
672.54,677.03,Mr. Flutie,back into your cage.
677.07,679.42,Mr. Flutie,This way.
681.34,682.56,Xander,I'm not getting this.
682.56,683.72,Willow,"It's simple, really."
683.76,686.3,Willow,"See, the bisector of a vertex"
686.33,691.51,Willow,is the line that divides the angle
686.33,691.51,Willow,at that vertex into two equal parts.
691.4,693.81,Xander,"It's like a big blur,"
691.4,693.81,Xander,all these numbers and angles.
693.9,696.64,Willow,It's the same stuff from last week.
693.9,696.64,Willow,You had it down then.
696.68,698.51,Xander,Why do I need to learn this?
698.51,700.73,Willow,Cause otherwise you'll flunk math.
700.81,702.77,Xander,Explain the part why that's bad.
702.86,706.03,Willow,"You remember. You fail math,"
702.86,706.03,Willow,"you flunk out of school,"
706.11,709.65,Willow,you end up being the guy at the pizza place
706.11,709.65,Willow,that sweeps the floor and says:
709.74,710.85,Xander,"Hey, kids, where's"
710.85,712.75,Willow,the cool parties this weekend?"
712.78,714.26,Xander,We've been through this.
714.26,715.67,Willow,Do you have a headache?
715.75,719.34,Xander,Yeah. And I think
715.75,719.34,Xander,I know what's causing it.
720.3,723.8,Xander,Ah! That's better.
720.3,723.8,Xander,It goes right to the source of the pain.
723.89,724.33,Willow,Xander...
724.33,726.09,Xander,"Look, forget it, OK? I don't get it."
726.12,729.2,Xander,I won't ever. I don't care!
730.05,732.17,Willow,We can finish this another time.
732.2,736.38,Mr. Flutie,"See, the problem is you kids today"
732.2,736.38,Mr. Flutie,have no school spirit.
738.08,740.75,Mr. Flutie,Hold on. Let me get his outfit off.
740.83,745.39,Mr. Flutie,Today it's all gangs and drugs and
740.83,745.39,Mr. Flutie,those movies on Showtime with the nudity.
745.42,746.97,Mr. Flutie,I don't have cable. I only heard.
747.36,749.69,Mr. Flutie,"When I was your age,"
747.36,749.69,Mr. Flutie,we cared about the school's reputation
749.72,752.22,Mr. Flutie,and the football team's record.
749.72,752.22,Mr. Flutie,All that stuff.
752.25,754.93,Mr. Flutie,"Of course, when I was your age"
752.25,754.93,Mr. Flutie,I was surrounded by old guys
754.97,760.25,Mr. Flutie,telling me how much better
754.97,760.25,Mr. Flutie,things were when they were my age.
760.5,761.62,Buffy,Yeah.
781.75,784.6,Coach Harrold,All right... it's raining.
785.5,789.53,Coach Harrold,All regular gym classes
785.5,789.53,Coach Harrold,have been postponed.
789.57,792.22,Coach Harrold,So you know what that means.
792.25,794.44,Coach Harrold,Dodge ball.
794.53,798.49,Coach Harrold,"For those of you that may have forgotten,"
794.53,798.49,Coach Harrold,the rules are as follows:
798.57,800.49,"dodgeball! Now, for those of you that may have forgotten, the rules are as follows",You dodge.
808.29,810.84,Coach Harrold,Here we go!
808.29,810.84,Coach Harrold,On your guards!
902.64,904.93,Coach Harrold,"God, this game is brutal."
905.03,906.8,Coach Harrold,I love it!
914.78,916.42,Willow,Xander?
916.45,918.5,Willow,What's wrong with you?
926.02,926.89,Xander,I guess you've noticed
926.02,926.89,Xander,that I've been different around you lately.
926.97,927.79,Willow,Yes.
927.79,930.65,Xander,I think I'm...
930.69,934.06,Xander,I think it's because my feelings for you
930.69,934.06,Xander,have been changing.
934.24,937.58,Xander,And while we've been friends
934.24,937.58,Xander,for such a long time
937.66,940.58,Xander,that I feel like I need to tell you something.
941.63,943.71,Xander,"I've, um..."
945.09,950.52,Xander,I've decided to drop geometry. So I won't
945.09,950.52,Xander,be needing your math help any more.
950.59,955.6,Xander,Which means I won't have to look
950.59,955.6,Xander,at your pasty face again.
973.76,977.07,Buffy,Are you gonna say something to me?
999.77,1000.92,Xander,Dogs.
1000.92,1002.31,Kyle,Where?
1007.07,1009.16,Boy#1,You're out of your mind!
1007.07,1009.16,Boy#1,That's no way to play lead guitar!
1009.16,1009.79,Boy#2,What're you talking about?
1009.79,1010.41,Boy#1,That's just hunt and peck.
1010.45,1011.05,Boy#2,It's not!
1011.05,1011.85,Boy#1,"Hey, Xander."
1011.88,1015.1,Boy#1,You've heard Wretched Refuse play. What
1011.88,1015.1,Boy#1,do you think of the guy who plays lead?
1017.03,1018.08,Boy#1,Hey!
1018.16,1019.5,Boy#1,Hey! What are you guys...?
1019.5,1019.91,Rhonda,Shut up.
1019.99,1021.45,Kyle,You're sharing.
1021.66,1023.75,Xander,Friends like to share.
1026.46,1027.01,Xander,Good?
1027.01,1029.09,Tor,It's too well done.
1029.59,1032.3,Boy#1,Hey! That is not cool.
1040.26,1041.31,Boy#1,Hey!
1067.79,1069.88,Xander,Let's do lunch.

1172.55,1175.91,Willow,"I've known him my whole life, Buffy."
1175.95,1180.61,Willow,"We haven't always been close,"
1175.95,1180.61,Willow,but he's never...
1180.69,1183.19,Buffy,I think something's wrong with him.
1183.28,1186.24,Willow,Or maybe there's something wrong with me.
1187.91,1190.62,Buffy,What are you talking about?
1190.7,1196.12,Willow,Come on. He's not picking on you.
1190.7,1196.12,Willow,He's just sniffing you a lot.
1197.29,1200.88,Buffy,I don't know.
1197.29,1200.88,Buffy,Maybe three isn't company any more.
1201.72,1204.04,Buffy,You think this has something to do with me?
1204.07,1206.05,Willow,Of course.
1206.13,1209.97,Buffy,No. That still doesn't explain why
1206.13,1209.97,Buffy,he's hanging out with the Dode Patrol.
1210.05,1213.43,Buffy,Something's going on. Something weird.
1213.51,1216.19,Willow,What are you gonna do?
1216.23,1218.39,Buffy,Talk to the expert on weird.
1218.48,1221.4,Giles,Xander's taken to teasing
1218.48,1221.4,Giles,the less fortunate?
1221.48,1224.33,Giles,And there's a noticeable change
1221.48,1224.33,Giles,in both clothing and demeanor?
1224.37,1225.08,Buffy,Yes.
1225.12,1229.43,Giles,"And, well, otherwise all his spare time"
1225.12,1229.43,Giles,is spent... lounging about with imbeciles.
1229.51,1231.34,Buffy,"It's bad, isn't it?"
1231.34,1232.97,Giles,It's devastating.
1233.06,1236.73,Giles,He's turned into a 16yearold boy.
1233.06,1236.73,Giles,"Of course, you'll have to kill him."
1236.81,1238.81,Buffy,"Giles, I'm serious!"
1238.81,1239.65,Giles,So am I!
1239.73,1242.23,Giles,Except for the part about killing him.
1242.32,1245.51,Giles,Testosterone is a great equaliser.
1242.32,1245.51,Giles,Turns all men into morons.
1245.51,1247.28,Giles,"He will, however, get over it."
1247.31,1250.16,Buffy,"I cannot believe that you, of all people,"
1247.31,1250.16,Buffy,are trying to Scully me!
1250.24,1253.13,Buffy,There is something supernatural
1250.24,1253.13,Buffy,at work here.
1253.13,1256,Giles,Get your books! Look stuff up!
1256.03,1258.52,Giles,Look under what?
1258.56,1260.75,Buffy,I don't know. That's your department.
1260.83,1263.67,Giles,The evidence that you've presented me with
1260.83,1263.67,Giles,is sketchy at best.
1263.75,1266.67,Buffy,He scared the pig.
1267.24,1268.3,Buffy,"Well, he did."
1268.3,1270.33,Giles,"Buffy, boys can be cruel."
1270.41,1276.5,Giles,They tease. They prey on the weak.
1270.41,1276.5,Giles,It's a natural teen behavior pattern.
1276.78,1279.03,Buffy,What did you just say?
1279.12,1281.75,Giles,Um... they tease.
1281.79,1286.22,Buffy,They prey on the weak.
1281.79,1286.22,Buffy,I've heard that somewhere before...
1286.57,1290.05,Buffy,Xander has been acting totally wiggy
1286.57,1290.05,Buffy,ever since we went to the zoo.
1290.09,1293.35,Buffy,"Him and Kyle and all those guys,"
1290.09,1293.35,Buffy,they went into the hyena cage.
1293.43,1295.33,Buffy,"Oh, God, that laugh."
1295.37,1297.95,Giles,You're saying that
1295.37,1297.95,Giles,Xander's becoming a hyena?
1297.95,1299.14,Buffy,I don't know.
1299.18,1302.65,Buffy,Or been possessed by one?
1299.18,1302.65,Buffy,Not just Xander. All of them.
1302.73,1305.44,Giles,"Well, I've certainly never heard of..."
1305.44,1307.36,Willow,Herbert! They've found him!
1307.44,1309.19,Buffy,The pig?
1309.19,1310.28,Willow,Dead.
1310.61,1314.44,Willow,And also eaten.
1310.61,1314.44,Willow,Principal Flutie's freaking out.
1314.47,1317.14,Buffy,"Testosterone, huh?"
1318.82,1321.07,Willow,What are you gonna do?
1321.16,1323.24,Giles,Get my books.
1323.53,1325.62,Giles,Look stuff up.
1333.88,1335.76,Mr. Flutie,You four!
1336.71,1337.15,Kyle,What?
1337.15,1339.68,Mr. Flutie,"Oh, don't think I don't know."
1339.76,1345.51,Mr. Flutie,Three kids saw you outside Herbert's room.
1339.76,1345.51,Mr. Flutie,You're busted. Yeah. You're going down.
1346.1,1348.14,Rhonda,How is Herbert?
1348.14,1349.23,Heidi,Crunchy!
1351.39,1354.11,Mr. Flutie,That's it! My office! Right now!
1355.32,1356.65,Mr. Flutie,Now!
1362.16,1364.1,Mr. Flutie,"You're gonna have so much detention,"
1364.1,1366.64,Mr. Flutie,your grandchildren'll be
1364.1,1366.64,Mr. Flutie,staying after school.
1366.97,1370.54,Buffy,"Wow! Apparently, Noah rejected"
1366.97,1370.54,Buffy,the hyenas from the Ark
1370.62,1374.6,Buffy,because he thought they were
1370.62,1374.6,Buffy,"an evil, impure mixture of dogs and cats."
1374.61,1376.69,Willow,Hyenas aren't well liked.
1376.78,1380.16,Buffy,They do seem to be the schmoes
1376.78,1380.16,Buffy,of the animal kingdom.
1380.24,1384.37,Willow,Why couldn't Xander be possessed
1380.24,1384.37,Willow,by a puppy or some ducks?
1384.45,1386.53,Buffy,That's assuming "possession" is the right word.
1386.53,1389.78,Buffy,"Oh, I'll say it is."
1386.53,1389.78,Buffy,The Masai of the Serengeti have spoken of
1389.82,1392.66,Buffy,animal possession for generations now.
1393.04,1395.4,Buffy,I should've remembered that.
1393.04,1395.4,Buffy,"So, how does it work?"
1395.44,1398.59,Giles,"Apparently, there's a sect"
1395.44,1398.59,Giles,of animal worshippers known as primals.
1398.67,1401.15,Buffy,They believe that... humanity...
1401.15,1403.09,Giles,consciousness... the soul
1403.28,1406.07,Giles,"is a perversion, a dilution of spirit."
1406.16,1408.32,Giles,To them the animal state is holy.
1408.41,1409.31,Buffy,"They're able,"
1409.31,1411.52,Giles,"through transpossession, toto..."
1411.55,1414.62,Buffy,draw the spirit of certain animals
1411.55,1414.62,Buffy,into themselves.
1414.71,1416.71,Buffy,And then they started acting like hyenas.
1416.79,1419.94,Giles,Only the most predatory of animals
1416.79,1419.94,Giles,are of interest to primals.
1419.94,1422.03,Buffy,"So, yes, that would fit."
1422.06,1425.67,Buffy,"So, what happens to the person"
1422.06,1425.67,Buffy,once the spirit's in them?
1425.7,1428.47,Giles,If it goes unchecked?
1433.06,1435.56,Buffy,I gotta find Xander.
1465.39,1467.67,Buffy,They are strong.
1484.44,1486.11,Buffy,Xander!
1490.78,1493.41,Buffy,This is ridiculous. We need to talk.
1497.1,1499.44,Xander,I've been waiting for you to jump my bones!
1499.47,1507.02,Mr. Flutie,I have seen some sick things
1499.47,1507.02,Mr. Flutie,"in my life, believe me!"
1505.08,1507.54,Mr. Flutie,But this is beyond the pale!
1508.09,1511.92,Mr. Flutie,What is it with you people? Is it drugs?
1511.96,1517.18,Mr. Flutie,"How could you? A poor, defenseless pig!"
1517.68,1519.89,Mr. Flutie,What are you doing?
1523.64,1524.59,Buffy,Get off of me!
1524.59,1526.56,Xander,Is that what you really want?
1527.69,1531.36,Xander,We both know what you really want.
1527.69,1531.36,Xander,"You want danger, don't ya?"
1531.44,1532.89,Xander,You like your men dangerous.
1532.89,1534.24,Buffy,"You're in trouble, Xander."
1534.32,1536.97,Buffy,You are infected with some hyena thing.
1534.32,1536.97,Buffy,It's like a demonic possession.
1539.02,1542.04,Xander,"Dangerous and mean, right?"
1539.02,1542.04,Xander,"Like Angel, your mystery guy."
1542.08,1543.6,Xander,"Well, guess who just got mean."
1544.02,1548.32,Mr. Flutie,Now stop that! You're only gonna
1544.02,1548.32,Mr. Flutie,make things worse for yourselves.
1549.28,1552.91,Mr. Flutie,I'll tell you how this is gonna work.
1549.28,1552.91,Mr. Flutie,"I am gonna call your parents,"
1552.91,1555.65,Mr. Flutie,and they're gonna take you all home.
1561.08,1562.54,Mr. Flutie,Thank you.
1566.04,1567.17,Rhonda,I'm sorry.
1568.02,1569.6,Mr. Flutie,That is it!
1572.15,1575.36,Xander,Do you know how long I've waited
1575.44,1579.16,Xander,until you'd stop pretending
1575.44,1579.16,Xander,that we aren't attracted...
1583.66,1587.12,Xander,Until Willow stops kidding herself
1587.83,1590.8,Xander,that I could settle with anyone but you
1590.83,1592.79,Buffy,"Look, Xander, I don't wanna hurt you."
1594.9,1597.31,Xander,Now do you wanna hurt me?
1597.34,1601.08,Xander,"Come on, Slayer. I like it when you're scared."
1601.91,1604.87,Xander,The more I scare you... the better you smell.
1607.72,1611.73,Mr. Flutie,"You're about this close to expulsion, people!"
1612.1,1616.73,Mr. Flutie,I'm willing to talk to the school
1612.1,1616.73,Mr. Flutie,counselor and we can discuss options.
1616.82,1619.32,Mr. Flutie,Get down from there this instant!
1619.9,1622.15,Mr. Flutie,Ow!
1623.85,1625.53,Mr. Flutie,Are you insane?!
1652.02,1654.71,Buffy,Hurry up. We gotta get him
1652.02,1654.71,Buffy,locked up somehow before he comes to.
1654.75,1656.67,Willow,"Oh, my God! What happened?"
1656.67,1657.41,Buffy,I hit him.
1657.44,1658.63,Willow,With what?
1658.63,1659.47,Buffy,A desk.
1659.51,1662.33,Buffy,He tried his hand
1659.51,1662.33,Buffy,at felony sexual assault.
1662.81,1666.32,Willow,"Oh, Buffy, the hyena in him didn't..."
1666.32,1666.6,Buffy,No.
1666.63,1669.7,Buffy,"No, but it's safe to say that"
1666.63,1669.7,Buffy,in his animal state his idea of wooing
1669.78,1673.75,Buffy,doesn't involve a Yanni CD
1669.78,1673.75,Buffy,and a bottle of Chianti.
1673.83,1676.5,Willow,There. That oughta hold him. Where's Giles?
1676.54,1679.12,Willow,He got called to some teacher's meeting.
1676.54,1679.12,Willow,What are we gonna do?
1679.16,1681.42,Buffy,I mean... How do we get Xander back?
1681.5,1684.05,Buffy,Right now I'm a little more worried about
1681.5,1684.05,Buffy,what the rest of the pack are up to.
1684.08,1689.64,Giles,The rest of the pack was spotted
1684.08,1689.64,Giles,outside Herbert the mascot's cage.
1689.68,1693.63,Giles,They were sent to the principal's office.
1693.63,1695.85,Willow,Good. That'll show 'em.
1695.89,1697.71,Willow,Did it show 'em?
1699.31,1701.49,Buffy,"They didn't hurt him, did they?"
1701.52,1704.65,Giles,"They, uh... ate him."
1709.86,1712.45,Buffy,They ate Principal Flutie?
1712.53,1714.16,Willow,Ate him up?
1714.87,1721.33,Giles,"The, uh, official theory is that wild dogs"
1714.87,1721.33,Giles,got into his office somehow.
1721.75,1723.84,Giles,There was no one at the scene.
1724.25,1728.38,Willow,But Xander didn't. He was with you.
1729.38,1731.76,Giles,"Oh! Well, that's a small mercy."
1731.84,1734.78,Buffy,"Giles, how do we stop this?"
1731.84,1734.78,Buffy,How do you transpossess someone?
1734.81,1737.42,Giles,I'm afraid I still don't have all the pieces.
1737.46,1741.19,Giles,Accounts of the primals and their methods
1737.46,1741.19,Giles,are a bit thin on the ground.
1741.23,1744.21,Giles,"There is some talk of a predatory act,"
1744.21,1746.57,Buffy,"but the exact ritual is, um..."
1749.08,1755.33,Giles,The Malleus Maleficarum deals in the
1749.08,1755.33,Giles,"particulars of demonic possession, which"
1755.87,1757.95,Buffy,may apply.
1759.87,1761.12,Buffy,Yes. One should be able
1761.12,1763.36,Giles,to transfer the spirits to another human.
1763.39,1766.13,Buffy,"Oh, that's great! Any volunteers?"
1766.13,1767.38,Giles,Oh. Good point.
1767.41,1770.11,Buffy,What we need to do
1767.41,1770.11,Buffy,is put the hyena back in the hyena.
1770.14,1771.66,Giles,"Bbut until we know more, uh..."
1771.66,1773.48,Buffy,Betcha that zookeeper could help us.
1773.52,1778.1,Buffy,Maybe he didn't quarantine those hyenas
1773.52,1778.1,Buffy,because they were sick.
1778.18,1780.05,Giles,We should talk to him.
1780.05,1780.31,Buffy,OK.
1780.39,1783.37,Buffy,"Oh, wait! Somebody's gotta watch Xander."
1783.37,1783.89,Willow,I will.
1783.98,1786.54,Buffy,"Will, are you sure? If he wakes up..."
1786.54,1788.06,Willow,I'll be all right. Go.
1788.98,1791.07,Buffy,Come on.
1859.38,1860.63,Xander,Willow.
1862.93,1864.39,Willow,How are you feeling?
1865.64,1868.35,Xander,Like somebody hit me with a desk.
1869.39,1871.75,Xander,What am I doing here?
1871.75,1873.44,Willow,You're resting.
1874.65,1877.36,Xander,You guys got me locked up now.
1877.44,1879.86,Willow,Cause you're sick. Buffy said.
1879.94,1882.83,Xander,"Oh, yeah. Buffy"
1879.94,1882.83,Xander,and her allpurpose solution.
1882.83,1884.94,Xander,"Punch 'em out, knock 'em down."
1884.97,1887.25,Xander,I'd love to see what she'd do
1884.97,1887.25,Xander,to somebody who was really sick.
1887.29,1890.5,Willow,That's not fair!
1887.29,1890.5,Willow,Buffy's saved both of our lives.
1890.58,1894.48,Xander,"Before she came here, our lives didn't"
1890.58,1894.48,Xander,"need that much saving, did they?"
1894.52,1899.17,Xander,Weren't things a lot simpler
1894.52,1899.17,Xander,when it was just you and me?
1900.38,1901.01,Willow,Maybe.
1901.01,1903.97,Xander,When we were alone together.
1904.05,1908.26,Xander,"Willow, I know there's something"
1904.05,1908.26,Xander,wrong with me. I think it's getting worse.
1908.35,1911.14,Xander,But I can't just stand around
1908.35,1911.14,Xander,waiting for Buffy to decide it's time
1911.15,1913.65,Xander,to punch me out again.
1913.69,1917.81,Xander,"Look, I want you to help me. I want you."
1917.84,1919.95,Willow,I am helping you.
1919.99,1922.83,Xander,You're doing what you're told.
1923.69,1927.85,Willow,"Buffy's trying to help you, too."
1923.69,1927.85,Willow,You know that.
1927.88,1929.68,Willow,Or Xander does.
1929.68,1930.28,Xander,Yeah.
1930.37,1935.06,Xander,Buffy's so selfless.
1930.37,1935.06,Xander,Always thinking of us.
1935.1,1938.25,Xander,"Well, if I'm so dangerous,"
1935.1,1938.25,Xander,how come she left you alone with me?
1938.33,1939.89,Willow,I told her to.
1939.89,1940.33,Xander,Why?
1940.37,1943.63,Willow,Cause I know you better than she does.
1943.71,1948.55,Willow,And I wanted to be here to see if
1943.71,1948.55,Willow,you were still you.
1949.59,1951.64,Xander,You know I am.
1951.72,1953.31,Xander,Look at me.
1957.93,1960.06,Xander,Look.
1960.15,1962.23,Willow,Xander...
1964.69,1966.23,Willow,Now I know.
1966.32,1969.36,Xander,Let me out! Let me out!
1969.45,1972.15,Zookeeper,The students have been possessed?
1972.15,1972.48,Giles,Yes!
1972.98,1973.92,Zookeeper,Are you sure?
1973.92,1975.79,Buffy,"We're really, really sure."
1975.82,1978.1,Giles,You don't seem
1975.82,1978.1,Giles,enormously surprised by this.
1978.13,1980.3,Zookeeper,The zoo imported those hyenas from Africa.
1980.3,1982.88,Zookeeper,There was something strange
1980.3,1982.88,Zookeeper,about them from day one.
1982.91,1986.92,Zookeeper,I did some homework.
1982.91,1986.92,Zookeeper,That particular breed is very rare.
1989.02,1991.43,Zookeeper,"Totally vicious. Historically,"
1989.02,1991.43,Zookeeper,they were worshipped by these guys.
1991.51,1992.3,Giles,Primals.
1992.3,1994.09,Zookeeper,Yeah. Creepy guys.
1994.18,1997.51,Zookeeper,"Now, they had rituals"
1994.18,1997.51,Zookeeper,"for taking the hyena spirits, but"
1997.6,2000.11,Zookeeper,I don't see how that
1997.6,2000.11,Zookeeper,could've happened to your kids.
2000.14,2004.36,Giles,We don't know how the ritual works.
2000.14,2004.36,Giles,"Only that it involves, uh,"
2004.45,2006.48,Giles,a predatory act and some kind of symbol.
2006.48,2010.82,Zookeeper,Predatory act? Of course.
2006.48,2010.82,Zookeeper,That makes sense.
2010.85,2012.04,Zookeeper,Where did you read that?
2012.04,2013.68,Giles,D'you have Sherman Jeffries' work
2013.68,2015.52,Giles,on cults and...
2015.52,2016.13,Buffy,Boys?
2016.17,2016.79,Giles,Sorry.
2016.79,2018.12,Zookeeper,Look. Look...
2018.2,2020.31,Zookeeper,I think we may have enough information
2020.31,2024.48,Zookeeper,so that together we could
2020.31,2024.48,Zookeeper,pull off a reverse transpossession.
2024.52,2025.5,Buffy,What do we do?
2025.38,2028.96,Zookeeper,You've gotta get those possessed students
2025.38,2028.96,Zookeeper,over to the hyena cage right away.
2029.04,2031.51,Zookeeper,I'll meet you there.
2029.04,2031.51,Zookeeper,We can begin the rituals.
2031.62,2033.26,Buffy,"Well, we can guarantee you one of them,"
2033.29,2035.82,Buffy,but there are four more and
2033.29,2035.82,Buffy,we have no idea where they are.
2035.84,2037.39,Zookeeper,"No, I wouldn't worry about that."
2037.42,2040.17,Zookeeper,"After hyenas feed and rest, they will track"
2040.21,2042.93,Zookeeper,the missing member of their pack
2040.21,2042.93,Zookeeper,until they find him.
2042.97,2045.64,Zookeeper,They should come right to you.
2046.66,2048.6,Buffy,Willow!
2055.15,2056.36,Buffy,Willow!
2056.45,2058.95,Willow,I'm not listening.
2071.59,2074.34,Kyle,Willow
2077.3,2079.8,Kyle,Willow
2080.26,2082.76,Willow,Xander shut up!
2082.85,2085.52,Kyle,Willow!
2200.21,2202.42,Giles,Run!
2215.56,2216.94,Buffy,I think they're going.
2216.94,2218.45,Willow,They could be faking it.
2218.49,2220.86,Buffy,"No, they're hungry."
2218.49,2220.86,Buffy,They'll be looking for somebody weak.
2220.95,2223.38,Buffy,"I'm really sorry, Will. I didn't know"
2220.95,2223.38,Buffy,they were gonna come after Xander.
2223.38,2223.77,Willow,It's OK.
2223.77,2225.42,Giles,We must lead them back to the zoo.
2225.45,2226.62,Giles,if we're going to stop it.
2226.62,2227.84,Buffy,And before their next meal.
2227.84,2228.87,Buffy,Guess that's my job.
2228.87,2229.79,Giles,"Well, individually"
2229.83,2231.7,Giles,they're almost as strong as you.
2229.83,2231.7,Giles,"As a group, they're..."
2231.73,2234.06,Buffy,"They're tough,"
2231.73,2234.06,Buffy,but I think they're getting stupider.
2234.1,2237.65,Buffy,You guys go to the zoo
2234.1,2237.65,Buffy,and I will bring them to you.
2238.7,2243.29,Mr. Anderson,I didn't say she looks better than you.
2238.7,2243.29,Mr. Anderson,I said she looks better.
2244.13,2249.67,Mrs. Anderson,"I heard what I heard. Joey, chew."
2244.13,2249.67,Mrs. Anderson,You have to chew or you'll choke.
2254.18,2258.01,Mr. Anderson,I don't see why we have to have
2254.18,2258.01,Mr. Anderson,this conversation every time we see them.
2258.51,2260.6,Mrs. Anderson,I didn't start it.
2261.48,2262.94,Mr. Anderson,Damn!
2263.31,2265.45,Mr. Anderson,Where are the keys?
2265.45,2265.9,Mrs. Anderson,Huh?
2266.94,2269.69,Mrs. Anderson,Joey!
2269.78,2271.44,Mrs. Anderson,Joey!
2272.28,2273.95,Mrs. Anderson,Joey.
2277.2,2279.16,Mrs. Anderson,Get out!
2281.15,2284.16,Mrs. Anderson,What's going on?
2281.15,2284.16,Mrs. Anderson,"Hey, get off! Get off!"
2289.71,2291.55,Mrs. Anderson,Joey! Joey!
2292.05,2293.34,Mrs. Anderson,Joey!
2302.06,2303.22,Mrs. Anderson,Joey!
2304.19,2306.82,Buffy,Didn't your mom teach you?
2307.03,2309.36,Buffy,Don't play with your food.
2315.7,2319.5,Buffy,Come on. You know what you want.
2331.47,2333.93,Willow,The pathway to the hyena house.
2334.46,2336.23,Willow,Where's the zookeeper?
2336.23,2337.67,Giles,He must be inside.
2337.76,2339.72,Giles,I'll go in and prepare things. You just...
2339.72,2344.24,Giles,"warn, uh, us when you hear"
2339.72,2344.24,Giles,Buffy and the others approaching.
2368.83,2370.5,Giles,Doctor?
2371.21,2374.04,Giles,Uh... zookeeper?
2377.3,2382.88,Giles,"Oh, of course. The, uh..."
2377.3,2382.88,Giles,Masai ceremonial garb. Yes. Very good.
2383.05,2386.93,Giles,"Are you, uh, otherwise prepared"
2383.05,2386.93,Giles,for the transpossession?
2387.47,2389.06,Zookeeper,Almost.
2390.52,2394.81,Giles,"Oh, right. The, uh sacred circle."
2394.9,2397.48,Giles,"Yes, you'd need that to, um..."
2398.02,2401.99,Giles,But this would be here when...
2398.02,2401.99,Giles,when the children first came.
2403.11,2405.2,Giles,Why would you...?
2409.81,2411.81,Giles,"How terribly frustrating for you,"
2411.9,2415.69,Giles,that a bunch of schoolchildren
2411.9,2415.69,Giles,could accomplish what you could not.
2415.87,2418.25,Zookeeper,It bothered me.
2418.33,2421.46,Zookeeper,But the power will be mine.
2450.77,2453.94,Willow,They're almost here! Giles! Giles!
2453.97,2456.08,Willow,Where are the hyenas
2453.97,2456.08,Willow,for the transpossession?
2456.11,2460.92,Zookeeper,They're right here in the feeding area.
2456.11,2460.92,Zookeeper,Stay back. They haven't been fed.
2463.02,2463.44,Willow,Where's Giles?
2463.44,2464.13,Zookeeper,He's... laying in wait.
2464.42,2467.21,Willow,They're almost here!
2464.42,2467.21,Willow,Shouldn't you bring the hyenas out?
2467.24,2473.02,Zookeeper,When the time is right.
2467.24,2473.02,Zookeeper,I'm gonna need your help.
2474.56,2476.47,Buffy,They're right behind me!
2476.56,2478.64,Willow,That's Buffy. Get ready!
2479.39,2480.17,Zookeeper,Here.
2480.17,2482.19,Willow,What is this?
2482.27,2484.19,Zookeeper,"A predatory act, remember?"
2484.27,2488.23,Willow,"Uh, right."
2484.27,2488.23,Willow,You'll pretend to slash my throat and
2488.32,2490.9,Willow,and put the evil in the hyenas?
2490.9,2492.57,Zookeeper,Something like that.
2494.16,2496.95,Willow,"Buffy, it's a trap!"
2500.6,2503.31,Zookeeper,YU BA YA SA NA!
2514.18,2515.8,Xander,Willow!
2554.63,2557.18,Giles,Uh... did I miss anything?
2559.68,2563.26,Willow,I heard the vice principal's taking over
2559.68,2563.26,Willow,till they can find a replacement.
2563.35,2565.14,Buffy,Shouldn't be too hard
2563.35,2565.14,Buffy,to find a new principal.
2565.14,2567.42,Buffy,Unless they ask
2565.14,2567.42,Buffy,what happened to the last one.
2567.45,2569.26,Xander,"OK, but I had nothing"
2567.45,2569.26,Xander,"to do with that, right?"
2569.38,2569.83,Buffy,Right.
2569.83,2571.39,Willow,You only ate the pig.
2571.42,2575.11,Xander,I ate a pig? Was he cooked
2571.42,2575.11,Xander,"and called bacon, or..."
2575.19,2577.28,Xander,"Oh, my God! I ate a pig?"
2577.36,2579.87,Xander,"I mean, the whole"
2577.36,2579.87,Xander,"trichinosis issue aside, yuck!"
2579.87,2581.51,Buffy,"Well, it wasn't really you."
2581.51,2582.48,Xander,"Well, I remember"
2582.51,2585.08,Xander,"I was goin' on the field trip,"
2582.51,2585.08,Xander,"and then goin' down to the Hyena House,"
2585.16,2588.41,Xander,"and next thing, some guy's"
2585.16,2588.41,Xander,holding Willow and he's got a knife.
2588.44,2589.86,Willow,You saved my life.
2589.86,2592.54,Xander,"Hey, nobody messes with my Willow."
2595.96,2600.88,Buffy,This is definitely the superior Xander.
2595.96,2600.88,Buffy,Accept no substitutes.
2600.97,2603.28,Xander,"I didn't do anything else, did l,"
2600.97,2603.28,Xander,around you guys?
2603.31,2606.05,Xander,Anything embarrassing?
2607.39,2608.16,Buffy,Nah!
2608.16,2610.27,Willow,Not at all.
2610.3,2611.72,Buffy,C'mon. We're gonna be late.
2611.72,2612.61,Willow,See you at lunch.
2612.65,2613.86,Xander,Cool!
2613.94,2617.74,Xander,"Oh, hey, going vegetarian, huh?"
2620.4,2622.74,Giles,I've been reading up on my...
2620.4,2622.74,Giles,animal possession.
2622.82,2627.63,Giles,I cannot find anything anywhere
2622.82,2627.63,Giles,about... memory loss afterwards.
2628.62,2630.81,Xander,Did you tell them that?
2630.81,2633.18,Giles,Your secret dies with me.
2633.67,2637.65,Xander,"Shoot me, stuff me, mount me."
