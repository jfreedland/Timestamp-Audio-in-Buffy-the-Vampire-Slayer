3.76,5.55,BUFFY,"l believe in you, Spike."
7.16,8.82,BUFFY,i> They were after Spike all along.</i>
8.82,10.87,BUFFY (V.O.),i>You know what we're up against. The First.</i>
10.96,14.27,BUFFY/FIRST,"Now, Spike, you wanna see"
10.96,14.27,BUFFY/FIRST,what a real vampire looks like?
14.36,16.87,BUFFY,We won't use magic to fight this
14.36,16.87,BUFFY,until we know what we're doing.
16.96,17.78,BUFFY,Giles.
17.78,18.59,GILES,Buffy.
18.68,21.19,DAWN,i></i> They're all slayers?
18.68,21.19,DAWN,i></i> Potentials.
21.28,25.27,GILES,Waiting for one to be called. There were
21.28,25.27,GILES,"many more like them all over the world,"
25.36,29.63,GILES,"but now there's just a handful,"
25.36,29.63,GILES,and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
29.72,32.67,GILES,"What you fought was a vampire,"
29.72,32.67,GILES,but it was something more.
32.76,34.87,GILES,lt was a TurokHan.
34.96,38.55,GILES,i>A ferociously powerful killing machine</i>
34.96,38.55,GILES,i>as singleminded as an animal.</i>
38.64,41.15,GILES,l think the TurokHan
38.64,41.15,GILES,is here as an agent of the First.
41.24,44.99,BUFFY,They want an apocalypse? We'll give 'em one.
41.24,44.99,BUFFY,Cos we just became an army.
45.08,51.11,BUFFY,There is only one thing on this earth
45.08,51.11,BUFFY,"more powerful than evil, and that's us."
52.88,55.67,,i></i> Sunnydale. Watch your step.

114.16,116.55,BUFFY,Try picking on someone my own size.
117.36,119.47,BRINGER,Ow! Urgh!
124.8,127.39,BUFFY,"Rona, right?"
127.48,130.04,BUFFY,l just got word you were arriving.
130.72,132.55,RONA,You're her.
132.64,133.79,BUFFY,Her is me.
136.12,139.59,RONA,"You know, l thought..."
136.12,139.59,RONA,They told me l'd be safe here.
139.68,145.71,BUFFY,"Right. Well, you are."
139.68,145.71,BUFFY,"l mean, you will be... safer... with me around."
145.8,146.64,RONA,This is good.
146.64,148.44,BUFFY,Next time you're attacked...
148.52,152.71,RONA,"Whoa, whoa. Next time?"
148.52,152.71,RONA,You sayin' l'm gonna get attacked again?
152.8,155.39,BUFFY,Welcome to the Hellmouth.
220.52,223.39,KENNEDY (O.S.),i></i> You don't have to do this.
223.48,225.59,KENNEDY,Flooring it. ln the bag.
225.68,228.43,KENNEDY,Cos nice big comfy bed right here.
228.52,231.2,KENNEDY,"l mean, you oughta know. Your bed."
231.2,231.59,WILLOW,Yeah.
231.68,234.47,KENNEDY,But no. l'm OK. l just...
234.56,237.07,WILLOW,l like it down here. lt's firm.
237.07,240.23,KENNEDY,"Funny, you look a little uncomfortable."
240.32,242.16,KENNEDY,Or is itjust me?
242.16,242.51,WILLOW,No.
242.6,245.87,WILLOW,"l'm just, uh... uneasy cos Buffy's out."
245.96,249.23,KENNEDY,Right. How many girls arriving this time?
249.23,249.95,WILLOW,Just one.
250.04,255.39,WILLOW,But since Giles has the coven searching for
250.04,255.39,WILLOW,"other slayersinwaiting to send 'em our way,"
255.48,258.15,WILLOW,l bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.
258.24,263.71,KENNEDY,So you're saying l should enjoy having
258.24,263.71,KENNEDY,this bed all to myself as long as l can?
263.8,266.93,WILLOW,lt is starting to get crowded around here.
266.93,269.47,KENNEDY,"Totally. And with this many girls,"
269.56,273.71,KENNEDY,if we don't get another bathroom in this
269.56,273.71,KENNEDY,"house soon, things are gonna get ugly."
273.8,277.03,WILLOW,Somebody had to share mirror time
273.8,277.03,WILLOW,with a bunch of siblings.
277.12,281.71,KENNEDY,Somebody not me. l only got a halfsister
277.12,281.71,KENNEDY,and we didn't have to share.
281.8,284.47,KENNEDY,Her bedroom was in
281.8,284.47,KENNEDY,a different wing of the house.
284.56,287.93,WILLOW,Wing? Your house had wings?
287.93,288.55,KENNEDY,Yeah.
288.64,291.07,KENNEDY,Just a couple. A few.
291.16,295.99,KENNEDY,Our summer home in the Hamptons
291.16,295.99,KENNEDY,"didn't have any at all. Well, one, actually."
296.96,297.95,WILLOW,Huh.
298.04,300.35,WILLOW,"Well, that's... that's... Huh!"
300.44,306.71,KENNEDY,"But never mind my deal. What's your story,"
300.44,306.71,KENNEDY,"Willow? l mean, witchcraft? Wow!"
306.8,309.55,KENNEDY,That sounds... NewAgey.
309.64,315.59,WILLOW,"No, it's safe to say that what l practise"
309.64,315.59,WILLOW,is definitely... OldAgey.
316.04,318.29,KENNEDY,"So, show me a trick."
318.29,319.19,WILLOW,A trick?
319.28,322.59,KENNEDY,"Pull a rabbit out of something,"
319.28,322.59,KENNEDY,or make something float.
322.68,323.95,WILLOW,"Uh, yeah."
324.04,329.39,WILLOW,"Listen, Kennedy, it's almost morning"
324.04,329.39,WILLOW,and we really need to get some sleep.
330.08,334.91,KENNEDY,"Hey, if l wanted to sleep, l'd be downstairs"
330.08,334.91,KENNEDY,catching z's with the other girls.
336.2,340.71,MOLLY,Annabelle was all
336.2,340.71,MOLLY,"Control your fear, control your fear."""
340.8,343.75,MOLLY,"Meanwhile, she's the one"
340.8,343.75,MOLLY,"that goes scamperin' off,"
343.84,346.91,MOLLY,right into that TurokHan vampire.
347,348.75,MOLLY,Poor Annie.
348.84,353.19,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,Great. So the Slayer who's supposed
348.84,353.19,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,to protect us let her get killed?
353.28,358.23,MOLLY,She didn't let her. Annabelle was foolish.
353.28,358.23,MOLLY,Buffy can't be faulted for arriving too late.
358.32,362.2,BRUNETTE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,lt's not like she could've stopped it.
358.32,362.2,BRUNETTE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,The supervampire messed her up good.
362.28,366.39,RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,No lie. She still looked like
362.28,366.39,RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"a big bruise when l got here,"
366.48,369.63,RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"and that was already, like, the day after."
369.72,375.07,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,And why isn't she back yet? Buffy?
369.72,375.07,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,She left to get the new girl over an hour ago.
377.08,381.83,MOLLY,Maybe she ran into trouble. You don't
377.08,381.83,MOLLY,think maybe she was too late again?
381.92,383.71,MOLLY,Maybe...
381.92,383.71,MOLLY,Maybe we can save maybes
383.8,386.79,XANDER,"for a more of a dayish part of the day, girls."
388.56,394.15,XANDER,Potential slayers can function without sleep.
388.56,394.15,XANDER,l'm no good without my usual 90 minutes.
394.24,397.19,ANDREW,l'm with him. Keep the chatter down.
397.28,399.87,ANDREW,Or speak up so l can hear you.
401.32,404.35,ANDREW,l'm bored. <i>Episode One</i> bored.
405.12,407.15,BUFFY,You guys are all still up?
407.15,408.71,XANDER,Ah! Who needs sleep?
409.64,410.46,BUFFY,"Everybody, this is Rona."
410.46,410.83,EVERYONE,i></i> Hey.
412.4,414.63,ANDREW,"Hey, Rona."
412.4,414.63,ANDREW,"Hey, Rona."
415.36,417.11,RONA,Um...
417.2,419.19,RONA,Why is that guy tied to a chair?
419.28,423.06,XANDER,The question you'll soon be asking is
419.28,423.06,XANDER,Why isn't he gagged?"
423.96,427.23,GILES,"Molly, show our new house guest"
423.96,427.23,GILES,where the kitchen is.
427.32,430.54,GILES,l'm sure she's hungry after her travels.
430.54,433.27,MOLLY,Fair enough. A bit peckish meself.
433.36,434.66,RONA,Bit what as well?
434.66,436.79,ANYA,That's English for "hungry".
436.88,438.23,RONA,Oh.
438.32,440.99,RONA,l thought "hungry" was English for "hungry".
441.68,442.94,GILES,Everything all right?
442.94,444.75,BUFFY,She had a welcoming committee.
444.84,446.91,XANDER,The First knows potential slayers
446.91,447.91,GILES,are coming here?
448,449.46,GILES,l must warn the coven.
449.46,452.11,BUFFY,The First will always be one step ahead.
452.2,456.75,BUFFY,l need to know how to stop it.
452.2,456.75,BUFFY,"No, not stop it, hurt it."
456.84,458.87,BUFFY,l want to hurt it real bad.
458.96,461.23,BUFFY,Tell me how.
458.96,461.23,BUFFY,"l, uh..."
461.32,463.91,GILES,"l don't know, Buffy."
464,467.27,GILES,l've exhausted all the sources
464,467.27,GILES,l have left with little result.
467.36,470.91,GILES,The watchers' records
467.36,470.91,GILES,are still really all we have to go on.
471,475.39,ANYA,l made the rounds myself. Tried to dig up
471,475.39,ANYA,anything useful from the demon community.
475.48,478.55,XANDER,They're a community now?
475.48,478.55,XANDER,"What's next, a Ladies' Auxiliary?"
478.64,482.42,ANYA,The ones that didn't attack me didn't know
478.64,482.42,ANYA,or didn't talk. We've got squat.
482.52,485.51,BUFFY,Squat's not gonna cut it.
482.52,485.51,BUFFY,What about the TurokHan?
485.6,490.15,XANDER,i></i> The vampire time forgot?
485.6,490.15,XANDER,"i></i> Time may forget him, but l won't."
490.24,494.51,BUFFY,"We know stakes don't kill it, but anything"
490.24,494.51,BUFFY,in those ancient myths about what does?
494.6,497.59,BUFFY,"Sunlight, fire. Germs?"
497.68,504.12,ANDREW,"Giles, with that thing guarding the entrance to"
497.68,504.12,ANDREW,"the First's crib, how will Buffy get to Spike?"
506.8,509.71,BUFFY,"l really hate to admit this,"
506.8,509.71,BUFFY,but he's not wrong.
509.8,512.44,,There's no way to help Spike
509.8,512.44,,until it's out of the way.
512.52,513.92,ANDREW,Spike?
514,518.79,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"Sorry, l'm confused. He's that vampire"
514,518.79,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"who's been killin' people, right?"
518.88,521.65,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,He's the one you're worried about helping?
521.65,523.63,BUFFY,"i></i> Well, we need him to..."
523.72,525.99,BUFFY,He's the one that's been...
527.52,529.47,BUFFY,"lt's complicated, Chloö."
530.48,532.43,BRUNETTE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / CHLOE,l'm Chloö. She's Eve.
532.52,538.19,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / EVE,"lt's just... Well, we've been talkin',"
532.52,538.19,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / EVE,and... do we have some kind of plan?
538.28,542.51,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / EVE,"You know, any kind of plan to..."
538.28,542.51,BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / EVE,keep us from dying?
545.64,547.35,BUFFY,We're workin' on it.
547.44,550.43,GILES,There is one avenue
547.44,550.43,GILES,that we haven't tried yet.
550.52,551.09,ANYA,Giles!
551.09,552.43,GILES,Beljoxa's Eye.
552.52,556.09,XANDER,Exactly what part of town is that avenue in?
556.09,557.23,ANYA,l told you no.
557.32,559.59,BUFFY,What is Botox's eye?
559.68,564.7,GILES,Beljoxa's Eye. lt's an oracletype creature
559.68,564.7,GILES,that exists in a dark dimension.
564.8,566.8,ANYA,lnternal vortex more like.
566.8,567.11,BUFFY,Fun.
567.2,568.33,ANYA,"Not really, no."
568.33,571.27,GILES,Only demons can open the gateway to it.
571.36,573.15,ANYA,"Excuse me, exdemon here."
573.24,576.63,GILES,You've still friends in the fold.
573.24,576.63,GILES,Or murderous acquaintances.
576.72,581.39,ANYA,There's no reason to think Beljoxa's Eye
576.72,581.39,ANYA,will have the answers we're looking for.
581.48,587.15,BUFFY,l'll take anything l can get.
581.48,587.15,BUFFY,"Anya, please, we're running out of time."
587.24,589.23,BUFFY,Spike's running out of time.
640.08,643.03,BUFFY/FIRST,"Dreaming of me again, aren't you?"
643.12,645.11,BUFFY/FIRST,Poor Spike.
645.2,647.99,BUFFY/FIRST,He still thinks l believe in him.
648.08,652.15,BUFFY/FIRST,Be realistic.
648.08,652.15,BUFFY/FIRST,l don't even believe in myself.
652.24,655.75,BUFFY/FIRST,"At least, not enough"
652.24,655.75,BUFFY/FIRST,to risk my skin to save your ass.

669.8,672.74,BUFFY/FIRST,You know it never would've worked out.
672.74,676.07,SPIKE,lt's time to let go so we can both move on.

735.4,738.27,TORG,The night we spent together
735.4,738.27,TORG,was important to me.
738.36,740.87,TORG,lt was one date. lt wasn't even a date.

790.36,793.51,GILES,"You help us,"

876.72,879.03,XANDER,i></i> OK.
879.12,882.03,BUFFY,"Listen up, Andrew."
879.12,882.03,BUFFY,l don't know what to do with you.
882.12,884.68,BUFFY,We don't have time to babysit a hostage.
884.68,887.63,XANDER,Especially one that's more than a little ripe.
889.6,893.95,BUFFY,"So l'm here to tell you,"
889.6,893.95,BUFFY,"if you try anything, try to run..."
894.04,896.11,BUFFY,Did you ever see the movie <i>Misery?</i>
896.11,897.87,ANDREW,Six times. But the book was scarier
897.96,903.63,ANDREW,cos instead of crushing his foot with a
897.96,903.63,ANDREW,"sledgehammer, Kathy Bates chops it off..."
904.92,906.69,ANDREW,l'll be good.
906.69,907.51,WILLOW,Buffy?
908.84,913.63,WILLOW,Word from the underground. Another
908.84,913.63,WILLOW,potential arrived the day before yesterday.
913.72,916.39,WILLOW,"She's at the Sunspot Motel, near the highway."
916.48,918.91,XANDER,Why are we just finding out about it now?
919,921.67,WILLOW,Bringers killed her watcher
919,921.67,WILLOW,before he could tell us.
921.76,927.19,WILLOW,"lf it wasn't for a powerful seer in the coven,"
921.76,927.19,WILLOW,we wouldn't even know about it now.
927.28,930.19,BUFFY,OK. There's still a couple
927.28,930.19,BUFFY,of hours of daylight left.
930.28,932.74,BUFFY,You guys should be safe here. l'll get her.
932.74,933.71,XANDER,l'll go with you.
933.8,936.83,ANDREW,"All right, retrieving a potential."
933.8,936.83,ANDREW,Let's do it!
939.84,942.75,ANDREW,Or l could just go wash up.
946.64,947.95,DAWN,Where are they going?
947.95,950.31,WILLOW,Bring another newbie in from the cold.
950.4,951.11,DAWN,Another one?
951.11,953.23,WILLOW,"Well, the more the better, l figure."
953.32,955.47,WILLOW,We need all the help we can get.
955.56,958.48,DAWN,"Help. Sure, that's cool, but..."
958.48,958.95,WILLOW,What?
960.56,965.39,DAWN,l'm just not sure more scared
960.56,965.39,DAWN,slayer wannabes translates as help.
975.48,977.25,EVE,What are we all doin' here?
977.25,978.63,KENNEDY,lt's called training.
978.72,982.31,KENNEDY,Didn't your watcher teach you the word?
978.72,982.31,KENNEDY,l never had a watcher.
982.4,987.15,RONA,l only found out what l was  or might be 
982.4,987.15,RONA,after those crazyass monks came after me.
987.24,990.03,EVE,l meant why are we all botherin'?
990.72,992.74,EVE,lt's not like we can make a difference.
992.74,994.03,MOLLY,i></i> We've gotta train.
994.12,996.34,MOLLY,We gotta keep our reflexes sharp.
996.34,998.16,KENNEDY,i></i> We have to be ready.
998.24,1002.23,CHLOE,lf something comes down...
998.24,1002.23,CHLOE,"No, something's already come down."
1002.32,1005.35,EVE,She's right. And what are we
1002.32,1005.35,EVE,supposed to do about it?
1005.44,1011.43,EVE,"l mean, l've never seen a real vampire"
1005.44,1011.43,EVE,"in my whole life, much less a slayed one."
1011.52,1013.71,RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,l've seen one.
1013.8,1017.47,RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"Well, my watcher once showed me"
1013.8,1017.47,RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,a photograph of one.
1018.72,1020.26,RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,A blurry photograph.
1020.26,1022.03,EVE,That's what l'm sayin'.
1022.12,1026.35,EVE,Not one of us is remotely prepared
1022.12,1026.35,EVE,to be activated as the new Chosen One.
1026.44,1027.76,KENNEDY,l feel pretty prepared.
1027.76,1029.19,RONA,"Excuse the newness of me,"
1029.28,1031.71,RONA,"butjust so l understand, if a slayer dies..."
1031.8,1034.55,EVE,"Well, <i>when</i> the Slayer dies."
1034.64,1037.99,EVE,"l mean, nobody lives forever, right?"
1038.08,1039.23,RONA,One of us...
1039.23,1041.35,EVE,Gets activated. Uhhuh.
1041.44,1042.61,MOLLY,l prefer "called".
1042.61,1044.55,RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,l heard there's more than one.
1044.64,1046.08,KENNEDY,More than one what?
1046.08,1049.03,RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,Slayer. There's another one. Somewhere.
1049.12,1051.09,MOLLY,That doesn't make any sense.
1051.09,1052.63,EVE,Like any of this does.
1052.72,1057.47,EVE,"No matter how many there are,"
1052.72,1057.47,EVE,"one of us is gonna be the next Slayer,"
1057.56,1060.87,EVE,with the weight of the world on her shoulders.
1060.96,1064.15,CHLOE,"lt won't be me. l mean, not now."
1065,1068.03,CHLOE,"l mean, l'm too young."
1068.12,1069.55,CHLOE,lt doesn't work that way.
1069.55,1071.39,KENNEDY,"ln fact, the younger the better."
1071.48,1072.47,CHLOE,l'm starting to think
1072.47,1073.79,KENNEDY,it might be too late for me.
1073.88,1076.55,EVE,Never too late. lt could be anyone.
1076.55,1079.99,KENNEDY,Especially since there are so few of us left.
1080.08,1083.07,EVE,They'll just run through each one of us.
1083.16,1086.23,EVE,One after the other.
1086.32,1088.47,EVE,"Kinda creepy, huh?"
1088.56,1092.55,EVE,All we do is wait around for each other to die.
1098.16,1099.27,XANDER,You sure this is it?
1099.27,1101.67,BUFFY,Clerk said it's the only checkin in a week.
1101.76,1102.96,BUFFY,Tourism must be down.
1102.96,1105.31,XANDER,Right in the middle of apocalypse season.
1105.4,1106.99,BUFFY,Hello.
1108.68,1112.23,BUFFY,lt's OK. We're friendly.
1108.68,1112.23,BUFFY,And we have eyes.
1112.32,1114.03,XANDER,Buffy.
1114.12,1116.11,XANDER,Kick the door down.
1124.52,1127.31,BUFFY,She's cold. Been dead for days.
1127.4,1130.95,XANDER,Poor kid. Made it all the way to Sunnydale
1127.4,1130.95,XANDER,just to get herself killed.
1131.04,1132.84,XANDER,lf only we...
1132.84,1133.39,BUFFY,Eve.
1133.48,1135.51,XANDER,"Eve, who's in our house?"
1145.2,1147.39,EVE,"Just my personal opinion,"
1147.48,1152.31,EVE,but l don't think the Slayer
1147.48,1152.31,EVE,can protect us from the First.
1158.72,1162.23,ANDREW,Another interesting thing:
1158.72,1162.23,ANDREW,how come the Slayer's always a girl?
1162.32,1164.09,DAWN,l dunno. Cos girls are cooler?
1164.09,1166.28,ANDREW,l think a guy slayer would be badass.
1166.36,1169.67,ANDREW,"Like, if there was this ninja,"
1166.36,1169.67,ANDREW,a guy slayer would be like:
1169.76,1172.71,ANDREW,"You may be silent, but this'll shut you up."""
1173.52,1175.55,DAWN,Buffy could stomp ninja ass.
1175.55,1178.31,ANDREW,The silent warrior? Haha! l think not.
1178.4,1183.91,ANDREW,She can't even slay that special vampire.
1178.4,1183.91,ANDREW,Everyone's saying.
1184,1188.27,DAWN,Everyone should shut up. And stop
1184,1188.27,DAWN,pretending anybody here is your friend.
1188.36,1193.91,ANDREW,"And also, why's she so about saving Spike?"
1188.36,1193.91,ANDREW,He's a worse killer than me by... a way lot.
1194,1197.19,DAWN,Spike was being controlled by the First.
1197.28,1199.31,DAWN,And he has a soul now.
1199.4,1201.75,DAWN,"Besides, we need his help."
1203.08,1206.86,ANDREW,What about me? Did it ever occur to anyone
1203.08,1206.86,ANDREW,that l could be a lot more useful?
1206.96,1209.59,ANDREW,l used to be an evil genius. Hello?
1209.59,1211.91,DAWN,And what was your genius thing?
1212,1215.03,ANDREW,"Well, um... raising demons mostly."
1215.96,1219.92,ANDREW,"OK, so not for now,"
1215.96,1219.92,ANDREW,but also there was planning.
1220,1222.39,ANDREW,"There were, um... blueprints."
1223.08,1227.59,ANDREW,"l can be in this, kickin' it righteous."
1223.08,1227.59,ANDREW,"Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah."
1228.68,1233.15,DAWN,"Buffy said if you talked enough,"
1228.68,1233.15,DAWN,l'm allowed to kill you.
1233.24,1234.91,ANDREW,Not even.
1234.91,1235.83,DAWN,Even.
1236.76,1239.15,ANDREW,"Licence to kill, huh?"
1239.24,1242.95,ANDREW,"Pretty cool. You know,"
1239.24,1242.95,ANDREW,Timothy Dalton never got his props
1243.04,1246.31,ANDREW,"cos he came in at the end of an old regime,"
1243.04,1246.31,ANDREW,but he had it going on.
1246.4,1251.87,ANDREW,He went rogue with the Broccolis.
1246.4,1251.87,ANDREW,"They were just treading water, stylistically."
1251.96,1254.71,DAWN,ls there a language that you're speaking?
1258.36,1259.91,ANDREW,l'm so alone.
1260,1263.63,DAWN,Then maybe you shouldn't
1260,1263.63,DAWN,have killed your only friend.
1263.72,1266.59,ANDREW,l hate that. You don't even know.
1267.68,1268.57,DAWN,l don't plan to.
1268.57,1270.4,ANDREW,The Slayer's not getting it done.
1270.48,1275.99,ANDREW,"l have got my ear to the ground,"
1270.48,1275.99,ANDREW,and... that's the word.
1279.68,1282.27,ANDREW,Do you wanna play Kevin Bacon?
1290.24,1290.89,WILLOW,Buffy.
1290.89,1292.83,DAWN,i></i> What is it?
1303.56,1305.26,BUFFY,Get away from them.
1305.26,1307.31,KENNEDY,Who? Get away from who?
1308.28,1310.05,EVE,"What's the problem, officer?"
1310.05,1311.95,BUFFY,l said get away from them now.
1312.04,1313.49,DAWN,"Buffy, what did Eve do?"
1313.49,1314.43,XANDER,That's not Eve.
1314.52,1315.66,BUFFY,Eve's dead.
1315.66,1317.63,RONA,l don't understand.
1318.72,1320.91,EVE,Oops! One more down.
1321,1324.31,EVE,"Oh, well, can't save 'em all, can ya, Buffy?"
1325.24,1329.79,EVE,"Thanks for the slumber party, girls."
1325.24,1329.79,EVE,lt's been real fun these past couple of nights.
1329.88,1331.66,EVE,l learned a whole lot...
1331.66,1333.15,BUFFY,Shut up and get out!
1334.04,1338.83,EVE,Or you'll do what? l'll be sending
1334.04,1338.83,EVE,"a guest over to visit y'all later on tonight,"
1338.92,1341.31,EVE,"after the sun goes down, of course."
1341.4,1345.59,EVE,Try and make him feel welcome
1341.4,1345.59,EVE,before he rips y'all to pieces.
1347.36,1349.27,EVE,Bye.
1350.72,1353.28,ANDREW,l need to go wash up again.
1353.8,1357.23,BELJOXA'S EYE,"lt cannot be fought, it cannot be killed."
1357.32,1360.75,BELJOXA'S EYE,The First Evil has been and always will be.
1360.84,1365.86,BELJOXA'S EYE,"Since before the universe was born,"
1360.84,1365.86,BELJOXA'S EYE,"long after there is nothing else, it will go on."
1365.96,1368.75,GILES,l refuse to believe that.
1365.96,1368.75,GILES,There must be a way to destroy it.
1368.84,1371.51,BELJOXA'S EYE,Am l talkin' to myself here? There's no way.
1371.6,1374.47,ANYA,"OK, we tried. Let's go, Giles."
1374.56,1378.67,GILES,Are you saying the First will succeed
1374.56,1378.67,GILES,in wiping out the line of slayers?
1378.76,1383.88,BELJOXA'S EYE,"The Eye sees not the future,"
1378.76,1383.88,BELJOXA'S EYE,only the truth of the now and before.
1383.96,1387.19,ANYA,"Yes, we've all got that. lt's called memory."
1387.28,1390.31,ANYA,Can you help us out with something
1387.28,1390.31,ANYA,a little bit more demony?
1390.4,1393.87,GILES,lf the First has been around
1390.4,1393.87,GILES,"for all time, then..."
1393.96,1397.03,GILES,why hasn't it attempted
1393.96,1397.03,GILES,something like this before? Why now?
1397.12,1400.23,BELJOXA'S EYE,The opportunity
1397.12,1400.23,BELJOXA'S EYE,has only recently presented itself.
1400.32,1401.35,GILES,Opportunity?
1401.44,1405.75,BELJOXA'S EYE,The mystical forces surrounding the chosen
1401.44,1405.75,BELJOXA'S EYE,"line have become irrevocably altered,"
1405.84,1408.67,BELJOXA'S EYE,"become unstable, vulnerable."
1408.76,1410.08,ANYA,Something the First did?
1410.08,1412.23,BELJOXA'S EYE,"The First did not cause the disruption,"
1412.32,1417.19,BELJOXA'S EYE,only seized upon it to extinguish
1412.32,1417.19,BELJOXA'S EYE,the lives of the chosen forever.
1417.96,1422.75,GILES,Then what has caused the disruption?
1417.96,1422.75,GILES,What is responsible for letting this happen?
1422.84,1424.83,BELJOXA'S EYE,The Slayer.
1425.8,1426.54,RED-HEAD SLAYER IN TRAINING,We should run.
1426.54,1427.43,KENNEDY,"And go where, Vi?"
1427.52,1429.42,DAWN,Annabelle ran. Look where it got her.
1429.42,1430.35,BUFFY,Safer in than out.
1430.44,1434.11,MOLLY,How can you say that?
1430.44,1434.11,MOLLY,"lt was here, Buffy, in the house."
1434.2,1435.56,MOLLY,Livin' with us for days.
1435.56,1436.92,CHLOE,You didn't even know it.
1437,1437.79,XANDER,None of us did.
1437.79,1440.23,RED-HEAD SLAYER IN TRAINING / VI,lt could still be here. lt could be one of us.
1440.32,1443.31,WILLOW,"No, the First can only take"
1440.32,1443.31,WILLOW,the form of dead people.
1443.4,1447.51,RONA,There'll be plenty more of those soon enough.
1443.4,1447.51,RONA,We're dropping like flies here.
1447.6,1450.47,RONA,i></i>
1450.56,1453.22,RONA,l know you're all scared. l am too.
1453.22,1456.03,BUFFY,But Giles and Anya will be back soon.
1456.12,1459.15,BUFFY,Hopefully they will have
1456.12,1459.15,BUFFY,the information that we need.
1459.24,1463.43,BUFFY,"ln the meantime, we need to stick together."
1459.24,1463.43,BUFFY,OK? We're stronger that way.
1463.52,1465.46,BUFFY,We cannot afford to fall apart now.
1465.46,1467.67,ANDREW,Right. Where would the Justice League be
1467.76,1473.19,ANDREW,if they hadn't put their differences aside
1467.76,1473.19,ANDREW,to stop the lmperium and his alien horde?
1473.28,1474.14,BUFFY,Don't help me.
1474.14,1476.03,XANDER,"i></i> Buff, the sun goes down,"
1476.12,1480.27,XANDER,"and Übervamp's on its way,"
1476.12,1480.27,XANDER,so a plan'd be good right about now.
1482.68,1484.97,BUFFY,"Will, l'm sorry to ask, but..."
1484.97,1486.95,WILLOW,l know. We need a barrier.
1487.04,1488.87,BUFFY,A major one.
1488.96,1493.39,BUFFY,Something tells me this vampire doesn't
1488.96,1493.39,BUFFY,need an invite to get into the house.
1493.48,1495.28,BUFFY,Can you do it?
1495.28,1496.43,WILLOW,l'll try.
1496.52,1496.91,RONA,Try?
1496.91,1498.27,KENNEDY,You heard her.
1498.36,1500.75,XANDER,Are you sure about Willow
1498.36,1500.75,XANDER,doing the hocuspocus?
1500.84,1501.68,XANDER,Last time she...
1501.68,1503.3,BUFFY,We don't have a lot of choices.
1503.4,1506.59,CHLOE,What if it doesn't work?
1503.4,1506.59,CHLOE,What if the monster gets through?
1506.68,1508.67,BUFFY,Then we'll deal.
1506.68,1508.67,BUFFY,i></i> Deal?
1508.76,1511.27,RONA,"Fight, you mean."
1508.76,1511.27,RONA,How are we supposed to do that?
1511.36,1512.45,VI,And with what?
1512.45,1514.79,KENNEDY,With whatever it takes! Right?
1514.88,1519.39,MOLLY,"Buffy, you fought the TurokHan,"
1514.88,1519.39,MOLLY,and it almost killed you.
1519.48,1521.52,CHLOE,And you're the real Slayer.
1521.52,1523.79,RONA,What chance do <i>we</i> have?
1525.36,1528.71,MOLLY,"Honestly, you staked that thing,"
1525.36,1528.71,MOLLY,and it didn't die.
1528.8,1530.42,DAWN,"No, but that doesn't..."
1530.42,1532.19,VI,Maybe it can't be killed.
1532.28,1533.83,DAWN,i></i> So we shouldn't try?
1533.83,1535.15,RONA,i></i> That word again.
1535.24,1536.67,KENNEDY,i></i> lt's a good word.
1536.67,1538.51,CHLOE,i></i> Give up. Can we do that?
