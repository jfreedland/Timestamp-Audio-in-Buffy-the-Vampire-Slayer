24.02,24.67,,All is calm *
24.75,27.98,,All is bright *
28.05,31.61,,Round yon virgin... *
31.69,34.99,,Mother and child *
31.69,34.99,,Watch it.
38.06,39.83,,Daniel.
39.9,41.76,,Where were you going?
41.83,43.3,Daniel,You... You're not human.
43.37,44.99,Angelus,"Not of late, no."
45.07,46.87,Daniel,Wh... What do you want?
46.94,48.03,Angelus,"Well, it happens that"
46.94,48.03,Angelus,"I'm hungry, Daniel..."
48.11,50.3,Angelus,and seeing as that you're
48.11,50.3,Angelus,somewhat in me debt...
50.37,51.47,Daniel,"Please, I can't."
51.54,52.94,Angelus,A man playing at cards
55.02,54.44,Angelus,should have
55.02,54.44,Angelus,a natural intelligence
54.51,58.51,Angelus,"or a great deal of money,"
54.51,58.51,Angelus,and you're sadly lacking in both.
61.62,64.11,Angelus,So I take me winnings
61.62,64.11,Angelus,me own way.
64.19,65.55,Daniel,The Lord is my shepherd.
65.62,67.06,Daniel,I shall not want.
67.12,69.15,Daniel,He maketh me to lie down
67.12,69.15,Daniel,in green pastures...
69.23,72.35,Angelus,"Daniel, be of good cheer."
72.43,73.76,Angelus,It's Christmas.
81.27,84.8,Weatherman,It's gonna be sunny and warm
81.27,84.8,Weatherman,with temperatures continuing
84.88,87.67,Weatherman,in the high 70s throughout
84.88,87.67,Weatherman,the holiday weekend.
87.75,90.04,Weatherman,Remember Christ our savior
90.04,92.41,Santa,was born on Christmas day *
92.48,94.97,Weatherman,To save us all
92.48,94.97,Weatherman,from Satan's power *
95.05,96.15,Weatherman,When we had gone astray *
96.15,96.85,Santa,Merry Christmas.
96.92,100.82,Santa,"Oh, tidings of comfort"
96.92,100.82,Santa,and joy *
100.89,102.65,Angel,Hi.
102.73,104.63,Buffy,Angel.
108.13,110.33,Buffy,"So, are you shopping?"
110.4,112.53,Buffy,You're probably not shopping.
112.6,115.37,Angel,I couldn't sleep.
115.44,119.21,Buffy,Vampires probably not that big on
115.44,119.21,Buffy,"Christmas, now that I think about it."
119.28,120.83,Angel,Not as a rule.
123.55,125.38,Buffy,But you're good?
127.52,129.04,Angel,I... I'm all right. You?
129.12,130.45,Buffy,Yeah.
130.52,132.72,Buffy,"Yeah, I'm good."
132.79,136.73,Buffy,I was just getting some
132.79,136.73,Buffy,Christmas gifts for the gang.
136.79,140.63,Buffy,"Um, I'd better go before"
136.79,140.63,Buffy,the magic store closes.
144.97,146.27,Buffy,Angel?
149.64,151.3,Buffy,What is it?
214.67,217.07,Buffy,And then he just bailed.
214.67,217.07,Buffy,He didn't say anything.
217.14,219.7,Buffy,He just took off.
217.14,219.7,Buffy,It was so weird.
219.78,223.34,Xander,Angel? Weird?
219.78,223.34,Xander,What are the odds?
223.41,227.44,Willow,Do you think something's wrong?
223.41,227.44,Willow,Maybe you should tell Giles.
227.52,230.65,Buffy,No. I don't wanna bug Giles.
230.72,233.85,Buffy,He's still kinda twitchy when it
230.72,233.85,Buffy,comes to the subject of Angel.
233.92,237.16,Xander,It must be that whole "Angel killed
233.92,237.16,Xander,his girlfriend and tortured her" thing.
237.23,239.86,Xander,Giles is pretty petty
237.23,239.86,Xander,when it comes to stuff like that.
239.93,242.3,Buffy,"Xander, enough, okay?"
242.37,245.49,Buffy,Maybe Angel just has
242.37,245.49,Buffy,the holiday blues.
245.57,249.47,Buffy,"Everybody gets them,"
245.57,249.47,Buffy,especially when they're alone.
249.54,252.17,Buffy,It's just so frustrating.
252.24,255.47,Buffy,I'm trying to do the right thing
252.24,255.47,Buffy,and stay away from him
255.55,259.92,Buffy,"and get over it,"
255.55,259.92,Buffy,"and then boom, there he is."
259.98,263.92,Buffy,"I just want a nice,"
259.98,263.92,Buffy,quiet Christmas vacation.
263.99,265.72,Buffy,"Xander: So, you doing"
265.72,267.12,Xander,anything special?
267.19,270.06,Buffy,Buffy: Tree. Nog. Roast beast.
270.13,272.76,Buffy,"Just me and Mom and,"
270.13,272.76,Buffy,"hopefully, an excess of gifts."
272.83,274.42,Buffy,What are you doing for Christmas?
274.5,276.56,Willow,Being Jewish.
274.5,276.56,Willow,"Remember, people?"
276.63,278.93,Willow,Not everybody worships Santa.
281.02,281.49,Buffy,I just meant for vacation.
281.57,282.83,Willow,Nothing fun.
282.91,288.47,Willow,Oz and I had planned...
282.91,288.47,Willow,But I guess that's off.
288.55,289.98,Xander,"Well, I'll be enjoying"
290.05,292.02,Xander,my annual Christmas Eve campout.
292.08,294.14,Xander,"See, I take"
292.08,294.14,Xander,my sleeping bag outside
294.22,295.98,Xander,and I go to sleep
294.22,295.98,Xander,on the grass.
296.05,297.42,Willow,Buffy: Sounds fun.
297.49,298.68,Xander,"Yeah, I like to look"
297.49,298.68,Xander,"at the stars, you know?"
298.76,299.98,Xander,Feel the whole nature vibe.
300.06,301.85,Cordelia,I thought you slept outside
301.93,304.55,Cordelia,to avoid your family's
301.93,304.55,Cordelia,drunken Christmas fights.
304.63,307.65,Xander,"Yes, and that was a confidence"
304.63,307.65,Xander,I was hoping
307.73,309.63,Xander,you would share with everyone.
309.7,313.69,Cordelia,"Well, I'll be in Aspen skiing..."
313.77,315.17,Cordelia,with actual snow.
315.24,319.02,Buffy,I hear that helps.
317.07,319.63,Cordelia,It must be a drag to be
317.07,319.63,Cordelia,stuck here in Sweatydale...
319.71,321.37,Cordelia,but I'm thinking of you.
321.45,323.88,Cordelia,"Okay, I'm not."
323.95,327.25,Buffy,She certainly has reverted to form.
327.32,328.98,Willow,It's not her fault.
329.05,331.62,Willow,"After what happened,"
329.05,331.62,Willow,we gotta cut her some slack.
331.75,333.65,Xander,That's the Christmas spirit.
333.72,335.28,Willow,"Hello, stillJewish."
335.35,337.79,Willow,"Chanukah spirit,"
335.35,337.79,Willow,I believe that was?
337.85,341.55,Willow,"Anyway, forgiveness is pretty much"
337.85,341.55,Willow,a big theme with me this year
341.63,343.53,Willow,cause of the...
348.87,349.89,Oz,Hey.
349.97,352.23,Oz,Hey.
352.3,355.86,Oz,Okay. The thing is...
357.94,361.21,Oz,"seeing you with Xander,"
357.94,361.21,Oz,it was...
363.25,365.51,Oz,I've never felt that way before
365.58,368.38,Willow,when it wasn't a full moon...
368.45,370.32,Willow,but I know you guys
370.32,371.79,Oz,have a history.
371.86,374.79,Willow,But it's a history
371.86,374.79,Willow,that's in the past.
374.86,378.89,Willow,"Well, I... I guess most"
374.86,378.89,Willow,history is in the past.
378.96,381.23,Willow,But it's over.
381.3,382.66,Oz,"Well, I don't know."
382.73,387.64,Oz,I don't know that it ever
382.73,387.64,Oz,will be between you two.
387.7,390.33,Willow,"Oz, please believe me."
390.41,392.34,Oz,This is what I do know.
394.24,395.87,Oz,I miss you...
398.15,399.64,Oz,"like, every second."
401.22,406.38,Oz,It's like I lost an arm
401.22,406.38,Oz,"or worse, a torso."
408.93,415.13,Oz,"So, I think I'd be willing"
408.93,415.13,Oz,to give it a shot.
419.64,421.33,Willow,Really?
425.34,426.81,Oz,Yeah.
432.25,436.08,Willow,Do you want us to...
432.25,436.08,Willow,to hug now?
437.59,439.95,Oz,"Yeah, I'm good for that."
453.5,453.89,Oz,Woman:
453.89,455.44,Shopper,Take the other one then.
462.38,464.87,Joyce,Do you wanna get one
462.38,464.87,Joyce,with snow on it?
464.95,467.28,Joyce,Be very Christmasy.
467.35,469.29,Buffy,I think those are just for display.
469.35,473.08,Joyce,"Oh. You know, honey,"
469.35,473.08,Joyce,I was thinking
473.16,475.82,Joyce,maybe we should invite Faith
473.16,475.82,Joyce,to spend Christmas Eve with us.
475.89,477.33,Buffy,I don't know.
477.39,481.52,Buffy,Faith and I don't really hang out
481.6,485.43,Buffy,or talk or make eye contact lately.
485.5,486.48,Joyce,Do you really wanna
486.48,487.87,Buffy,let her spend Christmas Eve
487.94,490.93,Buffy,all by herself in that
487.94,490.93,Buffy,dingy little motel room?
492.24,494.54,Buffy,You're still number one
492.24,494.54,Buffy,"with a guilt trip, Mom."
494.61,495.61,Joyce,I try.
495.61,497.77,Buffy,I'll ask her.
499.15,500.13,Joyce,You're a doll.
500.13,501.31,Buffy,What about Giles?
501.39,502.75,Buffy,He doesn't have any fam...
502.75,503.95,Joyce,"No, I'm sure he's fine."
504.02,505.35,Buffy,We could at least ask him.
505.42,509.02,Joyce,He doesn't wanna spend Christmas Eve
505.42,509.02,Joyce,with a bunch of girls.
509.09,511.03,Joyce,Let's split up.
538.79,540.85,Tree merchant,Bunch of them up and died on us.
540.92,542.29,Tree merchant,Don't know why.
542.36,546.09,Tree merchant,"If you want one,"
542.36,546.09,Tree merchant,I can make you a hell of a deal.
546.16,547.6,Buffy,"No, thank you."
547.66,549.89,Joyce,"Joyce: Oh, honey,"
547.66,549.89,Joyce,this one's perfect.
553.24,556.17,Joyce,
565.25,568.18,Joyce,
576.13,577.72,Joyce,
576.13,577.43,Joyce,TV: Merry Christmas...
577.43,577.72,Faith,Yeah?
577.79,580.63,Faith,Happy New Year...
580.7,582.39,Faith,"Hey, what's up?"
582.47,584.59,Faith,"Work, damn it!"
584.67,586.14,Buffy,Hey.
587.9,589.39,Faith,What's going on?
589.47,591.57,Faith,Scary monsters?
591.64,593.13,Buffy,No.
596.71,599.41,Buffy,We're having Christmas Eve dinner
596.71,599.41,Buffy,at my house...
599.48,602.65,Buffy,and I thought that if you
599.48,602.65,Buffy,didn't have plans...
602.72,605.12,Faith,"Your mom sent you down, huh?"
605.19,606.95,Buffy,No.
607.02,609.22,Faith,"Well, thanks, but I got plans."
609.29,612.85,Faith,There's this big party
609.29,612.85,Faith,I've been invited to.
612.93,614.49,Faith,It should be a blast.
614.56,616.43,Buffy,"Okay, cool."
616.5,621.16,Buffy,But if you change
616.5,621.16,Buffy,"your mind, the offer..."
621.24,623.1,Faith,That's nice of you. Thanks.
623.17,626.11,Faith,But I got... I got
623.17,626.11,Faith,that big party
626.18,628.67,Faith,that I've been
626.18,628.67,Faith,"invited to, so..."
634.55,636.99,Buffy,I like the lights.
637.05,641.96,Faith,"Yeah. Well, 'tis the season."
637.05,641.96,Faith,Whatever that means.
645,647.66,Faith,
647.73,648.96,Giles,Just a minute.
656.4,658.02,Giles,Hello.
658.1,659.26,Angel,Um...
659.33,661.82,Angel,I'm sorry to bother you.
665.97,667.96,Angel,Sorry. Coming from you
668.04,670.2,Angel,that phrase strikes me
668.04,670.2,Angel,as rather funny.
670.28,671.61,Angel,Sorry to bother me.
671.68,672.8,Angel,I need your help.
672.88,674.94,Giles,And the funny keeps on coming.
675.01,678.68,Angel,I understand. I have
675.01,678.68,Angel,no right to ask for it...
678.75,680.18,Angel,but there's no one else.
682.02,683.85,Giles,All right.
689.46,692.83,Angel,I... I can't come in
689.46,692.83,Angel,unless you invite me.
692.9,695.66,Giles,I'm aware of that.
697.74,699.97,Giles,Come in.
707.08,708.64,Angel,I've been seeing...
708.71,711.74,Angel,I've had...
708.71,711.74,Angel,I've had dreams lately
711.82,714.25,Angel,about the past.
714.32,717.78,Angel,It's like I'm living it again.
717.86,719.29,Angel,"It's so vivid, I..."
719.36,720.79,Angel,I need to know.
720.86,724.16,Angel,I need to know why I'm here.
724.23,726.99,Giles,"Here, back on Earth?"
727.07,732.02,Angel,I should be in a demon dimension
730.07,731.87,Angel,suffering an eternity of torture.
731.94,733.7,Giles,I don't feel particularly
731.94,733.7,Giles,inclined to argue with that.
733.77,735.26,Angel,But I'm not.
735.34,737.28,Angel,I was freed...
737.34,739.78,Angel,and I don't understand why.
739.85,741.71,Giles,Knowing why you were back
739.85,741.71,Giles,would give you peace of mind?
741.78,743.84,Angel,It might.
743.92,746.28,Giles,You think that's something
743.92,746.28,Giles,you ought to have?
746.35,748.82,Giles,"Because, sir, to be blunt..."
748.89,752.32,Giles,the last time you became
748.89,752.32,Giles,complacent about your existence...
752.39,754.15,Giles,it turned out rather badly.
757.8,758.73,Giles,What?
758.8,759.79,Angel,There.
761.77,763.5,Angel,Don't you see her?
763.57,764.5,Giles,Who?
770.91,772.31,Angel,I can't!
803.28,806.44,Margaret,"Sir, please, I should"
803.28,806.44,Margaret,return to the party.
806.51,808.21,Angelus,"Margaret, Margaret,"
806.51,808.21,Angelus,there's no hurry.
808.28,809.71,Margaret,Mistress will be wondering...
809.78,811.32,Margaret,Shh. The mistress will be
811.32,812.55,Angelus,wondering how to get
812.62,814.11,Angelus,the good Reverend Chalmers
812.62,814.11,Angelus,into bed
814.19,815.54,Angelus,and will not notice
815.54,817.18,Margaret,the absence of canapés.
817.26,818.52,Angelus,Stay with me.
818.59,820.62,Margaret,"Sir, people might talk."
820.69,823.56,Margaret,I'll be put out in the streets.
823.63,826.36,Margaret,My little boy would...
826.43,828.26,Margaret,I can't lose this job.
828.33,831.46,Angelus,Then you best keep quiet.
831.54,833.47,Margaret,You're hurting me.
833.54,835.47,Angelus,Cry out. Call for help.
835.54,838.03,Angelus,I'm sure mistress will believe
835.54,838.03,Angelus,your behavior beyond reproach.
838.11,839.81,Margaret,Please.
839.88,843.41,Angelus,"Come, make a scene, huh?"
839.88,843.41,Angelus,Shall I?
845.18,847.15,Margaret,No.
847.22,849.55,Margaret,"No, no."
850.92,853.76,Angelus,We'll be as quiet as mice.
859.87,862.13,Angelus,No matter what.
862.2,865.76,Margaret,"Sir, my son!"
865.84,868.74,Angelus,He'll make a fine dessert.
874.38,875.75,Angelus,
899.34,901.57,Jenny,Trouble sleeping?
901.64,903.47,Angel,You're not here.
903.54,905.48,Jenny,I'm always here.
907.38,909.9,Angel,Leave me alone.
909.98,913.58,Jenny,I can't.
909.98,913.58,Jenny,You won't let me.
916.92,918.15,Angel,What do you want?
918.22,922.16,Jenny,I want to die in bed
918.22,922.16,Jenny,surrounded by fat grandchildren...
922.23,924.59,Jenny,but guess that's off the menu.
924.66,925.6,Angel,I'm sorry.
925.66,927.13,Angel,You're sorry?
927.2,928.63,Angel,For me?
928.7,930.86,Angel,Don't bother.
928.7,930.86,Angel,I'm dead.
930.94,931.93,Angel,I'm over it.
933.57,936.67,Angel,If you wanna feel
933.57,936.67,Angel,sorry for someone...
936.74,938.64,Angel,you should feel sorry
936.74,938.64,Angel,for yourself.
938.71,943.02,Angel,"Oh, but I guess you've already"
938.71,943.02,Angel,got that covered.
941.08,944.88,Angel,I am sorry...
941.08,944.88,Angel,for what I've done.
944.95,948.55,Angel,What else can I say to you?
952.02,954.65,Jenny/Daniel,I don't wanna make you feel bad.
956.93,959.3,Daniel,I just want to show you
956.93,959.3,Daniel,who you are.
959.37,961.8,Giles,You had a dream about Angel.
961.87,963.23,Buffy,I was in Angel's dream.
963.36,964.19,Buffy,I'm not sure...
964.26,965.63,Buffy,"Giles, there was stuff"
964.26,965.63,Buffy,in this dream
965.7,968.13,Buffy,that I couldn't possibly
965.7,968.13,Buffy,know about.
968.2,969.63,Buffy,It was Angel's past.
969.7,972.86,Buffy,"He was dreaming it,"
969.7,972.86,Buffy,and somehow I got sucked in.
972.94,975.84,Buffy,There's something wrong with him.
979.18,982.54,Giles,I know. I've seen him.
982.61,986.17,Giles,He wanted to know
982.61,986.17,Giles,why he was back.
986.25,990.62,Buffy,Is there a way for us
986.25,990.62,Buffy,to find that out?
990.69,993.12,Giles,Possibly. I've been looking.
993.19,995.82,Buffy,"Well, let me look too."
995.89,997.62,Buffy,I'm not seeing him anymore.
997.69,999.63,Buffy,I'm trying to put
997.69,999.63,Buffy,all this behind me...
999.7,1002.13,Buffy,and I'm not gonna be able to
1002.2,1006.83,Buffy,as long as we're both doing guest spots
1002.2,1006.83,Buffy,in each other's dreams.
1008.91,1010.46,Buffy,So we'll help him?
1011.98,1013.1,Giles,Yes.
1014.54,1016.27,Xander,Where do we start?
1019.08,1022.14,Xander,"Look, I'm aware I haven't been"
1019.08,1022.14,Xander,the mostest best friend to you
1022.22,1024.15,Xander,when it comes to the whole
1022.22,1024.15,Xander,Angel thing.
1024.22,1027.71,Xander,And I don't know. Maybe I
1024.22,1027.71,Xander,finally got the Chanukah spirit.
1027.79,1029.22,Xander,"Well, we start,"
1029.22,1032.28,Giles,"not surprisingly, with research."
1034.26,1038.22,Giles,"Xander, the Black Chronicles."
1038.3,1041.24,Giles,"And, Buffy, the diary"
1038.3,1041.24,Giles,of Lucious Temple.
1041.3,1042.74,Buffy,"An acolyte of Acathla,"
1042.74,1043.86,Giles,expert on demons.
1043.94,1045.69,Buffy,You can skip the passages
1045.69,1046.6,Giles,on his garden
1046.68,1050.13,Giles,unless you're keen on growing
1046.68,1050.13,Giles,heartier beets.
1050.21,1053.31,Buffy,Are you sure this is how you
1050.21,1053.31,Buffy,wanna spend your Christmas vacation?
1053.38,1056.18,Xander,"Yeah, this is actually the most"
1053.38,1056.18,Xander,exciting thing I've got planned.
1056.25,1058.19,Xander,Who else can claim that
1056.25,1058.19,Xander,pathetic a social life?
1058.25,1060.45,Willow,"Hey, guys."
1058.25,1060.45,Willow,What are we doing?
1077.14,1080.91,Willow,He's gonna come over on Christmas Eve
1077.14,1080.91,Willow,cause my parents are out of town.
1080.98,1082.59,Willow,We're gonna watch videos.
1082.59,1083.81,Buffy,"That's good, right?"
1084.78,1086.58,Buffy,You guys are back.
1087.65,1090.14,Willow,It's good. It's perfect...
1090.22,1093.71,Willow,"in an awkward,"
1090.22,1093.71,Willow,uncomfortable sort of way.
1095.19,1098.46,Willow,I just don't know how
1095.19,1098.46,Willow,to make Oz trust me.
1099.76,1103.93,Buffy,Xander has a piece of you
1099.76,1103.93,Buffy,that Oz just can't touch.
1106.02,1108.63,Buffy,I guess now it's just about
1106.02,1108.63,Buffy,showing Oz that he comes first.
1108.71,1110.54,Buffy,I guess.
1111.94,1112.91,Willow,Thanks.
1114.44,1116.07,Willow,"Hey, he likes beets."
1116.15,1117.91,Buffy,I read that one already.
1117.98,1120.11,Buffy,We're not getting any closer.
1123.59,1125.61,Businessman,The thing I remember most
1125.69,1129.12,Businessman,was thinking how artful it was.
1129.19,1133.13,Businessman,"In the dark, they looked"
1129.19,1133.13,Businessman,just like they were sleeping.
1133.2,1137.43,Businessman,It wasn't until I bent down
1133.2,1137.43,Businessman,and kissed them good night
1137.5,1140.44,Businessman,that I felt how cold they were.
1140.5,1145.77,Businessman,"You grabbed me, and I thought,"
1140.5,1145.77,Businessman,Who would go to so much trouble
1145.84,1148.28,Businessman,to arrange them like that?"
1149.91,1152.18,Margaret,But you see...
1152.25,1155.27,Margaret,that's what makes you
1152.25,1155.27,Margaret,different than other beasts.
1155.35,1160.58,Margaret,"They kill to feed, but you took"
1155.35,1160.58,Margaret,more kinds of pleasure in it
1160.66,1163.65,Margaret,than any creature
1160.66,1163.65,Margaret,that walks or crawls.
1163.73,1165.32,Angel,"Oh, God."
1165.4,1168.02,Margaret,"Yeah, cry out."
1168.1,1169.66,Margaret,Make a scene.
1169.73,1172.03,Daniel,I was to be married that week...
1172.1,1175.16,Daniel,"but then, as I recall,"
1172.1,1175.16,Daniel,you knew that.
1175.24,1176.07,Angel,It wasn't me.
1176.14,1177.5,Jenny,It wasn't you?
1177.57,1179.87,Angel,A demon isn't a man.
1177.57,1179.87,Angel,I was a man once.
1179.94,1183.38,Jenny,"Oh, yes, and what a man you were."
1183.45,1185.71,Jenny,
1188.65,1191.59,Margaret,"A drunken, whoring layabout..."
1191.65,1195.52,Margaret,and a terrible disappointment
1191.65,1195.52,Margaret,to your parents.
1195.59,1197.96,Angel,I was young.
1198.03,1200.13,Angel,I never had a chance to...
1200.13,1201.66,Margaret,To die of syphilis?
1201.73,1204.96,Margaret,You were a worthless being
1201.73,1204.96,Margaret,before you were ever a monster.
1205.03,1207.2,Angel,Stop it! Stop.
1207.27,1209.7,Angel,
1209.77,1211.93,Jenny,"I don't wanna hurt you, Angel..."
1214.02,1213.94,Jenny,but you have to understand.
1215.95,1219.07,Jenny,Cruelty's the only thing
1215.95,1219.07,Jenny,you ever had a true talent for.
1219.15,1221.25,Angel,That's not true.
1221.25,1221.78,Jenny,Shh.
1221.85,1223.28,Jenny,Rest.
1224.52,1225.95,Jenny,Rest.
1231.86,1234.26,Jenny,"You mistake it for a curse,"
1231.86,1234.26,Jenny,"Angel, but it's not."
1237.07,1241.02,Jenny,It's your destiny.
1242.24,1244.17,Jenny,I'll show you.
1245.31,1247.24,Jenny,I'll show you.
1358.47,1360.52,Jenny,You want her?
1360.52,1360.99,Angel,No.
1361.07,1364.97,Jenny,Take her.
1361.07,1364.97,Jenny,Take what you want.
1365.04,1368.41,Jenny,Pour all that frustration
1365.04,1368.41,Jenny,and all that guilt into her...
1368.48,1370.41,Jenny,and you'll be free.
1370.48,1371.91,Angel,No.
1373.48,1380.02,Jenny,You can't live for eternity
1373.48,1380.02,Jenny,with all that pain.
1378.09,1382.49,Jenny,"This is what you are, and this is why"
1378.09,1382.49,Jenny,we brought you back.
1382.56,1384.15,Jenny,Take her.
1385.53,1387.46,Jenny,And then you'll be ready...
1388.6,1390.53,Jenny,to kill her.
1399.27,1401.71,Giles,"Hey, Buffy, take a look."
1403.51,1408.5,Giles,These letters contain references
1403.51,1408.5,Giles,to an ancient power known as the First.
1408.58,1410.11,Buffy,First what?
1410.11,1410.81,Giles,Evil.
1410.88,1413.61,Giles,"Absolute evil,"
1410.88,1413.61,Giles,"older than man, than demons."
1413.69,1417.12,Giles,It could have had the power
1413.69,1417.12,Giles,to bring Angel back.
1417.19,1420.56,Buffy,These guys...
1417.19,1420.56,Buffy,I saw them in my dream.
1420.63,1422.72,Buffy,I fell asleep up there.
1422.8,1425.63,Giles,You had another dream with Angel?
1425.7,1427.06,Giles,What happened?
1428.7,1431.14,Buffy,"Oh, we don't need"
1428.7,1431.14,Buffy,to get sidetracked.
1431.2,1432.3,Buffy,Who are these guys?
1432.37,1433.81,Giles,"Well, they're known as the..."
1433.87,1437.07,Giles,As the Bringers or Harbingers.
1437.14,1439.34,Giles,They're high priests of the First.
1439.41,1441.68,Giles,They can conjure
1439.41,1441.68,Giles,spirit manifestations
1441.75,1444.88,Buffy,and set them on people
1441.75,1444.88,Buffy,"to influence them, haunt them."
1444.95,1447.25,Buffy,These are the guys working
1444.95,1447.25,Buffy,the mojo on Angel?
1447.32,1449.55,Xander,Xander: We gotta stop them.
1449.62,1451.61,Giles,Y... You can't fight
1449.62,1451.61,Giles,"the First, Buffy."
1451.69,1453.06,Giles,It's not a physical being.
1453.13,1454.99,Buffy,"Well, I... I can fight"
1453.13,1454.99,Buffy,these priest guys.
1455.06,1456.19,Xander,If we can find them.
1463.54,1465.47,Xander,Willy: Hey.
1465.54,1467.23,Willy,It's the slayer.
1467.31,1469.87,Willy,What brings the slayer down here?
1471.51,1474.95,Buffy,"Hey, Willy, how you been?"
1475.02,1479.42,Willy,"Keeping out of trouble,"
1475.02,1479.42,Willy,as God is my witness.
1479.49,1482.42,Willy,"So, what can I do for you?"
1482.49,1483.92,Willy,Couple of drinks?
1483.99,1486.93,Xander,Yeah. Let me get
1483.99,1486.93,Xander,a double shot of...
1486.99,1488.46,Xander,"Of information, pal."
1488.53,1490.29,Buffy,Three priests.
1488.53,1490.29,Buffy,They call themselves...
1490.36,1491.35,Xander,The Bringers.
1491.43,1493.7,Buffy,"Bringers, Harbingers."
1493.77,1496.29,Buffy,They have a "no eyes"
1493.77,1496.29,Buffy,kind of look.
1496.37,1497.3,Willy,Doesn't ring a bell.
1497.37,1500.13,Xander,How about I ring
1497.37,1500.13,Xander,that bell for you?
1500.21,1501.64,Xander,Does the threatening come now?
1501.71,1503.27,Buffy,Maybe you shouldn't help.
1503.34,1505.28,Buffy,They would've come
1503.34,1505.28,Buffy,to town recently.
1505.35,1507.07,Buffy,They'd be holed up somewhere
1507.15,1509.12,Willy,summoning the spirit of the First.
1512.69,1517.45,Willy,"Well, I heard a few things,"
1512.69,1517.45,Willy,"you know, from the underground."
1517.52,1519.32,Xander,The underground?
1519.39,1521.59,Willy,"Yeah, you know, from things"
1519.39,1521.59,Willy,that live under the ground.
1521.66,1524.6,Willy,Apparently there's been a lot
1521.66,1524.6,Willy,of migration out of Sunnydale
1524.66,1527.1,Willy,from the lower inhabitants.
1524.66,1527.1,Willy,Something's scaring them off...
1527.17,1529.16,Willy,and these are things that
1527.17,1529.16,Willy,aren't easily scared.
1529.24,1530.51,Willy,Could be your priest guys
1530.51,1531.33,Buffy,are underground.
1531.4,1532.63,Buffy,Underground where?
1532.71,1534.33,Willy,I do not know.
1536.11,1537.94,Buffy,Okay. Thanks.
1537.94,1540.05,Xander,See you around.
1540.11,1542.31,Willy,"Hey. You did great,"
1540.11,1542.31,Willy,by the way.
1542.38,1544.37,Willy,I was very intimidated by you.
1544.45,1546.35,Xander,Really?
1547.55,1548.53,Xander,Thanks.
1548.53,1549.78,Buffy,Let's go.
1549.86,1553.29,Willy,"Hey, kid."
1549.86,1553.29,Willy,Merry Christmas.
1563.6,1565.2,Xander,"Man, is it hot."
1565.27,1567.21,Xander,It was so nice
1565.27,1567.21,Xander,and cool in there.
1567.27,1569.9,Buffy,"Yeah, a nice cool waste"
1567.27,1569.9,Buffy,of time.
1569.98,1572.21,Xander,We know underground.
1569.98,1572.21,Xander,That's a start.
1572.28,1575.21,Buffy,"Sure, in a town with 14 million"
1572.28,1575.21,Buffy,square miles of sewer.
1575.28,1578.98,Xander,Plus a lot of natural cave formations
1575.28,1578.98,Xander,and a gateway to hell.
1579.05,1580.12,Buffy,"Yeah, this does"
1580.12,1581.54,Xander,resemble square one.
1582.76,1584.28,Buffy,I don't know what to do.
1584.28,1585.55,Xander,I think right now...
1585.63,1588.19,Xander,the best plan is to deck the halls
1585.63,1588.19,Xander,with boughs of holly.
1589.7,1592.89,Xander,"Look, we'll catch the bad guys,"
1589.7,1592.89,Xander,sooner or later.
1599.47,1600.87,Oz,Willow?
1603.24,1605.04,Oz,I got videos.
1605.11,1606.72,Xander,Hi.
1607.85,1610.62,Willow,Why don't you come ssit down?
1622.73,1625.13,Lyrics,I've heard people say that *
1627.37,1632.37,Lyrics,Too much of anything
1627.37,1632.37,Lyrics,"is not good for you, baby *"
1632.44,1635.94,Oz,You ever have that dream
1632.44,1635.94,Oz,where you're in a play...
1636.01,1639.88,Oz,"and you really don't know your lines,"
1636.01,1639.88,Oz,and you kind of don't know the plot?
1639.95,1642.48,Willow,"Well, we're alone..."
1642.55,1645.39,Willow,and we're together.
1645.46,1648.36,Willow,I... I just wanted it
1645.46,1648.36,Willow,to be special.
1648.43,1650.79,Oz,How special are we talking?
1650.86,1653.96,Willow,"Well, you know, we're alone..."
1654.03,1658.73,Willow,and we're both mature
1654.03,1658.73,Willow,younger people...
1658.8,1665.02,Willow,and... and so we...
1658.8,1665.02,Willow,we could...
1663.07,1667.24,Willow,I... I'm ready to...
1663.07,1667.24,Willow,w... with you.
1667.31,1669.97,Willow,We could do that thing.
1670.05,1672.54,Willow,I don't know why *
1672.62,1674.98,Willow,I can't get enough
1672.62,1674.98,Willow,"of your love, babe *"
1675.05,1676.21,Willow,Where are you going?
1676.21,1677.25,Oz,"No, I'm not going."
1677.32,1679.95,Oz,Just a dramatic gesture.
1681.03,1682.96,Oz,That's... That's pretty special.
1685.43,1689.3,Willow,"Oz, I... I wanna"
1685.43,1689.3,Willow,be with you first.
1690.37,1692.6,Oz,I think we should
1690.37,1692.6,Oz,sit down again.
1696.04,1697.2,Willow,Oz?
1699.14,1700.84,Willow,I'm ready.
1705.72,1709.18,Oz,"Okay. Well, don't take"
1705.72,1709.18,Oz,this the wrong way...
1711.76,1713.75,Oz,but I'm not.
1715.46,1718.36,Willow,"Are you scared,"
1715.46,1718.36,Willow,cause I thought you had...
1718.43,1722.46,Oz,"I have,"
1718.43,1722.46,Oz,but this is different.
1722.53,1724.64,Oz,"I mean, you look great,"
1724.64,1725.47,Willow,you know.
1725.54,1726.79,Willow,And... And you got
1726.79,1728.73,Oz,the Barry working for you...
1728.81,1731.04,Willow,and it's all...
1731.11,1732.47,Willow,good.
1732.54,1736.04,Oz,But when it happens...
1737.88,1742.65,Oz,I want it to be because we both
1737.88,1742.65,Oz,need it too for the same reason.
1744.62,1747.06,Willow,You don't have to prove
1744.62,1747.06,Willow,anything to me.
1748.56,1750.59,Willow,I just wanted you to know.
1750.66,1752.22,Oz,I know.
1752.3,1754.6,Oz,I get the message.
1768.15,1769.58,Joyce,There we go.
1769.65,1771.88,Buffy,Nothing like a roaring fire
1771.95,1773.54,Buffy,to keep away the blistering heat.
1773.62,1775.95,Joyce,"Oh, come on. It's lovely."
1776.02,1779.32,Joyce,Maybe I should turn
1776.02,1779.32,Joyce,the air conditioning on.
1782.89,1785.02,Joyce,"So, Angel's on top again?"
1785.1,1786.26,Buffy,What?
1786.33,1788.09,Joyce,Angel or star?
1788.17,1792.19,Buffy,"Oh, uh, star."
1792.27,1793.83,Buffy,Star.
1793.91,1795.34,Buffy,
1802.58,1804.14,Faith,Hey.
1805.25,1806.48,Buffy,Hi.
1807.72,1810.15,Faith,"Uh, looked like"
1807.72,1810.15,Faith,that whole party thing
1810.22,1812.25,Faith,was gonna be kind of a drag.
1813.86,1817.29,Faith,I didn't really have anything...
1817.36,1819.13,Buffy,You know.
1820.8,1822.6,Buffy,I'm glad you came.
1825.07,1826.63,Faith,"Uh, here."
1826.7,1828.7,Buffy,Why don't you come in
1828.77,1831.3,Buffy,from the entire lack of cold?
1831.38,1835.02,Faith,Mm.
1833.08,1835.51,Faith,"Uh, that one is for your mom."
1835.58,1836.84,Faith,They're pretty crappy.
1836.92,1838.38,Joyce,"Faith, you made it."
1839.58,1842.02,Joyce,"Oh, that is so thoughtful."
1842.09,1843.38,Faith,They're crappy.
1843.45,1846.12,Buffy,"You know, I'm gonna go upstairs"
1843.45,1846.12,Buffy,and get your gifts.
1846.19,1847.16,Buffy,Excuse me.
1847.23,1849.22,Joyce,"Uh, would you like some nog?"
1849.29,1850.73,Buffy,"Okay, Mom, don't touch"
1849.29,1850.73,Buffy,"yours, though..."
1850.8,1853.06,Buffy,cause then you're gonna know
1850.8,1853.06,Buffy,what it is.
1857.2,1858.73,Buffy,Angel.
1859.8,1861.36,Angel,Huh.
1861.44,1863.24,Angel,Buffy.
1863.31,1865.37,Buffy,What is it?
1865.44,1867.74,Angel,Uh...
1867.81,1867.81,Buffy,
1867.81,1869.37,Angel,I gotta... I...
1870.82,1873.58,Angel,"Look, I, uh,"
1870.82,1873.58,Angel,"I had to see you, um..."
1876.62,1878.65,Angel,"I don't know, I..."
1879.92,1881.92,Angel,You shouldn't be...
1881.99,1884.09,Buffy,Just tell me what's going on.
1886.16,1889.16,Jenny,She wants you to touch her.
1889.23,1891.67,Jenny,What are you waiting for?
1891.74,1894.2,Angel,You have to stay away from me.
1894.27,1897.71,Buffy,You came to see me to tell me
1894.27,1897.71,Buffy,that I can't see you?
1901.25,1904.77,Buffy,"Angel, something"
1901.25,1904.77,Buffy,is doing this to you.
1907.12,1909.52,Buffy,You just have to
1907.12,1909.52,Buffy,"control it, okay?"
1909.59,1911.45,Angel,I... I know that you're confused.
1911.52,1913.96,Angel,I think you're the one
1911.52,1913.96,Angel,who's confused.
1914.03,1915.79,Angel,I think you need to...
1915.86,1918.52,Jenny,She wants you to taste her.
1918.6,1921.03,Jenny,Think of the peace.
1921.1,1924.3,Jenny,You'll never have to see us again.
1924.37,1925.6,Buffy,"Angel, how can I help you?"
1925.67,1926.86,Angel,Leave me alone!
1929.44,1931.97,Buffy,I just need you to stay with Mom
1929.44,1931.97,Buffy,in case he comes back.
1932.04,1933.48,Faith,"Yeah, I'll play watchdog."
1933.54,1934.98,Faith,"I don't really get it, though."
1935.05,1936.48,Buffy,I'll explain later.
1936.55,1937.98,Buffy,Everything. I promise.
1938.05,1939.68,Faith,Watch your back.
1939.75,1942.19,Buffy,"Giles, we have to do something."
1942.25,1943.19,Buffy,Soon. Now.
1943.25,1945.19,Giles,I'm still not sure what.
1945.26,1947.19,Buffy,Find me these priest guys.
1947.26,1949.42,Buffy,Find me something I can pummel.
1949.49,1950.43,Giles,Let's not lose our heads.
1950.5,1953.63,Buffy,"Giles, he's slipping."
1956.93,1959.16,Buffy,I think we're losing him.
1959.23,1960.86,Giles,Look...
1960.93,1963.37,Giles,you realize if he...
1963.44,1965.46,Giles,truly becomes a danger...
1965.54,1967.8,Giles,you may have to kill him.
1967.87,1969.07,Giles,Again.
1971.25,1973.18,Giles,Can you do that?
1974.41,1975.85,Angel,I can't do it.
1975.92,1977.35,Jenny,You have to do it.
1977.42,1978.85,Jenny,What else are you good for?
1978.92,1979.89,Angel,Get away from me.
1979.95,1983.72,Jenny,Couldn't you just... feel her?
1983.79,1986.85,Jenny,Couldn't you almost smell her skin?
1988.4,1991.92,Jenny,"You never were a fighter, Angel."
1988.4,1991.92,Jenny,Don't start trying now.
1994.07,1995.69,Angel,"Sooner or later,"
1994.07,1995.69,Angel,you will drink her.
1997.6,1999.2,Angel,I'll never hurt her.
1999.27,2001.64,Jenny,You were born to hurt her.
1999.27,2001.64,Jenny,Have you learned nothing?
2001.71,2003.14,Jenny,As long as you are alive...
2003.21,2005.27,Angel,Then I'll die.
2006.88,2009.14,Jenny,You don't have the strength
2006.88,2009.14,Jenny,to kill yourself.
2009.22,2010.74,Angel,I don't need strength.
2013.72,2016.35,Angel,I just need the sun to rise.
2021.13,2023.26,Jenny,You're not supposed to die.
2021.13,2023.26,Jenny,This isn't the plan.
2030.3,2032.07,Jenny,But it'll do.
2036.91,2041.28,Buffy,A child shall be born of man
2036.91,2041.28,Buffy,and goat and have two heads...
2041.35,2044.28,Buffy,and the First shall speak
2041.35,2044.28,Buffy,only in riddles..."
2044.35,2047.65,Buffy,No wonder you like this stuff.
2044.35,2047.65,Buffy,It's like reading the sun.
2047.72,2049.31,Giles,Yes. Ah.
2049.39,2050.91,Buffy,Priests?
2050.99,2054.43,Giles,"Um, yes, but, uh,"
2050.99,2054.43,Giles,"more posturing, I'm afraid."
2054.49,2056.43,Giles,For they are
2054.49,2056.43,Giles,the Harbingers of Death.
2056.5,2058.79,Giles,Nothing shall grow
2056.5,2058.79,Giles,above or below them.
2058.87,2060.83,Giles,"No seed shall flower,"
2058.87,2060.83,Giles,neither in man nor..."
2060.9,2064.67,Giles,"They're rebels, and they'll never,"
2060.9,2064.67,Giles,ever be any good.
2064.74,2066.53,Giles,Nothing specific about their haunts.
2066.53,2067.33,Buffy,Let me see that.
2071.08,2073.31,Buffy,The Harbingers of Death.
2073.38,2076.91,Buffy,Nothing shall grow
2073.38,2076.91,Buffy,above or below."
2079.35,2081.58,Giles,What?
2105.08,2106.55,Giles,
2143.25,2146.78,Buffy,"All right, ten more minutes of chanting,"
2143.25,2146.78,Buffy,and then you guys have to go to bed.
2148.96,2150.22,Buffy,Uhh!
2150.29,2151.72,Buffy,Uhh!
2155.03,2157.72,Jenny/The First,Hmm. I'm impressed.
2160.23,2162.5,Buffy,You won't get Angel.
2162.57,2163.5,Jenny/The First,Hmm.
2163.57,2165.33,Jenny/The First,You think you can fight me?
2165.41,2168,Jenny/The First,"I'm not a demon, little girl."
2168.07,2170.74,Jenny/The First,I am something
2168.07,2170.74,Jenny/The First,that you can't even conceive...
2170.81,2173.14,Buffy,The First Evil.
2173.21,2175.27,Buffy,Beyond sin...
2175.35,2180.02,Buffy,beyond death.
2178.08,2179.75,Buffy,I am the thing
2179.75,2182.02,Jenny/The First,the darkness fears.
2182.09,2186.53,Buffy,"You'll never see me,"
2182.09,2186.53,Buffy,but I am everywhere.
2186.59,2188.03,Buffy,Every being...
2188.09,2189.79,Buffy,every thought...
2189.86,2191.49,Buffy,every drop of hate.
2191.57,2193.66,Buffy,"All right, I get it."
2191.57,2193.66,Buffy,You're evil.
2193.73,2196,Buffy,Do we have to
2193.73,2196,Buffy,chat about it all day?
2196.07,2199.44,Jenny/The First,Angel will be dead by sunrise.
2199.51,2202.96,Jenny/The First,Your Christmas will be his wake.
2203.04,2205.41,Buffy,No.
2205.48,2210.02,Jenny/The First,You have no idea
2205.48,2210.02,Jenny/The First,what you're dealing with.
2208.08,2209.51,Buffy,Let me guess.
2209.58,2211.41,Buffy,Is it... evil?
2214.82,2217.29,The First,Dead by sunrise!
2217.36,2218.62,Buffy,Angel!
2244.95,2245.94,Buffy,Angel.
2250.62,2254.03,Angel,I bet half the kids
2250.62,2254.03,Angel,down there are already awake.
2254.09,2256.32,Angel,Lying in their beds.
2256.4,2260.92,Angel,Sneaking downstairs.
2256.4,2260.92,Angel,Waiting for day.
2263.02,2262.76,Buffy,"Angel, please."
2262.84,2266.1,Buffy,I need you to get inside.
2262.84,2266.1,Buffy,There's only a few minutes left.
2266.23,2270.26,Angel,I know. I can smell the sunrise
2266.23,2270.26,Angel,long before it comes.
2270.33,2273.43,Buffy,I don't have time to explain this.
2270.33,2273.43,Buffy,You just have to trust me.
2273.5,2275.16,Buffy,That thing that was haunting you...
2275.16,2276.2,Angel,It wasn't haunting me.
2277.28,2278.94,Angel,It was showing me.
2278.94,2280.04,Buffy,Showing you?
2280.11,2281.15,Angel,What I am.
2281.15,2281.67,Buffy,Were.
2281.75,2284.04,Angel,And ever shall be.
2284.12,2287.74,Angel,I wanted to know why I was back.
2284.12,2287.74,Angel,Now I do.
2288.89,2291.35,Buffy,You don't know.
2288.89,2291.35,Buffy,Some great evil
2291.42,2294.12,Buffy,"takes credit for bringing you back,"
2291.42,2294.12,Buffy,and you buy it?
2294.19,2295.39,Buffy,You just give up?
2295.46,2296.89,Angel,"I can't do it again, Buffy."
2296.96,2298.39,Angel,I can't become a killer.
2298.46,2299.4,Buffy,Then fight it.
2299.46,2300.56,Angel,It's too hard.
2300.63,2301.56,,Mmmmm.
2301.63,2303.26,,"Angel, please,"
2301.63,2303.26,,you have to get inside.
2303.33,2304.49,,It told me to kill you.
2304.57,2306.94,,You were in the dream.
2304.57,2306.94,,You know.
2309.02,2309.44,,It told me to lose my soul in you
2309.02,2309.44,,and become a monster again.
2309.51,2312,,I know what it told you.
2309.51,2312,,What does it matter?
2312.08,2313.1,,Because I wanted to!
2313.18,2316.17,,Because I want you so badly.
2316.25,2318.18,,I want to take comfort in you...
2318.25,2320.18,,and I know it'll cost me my soul...
2320.25,2322.69,,and a part of me doesn't care.
2326.19,2327.62,,"Look, I'm weak."
2327.69,2329.79,,I've never been anything else.
2329.86,2333.56,,It's not the demon in me
2329.86,2333.56,,"that needs killing, Buffy."
2333.63,2335.29,,It's the man.
2335.37,2336.89,,You're weak.
2336.97,2338.63,,Everybody is.
2338.7,2340.26,,Everybody fails.
2340.34,2342.27,,Maybe this evil
2340.34,2342.27,,did bring you back...
2342.34,2345.1,,"but if it did,"
2342.34,2345.1,,it's because it needs you.
2345.18,2349.11,,And that means
2345.18,2349.11,,that you can hurt it.
2349.18,2352.95,,"Angel, you have the power"
2349.18,2352.95,,"to do real good, to make amends."
2353.02,2358.32,,"But if you die now, then all"
2353.02,2358.32,,that you ever were was a monster.
2360.32,2363.29,,"Angel, please,"
2360.32,2363.29,,the sun is coming up.
2363.36,2364.69,,Just go.
2363.36,2364.69,,I won't.
2364.76,2367.23,,You think this is simple?
2364.76,2367.23,,You think there's an easy answer?
2367.3,2370.93,,You can never understand
2367.3,2370.93,,what I've done. Now go.
2373.02,2373.13,,You are not staying here.
2373.02,2373.13,,I won't let you!
2373.02,2373.13,,Leave!
2375.47,2376.8,,"Oh, my God."
2378.41,2380.43,,No! No!
2380.51,2383.64,,"Am I a thing worth saving, huh?"
2383.71,2385.65,,Am I a righteous man?
2386.72,2390.08,,The world wants me gone.
2392.06,2393.65,,What about me?
2394.93,2397.19,,I love you so much.
2399.46,2402.83,,And I tried to make you go away.
2402.9,2407.36,,"I killed you,"
2402.9,2407.36,,and it didn't help.
2408.44,2410.91,,And I hate it!
2410.98,2414.41,,I hate that it's so hard...
2414.48,2418.85,,and that you can
2414.48,2418.85,,hurt me so much.
2421.15,2423.92,,I know everything that you did...
2423.99,2425.92,,because you did it to me.
2427.19,2428.42,,"Oh, God."
2428.49,2431.55,,I wish that I wished you dead.
2433.23,2436.2,,I don't.
2436.27,2438.24,,I can't.
2445.44,2447.91,,"Buffy, please."
2450.62,2452.11,,Just this once...
2454.29,2456.52,,let me be strong.
2456.59,2458.99,,Strong is fighting.
2459.06,2460.39,,It's hard...
2460.46,2461.89,,and it's painful...
2461.96,2463.39,,and it's every day.
2463.46,2465.9,,It's what we have to do.
2465.96,2468.26,,And we can do it together.
2470.23,2474.53,,But if you're too much of
2470.23,2474.53,,"a coward for that, then burn."
2474.61,2477.54,,If I can't convince you
2474.61,2477.54,,that you belong in this world...
2477.61,2480.91,,then I don't know what can.
2480.98,2484.04,,But do not expect me to watch.
2484.12,2486.98,,And don't expect me
2484.12,2486.98,,"to mourn for you, because..."
2583.85,2586.28,,TVweatherman:
2583.85,2586.28,,And while most of Southern California
2586.35,2588.28,,is enjoying a balmy Christmas...
2588.35,2591.29,,an extreme cold front
2588.35,2591.29,,has sprung up out of nowhere
