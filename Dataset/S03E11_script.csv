17.38,19.47,Joyce,Is it a vampire?
19.54,21.14,Buffy,"Mom, what are you doing here?"
21.21,22.47,Joyce,I brought you a snack.
22.55,24.31,Joyce,I thought it was about time
24.38,27.15,Joyce,for me to come out and watch.
24.38,27.15,Joyce,"You know, the slaying."
27.22,28.44,Joyce,"You know, the slaying"
28.44,29.95,Buffy,is kind of an alone thing.
30.02,34.02,Joyce,But it's such a big part
30.02,34.02,Joyce,"of your life,"
32.09,34.25,Joyce,and I'd like to understand it.
34.33,37.26,Joyce,"It's some... you know,"
34.33,37.26,Joyce,something we could share.
37.33,39.26,Buffy,"Actually, it's pretty dull,"
37.33,39.26,Buffy,you know.
39.33,42.27,Buffy,It's bam boom stick... poof.
48.02,47.16,Buffy,
51.02,50.6,Joyce,"Good, honey! Kill him!"
53.54,55.88,Joyce,"Buffy, he's over here!"
55.95,57.78,Joyce,"Oh, my God!"
57.85,60.28,Joyce,It's Mr. Sanderson from the bank.
63.45,65.55,Joyce,And he's getting away!
65.62,67.35,Buffy,Stay!
105.8,107.26,Joyce,"Oh, God."
221.25,223.08,Buffy,They said we can go home now.
224.15,226.45,Joyce,They were little kids.
226.52,228.14,Joyce,Did you see them?
228.22,229.95,Joyce,They're so tiny.
231.02,232.51,Buffy,I saw.
232.59,236.03,Joyce,Who could do something like this?
236.09,237.49,Joyce,I just...
237.56,240.36,Buffy,I'm so sorry that
237.56,240.36,Buffy,you had to see this.
240.43,242.96,Buffy,"But I promise,"
240.43,242.96,Buffy,everything's going to be OK.
243.03,244.3,Joyce,How?
244.37,247.3,Buffy,Because I'm going
244.37,247.3,Buffy,to find whatever did it.
247.37,249.31,Joyce,I guess.
249.37,252.47,Joyce,It's just you can't...
252.54,255.1,Joyce,you can't make it right.
257.21,258.15,Buffy,I know.
258.22,259.61,Buffy,
259.68,261.15,Buffy,I'm sorry.
261.22,263.65,Buffy,But I'll take care
261.22,263.65,Buffy,of everything.
263.72,264.81,Buffy,I promise.
264.89,267.65,Buffy,Just try and calm down.
267.73,269.66,Buffy,Don't tell me to calm down.
269.73,271.02,Giles,I... I... I only meant...
271.1,273.72,Buffy,"They were kids, Giles."
271.1,273.72,Buffy,Little kids.
273.8,276.66,Buffy,You don't know what it was like
273.8,276.66,Buffy,to see them there.
276.73,278.83,Buffy,My mom can't even talk.
278.9,282.03,Giles,I'm sorry. I...
278.9,282.03,Giles,I just want to help.
282.11,284.2,Buffy,I know.
284.27,286.67,Giles,Do we know how? I mean...
286.74,288.18,Giles,it wasn't the vampire?
288.25,290.18,Buffy,No. There were no marks.
290.25,291.18,Buffy,Wait.
291.25,294.18,Buffy,"I mean, there..."
291.25,294.18,Buffy,"there was a mark,"
294.25,296.12,Buffy,"um, a... a symbol."
296.19,297.62,Giles,"Oh, uh, 12th century,"
297.69,299.12,Giles,Papal Encyclical.
299.19,300.55,Giles,Try this.
302.96,304.55,Buffy,It was on their hands.
304.63,306.56,Buffy,"The cops are keeping it quiet,"
306.63,308.43,Buffy,but I got a good look at it.
308.5,309.43,Buffy,There.
309.5,311.13,Buffy,Find me the thing
309.5,311.13,Buffy,that uses the symbol
311.2,312.93,Buffy,and point me at it.
315.02,313.94,Giles,Hmm.
316.02,315.63,Buffy,Hmm. What?
315.71,316.93,Buffy,"Giles, speak."
319.02,318.67,Giles,"Oh, sorry."
318.74,320.18,Giles,"Um, no, it..."
320.24,323.44,Giles,I just wonder if
320.24,323.44,Giles,we're looking for a thing.
323.51,326.45,Giles,The use of a symbol
323.51,326.45,Giles,"on a victim like this,"
326.52,329.04,Buffy,"it suggests a... a ritual murder,"
329.12,331.21,Giles,an occult sacrifice by a group.
331.29,333.98,Buffy,A group of... human beings.
335.09,337.19,Buffy,Someone with a soul did this?
337.26,338.96,Giles,"Yes, I'm afraid so."
340.03,341.96,Buffy,OK.
342.03,344.47,Buffy,Then while you're looking
342.03,344.47,Buffy,"for the meaning that symbol thingy,"
344.54,345.97,Buffy,could you also find a loophole
346.04,348.06,Buffy,in that "slayers don't
346.04,348.06,Buffy,kill people" rule?
348.14,349.57,Giles,Buffy...
350.77,353.71,Giles,"this is a dreadful crime,"
350.77,353.71,Giles,"I know,"
353.78,356.71,Giles,and you have every right
353.78,356.71,Giles,"to be upset, but..."
356.78,359.21,Giles,I wonder if you're not
356.78,359.21,Giles,letting yourself
359.28,361.27,Giles,"get a shade, uh, more personal"
361.35,364.12,Giles,because of your mother's
361.35,364.12,Giles,involvement.
364.19,366.12,Buffy,"Oh, it's completely personal."
366.19,369.13,Buffy,"Giles, find me the people"
366.19,369.13,Buffy,that did this.
369.19,370.35,Buffy,Please.
374.97,375.9,Xander,Hey.
375.97,377.06,Xander,Hey.
379.54,381.13,Xander,"So, a burrito."
382.41,384.34,Oz,This is a burrito.
384.41,386.31,Xander,Damn straight.
390.21,391.15,Willow,"Hi, Oz."
391.22,392.15,Oz,Hey.
392.22,393.15,Willow,Xander. Hi.
393.22,394.61,Oz,"Hey, Amy."
394.74,395.61,Amy,"Hi, guys."
395.68,397.14,Xander,"Xander: Hey, Amy."
395.68,397.14,Xander,I like your new hair.
397.21,399.58,Oz,I haven't see you all day.
397.21,399.58,Oz,Where you been?
399.65,402.58,Xander,Not with me.
399.65,402.58,Xander,"No, sir. Ask anyone."
402.65,404.35,Xander,No.
412.83,415.26,Oz,"So, Buffy's birthday's"
412.83,415.26,Oz,next week.
415.33,416.49,Xander,Ooh! Yeah.
416.56,417.5,Xander,Good.
417.57,419.69,Xander,I've been pondering
417.57,419.69,Xander,gift options.
419.77,421.23,Willow,Shh.
421.3,422.74,Xander,"Oh, come on,"
421.3,422.74,Xander,we just got a topic here.
422.8,423.74,Willow,"Hi, Buffy."
423.81,426.24,Xander,Buffy. What's up?
426.31,427.74,Buffy,You guys didn't hear?
427.81,429.74,Xander,Hear what?
429.81,430.78,Buffy,A murder.
430.85,433.18,Buffy,Somebody killed
430.85,433.18,Buffy,little kids.
433.25,434.44,Willow,"Oh, no."
434.52,437.45,Buffy,"They were, like,"
434.52,437.45,Buffy,or 8 years old.
437.52,439.42,Buffy,My mom found the bodies
437.52,439.42,Buffy,during patrol last night.
439.49,440.85,Amy,"Oh, my God."
440.92,442.12,Oz,Kids?
442.19,443.56,Xander,Why was your mom there?
443.63,445.82,Buffy,More bad. She picked
443.63,445.82,Buffy,"last night, of all nights,"
445.89,447.45,Buffy,for a surprise bonding visit.
447.53,450.52,Willow,"God, your mom would actually"
447.53,450.52,Willow,take the time to do that with you?
451.87,455.56,Willow,That really wasn't the point
451.87,455.56,Willow,"of the story, was it?"
455.64,458.57,Buffy,"No. The point is,"
455.64,458.57,Buffy,she's completely wigging.
458.64,460.87,Joyce,Who's wigging?
460.94,462.38,Buffy,Um...
462.44,463.38,Buffy,everyone.
463.44,465.88,Buffy,"You know,"
463.44,465.88,Buffy,cause of what happened.
465.95,467.38,Joyce,"Oh, it's so awful."
467.45,469.92,Joyce,I had bad dreams
467.45,469.92,Joyce,about it all night.
469.98,470.92,Willow,"Hi, Mrs. Summers."
470.99,472.32,Joyce,"Oh, hi, everybody."
472.39,473.72,Xander,Hi.
473.79,474.85,Amy,"Hi, Mrs. Summers."
474.92,477.36,Joyce,"Buffy, have you talked"
474.92,477.36,Joyce,to Mr. Giles yet
477.43,478.98,Joyce,about who could have done this?
479.06,480.99,Buffy,"Yeah. He, uh..."
481.06,484.12,Buffy,he thinks it might be
481.06,484.12,Buffy,something ritual.
484.2,484.68,Joyce,Occult.
484.68,486.26,Buffy,But he's still looking.
486.33,487.22,Joyce,"In the meantime,"
487.22,488.77,Buffy,we're gonna add to my patrol
488.84,490.43,Buffy,and... and keep an eye out.
490.51,491.94,Joyce,Occult.
494.02,493.8,Joyce,Like witches.
493.88,495.17,Joyce,
496.68,499.48,Willow,Sorry. Phlegm. Too much dairy.
499.55,502.98,Joyce,I... I know you kids
499.55,502.98,Joyce,think that stuff s cool.
503.05,504.58,Joyce,Buffy told me you dabble.
504.65,506.09,Willow,Right. Absolutely. That's me.
506.15,508.02,Willow,I'm a... a dabbler.
508.09,510.52,Joyce,But anybody who could
508.09,510.52,Joyce,do this isn't cool.
510.59,513.53,Joyce,Anybody who could do this
510.59,513.53,Joyce,has to be a monster.
513.59,518.03,Buffy,"You know what? Uh, would you guys"
513.59,518.03,Buffy,excuse us for a little bit?
518.1,519.5,Joyce,"Uh, nice to see you."
522.57,524.09,Xander,What a burn.
524.17,527.04,Xander,"I mean, Buff s mom was just starting"
524.17,527.04,Xander,"to accept the whole slayer thing,"
527.11,528.97,Xander,and now she's going to be
527.11,528.97,Xander,double freaked.
529.04,531.48,Willow,Makes me grateful
529.04,531.48,Willow,that my mom's not interested
531.55,534.04,Willow,in my extracurricular
531.55,534.04,Willow,activities.
534.12,537.21,Willow,Or my curricular activities.
537.29,540.72,Joyce,Are your friends going to help
537.29,540.72,Joyce,"with the investigation, too?"
540.79,543.72,Buffy,"Mom, I really think maybe"
540.79,543.72,Buffy,this isn't the best place
543.79,545.22,Buffy,to talk about this.
545.29,548.23,Joyce,Are you embarrassed
545.29,548.23,Joyce,to be hanging out with your mother?
548.3,549.73,Joyce,I didn't hug you.
549.8,551.99,Buffy,No. It's just...
552.07,556.02,Buffy,"this hall is about school,"
554.07,555.5,Buffy,and you're about home.
555.57,557.83,Buffy,"Mix them,"
555.57,557.83,Buffy,my world dissolves.
557.91,561.5,Joyce,"It's just, I keep thinking about"
557.91,561.5,Joyce,who could have done such a thing.
561.58,563.07,Joyce,I have to help.
563.14,565.61,Buffy,"Well, Giles can always"
563.14,565.61,Buffy,use help in the library.
565.68,567.11,Buffy,I called everybody
565.68,567.11,Buffy,I know in town.
567.18,568.61,Buffy,I told them about
567.18,568.61,Buffy,the dead children.
568.68,570.34,Buffy,They're all just
568.68,570.34,Buffy,as upset as I am.
570.42,573.29,Buffy,You called everybody
570.42,573.29,Buffy,that you know?
573.35,575.29,Joyce,And they called
573.35,575.29,Joyce,all their friends.
575.36,578.29,Joyce,And guess what. We're setting up
575.36,578.29,Joyce,"a vigil, for tonight, for city hall."
578.36,580.29,Joyce,The mayor is even
578.36,580.29,Joyce,going to be there.
580.36,582.23,Joyce,Now we are going to get
580.36,582.23,Joyce,some action.
582.3,583.96,Buffy,Uhhuh.
584.03,585.66,Buffy,That's great. Uh...
585.73,587.33,Buffy,but you know what?
587.4,590.27,Buffy,A lot of times when we're
587.4,590.27,Buffy,"working on stuff like this,"
590.34,593.21,Buffy,we like to keep the number
590.34,593.21,Buffy,of people that know about it
593.27,594.83,Buffy,kind of... small.
594.91,597.34,Joyce,Oh. Right.
597.41,600.58,Joyce,"Well, I'm sure there won't be"
597.41,600.58,Joyce,all that many people.
610.56,611.99,Buffy,This is great.
612.06,614.49,Buffy,Maybe we could all go
612.06,614.49,Buffy,patrolling together later.
614.56,618,Willow,At least your mom's making
614.56,618,Willow,an effort. My mom's probably...
618.07,621.47,Willow,Standing right in front of me
618.07,621.47,Willow,right this second.
621.54,622.63,Willow,Mom?
622.7,627.02,Sheila,"Willow, I didn't know"
622.7,627.02,Sheila,you were going to be here.
625.07,626.06,Sheila,"Oh, hi, Bunny."
626.14,627.07,Buffy,Hi.
627.14,629.63,Willow,"Mom, what are you doing here?"
629.71,631.08,Sheila,"Oh, well, I read about it"
629.71,631.08,Sheila,"in the paper,"
631.15,633.08,Sheila,and what with
631.15,633.08,Sheila,your dad out of town...
633.15,634.77,Sheila,"Willow, you cut off your hair."
634.85,636.71,Willow,Ha. That's a new look.
636.78,639.72,Willow,"Yeah, it's just"
636.78,639.72,Willow,a sudden whim I had...
639.79,641.15,Willow,In August.
641.22,643.09,Sheila,I like it.
643.16,644.09,Sheila,"Hello, Joyce."
644.16,646.59,Joyce,"Sheila, I'm glad you could come."
646.66,650.1,Giles,There you are. I almost
646.66,650.1,Giles,didn't find you in this crush.
650.16,652.53,Joyce,"Oh, uh, Mrs., uh..."
652.6,653.83,Giles,Joyce.
653.9,655.84,Joyce,Quite a turnout you have here.
655.9,659.34,Joyce,"Well, it's... it's not"
655.9,659.34,Joyce,"just me, but thank you."
659.41,661.81,Joyce,"Well, it's, uh,"
659.41,661.81,Joyce,it's been a while.
661.88,663.87,Giles,Right.
663.95,665.54,Giles,"Not since, um,"
665.61,667.55,Giles,not since...
667.62,668.88,Giles,not for a while.
668.95,672.25,Sheila,There's a rumor
668.95,672.25,Sheila,"going around, Mr. Giles."
672.32,674.31,Giles,"RRumor, about us?"
674.39,676.48,Giles,AAAbout what?
676.56,677.65,Sheila,About witches.
677.73,679.85,Sheila,People calling
677.73,679.85,Sheila,themselves witches
679.93,681.9,Sheila,are responsible
679.93,681.9,Sheila,for this brutal crime.
681.96,682.93,Giles,Indeed?
683,684.19,Giles,How strange.
684.27,686.2,Willow,Haha. Yes. Strange.
686.27,687.73,Sheila,Witches.
687.8,689.74,Sheila,"Well, actually,"
687.8,689.74,Sheila,not that strange.
689.8,691.74,Sheila,I recently
689.8,691.74,Sheila,coauthored a paper
691.81,694.74,Sheila,about the rise of mysticism
691.81,694.74,Sheila,"among adolescents,"
694.81,697.24,Sheila,and I was shocked
694.81,697.24,Sheila,at the statistical...
697.31,703.02,Sheila,"Oh. Oh, are we starting?"
701.08,704.02,Sheila,
704.09,705.11,Mayor Wilkins,"Mayor: Hello, everybody."
705.19,707.55,Joyce,He'll do something
705.19,707.55,Joyce,about this. You'll see.
707.62,709.02,Mayor Wilkins,Um...
710.32,713.26,Joyce,I want to thank you all for coming
713.33,716.76,Mayor Wilkins,in the aftermath
713.33,716.76,Mayor Wilkins,of such a tragic crime.
716.83,719.6,Mayor Wilkins,Seeing you all here proves
719.67,723.03,Mayor Wilkins,what a caring community
719.67,723.03,Mayor Wilkins,Sunnydale is.
723.1,726.1,Mayor Wilkins,"Sure, we've had our share"
723.1,726.1,Mayor Wilkins,"of misfortunes,"
726.17,728.4,Mayor Wilkins,but we're a good town
728.48,729.7,Mayor Wilkins,"with good people,"
729.78,733.21,Mayor Wilkins,and I know that none of us
729.78,733.21,Mayor Wilkins,will rest easy
733.28,736.25,Mayor Wilkins,until this horrible murder
733.28,736.25,Mayor Wilkins,is solved.
736.32,737.78,Mayor Wilkins,With that in mind...
737.85,742.02,Mayor Wilkins,I make these words
737.85,742.02,Mayor Wilkins,my pledge to you.
742.09,743.85,Mayor Wilkins,Never again.
747.23,748.08,Joyce,Now I ask you
748.08,749.53,Mayor Wilkins,to give your attention
749.6,751.22,Mayor Wilkins,to the woman who brought us
749.6,751.22,Mayor Wilkins,"all here tonight,"
751.3,752.39,Mayor Wilkins,Joyce Summers.
757.02,756.77,Joyce,Thank you.
759.37,761.77,Joyce,Mr. Mayor...
761.84,763.61,Joyce,you're dead wrong.
765.66,767.56,Joyce,This is not a good town.
767.63,771.07,Joyce,How many of us have...
767.63,771.07,Joyce,have lost someone
771.13,773.97,Joyce,who... who just disappeared?
774.04,776.7,Joyce,Or... Or got skinned?
776.77,779.43,Joyce,Or suffered neck rupture?
779.51,784.47,Joyce,And how many of us have been
779.51,784.47,Joyce,too afraid to speak out?
784.55,788.48,Joyce,I was supposed to lead us
784.55,788.48,Joyce,"in a moment of silence, but..."
788.55,791.75,Joyce,silence is this town's disease.
792.89,795.82,Joyce,For too long
792.89,795.82,Joyce,we've been plagued by
795.89,797.83,Joyce,unnatural evils.
797.89,800.49,Joyce,This isn't our town anymore.
800.56,803.16,Joyce,It belongs to the monsters
800.56,803.16,Joyce,and the witches
803.23,804.39,Joyce,and the slayers.
808.77,813.5,Joyce,I say it's time for the grownups
808.77,813.5,Joyce,to take Sunnydale back.
813.58,819.02,Joyce,I say we start by finding
813.58,819.02,Joyce,the people who did this
817.08,818.31,Joyce,and making them pay.
818.38,820.41,Joyce,
873.17,875.97,Joyce,
899.9,901.02,Michael,Watch it.
901.1,902.43,Roy,"Oh, sorry."
902.5,904.43,Roy,Did I make you
902.5,904.43,Roy,smudge your eyeliner?
904.5,905.66,Roy,You gonna put a spell on me?
905.74,907.7,Amy,"Hey, what is your problem?"
907.77,910.74,Roy,Everyone knows he's
907.77,910.74,Roy,into that voodoo witchcraft.
910.81,912.43,Roy,I heard about those kids.
912.51,913.94,Roy,People like him...
916.02,915.48,Roy,gotta learn a lesson.
915.54,918.07,Amy,And what about people like me?
918.15,919.81,Roy,You get in my face
918.15,919.81,Roy,and you'll find out.
925.82,927.25,Roy,No problem here.
929.29,931.09,Roy,We're walking.
937.23,938.36,Buffy,You guys OK?
938.43,939.37,Michael,Yeah.
939.44,940.37,Michael,We're fine.
940.44,942.67,Amy,"Thanks, Buffy."
942.74,946.67,Cordelia,You're going to be one busy
942.74,946.67,Cordelia,"little slayer, babysitting them."
946.74,947.94,Buffy,I doubt they'll have
946.74,947.94,Buffy,any more trouble.
950.02,949.27,Cordelia,I doubt your doubt.
949.35,951.71,Cordelia,Everyone knows that witches
949.35,951.71,Cordelia,"killed those kids,"
951.78,953.25,Cordelia,and Amy is a witch.
953.32,955.48,Cordelia,And Michael is whatever
953.32,955.48,Cordelia,"the boy of witch is,"
955.55,957.71,Cordelia,plus being the poster
955.55,957.71,Cordelia,child for yuck.
957.79,959.15,Cordelia,If you're going
957.79,959.15,Cordelia,"to hang with them,"
959.22,960.65,Cordelia,expect badness.
960.72,963.66,Cordelia,Cause that's what you get
960.72,963.66,Cordelia,when you hang with freaks and losers.
963.73,966.02,Cordelia,"Believe me, I know."
967.73,971.13,Cordelia,That was a pointed comment
967.73,971.13,Cordelia,about me hanging with you guys.
971.2,972.79,Buffy,"Yeah, I got that one."
972.87,975,Buffy,"Besides, witches didn't do it."
975.07,976.73,Giles,"Actually, I think they may have."
976.81,978.64,Giles,My research keeps
976.81,978.64,Giles,bringing me back
978.71,981.54,Giles,to European Wiccan covens.
981.61,983.17,Buffy,You found the meaning
981.61,983.17,Buffy,of the symbol?
983.25,985.24,Giles,"I'm pretty sure, yes."
985.31,987.78,Giles,There's a piece
985.31,987.78,Giles,of information I need
987.85,989.88,Giles,that's in a book
987.85,989.88,Giles,that Willow borrowed.
989.95,991.18,Giles,Can you find it?
995.59,996.62,Xander,"Buffy, hi."
996.69,998.18,Buffy,Hey. Is Willow around?
998.26,1000.06,Xander,How can I convince
998.26,1000.06,Xander,you people that it's over?
1000.13,1002.22,Xander,You assume because
1000.13,1002.22,Xander,"I'm here, she's here,"
1002.3,1004.43,Xander,that I somehow mysteriously
1002.3,1004.43,Xander,know where she is.
1004.5,1006.16,Buffy,Those her books?
1006.24,1007.96,Xander,Yeah. She's in the bathroom.
1008.04,1010.44,Xander,But the fact that
1008.04,1010.44,Xander,I know that doesn't change
1010.51,1012.41,Xander,that I have a genuine
1010.51,1012.41,Xander,complaint here.
1012.48,1014.84,Xander,Look. I'm getting sick
1012.48,1014.84,Xander,"of the judgment,"
1014.91,1016.43,Xander,the innuendoes.
1016.51,1018.95,Xander,Is a man not innocent
1016.51,1018.95,Xander,until proven guilty?
1019.01,1020.38,Buffy,You are guilty.
1020.45,1021.92,Buffy,"You got illicit smoochies,"
1021.98,1023.21,Buffy,gonna have to pay the price.
1023.29,1025.12,Xander,But I'm talking about
1023.29,1025.12,Xander,the future guilt.
1025.19,1027.18,Xander,"Look, everyone expects me"
1025.19,1027.18,Xander,to mess up again.
1027.26,1029.95,Xander,Like Oz.
1027.26,1029.95,Xander,I see how he is around me.
1030.03,1032.19,Xander,"You know, that steely gaze..."
1032.26,1034.13,Xander,that pointed silence.
1034.2,1036.69,Buffy,Cause he's usually
1034.2,1036.69,Buffy,such a chatterbox.
1036.77,1037.76,Xander,"No, but it's different now."
1037.83,1040.2,Xander,It's more a verbal nonverbal.
1040.27,1041.9,Xander,He speaks volumes with his eyes.
1045.91,1047.6,Willow,"Hey, Buff."
1045.91,1047.6,Willow,What you looking for?
1047.68,1050.17,Willow,You want to borrow something?
1050.25,1051.94,Buffy,What is this?
1052.01,1053.5,Willow,A doodle. I do doodle.
1053.58,1055.07,Willow,"You, too."
1053.58,1055.07,Willow,"You do doodle, too."
1055.15,1057.42,Buffy,This is a witch symbol.
1057.49,1059.25,Willow,"OK, yeah, it is."
1059.32,1060.48,Buffy,Willow.
1060.56,1062.22,Willow,What?
1062.29,1064.59,Buffy,That symbol was on
1062.29,1064.59,Buffy,the murdered children.
1064.66,1066.25,Buffy,
1066.33,1069.99,Police Officer #3,Police Officer: Step away from
1066.33,1069.99,Police Officer #3,the lockers. This is police business.
1073.04,1075.37,Police Officer #4,"Wanna give me those, please..."
1073.04,1075.37,Police Officer #4,the books.
1075.44,1080.07,Police Officer #3,
1080.14,1081.37,Xander,"Aw, man, it's Nazi Germany"
1081.44,1083.64,Xander,and I've got Playboys in my locker.
1083.71,1087.84,Snyder,This is a glorious day
1083.71,1087.84,Snyder,for principals everywhere.
1087.92,1090.78,Snyder,No pathetic whining
1087.92,1090.78,Snyder,about students' rights.
1090.85,1094.29,Snyder,Just a long row of lockers
1090.85,1094.29,Snyder,and a man with a key.
1096.76,1098.75,Oz,They just took 3 kids away.
1098.83,1100.26,Buffy,What are they looking for?
1100.33,1101.26,Amy,Witch stuff.
1101.33,1103.13,Willow,What?
1103.2,1105.5,Amy,They got my spells. I'm supposed
1103.2,1105.5,Amy,to report to Snyder's office.
1105.57,1106.63,Willow,"Oh, my God."
1106.7,1108.54,Police Officer #3,"Move back, please."
1108.67,1110.66,Police Officer #3,"Okay, Amy, you'll"
1108.67,1110.66,Police Officer #3,have to come with me.
1110.74,1111.66,Police Officer #3,"Willow, be careful."
1111.66,1112.87,Police Officer #4,Get away from the locker.
1115.98,1119.02,Willow,I have stuff in my locker.
1117.08,1119.21,Willow,"Henbane, hellebore,"
1117.08,1119.21,Willow,mandrake root.
1119.28,1121.22,Xander,Excuse me. Playboys.
1121.29,1123.81,Xander,Can we turn
1121.29,1123.81,Xander,the sympathy this way?
1123.89,1128.22,Cordelia,Hey! Get your grubby
1123.89,1128.22,Cordelia,custodial hands off that.
1128.29,1131.92,Cordelia,"That hair spray costs $45,"
1128.29,1131.92,Cordelia,and it's imported.
1132,1136.09,Willow,"My locker's next. Buffy,"
1132,1136.09,Willow,I didn't do anything wrong.
1136.17,1138.14,Willow,The... The symbol is harmless.
1138.2,1140.67,Willow,I used it to make
1138.2,1140.67,Willow,"a protection spell for you,"
1140.74,1143.11,Willow,for your birthday.
1140.74,1143.11,Willow,With Michael and Amy.
1143.18,1144.44,Willow,"Only, now it's broken,"
1144.51,1146.6,Willow,"Because you know about it,"
1144.51,1146.6,Willow,so Happy Birthday.
1146.68,1149.27,Willow,"And please,"
1146.68,1149.27,Willow,you have to believe me.
1154.25,1157.31,Snyder,Ms. Rosenberg. My office.
1165.96,1168.73,Snyder,Police Officer:
1165.96,1168.73,Snyder,Back up. Comin' through.
1179.18,1180.2,Buffy,Giles.
1180.28,1182.27,Giles,They're confiscating my books.
1182.35,1183.37,Buffy,"Giles, we need those books."
1183.45,1184.51,Giles,"Believe me,"
1183.45,1184.51,Giles,I tried to tell that
1184.58,1185.91,Giles,to the nice man
1184.58,1185.91,Giles,with the big gun.
1185.98,1188.45,Buffy,No. There's something about
1185.98,1188.45,Buffy,the symbol that we're missing.
1188.52,1189.63,Giles,Willow said she used it in
1189.63,1191.08,Buffy,a protection spell. It's harmless.
1191.16,1192.71,Buffy,Not a big bad.
1192.79,1195.56,Giles,So then why would it turn up
1192.79,1195.56,Giles,in a ritual sacrifice?
1195.63,1198.15,Giles,"I don't know. Ordinarily,"
1195.63,1198.15,Giles,I would say let's widen our research.
1198.23,1201.56,Buffy,Using what? A dictionary
1198.23,1201.56,Buffy,and My Friend Flicka?
1201.63,1203.6,Giles,This is intolerable.
1203.67,1205.16,Giles,"Snyder has interfered before,"
1205.24,1207.3,Giles,but I won't take this from that
1205.24,1207.3,Giles,twisted little homunculus.
1207.37,1211.31,Snyder,I love the smell of desperate
1207.37,1211.31,Snyder,librarian in the morning.
1211.38,1213.07,Giles,You get out...
1213.14,1215.51,Giles,and take your marauders
1213.14,1215.51,Giles,with you.
1215.58,1219.35,Snyder,"Oh, my. So fierce."
1219.42,1220.94,Snyder,I suppose
1219.42,1220.94,Snyder,I should hear you out.
1221.02,1223.92,Snyder,"Just how is, um..."
1223.99,1227.19,Snyder,Blood Rites and Sacrifices"
1227.26,1229.66,Snyder,appropriate material
1227.26,1229.66,Snyder,for a public school library?
1229.73,1231.29,Snyder,Chess club branching out?
1231.36,1233.59,Giles,This is not over.
1233.67,1235.72,Snyder,"Oh, I should say"
1233.67,1235.72,Snyder,it's just beginning.
1235.8,1237.27,Snyder,Fight it if you want.
1237.34,1239.63,Buffy,"Just remember,"
1237.34,1239.63,Buffy,"lift a finger against me,"
1239.7,1241.7,Buffy,and you'll have to answer to MOO.
1241.77,1243.97,Buffy,Answer to MOO?
1244.04,1247.34,Buffy,Did that sentence just make
1244.04,1247.34,Buffy,some sense that I'm not in on?
1247.41,1249.71,Snyder,Mothers Opposed to the Occult.
1249.78,1251.18,Snyder,A powerful new group.
1252.58,1254.52,Buffy,And who came up
1252.58,1254.52,Buffy,with that lame name?
1255.99,1257.78,Snyder,That would be the founder.
1257.86,1260.35,Snyder,I believe you call her Mom.
1270.17,1273.16,Sheila,"Oh, sit down, honey."
1273.24,1274.97,Willow,Principal Snyder talk to you?
1275.04,1277.87,Sheila,Yes. He's quite concerned.
1277.94,1280.41,Willow,"Mom, I know what this looks like,"
1277.94,1280.41,Willow,and I can totally...
1280.48,1281.81,Sheila,"You don't have to explain, honey."
1281.88,1284.25,Sheila,This isn't exactly a surprise.
1284.32,1286.58,Willow,Why not?
1286.65,1289.42,Sheila,"Oh, well, identification"
1286.65,1289.42,Sheila,with mythical icons
1289.49,1291.48,Sheila,is perfectly typical
1289.49,1291.48,Sheila,of your age group.
1291.56,1293.82,Sheila,It's a classic
1291.56,1293.82,Sheila,adolescent response
1293.89,1296.33,Sheila,to the pressures
1293.89,1296.33,Sheila,of incipient adulthood.
1296.39,1298.76,Willow,Oh. Is that what it is?
1298.83,1300.89,Sheila,"Of course, I wish you"
1298.83,1300.89,Sheila,could have identified
1300.97,1303.09,Sheila,with something
1300.97,1303.09,Sheila,"a little less icky,"
1303.17,1304.86,Sheila,but developmentally speaking...
1304.94,1307.23,Willow,"Mom, I'm not an age group."
1307.31,1309.93,Willow,I'm me. Willow group.
1312.02,1313.17,Sheila,"Oh, honey..."
1313.24,1314.91,Sheila,I understand.
1314.98,1317.21,Willow,"No, you don't."
1317.28,1320.84,Willow,"Mom, this may be hard"
1317.28,1320.84,Willow,"for you to accept,"
1320.92,1322.58,Willow,but I can do stuff.
1322.65,1324.45,Willow,"Nothing bad or dangerous,"
1324.52,1326.39,Willow,but I can do spells.
1326.46,1327.86,Sheila,"You think you can,"
1327.93,1329.26,Sheila,and that's what concerns me.
1329.33,1331.39,Sheila,The delusions.
1331.46,1334.9,Willow,"Mom, how would you know"
1331.46,1334.9,Willow,what I can do?
1334.97,1337.7,Willow,"I mean, the last time we had"
1334.97,1337.7,Willow,"a conversation over 3 minutes,"
1337.77,1341.47,Willow,it was about the patriarchal bias
1337.77,1341.47,Willow,of The Mr. Rogers Show.
1341.54,1344.34,Sheila,"Well, with King Friday lording it"
1341.54,1344.34,Sheila,over all the lesser puppets.
1344.41,1345.84,Willow,"Mom, you're not"
1344.41,1345.84,Willow,paying attention.
1345.91,1348.14,Sheila,And this is your way
1345.91,1348.14,Sheila,of trying to get it.
1348.21,1350.44,Sheila,"Now, I have consulted"
1348.21,1350.44,Sheila,"with some of my colleagues,"
1350.52,1354.45,Sheila,and they agree that this
1350.52,1354.45,Sheila,is a cry for discipline.
1354.52,1356.08,Sheila,You're grounded.
1356.15,1358.32,Sheila,Grounded?
1358.39,1360.52,Willow,This is the first time ever...
1360.59,1363.43,Willow,"I've done something you don't like,"
1360.59,1363.43,Willow,and I'm grounded?
1363.5,1366.16,Willow,I'm supposed to mess up.
1363.5,1366.16,Willow,"I'm a teenager, remember?"
1366.23,1368.06,Sheila,You're upset. I hear you.
1368.13,1370.69,Willow,"No, Ma, hear this."
1370.77,1371.96,Willow,I'm a rebel.
1372.04,1373.4,Willow,I'm having a rebellion.
1373.47,1376.7,Sheila,"Willow, honey, you don't"
1373.47,1376.7,Sheila,need to act out like this
1376.78,1378.4,Sheila,to prove your specialness.
1378.48,1380.97,Willow,"Mom, I'm not acting out."
1378.48,1380.97,Willow,I'm a witch.
1381.05,1383.31,Willow,I can make pencils float.
1383.38,1385.68,Willow,And I can summon the 4 elements.
1385.75,1388.08,Sheila,"OK, 2, but 4 soon."
1388.15,1390.45,Willow,And I'm dating a musician.
1390.52,1392.62,Sheila,"Oh, Willow!"
1394.56,1396.93,Willow,I worship Beelzebub.
1397,1398.79,Willow,I do his biddings.
1398.86,1401.99,Willow,Do you see any goats around?
1398.86,1401.99,Willow,"No, because I sacrificed them."
1402.07,1403.9,Willow,All bow before Satan!
1403.97,1405.53,Sheila,I'm not listening to this.
1405.6,1407.87,Willow,"Prince of Night, I summon you."
1407.94,1410.6,Willow,Come fill me with your
1407.94,1410.6,Willow,"black, naughty evil."
1410.68,1413.7,Sheila,That's enough!
1410.68,1413.7,Sheila,Is that clear?
1413.78,1415.04,Sheila,"Now, you will go to your room"
1415.11,1417.84,Sheila,and stay there
1415.11,1417.84,Sheila,until I say otherwise.
1417.92,1420.18,Sheila,And we're going
1417.92,1420.18,Sheila,to make some changes.
1420.25,1423.24,Sheila,I don't want you hanging out
1420.25,1423.24,Sheila,with those friends of yours.
1423.32,1426.22,Sheila,It's clear where this
1423.32,1426.22,Sheila,little obsession came from.
1427.43,1430.83,Sheila,You will not speak
1427.43,1430.83,Sheila,to Bunny Summers again.
1430.9,1433.36,Joyce,I don't want you seeing
1430.9,1433.36,Joyce,that Willow anymore.
1433.43,1434.73,Joyce,I've spoken with her mother.
1434.8,1437.86,Joyce,I had no idea her forays
1434.8,1437.86,Joyce,into the occult had gone so far.
1437.94,1440.67,Buffy,You're the one who ordered
1437.94,1440.67,Buffy,the raid on the school today.
1440.74,1442.97,Joyce,"Honey, they opened a few lockers."
1443.04,1443.6,Joyce,Lockers.
1443.6,1445.07,Buffy,"First syllable, lock."
1445.14,1446.24,Buffy,They're supposed to be private.
1446.31,1448.21,Buffy,And they took
1446.31,1448.21,Buffy,all of Giles' books away.
1448.28,1450.11,Joyce,He'll get most of them back.
1450.18,1453.21,Joyce,MOO just wants to weed out
1450.18,1453.21,Joyce,the offensive material.
1453.28,1455.48,Joyce,Everything else will be
1453.28,1455.48,Joyce,returned to Mr. Giles soon.
1455.55,1458.07,Buffy,"If we're going to solve this,"
1455.55,1458.07,Buffy,we need those books now.
1458.21,1462.51,Joyce,"Sweetie, those books have no place"
1458.21,1462.51,Joyce,in a public school library.
1462.58,1463.91,Joyce,Especially now.
1463.98,1468.47,Joyce,Any student can waltz in there
1463.98,1468.47,Joyce,and get all sorts of ideas.
1468.55,1473.55,Joyce,Do you understand
1468.55,1473.55,Joyce,how that terrifies me?
1473.62,1476.35,Buffy,"Mom, I hate that these people"
1473.62,1476.35,Buffy,scared you so much.
1476.43,1478.49,Buffy,And I know that you're
1476.43,1478.49,Buffy,"just trying to help,"
1478.56,1480.39,Buffy,but you have to let me
1478.56,1480.39,Buffy,handle this.
1480.46,1481.93,Buffy,It's what I do.
1482,1483.33,Joyce,But is it really?
1483.4,1485.63,Joyce,"I mean, you patrol, you slay."
1485.7,1489.1,Joyce,"Evil pops up, you undo it."
1485.7,1489.1,Joyce,And that's great.
1489.17,1491.4,Joyce,But is Sunnydale
1489.17,1491.4,Joyce,getting any better?
1491.47,1493.64,Buffy,Are they running out
1491.47,1493.64,Buffy,of vampires?
1493.71,1495.97,Buffy,I don't think that
1493.71,1495.97,Buffy,you run out of...
1496.05,1497.81,Joyce,It's not your fault.
1497.88,1500.44,Joyce,You don't have a plan.
1497.88,1500.44,Joyce,You just react to things.
1500.52,1502.14,Joyce,It's bound to be
1500.52,1502.14,Joyce,kind of fruitless.
1505.22,1507.25,Buffy,"OK, maybe I don't have a plan."
1507.32,1509.09,Buffy,Lord knows I don't
1507.32,1509.09,Buffy,have lapel buttons.
1509.16,1510.82,Joyce,Buffy.
1510.89,1513.16,Buffy,And maybe next time that the world
1510.89,1513.16,Buffy,"is getting sucked into hell,"
1513.23,1514.29,Joyce,I won't be able to stop it
1514.29,1515.6,Buffy,because the antihellsucking book
1515.67,1517.76,Joyce,isn't on the approved
1515.67,1517.76,Joyce,reading list.
1517.83,1520.83,Joyce,I'm sorry.
1517.83,1520.83,Joyce,I didn't mean to put down...
1520.9,1522.17,Buffy,"Yeah, well, you did."
1523.37,1524.7,Buffy,It doesn't matter.
1524.77,1526.5,Buffy,I have to go.
1526.58,1528.74,Buffy,I have to go on one
1526.58,1528.74,Buffy,of my pointless patrols
1528.81,1531.54,Buffy,and react to some vampires.
1531.61,1534.98,Buffy,If that's all right with MOO.
1536.89,1539.51,Buffy,"And nice acronym, Mom."
1541.89,1544.49,Joyce,Just trying
1541.89,1544.49,Joyce,to make things better.
1546.96,1548.52,Boy,You are.
1548.6,1550.79,Girl,There's bad people out there.
1550.87,1553.1,Boy,And we can't sleep.
1553.17,1555.19,Girl,Not until you hurt them.
1555.27,1557.36,Boy,The way they hurt us.
1585.67,1587.36,Angel,Hey.
1587.44,1588.96,Buffy,Hi.
1598.82,1600.25,Buffy,How are you?
1600.32,1601.94,Angel,I'm all right.
1602.02,1604.65,Angel,I think I'm better
1602.02,1604.65,Angel,than you right now.
1606.59,1610.39,Angel,I heard about this.
1610.46,1613.22,Angel,People are talking.
1613.3,1616.36,Angel,People are even talking to me.
1616.43,1618.96,Buffy,It's strange.
1619.04,1621.9,Buffy,People die in Sunnydale
1619.04,1621.9,Buffy,all the time...
1621.97,1624.5,Buffy,and I've never seen
1621.97,1624.5,Buffy,anything like this.
1625.98,1628.81,Angel,They were children.
1628.88,1630.57,Angel,Innocent.
1630.65,1632.24,Angel,It makes a difference.
1632.32,1637.41,Buffy,And Mr. Sanderson from the bank
1632.32,1637.41,Buffy,had it coming?
1639.49,1641.12,Buffy,
1641.19,1644.16,Buffy,My mom... said
1641.19,1644.16,Buffy,some things to me
1644.23,1646.92,Buffy,about being the slayer.
1647,1648.96,Buffy,That it's fruitless.
1649.03,1650.4,Buffy,No fruit for buffy.
1650.47,1651.9,Angel,She's wrong.
1651.97,1652.9,Buffy,Is she?
1654.57,1658.47,Buffy,Is Sunnydale any better
1654.57,1658.47,Buffy,than when I first came here?
1658.54,1661.41,Buffy,"OK, so I battle evil."
1661.48,1663.88,Buffy,But I don't really win.
1663.95,1667.18,Buffy,The bad keeps coming back
1663.95,1667.18,Buffy,and getting stronger.
1667.25,1669.22,Buffy,I'm like that kid
1667.25,1669.22,Buffy,"in the story,"
1669.29,1671.78,Buffy,the boy that stuck
1669.29,1671.78,Buffy,his finger in the duck.
1671.85,1672.82,Angel,Dike.
1673.89,1676.26,Angel,It's another word for dam.
1676.33,1678.35,Buffy,Oh.
1678.43,1681.4,Buffy,"OK, that story makes"
1678.43,1681.4,Buffy,a lot more sense now.
1681.46,1684.02,Angel,"Buffy, you know,"
1681.46,1684.02,Angel,I'm still figuring things out.
1684.1,1686.09,Angel,There's a lot
1684.1,1686.09,Angel,I don't understand.
1688.94,1691.63,Angel,But I do know it's
1688.94,1691.63,Angel,important to keep fighting.
1691.71,1694.04,Angel,I learned that from you.
1696.28,1697.34,Buffy,But we never...
1697.41,1699.35,Angel,We never win.
1699.42,1700.97,Buffy,Not completely.
1701.05,1702.14,Angel,We never will.
1702.22,1704.71,Angel,That's not why we fight.
1704.79,1707.81,Angel,We do it 'cause there's
1704.79,1707.81,Angel,things worth fighting for.
1707.89,1710.88,Angel,Those kids. Their parents.
1712.09,1714.39,Buffy,Their parents.
1714.46,1715.9,Angel,"Look, I know it's not much."
1715.97,1720.06,Buffy,"No. No, it's a lot."
1724.02,1724.6,Giles,Session interrupted?
1724.67,1725.7,Giles,"Who said you could interrupt,"
1725.78,1728.54,Giles,"you stupid, useless fad!"
1728.61,1729.77,Giles,"No, I said fad."
1729.85,1731.54,Giles,And I'll say it again.
1731.61,1734.38,Xander,"At that point,"
1731.61,1734.38,Xander,I will become frightened.
1734.45,1736.51,Oz,Take heart.
1734.45,1736.51,Oz,We found your books.
1736.59,1738.38,Xander,You can put the heart back.
1736.59,1738.38,Xander,We can't get them.
1738.45,1740.32,Xander,They're locked up in City Hall.
1740.39,1744.19,Xander,Frisky Watcher's Chat Room."
1740.39,1744.19,Xander,"Why, Giles. Oh!"
1744.26,1745.35,Xander,"Buffy, Oz and I found out..."
1745.43,1746.95,Buffy,What do we know about these kids?
1747.03,1748.02,Giles,What?
1748.1,1749.53,Buffy,Facts. Details.
1753.02,1752.59,Xander,"Well, they were, uh,"
1753.02,1752.59,Xander,found in the park.
1752.67,1755.03,Buffy,No. Where did they
1752.67,1755.03,Buffy,go to school?
1755.1,1757.04,Buffy,Who were their parents?
1755.1,1757.04,Buffy,What are their names?
1757.11,1759.4,Buffy,We know everything
1757.11,1759.4,Buffy,"about their deaths,"
1759.48,1761.97,Buffy,but we don't even know
1759.48,1761.97,Buffy,their names.
1762.04,1764.91,Xander,"Well, sure we do."
1762.04,1764.91,Xander,"Um, it's on the tip of my tongue."
1764.98,1767.38,Oz,That never came up. Ever.
1767.45,1769.48,Buffy,And if no one knows
1767.45,1769.48,Buffy,"who they are,"
1769.55,1771.38,Buffy,where did these pictures
1769.55,1771.38,Buffy,come from?
1771.45,1772.92,Giles,I just assumed someone
1771.45,1772.92,Giles,had the details.
1772.99,1774.98,Giles,I never really...
1775.06,1776.55,Giles,"Well, that is strange."
1776.63,1778.86,Buffy,We need to get
1776.63,1778.86,Buffy,some information.
1778.93,1779.9,Giles,"Yeah, well,"
1778.93,1779.9,Giles,somebody else do it.
1779.96,1781.36,Giles,This thing's locked me out.
1781.43,1782.42,Xander,"Well, if you wouldn't yell at it."
1782.5,1783.59,Oz,"I can look around,"
1783.67,1785.57,Oz,but Willow would really
1783.67,1785.57,Oz,know the sites we need.
1785.63,1787.23,Buffy,That's great. She can't
1785.63,1787.23,Buffy,even come to the phone.
1787.3,1788.7,Buffy,The wrath of MOO.
1788.77,1790.2,Oz,"Well, we don't need a phone."
1794.71,1796.27,Oz,
1801.22,1802.98,Oz,"All right, we're linked."
1803.05,1804.11,Oz,"If anybody's I.D. 'd the kids,"
1804.19,1806.88,Oz,she'll pull it up
1804.19,1806.88,Oz,and feed it here.
1812.06,1814.5,Giles,"All right, ""2 children found dead."
1812.06,1814.5,Giles,Mysterious mark..."
1814.56,1819.9,Giles,No. No. These children
1814.56,1819.9,Giles,were found near Omaha in 1949.
1819.97,1821.73,Xander,"Yeah, they ain't ours."
1819.97,1821.73,Xander,Keep going.
1824.41,1826.07,Buffy,Wait.
1827.34,1828.37,Willow,Those are...
1828.44,1829.88,Buffy,The same kids.
1829.95,1832.21,Giles,years ago.
1833.45,1835.75,Giles,Utah...
1833.45,1835.75,Giles,Two children...
1835.82,1837.91,Giles,Rural community torn
1835.82,1837.91,Giles,apart by suspicion."
1837.99,1841.08,Giles,years ago.
1837.99,1841.08,Giles,"I mean, how is this possible?"
1841.16,1842.78,Oz,There's no mention
1841.16,1842.78,Oz,of who they were.
1842.86,1844.76,Buffy,"They've never been seen alive,"
1842.86,1844.76,Buffy,just dead.
1844.83,1846.35,Buffy,A lot.
1847.53,1849.09,Oz,Ah. There were more articles.
1849.17,1851.9,Oz,Every 50 years. All the same.
1851.97,1855.8,Giles,From as far back as 1649.
1855.87,1856.9,Giles,Can I see that?
1861.98,1864.54,Giles,Written by a cleric from a village
1861.98,1864.54,Giles,near the Black Forest.
1864.61,1866.64,Giles,He found the bodies himself.
1866.72,1868.65,Giles,Two children...
1868.72,1869.95,Giles,"Greta Strauss, age 6."
1870.02,1871.54,Giles,
1871.62,1873.32,Xander,"Hans Strauss, 8."
1873.39,1876.12,Xander,So they have names.
1873.39,1876.12,Xander,That's new.
1878.69,1879.75,Sheila,Willow.
1879.83,1881.19,Sheila,I thought
1879.83,1881.19,Sheila,I made myself clear.
1881.26,1882.42,Sheila,You're not minding me.
1882.5,1883.59,Willow,Mom...
1883.67,1885.46,Sheila,I see what you're doing.
1883.67,1885.46,Sheila,You're challenging me.
1885.53,1887.26,Sheila,But I will not have you
1885.53,1887.26,Sheila,communicating
1887.34,1889.93,Sheila,with your cybercoven
1887.34,1889.93,Sheila,or what have you.
1892.02,1894.84,Willow,Coven? What happened to me
1892.02,1894.84,Willow,being delusional and acting out?
1894.91,1896.67,Sheila,"Well, that was before"
1894.91,1896.67,Sheila,I talked in depth
1896.75,1899.37,Sheila,with Ms. Summers
1896.75,1899.37,Sheila,and her associates.
1899.45,1902.18,Sheila,It seems I've been
1899.45,1902.18,Sheila,rather closeminded.
1902.25,1904.62,Willow,"So, you believe me?"
1905.72,1907.21,Sheila,"I believe you, dear."
1908.72,1911.28,Sheila,Now all I can do
1908.72,1911.28,Sheila,is let you go with love.
1913.03,1914.36,Willow,Let me go?
1914.43,1916.13,Willow,What does that mean?
1917.93,1919.26,Willow,
1919.34,1920.63,Willow,Mom?
1920.7,1923.1,Giles,Giles:
1920.7,1923.1,Giles,"Uh, wait a minute."
1923.17,1924.73,Giles,Uh... uh...
1924.81,1928.1,Giles,There is a fringe theory
1924.81,1928.1,Giles,held by a few folklorists
1928.1,1929.5,Giles,There is a fringe theory
1928.1,1929.5,Giles,held by a few folklorists
1929.57,1934.2,Giles,that some regional stories
1929.57,1934.2,Giles,"have actual, um..."
1934.27,1939.02,Giles,very literal antecedents.
1937.08,1939.24,Buffy,And in some language
1937.08,1939.24,Buffy,that's English?
1939.31,1941.3,Oz,Fairy tales are real?
1941.38,1944.28,Buffy,Hans and Gre...
1944.35,1945.82,Buffy,Hansel and Gretel?
1945.89,1948.72,Buffy,Wait. Hansel and Gretel?
1948.79,1951.22,Xander,"Breadcrumbs, ovens,"
1948.79,1951.22,Xander,gingerbread house?
1951.29,1953.09,Giles,Of course.
1953.16,1954.59,Giles,"Well, it makes sense now."
1954.66,1956.96,Buffy,"Yeah, it's all"
1954.66,1956.96,Buffy,falling into place.
1957.03,1959.73,Buffy,"Of course, that place"
1957.03,1959.73,Buffy,is nowhere near this place.
1959.8,1961.79,Giles,Some demons thrive
1961.87,1964.93,Giles,by fostering hatred
1961.87,1964.93,Giles,"and, uh, persecution"
1967.02,1966.47,Giles,amongst the mortal animals.
1966.54,1968.67,Giles,"Not by... Not by destroying men,"
1968.74,1970.9,Giles,but by watching men
1968.74,1970.9,Giles,destroy each other.
1970.98,1972.77,Giles,They feed us our darkest fear
1972.85,1976.58,Giles,and turn peaceful communities
1972.85,1976.58,Giles,into vigilantes.
1976.65,1978.24,Buffy,Hansel and Gretel
1976.65,1978.24,Buffy,run home to tell everyone
1978.32,1979.62,Buffy,about the mean old witch.
1979.69,1982.18,Giles,And then she and probably
1979.69,1982.18,Giles,dozens of others
1982.26,1983.92,Giles,are persecuted
1982.26,1983.92,Giles,by a righteous mob.
1983.99,1985.69,Giles,It's happened
1983.99,1985.69,Giles,all throughout history.
1985.76,1988.25,Xander,"It happened in Salem,"
1985.76,1988.25,Xander,not surprisingly.
1988.33,1989.45,Xander,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
1988.33,1989.45,Xander,I'm still spinning
1989.53,1992.9,Xander,on this whole
1989.53,1992.9,Xander,fairy tales are real" thing.
1992.97,1994.3,Oz,So what do we do?
1994.37,1996.8,Xander,"I don't know about you, but"
1994.37,1996.8,Xander,I'm going to go trade my cow in
1996.87,1998.53,Xander,for some beans.
1999.61,2001.47,Xander,No one else is seeing
1999.61,2001.47,Xander,the funny here.
2001.54,2005.02,Buffy,"Giles, we need to talk to Mom."
2003.08,2005.74,Buffy,"If she knows the truth,"
2003.08,2005.74,Buffy,she can defuse the whole thing.
2007.81,2008.75,Buffy,What happened?
2008.82,2010.11,Michael,I was attacked.
2010.18,2011.48,Xander,Officially not funny.
2011.55,2012.48,Buffy,By whom?
2012.55,2014.58,Michael,My dad. His friends.
2014.65,2016.68,Michael,They're taking people
2014.65,2016.68,Michael,out of their homes.
2016.76,2018.72,Michael,They're talking about a trial
2016.76,2018.72,Michael,down at City Hall.
2018.79,2019.88,Buffy,They got Amy.
2019.96,2021.12,Buffy,"Michael, stay here and hide."
2021.19,2022.59,Buffy,"Giles, we'll go find my mom."
2022.66,2023.3,Oz,Tell Willow
2023.3,2024.69,Michael,to get out of her house.
2024.76,2027.16,Giles,Stay in my office.
2029.34,2031.06,Giles,
2032.24,2034.1,Willow,"Mom, we really have to talk..."
2034.17,2035.14,Sheila,It's time to go.
2035.21,2036.97,Sheila,"Oh, and get your coat."
2035.21,2036.97,Sheila,It's chilly out.
2037.04,2038.24,Willow,Go? Go where?
2038.31,2040.07,Sheila,"I said get your coat, witch!"
2043.92,2046.41,Joyce,Did you speak to the families?
2046.49,2047.78,Joyce,Great.
2049.52,2051.18,Joyce,Buffy. Mr. Giles.
2051.26,2052.28,Joyce,Did something happen?
2052.36,2054.45,Buffy,"Mom, we need"
2052.36,2054.45,Buffy,to talk to you. Now.
2054.53,2055.55,Joyce,"Well, of course, honey."
2055.63,2057.19,Joyce,"Um, go on without me."
2058.3,2059.86,Buffy,"No, we need to talk alone."
2061.33,2063.67,Buffy,"Look, there's"
2061.33,2063.67,Buffy,more to this than...
2069.04,2071.91,Joyce,You were right.
2071.98,2073.67,Joyce,It was easy.
2073.75,2075.68,Gretel,I told you.
2075.75,2077.55,Hansel,It gets even easier.
2077.62,2080.55,Gretel,But I'm still scared
2077.62,2080.55,Gretel,of the bad girls.
2080.62,2082.71,Hansel,You have to stop them.
2082.79,2085.28,Hansel,You have to make them go away...
2085.36,2086.95,Hansel,forever.
2094.33,2095.86,Oz,Willow!
2109.35,2111.41,Sheila,Hold still.
2109.35,2111.41,Sheila,Be a good girl.
2111.48,2115.28,Willow,No! Why are you
2111.48,2115.28,Willow,doing this to me? Mom?
2115.36,2117.69,Sheila,There's no cure but the fire.
2117.76,2119.16,Willow,Buffy!
2119.23,2120.66,,Wake up!
2120.73,2122.59,Willow,"This is crazy, Mom."
2122.66,2124.79,Willow,Buffy!
2124.86,2126.33,Willow,Buffy!
2126.4,2127.73,,Cordelia: Wake up!
2134.61,2135.54,Giles,Cordelia?
2135.61,2137.41,Cordelia,Took you long enough
2135.61,2137.41,Cordelia,to wake up.
2137.48,2139.54,Cordelia,My hand hurts.
2139.61,2141.71,Giles,Pity.
2141.78,2143.31,Giles,Oh. Why are you here?
2143.38,2145.61,Cordelia,Things are way out
2143.38,2145.61,Cordelia,"of control, Giles."
2145.69,2147.18,Cordelia,"First the thing at school,"
2147.25,2148.65,Cordelia,and then my mom confiscates
2148.72,2151.66,Cordelia,all of my black clothes
2148.72,2151.66,Cordelia,and scented candles.
2151.72,2154.49,Cordelia,I came over here to tell Buffy
2151.72,2154.49,Cordelia,to stop this craziness
2154.56,2157.22,Cordelia,and found you
2154.56,2157.22,Cordelia,all unconscious... again.
2157.3,2159.56,Cordelia,How many times have you
2157.3,2159.56,Cordelia,"been knocked out, anyway?"
2159.63,2161.69,Cordelia,"I swear,"
2159.63,2161.69,Cordelia,"one of these times,"
2161.77,2163.29,Cordelia,you're going to wake up
2161.77,2163.29,Cordelia,in a coma.
2163.37,2165.14,Cordelia,Wake up in a...
2165.14,2166.9,Giles,"Oh, never mind."
2166.97,2170.07,Giles,We need to save Buffy
2166.97,2170.07,Giles,from Hansel and Gretel.
2171.14,2172.84,Cordelia,"Now, let's be clear."
2172.91,2176.04,Cordelia,The brain damage happened
2172.91,2176.04,Cordelia,before I hit you.
2181.85,2183.34,Xander,What's with the grim?
2183.42,2185.08,Xander,We're here to join you guys.
2185.16,2187.59,Xander,Really. Why should you guys
2185.16,2187.59,Xander,have all the fun?
2187.66,2189.92,Xander,We want to be part of the hate.
2191.06,2192,Oz,"Just so we're clear,"
2192.07,2193.9,Oz,you guys know
2192.07,2193.9,Oz,"you're nuts, right?"
2193.97,2195.83,Xander,
2197.94,2198.93,Willow,Buffy!
2201.02,2200.84,Joyce,"Good morning, sleepyhead."
2200.91,2203.07,Buffy,"Mom, you don't want this."
2203.14,2204.94,Joyce,Since when does it
2203.14,2204.94,Joyce,matter what I want?
2207.02,2206.54,Joyce,"I wanted a normal,"
2207.02,2206.54,Joyce,happy daughter.
2206.61,2208.14,Joyce,Instead I got a slayer.
2212.22,2213.58,Sheila,Torch.
2213.65,2215.28,Joyce,Thanks.
2215.36,2216.55,Joyce,This has been so trying.
2216.62,2218.15,Joyce,You've been such a champ.
2218.22,2219.69,Sheila,"Oh, you, too, Joyce."
2219.76,2221.62,Joyce,"We should stay close,"
2219.76,2221.62,Joyce,have lunch.
2221.69,2223.96,Sheila,"Oh, I'd like that."
2221.69,2223.96,Sheila,How nice.
2225.16,2226.86,Amy,"Oh, you can't be serious."
2226.93,2228.59,Buffy,"Mom, don't!"
2236.04,2239.21,Amy,All right.
2236.04,2239.21,Amy,You want to fry a witch?
2239.28,2240.91,Amy,I'll give you a witch.
2240.98,2243.54,Amy,"Goddess Hecate, work thy will."
2243.62,2244.61,Buffy,Uhoh.
2244.68,2248.35,Amy,Before thee let
2244.68,2248.35,Amy,the unclean thing crawl.
2248.42,2249.58,Amy,
2263.84,2265.06,Amy,
2266.54,2268.47,Buffy,She couldn't do us first?
2268.54,2270.2,Willow,You've seen what we can do.
2270.28,2273.97,Willow,Another step and you
2270.28,2273.97,Willow,will all feel my power.
2274.05,2276.85,Buffy,"What are you going to do,"
2274.05,2276.85,Buffy,float a pencil at them?
2276.92,2279.58,Willow,It's a really big power.
2279.65,2283.45,Buffy,Yes! You will all
2279.65,2283.45,Buffy,be turned into vermin.
2283.52,2285.58,Buffy,And some of you will be fish.
2285.66,2288.22,Buffy,"Yeah, you in the back"
2285.66,2288.22,Buffy,will be fish.
2288.29,2290.23,Man in the back,Maybe we should go.
2290.3,2292.23,Hansel,But you promised.
2292.3,2294.77,Gretel,You have to kill the bad girls.
2296.44,2299.53,Cordelia,Cordelia: I can't believe you had
2296.44,2299.53,Cordelia,this stuff in your apartment.
2299.61,2301.85,Cordelia,It smells foul.
2301.98,2304.28,Giles,Shred the wolfsbane.
2301.98,2304.28,Giles,That's the leafy stuff.
2304.35,2308.38,Giles,And then you can crush
2304.35,2308.38,Giles,the satyrion root.
2308.46,2311.95,Giles,Luften sie den something.
2312.03,2314.33,Giles,Schlumer? Schluter?
2314.4,2315.56,Cordelia,What are you muttering about?
2315.63,2316.72,Giles,It's a part of an incantation.
2316.8,2319.1,Giles,"It's in German,"
2316.8,2319.1,Giles,and without my books...
2319.17,2320.33,Cordelia,What does it mean?
2320.4,2322.2,Giles,It's about lifting a veil.
2322.27,2326.17,Giles,It should make the demons
2322.27,2326.17,Giles,"appear in their true form,"
2326.24,2329.11,Giles,"which with any luck,"
2326.24,2329.11,Giles,will negate their influence.
2329.18,2331.44,Giles,"And, uh, drop a toadstone"
2329.18,2331.44,Giles,into the mixture.
2331.51,2333.85,Cordelia,This?
2333.92,2335.98,Cordelia,It doesn't look like a toad.
2336.05,2337.85,Giles,No reason it should.
2337.92,2339.35,Giles,It's from inside the toad.
2339.42,2342.59,Cordelia,I hate you.
2347.5,2348.86,Oz,We got to get inside.
2348.93,2351.73,Willow,"Willow: No! Oh, God, help!"
2353.54,2354.76,Oz,Wil?
2354.84,2357.77,Xander,It sounds like
2354.84,2357.77,Xander,she's right above us?
2375.63,2376.39,Xander,Little Girl:
2376.39,2377.22,Gretel,They hurt us.
2377.29,2378.02,Gretel,Little Boy:
2378.02,2378.69,Hansel,Burn them.
2378.76,2382.49,Buffy,"Mom, dead people are talking"
2378.76,2382.49,Buffy,to you. Do the math.
2382.57,2384.53,Joyce,"I'm sorry, Buffy."
2384.6,2385.73,Buffy,"Mom, look at me!"
2385.8,2387.56,Buffy,You love me.
2387.64,2390.8,Buffy,You're not going to be able to live
2387.64,2390.8,Buffy,with yourself if you do this.
2390.87,2391.81,Joyce,You earned this.
2391.87,2395.21,Joyce,You toyed with unnatural forces.
2395.28,2399.02,Joyce,What kind of a mother would I be
2397.08,2398.71,Joyce,if I didn't punish you?
2409.33,2412.09,Cordelia,Ouch! You got hair with that.
2413.63,2417.09,Cordelia,"God, you really were the little"
2413.63,2417.09,Cordelia,"youthful offender, weren't you?"
2417.17,2419.69,Cordelia,You must just look back
2417.17,2419.69,Cordelia,on that and cringe.
2419.77,2421.26,Giles,Shh!
2431.11,2434.14,Willow,"Buffy, I can't take it."
2431.11,2434.14,Willow,It's too hot.
2434.22,2436.45,Buffy,"I'm sorry, Wil."
2434.22,2436.45,Buffy,"If it wasn't for me,"
2436.52,2437.75,Buffy,none of this
2436.52,2437.75,Buffy,would have happened.
2437.82,2439.62,Buffy,It wouldn't be...
2445.6,2446.93,Joyce,Stop them!

2447,2451.56,Cordelia,Incantation In German]
2454.34,2455.53,Cordelia,Do you like that? Huh?
2455.61,2457.9,Willow,"Buffy, I'm on fire!"
2457.97,2459.81,Buffy,"Cordelia, put out the fire!"
2459.88,2461.87,Cordelia,"Oh, right."
2484.7,2486.33,Giles,Ruft euch an.
2486.4,2489.77,Giles,Verbergt euch nicht
2486.4,2489.77,Giles,hinter falschen gesichtern.
2510.36,2513.29,Cordelia,"OK, I think I liked"
2510.36,2513.29,Cordelia,the two little ones
2513.36,2515.13,Cordelia,more than the one big one.
2520.17,2521.53,Joyce,"Oh, my God!"
2521.6,2523.2,Demon,Protect us.
2523.27,2525.33,Demon,Kill the bad girls.
2527.18,2530.94,Buffy,You know what?
2527.18,2530.94,Buffy,Not as convincing in that outfit.
2531.01,2532.48,Buffy,Grr!
2539.89,2541.91,Buffy,Did I get it?
2541.99,2543.19,Buffy,Did I get it?
2545.26,2546.35,Oz,Aah!
2552.23,2553.96,Oz,We're here to save you.
2556.21,2559.07,Buffy,Your mom doesn't mind us
2556.21,2559.07,Buffy,doing this in the house?
2559.14,2561.11,Willow,She doesn't know.
2561.18,2562.7,Buffy,Business as usual?
2562.78,2565.94,Willow,Sort of. She's doing
2562.78,2565.94,Willow,that selective memory thing
2566.02,2567.45,Willow,your mom used to be so good at.
2567.52,2569.28,Buffy,She forgot everything?
2569.35,2573.31,Willow,No. She remembered the part where
2569.35,2573.31,Willow,I said I was dating a musician.
2573.39,2575.76,Willow,Oz has to come
2573.39,2575.76,Willow,for dinner next week.
2575.83,2578.23,Willow,"So, that's sort of like"
2575.83,2578.23,Willow,taking an interest.
2580.03,2581.59,Buffy,"OK, should we try this again?"
2581.66,2586.4,,Let's do it. I think we got
