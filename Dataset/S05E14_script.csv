2.21,5.93,GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
5.93,7.02,SPIKE,Look at you.
5.09,6.83,SPIKE,All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
6.83,7.65,RILEY,Because you are.
7.73,10.41,SPIKE,They had to be certain
7.73,10.41,SPIKE,"the Slayer would protect it,"
10.49,13.33,SPIKE,so they sent the Key to her
10.49,13.33,SPIKE,in the form of a sister."
13.41,14.52,DAWN,I'm not real.
14.52,15.8,BEN,You're the Key.
16.25,19.45,BEN,Go! Before she finds you. Don't...
16.25,19.45,BEN,She's here!
19.53,24.48,DAWN,Ben. He was trying to help me. He might have
19.53,24.48,DAWN,left before Glory came. I can't remember.

28.02,32.07,DAWN,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
35.21,37.28,SPIKE,I'm amused
37.37,39.93,DAWN,By the overwhelming choices
40.01,42.13,DAWN,I guess the hardest part
42.21,44.41,SPIKE,Is knowing when to stop
44.49,46.93,SPIKE,"Yeah, I'm confused"
47.01,49.53,SPIKE,And I think I'm hearing voices
49.61,51.81,DAWN,Things are happening so fast
51.89,54.41,DAWN,Do I save the best for last?
55.37,57.97,SPIKE,Bleeding crime is what it is.
59.93,63.21,SPIKE,Jacking up the bar price
59.93,63.21,SPIKE,to pay for fixing up this sinkhole.
63.29,66.33,SPIKE,Not my fault the insurance
63.29,66.33,SPIKE,doesn't cover "act of troll".
66.41,69.8,BUFFY,"Gee, maybe it's time"
66.41,69.8,BUFFY,you found a new place to patronise.
69.89,74.97,SPIKE,"I've half a mind to, since the flowering onion"
69.89,74.97,SPIKE,got remodelled right off the sodding menu.
75.05,76.26,BUFFY,It's the only thing
76.26,78.05,SPIKE,this place had going for it.
78.13,79.61,BUFFY,What are you doing?
79.61,82.17,SPIKE,"What do you mean, ""What am I...""?"
82.57,88.21,BUFFY,Here. At this table. Talking to me.
82.57,88.21,BUFFY,Like we're some kind of talking buddies.
90.05,93.2,SPIKE,"Well, I saw you sitting here alone."
93.29,97.92,SPIKE,"Thought, I don't know, you could,"
93.29,97.92,SPIKE,"maybe do with a bit of, you know, company."
101.93,104.05,SPIKE,Suit yourself.
105.77,111.77,SPIKE,Well... we took on that Glory chippy together.
105.77,111.77,SPIKE,"I was right there with you, fighting the fight."
111.85,114.29,BUFFY,Or sleeping the sleep
111.85,114.29,BUFFY,of the knocked unconscious.
114.37,118.69,SPIKE,"Still, points for intent. You'd think that"
114.37,118.69,SPIKE,would be enough to cut me a sliver of slack.
118.77,121.43,SPIKE,"Earn me a little consideration, respect."
121.43,123.69,XANDER,"Hey, Evil Dead, you're in my seat."
125.77,127.76,SPIKE,Bugger it.
133.53,135.81,ANYA,"Xander, I think you hurt his feelings."
135.89,139.6,XANDER,And you should never
135.89,139.6,XANDER,hurt the feelings of a brutal killer.
139.69,143.29,XANDER,"You know, that's actually"
139.69,143.29,XANDER,some pretty good advice.
143.37,147.92,XANDER,Who's up for more liquid refreshments?
143.37,147.92,XANDER,"I'm buying, for I am Payday Man."
148.01,149.45,WILLOW,I could use a water.
149.53,153.24,XANDER,Water poses no challenge
149.53,153.24,XANDER,"for Payday Man, for I have..."
153.73,158.02,XANDER,"Hey, where's my change?"
158.93,160.92,XANDER,"Spike, you diabolical fiend."
163.17,165.53,BUFFY,Poor Will. Still getting those headaches?
165.61,169.93,WILLOW,"Fewer and further between, but they're"
165.61,169.93,WILLOW,still exercising their visitation rights.
170.01,174.93,TARA,"Honey, in case you didn't hear me the first"
170.01,174.93,TARA,"times, no more teleportation spells."
175.01,177.73,WILLOW,We have squat in the way of
175.01,177.73,WILLOW,Gloryfighting arsenal.
177.81,182.97,WILLOW,"Another runin with her, and headaches and"
177.81,182.97,WILLOW,nosebleeds will be the least of our problems.
183.05,188.25,BUFFY,This is my first R and R in weeks. Can we go
183.05,188.25,BUFFY,one night without saying the name Glory?
188.33,190.41,TARA,I'm down with that. Let's call She Who Will
190.41,192.53,BUFFY,Not Be Named another name. Let's call her...
192.61,193.1,BUFFY,Ben!
193.1,194.57,TARA,For example.
194.93,197.08,BUFFY,I'll be right back.
197.17,198.17,BUFFY,Ben! Hey!
198.17,199.29,BEN,"Buffy, hi."
199.81,202.89,BUFFY,I barely recognised you
199.81,202.89,BUFFY,without your hospital scrubs.
202.97,206.68,BEN,"Oh, you'd be surprised"
202.97,206.68,BEN,at the extent of my wardrobe.
206.77,207.27,BUFFY,Really?
207.27,210.61,BEN,I have entire outfits that aren't blue pyjamas.
213.37,217.97,BUFFY,My sister told me what happened
213.37,217.97,BUFFY,at the hospital before I got there.
218.05,218.6,BEN,Uhhuh.
218.6,221.84,BUFFY,And I just wanted to say... thanks.
223.33,225.53,BUFFY,For looking after her.
226.53,229.37,BEN,That's OK. I'm glad Dawn's all right.
229.45,231.64,XANDER,"The point is, I work hard for that money."
231.64,233.08,SPIKE,And you're saying I didn't?
233.17,233.99,XANDER,You stole it.
233.99,236.56,SPIKE,And you're making it into very hard work.
236.65,239.25,XANDER,"Listen, Bleach Boy,"
236.65,239.25,XANDER,I don't have a chip in my head.
239.33,242.45,XANDER,I can do far more damage to you
239.33,242.45,XANDER,than you can ever do to me.
242.53,244.52,SPIKE,Yeah?
245.37,247.68,SPIKE,Like you could ever hurt me.
279.17,282.25,PORTER,Sunnydale Station! Last stop this line!
303.57,306.04,PORTER,"Oh, God! Oh, please! Help me!"
306.13,308.49,PORTER,"Somebody, please! Help me!"
367.09,369.37,JOYCE,Buffy?
369.45,371.25,BUFFY,I'm back by popular demand.
371.25,372.92,GILES,Did you have a nice time?
374.09,376.93,BUFFY,"You know, I think I did. Much needed fun."
377.01,380.21,BUFFY,Apart from Willow's headaches
377.01,380.21,BUFFY,and Spike's cameo appearance.
380.29,382.28,DAWN,Spike was there?
382.28,384.02,BUFFY,Unfortunately.
382.09,384.08,JOYCE,"Well, I'm relieved that you're home."
384.17,388.17,JOYCE,"Because, to be honest,"
384.17,388.17,JOYCE,I wasn't feeling all that safe with you gone.
389.25,393.02,JOYCE,At first.
391.09,395.21,JOYCE,And then I remembered that Rupert was here
391.09,395.21,JOYCE,"and I felt much, much safer."
395.29,398.81,GILES,"Yes, well, thank you for the little backpedal,"
395.29,398.81,GILES,but I'm forced to agree
398.89,401.19,GILES,that I'm barely an adequate substitute
401.19,403.49,JOYCE,for a slayer in the house. Good night.
403.57,405.56,JOYCE,Good night.
407.65,408.82,BUFFY,So how is Dawn?
408.82,410.61,GILES,She's coping very well.
410.69,415.97,GILES,"Extremely well, really, considering"
410.69,415.97,GILES,the extraordinary circumstances of her origin.
416.05,421.02,BUFFY,Then let me ask you something.
419.09,422.88,BUFFY,We've been going easy on her
419.09,422.88,BUFFY,"the last week, letting things slide."
422.97,424.87,GILES,I don't think that's at all wise.
424.87,425.44,BUFFY,You don't?
425.53,429.05,GILES,The best thing you can do now
425.53,429.05,GILES,is behave exactly as you always have.
429.13,433.29,GILES,Any special treatment at this stage
429.13,433.29,GILES,will undermine Dawn's sense of normality.
433.37,435.89,BUFFY,You think so?
435.89,438.02,GILES,Absolutely.
436.09,437.97,BUFFY,Thanks. Dawn!
438.65,438.98,DAWN,What?
438.98,441.73,BUFFY,What did I say about borrowing my clothes?
441.81,442.76,DAWN,I didn't.
442.76,443.29,BUFFY,Bull!
443.37,445.01,DAWN,I never touched your stuff.
445.01,447.33,BUFFY,Then what happened to my blue sweater?
449.09,451.16,HARMONY,Spikey?
451.25,453.46,HARMONY,Aren't you coming to bed?
453.46,454.69,SPIKE,I'm not tired.
455.41,457.4,HARMONY,Me neither.
459.85,462.21,HARMONY,Don't you wanna come in and...
463.65,464.69,HARMONY,tire me out?
464.77,468.29,SPIKE,"Harm, I'm really not in the mood right now."
469.65,471.85,HARMONY,You're never in the mood.
475.45,478.15,HARMONY,We could do something different tonight.
478.15,480.85,SPIKE,Like you stop yammering for two seconds?
481.77,486.02,HARMONY,"Well, we could..."
484.09,488.02,HARMONY,I don't know...
486.09,488.16,HARMONY,maybe play a game?
493.17,495.61,HARMONY,"Oh, I'm gonna stake you!"
495.69,499.16,HARMONY,"I'm coming after you,"
495.69,499.16,HARMONY,"you bad, evil vampire,"
499.25,501.89,HARMONY,and I'm gonna slay you!
502.73,507.09,HARMONY,"I'm sneaking up,"
502.73,507.09,HARMONY,and I'm gonna stake you so much
507.17,511.93,HARMONY,with my slaying powers
507.17,511.93,HARMONY,that I have because I'm the Chosen...
514.45,515.73,HARMONY,"Oh, Spike!"
516.05,518.85,WILLOW VOICEOVER,I don't see why
516.05,518.85,WILLOW VOICEOVER,he couldn't end up with Esmeralda.
518.93,522.69,WILLOW,"They could have the wedding right there,"
518.93,522.69,WILLOW,beneath the very bell tower
522.77,525.73,WILLOW,where he laboured thanklessly
522.77,525.73,WILLOW,for all those years.
525.81,528.23,WILLOW,"No, it can't end like that, cos Quasimodo's"
528.23,530.09,TARA,actions were selfishly motivated.
530.17,533.05,TARA,"He had no moral compass,"
530.17,533.05,TARA,no understanding of right.
533.13,536.73,TARA,Everything he did was out of love
533.13,536.73,TARA,for a woman who would never love him.
536.81,541.93,TARA,"Also, you can tell it's not gonna have a happy"
536.81,541.93,TARA,ending when the main guy's all bumpy.
544.57,546.08,WILLOW,"What do you think, Buffy?"
546.08,548.25,BUFFY,"The test isn't till tomorrow, right?"
548.33,550.69,BUFFY,I don't have an opinion till then.
550.69,552.29,WILLOW,"But you read it, right?"
552.37,554.76,BUFFY,Kinda not. I rented the movie.
554.85,557.61,TARA,"Oh, with Charles Laughton?"
558.29,561.06,BUFFY,I dunno. He one of the singing gargoyles?
561.06,561.6,WILLOW,"Oh, boy."
561.69,563.89,BUFFY,What? I'm kidding!
565.53,567.13,BUFFY,You're done with this?
567.13,569.53,GUY,"Yeah, hi, kind of reading that..."
570.65,573.73,Shot of front page of the Sunnydale Press reading,Six found murdered on train
570.65,573.73,Shot of front page of the Sunnydale Press reading,at Sunnydale Station."
573.81,575.69,TARA,Glory?
575.77,580.48,BUFFY,Unconfirmed reports of severe trauma
575.77,580.48,BUFFY,to the throats of one or more of the victims."
581.25,584.25,BUFFY,Survey says... vampire.
588.45,592.65,SPIKE,"Oh, it's you."
588.45,592.65,SPIKE,"What are you doing here, lurking about?"
593.29,596.49,DAWN,I'm not lurking. I'm looking.
596.57,598.31,DAWN,What are you doing?
598.31,599.04,SPIKE,Nothing.
599.85,603.24,DAWN,So is that how you
599.85,603.24,DAWN,get around town in the daytime?
603.33,606.37,DAWN,"I mean, does that lead"
603.33,606.37,DAWN,into the sewers or something?
606.45,608.64,DAWN,Can you show me?
608.64,609.05,SPIKE,No.
609.89,611.88,SPIKE,Why are you...?
612.89,615.12,SPIKE,Does Buffy know you're here?
615.21,616.57,DAWN,"Yeah, right."
616.65,619.14,SPIKE,Nothing would make her happier than to
619.14,622.09,DAWN,find out I'm hanging out in a vampire's lair.
622.17,624.32,DAWN,Especially yours.
624.32,626.09,SPIKE,"Go home, then."
626.61,627.7,DAWN,I don't feel like it.
627.7,629.37,SPIKE,You can't bloody well stay here.
629.45,629.96,DAWN,Why not?
629.96,631.89,SPIKE,Because I've got things to do.
633.33,636.05,SPIKE,"Bad, evil things!"
636.73,639.2,SPIKE,That are not for a child's eyes.
639.97,642.28,DAWN,I'm not a child.
642.37,644.73,DAWN,I'm not even human.
644.81,646.8,DAWN,Not originally.
648.01,651.32,SPIKE,"Yeah, well, originally I was. I got over it."
652.77,655.85,SPIKE,Doesn't seem to me
652.77,655.85,SPIKE,it matters very much how you start out.
655.93,658.89,DAWN,That's smart. I get that.
662.13,665.25,DAWN,I like how you talk to me
662.13,665.25,DAWN,like I can understand things.
665.33,668.77,DAWN,Everyone else is being
665.33,668.77,DAWN,all twitchy and secretive.
668.85,671.77,SPIKE,"They're just trying to keep you safe, I expect."
671.85,674.21,DAWN,I feel safe with you.
675.49,676.58,SPIKE,Take that back!
676.58,679.33,DAWN,"I mean, you have the superpower thing."
680.25,683.45,DAWN,"You're just as tough as Buffy is,"
680.25,683.45,DAWN,maybe tougher.
684.61,686.46,DAWN,Buffy thinks so too.
686.46,687.29,SPIKE,She does?
688.05,692.76,DAWN,"Well, she's always worried about what she'll"
688.05,692.76,DAWN,do if you ever get that chip out of your head.
692.85,695.29,SPIKE,Is that right?
695.37,700.32,SPIKE,"So, what else does Buffy say about me?"
702.09,702.85,BUFFY,Hey!
702.85,703.81,JOYCE,Dawn?
703.89,706.25,BUFFY,"No, it's me."
706.33,707.82,JOYCE,Is Dawn with you?
707.82,709.13,BUFFY,Isn't she here?
709.21,713.45,JOYCE,"No, she didn't come home from school. The"
709.21,713.45,JOYCE,news said something about people murdered.
713.53,718.45,BUFFY,It's not Glory. It has nothing to do
713.53,718.45,BUFFY,"with Dawn, I promise. Look, she probably..."
718.53,720.73,BUFFY,I'll find her.
722.49,724.85,DAWN VOICEOVER,And the lady just invited you in?
724.93,727.32,SPIKE,"Well, I had hubby by the throat, didn't I?"
727.41,730.56,SPIKE,Promised her he'd live if she did the invite.
730.65,735.02,DAWN,And did you? Let him live?
733.45,735.41,SPIKE,What do you think?
736.37,737.82,SPIKE,Too much for you?
737.82,739.09,DAWN,No. Keep going.
740.09,743.97,SPIKE,"And I kill 'em. Right quick, the whole lot."
744.09,747.32,SPIKE,But there's someone missing.
747.73,750.85,SPIKE,There's supposed to be this little girl.
752.53,755.33,SPIKE,"So I get real quiet,"
757.21,761.41,SPIKE,and I hear this tiny noise
757.21,761.41,SPIKE,coming from the coal bin.
762.25,764.24,SPIKE,This little sigh.
765.73,770.41,SPIKE,"So I listened harder. It's very, very quiet..."
772.93,773.8,SPIKE,Bloody hell!
773.8,776.32,BUFFY,"Spike, I need your help. Dawn is..."
777.09,778.89,BUFFY,here.
778.97,782.17,DAWN,"Spike was telling a story,"
778.97,782.17,DAWN,and he was at this really cool part...
782.25,784.89,BUFFY,What the hell is this?
782.25,784.89,BUFFY,What is she doing here?
785.33,787.24,DAWN,Just hanging out.
787.24,787.8,BUFFY,Here?
788.49,792.85,DAWN,Can you please let him finish the story?
788.49,792.85,DAWN,Then you could do the lecture?
795.77,797.76,BUFFY,Yeah. OK.
798.85,802.61,BUFFY,Let's hear the story
798.85,802.61,BUFFY,that Spike is telling my little sister.
803.25,804.48,SPIKE,Right.
805.01,806.45,BUFFY,Yeah.
806.53,809.73,BUFFY,"So, I knew the girl was in the coal bin,"
809.81,811.99,BUFFY,"and rip it open, very violent,"
811.99,813.73,SPIKE,haul her out of there...
813.81,816.69,SPIKE,and then I give her
813.81,816.69,SPIKE,"to a good family in a nice home,"
816.77,820.65,SPIKE,"where they're never ever mean to her,"
816.77,820.65,SPIKE,and didn't lock her in the coal bin.
820.73,825.02,DAWN,What? That's so lame!
823.09,826.69,SPIKE,I was just about to send her home.
823.09,826.69,SPIKE,I knew you'd be fretting.
828.65,831.65,BUFFY,"Dawn, get your stuff."
828.65,831.65,BUFFY,We're getting out of here.
833.29,837.53,BUFFY,Why doesn't that register with you?
833.29,837.53,BUFFY,Crypt plus vampire equals bad.
837.61,839.92,DAWN,Cos it was Spike!
840.01,842.89,BUFFY,Hanging out with Spike
840.01,842.89,BUFFY,"is not cool, Dawn. OK?"
842.97,845.77,BUFFY,"It is dangerous, and... icky."
847.09,848.98,DAWN,I don't think Spike's icky.
848.98,851.21,BUFFY,"Yeah, well, think again, sister."
854.49,856.33,BUFFY,You have a crush on him.
856.33,857.25,DAWN,"No, I don't!"
858.29,863.13,DAWN,"It's just, he's got cool hair,"
858.29,863.13,DAWN,and he wears cool leather coats and stuff.
864.01,866.26,DAWN,And he doesn't treat me like an alien.
866.26,867.45,BUFFY,"He's a killer, Dawn."
867.53,871.73,BUFFY,You cannot have a crush on something
867.53,871.73,BUFFY,"that is dead, and evil, and a vampire."
871.81,875.2,DAWN,"Right, that's why you were"
871.81,875.2,DAWN,never with Angel for three years.
875.29,877.41,BUFFY,Angel's different. He has a soul.
877.49,879.56,DAWN,Spike has a chip. Same diff.
879.65,882.09,BUFFY,I can't listen to this!
883.65,888.52,BUFFY,"Spike is a monster, OK?"
883.65,888.52,BUFFY,And plus you are only 14 years old.
888.61,891.41,DAWN,I like hanging out with him is all.
892.13,896.84,DAWN,"And even if I had a crush, he wouldn't notice"
892.13,896.84,DAWN,in a million years. Not with you around.
897.25,898.71,BUFFY,What does that mean?
898.71,900.53,DAWN,Spike's totally into you.
903.45,905.89,DAWN,"Oh, come on. You didn't notice?"
905.97,909.05,DAWN,"Buffy, Spike's completely in love with you."
916.81,920.36,XANDER,So tell me again what we're looking for?
920.36,920.89,BUFFY,Clues.
920.97,922.37,XANDER,OK.
923.21,926.6,XANDER,Could you give me a clue
923.21,926.6,XANDER,about what kind of clues?
927.41,929.61,BUFFY,Something. Anything.
930.93,935.88,BUFFY,Just wanna know if this was a vamp attack.
930.93,935.88,BUFFY,"And if it was, how many we're talking about."
935.97,939.52,XANDER,"Well, Sunnydale's finest"
935.97,939.52,XANDER,"didn't leave us a lot of stuff to examine,"
939.61,943.08,XANDER,and who knows how many people
939.61,943.08,XANDER,have traipsed through here.
943.17,944.15,BUFFY,Xander?
944.15,944.85,XANDER,What?
947.01,951.02,BUFFY,Never mind.
952.45,955.37,BUFFY,It's just that... Dawn said that...
957.13,958,XANDER,Yeah?
958,959.73,BUFFY,Forget it.
961.33,963.64,XANDER,Buffy.
964.21,967.41,BUFFY,She thinks that... She said that...
969.53,971.92,BUFFY,Spike's in love with me.
974.45,975.68,BUFFY,I'm notjoking.
975.68,979.37,XANDER,"Oh, I hope not. It's funnier if it's true."
979.45,982.65,BUFFY,"I'm serious. Xander, this is serious!"
983.25,987.02,XANDER,All right.
988.73,990.84,BUFFY,It's creepy.
990.84,991.37,XANDER,No.
991.45,994.68,XANDER,Not creepy. Cos it's not real!
994.77,1002.02,XANDER,How upset can you get over one of Spike's
994.77,1002.02,XANDER,fevered daydreams that's not gonna happen?
1000.09,1001.01,BUFFY,I guess.
1001.01,1003.53,XANDER,"So, where did Dawn...?"
1003.61,1007.73,XANDER,How did she come to this
1003.61,1007.73,XANDER,extremely entertaining conclusion?
1009.01,1012.89,BUFFY,She was hanging out with Spike.
1009.01,1012.89,BUFFY,I think she has a crush on him.
1014.53,1014.98,XANDER,What?
1014.98,1018.65,BUFFY,I knew he had a weird fixation with me...
1018.73,1021.29,XANDER,I'm the one she has a crush on! Me!
1021.37,1023.32,BUFFY,There's nothing here. Let's go.
1023.32,1024.57,XANDER,It's always been me!
1024.65,1028.53,XANDER,"Big funny Xander! What, she just suddenly"
1024.65,1028.53,XANDER,decides I'm not the cool one any more?
1028.61,1033.02,XANDER,Why is that OK?
1033.17,1037.21,JOYCE,But what they didn't get
1033.17,1037.21,JOYCE,was that it was a copy of the bill of lading.
1037.29,1039.68,JOYCE,So they thought it was another order form.
1039.77,1043.61,JOYCE,So now I've got two shipments
1039.77,1043.61,JOYCE,of Greek amphorae on my hands!
1043.69,1047.37,SPIKE,"That's funny. And, really,"
1043.69,1047.37,SPIKE,how many do you need? Amphorae?
1047.61,1051.81,JOYCE,"Oh, Buffy. Spike came by"
1047.61,1051.81,JOYCE,to apologise for yesterday.
1051.89,1053.93,JOYCE,Our missingchild drama.
1054.01,1056.85,BUFFY,And he just decided to hang out for a while?
1056.93,1060.29,JOYCE,"Well, I got talking about the gallery."
1056.93,1060.29,JOYCE,"See, there was this..."
1060.37,1064.65,SPIKE,"Don't get us all laughing again, Joyce."
1060.37,1064.65,SPIKE,"Anyhow, I really need to talk to your eldest."
1064.73,1066.41,BUFFY,What about?
1068.73,1071.17,SPIKE,I got a bit of info
1068.73,1071.17,SPIKE,you might be keen on knowing.
1071.25,1075.25,BUFFY,"Sorry, all out of cash."
1071.25,1075.25,BUFFY,Why don't you hit on Giles... hit up Giles?
1075.45,1079.33,SPIKE,I got a bead on the guy who killed
1075.45,1079.33,SPIKE,those people. The ones on the train.
1079.41,1079.9,BUFFY,Do tell.
1079.9,1082.13,SPIKE,I'll do better than that. I'll show.
1084.85,1086.41,SPIKE,What's the matter?
1086.49,1088.48,BUFFY,Nothing. Just...
1090.41,1093.21,SPIKE,Two vamps holed up
1090.41,1093.21,SPIKE,in a warehouse downtown.
1093.29,1097.81,SPIKE,"Come on, what are you waiting for?"
1093.29,1097.81,SPIKE,Grab your coat and your pointy sticks.
1108.77,1110.05,BUFFY,Hey!
1118.89,1121.49,SPIKE,"It's not blood, it's bourbon."
1124.29,1126.28,SPIKE,Suit yourself.
1138.25,1140.29,SPIKE,I wanna be sedated
1140.61,1142.81,SPIKE,Do you like the Ramones?
1142.89,1145.81,BUFFY,So if you're not doing this
1142.89,1145.81,BUFFY,"for the money, why are y...?"
1165.77,1167.76,VAMP 1,Slayer.
1171.37,1174.13,SPIKE,Well... that was sad.
1175.41,1180.02,SPIKE,I'm embarrassed for our kind.
1179.21,1186.02,SPIKE,"So should we chase after 'em, then?"
1179.21,1186.02,SPIKE,They couldn't have gone far.
1184.09,1187.8,BUFFY,These vamps have been here for a while.
1184.09,1187.8,BUFFY,They've nested.
1187.89,1190.97,SPIKE,"So, you're saying"
1187.89,1190.97,SPIKE,they're a couple of poofters?
1191.05,1195.57,BUFFY,No. I'm saying they had nothing
1191.05,1195.57,BUFFY,to do with last night's murders.
1195.65,1197.33,SPIKE,How do you figure?
1197.41,1200.72,BUFFY,Whoever did it only arrived in town last night.
1200.81,1203.28,BUFFY,Looks like you've wasted my time.
1211.05,1213.52,BUFFY,What are you doing?
1216.77,1218.97,SPIKE,I wasn't thinking.
1219.29,1220.04,BUFFY,What is this?
1220.04,1222.65,SPIKE,"Oh, don't get your knickers twisted. I was..."
1222.73,1225.29,BUFFY,What is this?
1225.65,1229.57,BUFFY,The latenight stakeout?
1225.65,1229.57,BUFFY,The bogus suspects? The flask?
1230.49,1233.53,BUFFY,Is this a date?
1230.49,1233.53,BUFFY,A d...?
1233.61,1236.69,BUFFY,Please! A date?
1236.77,1241.72,SPIKE,You are completely off your bird!
1236.77,1241.72,SPIKE,I mean... Do you want it to be?
1245.45,1247.52,BUFFY,"Oh, my God."
1251.49,1253.29,BUFFY,"Oh, no."
1254.05,1255.74,BUFFY,Are you out of your mind?
1255.74,1257.09,SPIKE,It's not so unusual.
1259.17,1262.09,SPIKE,Two people in the workplace...
1262.17,1263.9,SPIKE,Feelings develop.
1263.9,1264.61,BUFFY,No! No.
1264.69,1267.25,BUFFY,"No, feelings do not develop. No feelings."
1267.33,1270.96,SPIKE,You can't deny it.
1267.33,1270.96,SPIKE,There's something between us.
1271.05,1272.85,BUFFY,Loathing. Disgust.
1272.93,1274.65,SPIKE,Heat. Desire.
1274.73,1276.8,BUFFY,"Please! Spike, you're a vampire."
1276.8,1278.09,SPIKE,Angel was a vampire.
1278.49,1279.82,BUFFY,Angel was good.
1279.82,1283.2,SPIKE,"And I can be too. I've changed, Buffy."
1283.61,1286.97,BUFFY,"What, that chip in your head?"
1283.61,1286.97,BUFFY,That's not change.
1287.05,1290.6,BUFFY,That's just holding you back.
1287.05,1290.6,BUFFY,You're like a serial killer in prison!
1290.69,1292.97,SPIKE,Women marry 'em all the time!
1293.65,1298.85,SPIKE,But I'm not like that. Something's happening
1293.65,1298.85,SPIKE,to me. I can't stop thinking about you.
1299.33,1301.61,SPIKE,And if that means turning my back on evil...
1301.69,1305.29,BUFFY,You don't know what you mean!
1301.69,1305.29,BUFFY,You don't know what feelings are!
1305.37,1308.6,SPIKE,I damn well do! I lie awake every night!
1308.69,1311.07,BUFFY,You sleep during the day!
1311.07,1312.21,SPIKE,"Yeah, but..."
1312.29,1315.52,SPIKE,You are missing the point. This is real here.
1316.41,1317.49,SPIKE,I love...
1317.49,1318.21,BUFFY,Don't!
1319.37,1321.28,BUFFY,Don't say it.
1323.41,1324.28,BUFFY,I'm going.
1324.28,1326.96,SPIKE,"Oh, come on, we need to talk..."
1327.05,1331.68,BUFFY,We don't need to do anything!
1327.05,1331.68,BUFFY,OK? There is no "we"!
1332.25,1334.24,BUFFY,Understand?
1335.85,1338.24,SPIKE,Buffy...
1358.69,1361.13,SPIKE,Who's there?
1361.21,1364.09,VOICE,"A happy memory, pretty Spike."
1366.57,1369.77,DRUSILLA,Look who's come
1366.57,1369.77,DRUSILLA,to make everything right again.
1379.33,1382.09,DRUSILLA,"So, let me get this straight."
1382.85,1386.69,SPIKE,"Darla got mojoed back from the beyond,"
1382.85,1386.69,SPIKE,"you vamped her,"
1386.77,1391.37,SPIKE,and now she and you are working on
1386.77,1391.37,SPIKE,turning Angel into his own bad self again.
1391.45,1392.6,SPIKE,Sounds fun.
1392.6,1396.37,DRUSILLA,It is. Like lollipops at the circus.
1396.85,1398.37,DRUSILLA,Although...
1398.45,1401.84,DRUSILLA,didn't care for Angelus setting us on fire.
1401.93,1405.64,SPIKE,"And this has got you, what,"
1401.93,1405.64,SPIKE,"all nostalgic now, has it?"
1405.73,1408.88,DRUSILLA,"I want us to be a family again, my William."
1412.97,1415.17,DRUSILLA,Come back with me.
1417.29,1419.33,SPIKE,To Los Angeles?
1420.21,1423.68,SPIKE,"I've done the whole LA scene, Dru."
1420.21,1423.68,SPIKE,Didn't agree with me.
1425.81,1429.69,SPIKE,"Besides, I've got a sweet"
1425.81,1429.69,SPIKE,little setup here in Sunny D.
1430.17,1432.21,SPIKE,Decent digs...
1432.29,1435.21,SPIKE,not to mention all the tasty townies I can eat.
1435.29,1437.89,DRUSILLA,Naughty.
1437.97,1440.65,DRUSILLA,You needn't make up stories.
1440.73,1443.33,DRUSILLA,I already know why you're not coming.
1444.01,1446.29,DRUSILLA,Poor boy.
1446.37,1449.84,DRUSILLA,Tin soldiers put funny little
1446.37,1449.84,DRUSILLA,knickknacks in your brain.
1449.93,1452.93,DRUSILLA,Can't hunt. Can't hurt. Can't kill.
1456.25,1458.64,DRUSILLA,You've got a chip.
1458.73,1461.33,SPIKE,"Right, so you've heard."
1461.89,1465.09,SPIKE,Poor Spike's become
1461.89,1465.09,SPIKE,"a cautionary tale for vampires, right?"
1465.17,1469.96,SPIKE,"You better be good, kiddies,"
1465.17,1469.96,SPIKE,or else they might wire you up someday!"
1470.85,1475.02,DRUSILLA,I don't believe in science.
1473.09,1476.48,DRUSILLA,All those bits and molecules
1473.09,1476.48,DRUSILLA,no one's ever seen.
1476.57,1479.04,DRUSILLA,I trust eyes and heart alone.
1480.25,1484.21,DRUSILLA,And do you know what mine
1480.25,1484.21,DRUSILLA,is singing out right now?
1486.89,1489.04,DRUSILLA,You're a killer.
1489.13,1490.93,DRUSILLA,Born to slash...
1491.01,1493.48,DRUSILLA,and bash... and...
1495.77,1498.73,DRUSILLA,"bleed, like beautiful poetry."
1502.33,1505.69,DRUSILLA,No little Tinkertoy
1502.33,1505.69,DRUSILLA,could ever stop you from flowing.
1505.77,1507.76,SPIKE,Yeah.
1512.65,1515.77,SPIKE,"But the pain... Love, you don't understand."
1517.61,1520.61,SPIKE,It's searing. It's blinding.
1523.49,1525.96,DRUSILLA,All in your head.
1526.05,1527.81,DRUSILLA,I can see it.
1527.89,1530.2,DRUSILLA,"Little bit of plastic,"
1530.29,1533.09,DRUSILLA,spiderwebbing out nasty blue shocks.
1533.97,1536.41,DRUSILLA,And every one is a lie.
1537.33,1539.8,DRUSILLA,"Electricity lies, Spike."
1539.89,1543.68,DRUSILLA,"It tells you you're not a bad dog, but you are."
1549.57,1552.73,HARMONY,What the heck is this?
1552.73,1555.02,SPIKE,"Oh, bloody hell."
1553.09,1554.92,HARMONY,Who is...?
1555.01,1559.17,HARMONY,"Oh, wait. I get it."
1555.01,1559.17,HARMONY,Our little sex game was just the beginning.
1559.25,1564.49,HARMONY,Now you pick up some cheap queen of the
1559.25,1564.49,HARMONY,damned to dress as your precious Droodzilla.
1564.57,1565.16,SPIKE,Harm...
1565.25,1569.88,HARMONY,You better not be thinking what I think you're
1565.25,1569.88,HARMONY,thinking. My answer is the same as always.
1569.97,1574.36,HARMONY,"No threesomes unless it's boy,"
1569.97,1574.36,HARMONY,"boy, girl. Or Charlize Theron."
1574.45,1578.13,SPIKE,"Harm, you moron, this is Drusilla."
1581.05,1586.08,HARMONY,Well. You've got some nerve
1581.05,1586.08,HARMONY,showing up here like this.
1586.17,1590.13,HARMONY,After all this time.
1586.17,1590.13,HARMONY,After breaking my sweet booboo's heart.
1591.57,1595.61,HARMONY,Do you have any idea how hard it's been to
1591.57,1595.61,HARMONY,break down the walls he put up after you left?
1595.69,1597.66,HARMONY,"I mean, serious trust issues."
1597.66,1598.13,SPIKE,Harm...
1598.21,1603.89,SPIKE,"So it's no use crawling back to him, cos"
1598.21,1603.89,SPIKE,"he don't play that game any more, Morticia."
1607.33,1613.25,SPIKE,"It's been fun while it lasted, Harm, but"
1607.33,1613.25,SPIKE,I think it'd be best now if you hit the road.
1619.01,1621.81,HARMONY,Why? Because she's back?
1622.33,1624.85,SPIKE,No.
1624.93,1626.97,SPIKE,Because I am.
1631.93,1636.17,DRUSILLA,"And there you are, my darling, deadly boy."
1640.57,1644.96,WILLOW,"Well, he actually told you?"
1640.57,1644.96,WILLOW,He said "I love you"?
1645.33,1649.65,BUFFY,"Well, I didn't let him get that far,"
1645.33,1649.65,BUFFY,but I could see the words coming.
1649.73,1654.76,JOYCE,"Honey, did you... somehow,"
1649.73,1654.76,JOYCE,"unintentionally, lead him on in any way?"
1654.85,1656.57,JOYCE,Send him signals?
1656.65,1659.65,BUFFY,"Well, I do beat him up a lot."
1661.01,1663.48,BUFFY,For Spike that's like third base.
1664.65,1667.29,WILLOW,"Buffy, I'm really worried."
1667.37,1669.89,JOYCE,So am I. He could become dangerous.
1669.97,1674.92,BUFFY,Not really. As long as it's still chips ahoy in
1669.97,1674.92,BUFFY,"Spike's head, he can't hurt me, or any of us."
1675.81,1678.77,BUFFY,"Besides, this'll probably"
1675.81,1678.77,BUFFY,just blow over. You know?
1678.85,1684.25,BUFFY,It's just a weird Spike thing. He'll have the
1678.85,1684.25,BUFFY,hots for some gak demon before we know it.
1684.33,1688.61,WILLOW,I don't know. These things
1684.33,1688.61,WILLOW,can become pretty twisted.
1688.69,1691.03,JOYCE,"Yeah, and Spike, I mean, he's..."
1691.03,1692.13,BUFFY,Pretty twisted.
1692.21,1693.53,JOYCE,Yeah.
1693.61,1696.73,JOYCE,"Well, you made it clear, right?"
1693.61,1696.73,JOYCE,That it could never happen.
1696.81,1700.6,JOYCE,That there's no possible way. Ever.
1696.81,1700.6,JOYCE,Yeah!
1702.09,1705.97,BUFFY,I think so. I don't know. I was just so thrown.
1706.05,1708.64,WILLOW,"Well, Buffy, you have to talk to him again."
1708.64,1711.29,BUFFY,"What? No. No, no, I have to avoid him again."
1711.37,1713.89,WILLOW,Not until you shut him down completely.
1713.97,1718.73,WILLOW,If he thinks there's even a little chance
1713.97,1718.73,WILLOW,"with you, there's no telling what he'll do."
1721.09,1723.65,JOYCE,And this time
1723.73,1726.77,JOYCE,I'm staying
1727.53,1735.02,WILLOW,To bury the trail that you left
1733.09,1735.48,JOYCE,You left
1749.45,1753.21,JOYCE,And if I was cold
1753.29,1757.61,JOYCE,"Well, then you would"
1757.69,1761.32,JOYCE,Stay inside me
1761.41,1764.13,JOYCE,Warm me
1771.69,1774.92,JOYCE,Here I stay...
1775.57,1780.04,JOYCE,"I know this is hard, but you made the right"
1775.57,1780.04,JOYCE,decision. Better to nip this in the bud before...
1780.13,1781.67,BUFFY,The bud nips me?
1781.67,1782.44,JOYCE,Exactly.
1782.53,1786.45,WILLOW,"If you want, Buffy, I can go with."
1782.53,1786.45,WILLOW,Back you up with some scowling.
1786.77,1790.89,BUFFY,"Thanks, but I think"
1786.77,1790.89,BUFFY,this is something I have to do myself.
1790.97,1796.21,BUFFY,"Besides, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this whole"
1790.97,1796.21,BUFFY,thing's just been blown way out of proportion
1796.29,1798.73,BUFFY,and he's already gone back
1796.29,1798.73,BUFFY,to wanting me dead.
1798.81,1800.8,WILLOW,Here's hoping.
1803.93,1807.64,BUFFY,"You know what, though? There is one thing"
1803.93,1807.64,BUFFY,you can do for me while I'm gone.
1807.93,1809.81,BUFFY,I told you
1809.89,1814.21,BUFFY,Just like I told everyone
1814.29,1817.81,BUFFY,I still have some doubts
1817.89,1821.36,BUFFY,That you are the reason
1822.73,1825.09,BUFFY,Still this is just so hard
1825.17,1828.37,BUFFY,Cos I know that I'll be left
1828.45,1831.45,BUFFY,Like always
1833.33,1835.32,BUFFY,Always
1836.77,1839.73,BUFFY,Here I'm safe
1839.81,1843.41,BUFFY,So here I stay
1844.09,1847.53,BUFFY,Lift me out
1847.61,1850.41,BUFFY,Lift the doubt
1874.05,1876.04,BUFFY,Spike?
1878.73,1880.72,BUFFY,Are you here?
1890.17,1892.16,BUFFY,Spike?
1969.37,1974.02,SPIKE,See anything interesting?
1972.89,1975.09,BUFFY,Spike... I...
1976.85,1978.84,BUFFY,What...
1979.77,1981.85,BUFFY,What happened?
1981.85,1982.29,DRUSILLA,Me.
1984.41,1987.41,SPIKE,"You remember my ex, don't you, Slayer?"
1989.57,1992.77,SPIKE,"Come back, she did."
1989.57,1992.77,SPIKE,Couldn't live without me.
1993.65,1997.85,DRUSILLA,My boy's been feeding again.
1993.65,1997.85,DRUSILLA,But I know what he really wants to eat.
2002.73,2006.2,DRUSILLA,Shall we tie her up?
2002.73,2006.2,DRUSILLA,Play with her a teensy bit first?
2007.33,2010.45,SPIKE,I'm through playing.
2010.53,2014.85,DRUSILLA,I like it when you're all dour
2010.53,2014.85,DRUSILLA,"and straighttobusiness, like."
2024.37,2026.97,SPIKE,Bloody well through playing.
2036.33,2038.61,SPIKE,There she is.
2038.69,2042.13,SPIKE,I was beginning to think
2038.69,2042.13,SPIKE,you'd sleep the night away.
2044.37,2047.25,BUFFY,Dru... Drusilla?
2050.81,2054.2,DRUSILLA,Not nice to change the game
2050.81,2054.2,DRUSILLA,"in midplay, Spike."
2054.29,2057.89,DRUSILLA,You've taken my chair
2054.29,2057.89,DRUSILLA,and the music hasn't stopped.
2057.97,2059.96,SPIKE,"Sorry, pet. My house, my rules."
2060.05,2062.85,DRUSILLA,I think I shall be very cross with you
2060.05,2062.85,DRUSILLA,when I'm free again.
2062.93,2064.93,BUFFY,What's going on?
2064.93,2065.81,SPIKE,Simple.
2065.89,2068.28,SPIKE,I'm gonna prove something.
2070.97,2072.93,SPIKE,I love you.
2073.01,2074.25,BUFFY,"Oh, my God."
2074.25,2075.93,SPIKE,"No, look at me."
2076.29,2078.65,SPIKE,I... love you.
2080.85,2083.57,SPIKE,You're all I bloody think about.
2084.37,2089.02,SPIKE,Dream about.
2087.09,2090.09,SPIKE,"You're in my gut, in my throat."
2092.49,2095.05,SPIKE,"I'm drowning in you, Summers,"
2092.49,2095.05,SPIKE,I'm drowning in you.
2098.25,2100.97,SPIKE,"I can do without the laugh track, Dru."
2101.05,2103.61,DRUSILLA,But it's so funny.
2104.05,2107.05,DRUSILLA,I knew... before you did.
2108.73,2112.65,DRUSILLA,I knew you loved the Slayer.
2108.73,2112.65,DRUSILLA,The pixies in my head whispered it to me...
2112.73,2117.12,SPIKE,You can't tell me there isn't anything between
2112.73,2117.12,SPIKE,you and me. I know you feel something.
2117.21,2121.76,BUFFY,It's called revulsion. And whatever
2117.21,2121.76,BUFFY,"you think you're feeling, it's not love."
2121.85,2126.02,BUFFY,You can't love without a soul.
2124.09,2126.29,DRUSILLA,"Oh, we can, you know."
2126.37,2130.53,DRUSILLA,We can love quite well... if not wisely.
2130.61,2135.48,SPIKE,You still don't believe. You still
2130.61,2135.48,SPIKE,don't think I mean it. You want proof?
2137.21,2139.41,SPIKE,How's this?
2146.53,2148.65,SPIKE,I'm gonna kill Drusilla for you.
2150.65,2155.6,BUFFY,It doesn't prove anything. Except that you're
2150.65,2155.6,BUFFY,a sick vampire I should have dusted long ago.
2155.69,2157.41,BUFFY,"And hey, already there."
2157.41,2158.61,SPIKE,Don't mock this.
2158.69,2160.23,BUFFY,Go mock yourself.
2160.23,2162.32,SPIKE,"This is Drusilla, girl!"
2162.41,2167.04,SPIKE,Do you have the slightest idea what she
2162.41,2167.04,SPIKE,means to me? It's the face of my salvation!
2168.09,2173.93,SPIKE,She delivered me from mediocrity. For over
2168.09,2173.93,SPIKE,a century we cut a swath through continents.
2174.01,2177.21,SPIKE,"A hundred years,"
2174.01,2177.21,SPIKE,she never stopped surprising me.
2177.93,2180.73,SPIKE,Never stopped taking me to new depths.
2182.37,2185.09,SPIKE,I was a lucky bloke.
2185.17,2188.05,SPIKE,Just to touch such a black beauty.
2194.21,2199.02,SPIKE,"So you see, it means something."
2197.09,2199.65,BUFFY,Not to me. Kill her. Why do I care?
2201.01,2205.02,SPIKE,Here's why.
2204.53,2207.76,SPIKE,If you don't admit
2204.53,2207.76,SPIKE,that there's something there...
2209.21,2215.08,SPIKE,some tiny feeling for me...
2209.21,2215.08,SPIKE,then I'll untie Dru and let her kill you instead.
2215.49,2217.21,DRUSILLA,"Yes, please."
2217.29,2219.44,DRUSILLA,I like that game much more.
2219.53,2221.6,SPIKE,Just...
2222.49,2224.56,SPIKE,give me something.
2224.65,2227.65,SPIKE,A crumb. The barest smidgen.
2229.65,2232.57,SPIKE,"Tell me... maybe,"
2233.25,2235.85,SPIKE,"someday, there's a chance."
2245.85,2247.84,BUFFY,Spike...
2250.13,2253.97,BUFFY,The only chance you had with me
2250.13,2253.97,BUFFY,was when I was unconscious.
2262.29,2267.89,SPIKE,What the bleeding hell is wrong
2262.29,2267.89,SPIKE,with you bloody women?
2268.73,2270.96,SPIKE,What the hell does it take?
2271.05,2274.28,SPIKE,Why do you bitches torture me?
2274.37,2276.38,BUFFY,Which question shall I answer first?
2276.38,2278.45,SPIKE,I'm at the end of my bleeding tether.
2278.53,2283.02,SPIKE,I don't even know why I even bother.
2281.09,2284.05,SPIKE,It's your fault.
2281.09,2284.05,SPIKE,You're the one to blame for all this.
2284.13,2284.61,DRUSILLA,Am I?
2284.61,2286.6,SPIKE,Bloody right you are!
2286.69,2290.93,SPIKE,"If you hadn't left me for that chaos demon,"
2286.69,2290.93,SPIKE,I never would have come back here!
2291.01,2296.04,SPIKE,Never would have had a sodding chip in my
2291.01,2296.04,SPIKE,skull! And you wouldn't be able to touch me.
2296.13,2298.97,SPIKE,"Because this, with you, is wrong."
2299.05,2300.88,SPIKE,I know it.
2300.97,2303.49,SPIKE,I'm not a complete idiot.
2303.57,2305.77,SPIKE,You think I like having you in here?
2305.85,2310.17,SPIKE,"Destroying everything that was me,"
2305.85,2310.17,SPIKE,"until all that's left is you, in a dead shell."
2310.25,2312.89,SPIKE,"You say you hate it, but you won't leave."
2312.97,2317.33,SPIKE,"You know, what I should just do"
2312.97,2317.33,SPIKE,is get rid of both of you. Burn you.
2317.41,2322.81,SPIKE,"Cut you into little pieces, so there won't be"
2317.41,2322.81,SPIKE,any more bints to cock up things for Spi...
2325.33,2326.3,SPIKE,"Oh, great."
2326.3,2328.33,HARMONY,"What about me, Spike?"
2328.41,2332.17,HARMONY,You forget about me again?
2328.41,2332.17,HARMONY,The actual girlfriend?
2332.25,2337.12,HARMONY,I gave you the best...
2332.25,2337.12,HARMONY,bunch of months of my life!
2338.93,2342.77,DRUSILLA,"That's right, little girl."
2338.93,2342.77,DRUSILLA,Teach our naughty boy a lesson.
2342.85,2345.06,SPIKE,"Oh, so now you're all ganging up?"
2345.06,2347.48,HARMONY,"I thought I could change you, Spike."
2347.57,2350.77,HARMONY,"I thought maybe if I gave and I gave and gave,"
2350.85,2353.73,HARMONY,maybe you'd come around.
2353.81,2357.81,HARMONY,Maybe be a little nicer.
2353.81,2357.81,HARMONY,Stop treating me like your dog.
2358.65,2361.04,HARMONY,But now I see it's you.
2361.13,2364.05,HARMONY,"You're the dog, who needs to be put..."
2389.17,2391.16,HARMONY,You're on my hair.
2425.69,2430.02,DRUSILLA,Poor Spike.
2428.09,2431.48,DRUSILLA,So lost. Even I can't help you now.
2436.57,2438.56,HARMONY,"Oh, Spikey."
2439.33,2442.41,HARMONY,And you can say goodbye to this.
2442.49,2445.61,HARMONY,Because you're not gonna see it any more.
2445.69,2453.02,HARMONY,Unless you run into me somewhere
2445.69,2453.02,HARMONY,and it's me walking away from you.
2451.09,2456.09,HARMONY,"But even then, I'll probably just,"
2451.09,2456.09,HARMONY,"you know, back away."
2474.57,2478.49,SPIKE,"Buffy? Come on now, stop!"
2474.57,2478.49,SPIKE,You can'tjust walk away from this.
2478.57,2483.17,,What part did you not understand?
2478.57,2483.17,,We had a fight. It doesn't change anything.
2483.25,2486.96,,"It changes everything, Spike! I want you out."
2487.05,2490.09,,"I want you out of this town,"
2487.05,2490.09,,I want you off this planet!
2490.17,2495.17,,"You don't come near me, my friends"
2490.17,2495.17,,"or my family again, ever! Understand?"
2496.09,2500.61,,"No. It's not that easy. We have something,"
2496.09,2500.61,,"Buffy. It's not pretty, but it's real."
2500.69,2506.4,,And there's nothing we can do about it.
2500.69,2506.4,,I'm in your life. You can'tjust shut me out...
