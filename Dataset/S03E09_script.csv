38,40.83,,OK. That was too close
38,40.83,,for comfort.
40.9,43.59,,Not that slaying
40.9,43.59,,"is ever comfy, but..."
43.67,45.43,,you know what I mean?
45.5,47.33,,If you guys hadn't
45.5,47.33,,been here to help...
47.41,48.34,,Willow: But we were.
48.41,51.47,,"And we did,"
48.41,51.47,,and we're all fine.
51.54,53.13,,Isn't he gonna go poof?
53.21,56.11,,"Uh, I guess these guys don't."
56.18,58.21,,We'll have to bury him
56.18,58.21,,or something.
58.28,59.21,,Ooh...
59.28,61.41,,"makes you appreciate vamps,"
59.28,61.41,,though.
61.49,62.51,,"No fuss, no muss."
62.59,64.28,,So how come Faith
62.59,64.28,,was a noshow?
64.36,66.98,,I thought mucusy demons
64.36,66.98,,were her favorites.
67.06,69.89,,Couldn't reach her... again.
69.96,71.79,,She hasn't been
69.96,71.79,,hanging out much.
71.86,74.52,Xander,I detect worry.
74.6,76.46,Buffy,A little bit.
76.53,79.77,Buffy,Slaying's a rough gig.
76.53,79.77,Buffy,Too much alone time isn't healthy.
79.84,81.83,Buffy,Stuff gets pent up.
81.91,84.57,Willow,We should try to do more
81.91,84.57,Willow,socializing with her.
84.64,86.51,Xander,"Well, burial detail aside..."
86.58,88.31,Xander,does this cap us off
86.58,88.31,Xander,for the day?
88.38,90.47,Buffy,You got plans?
90.55,93.85,Xander,I cannot stress enough
90.55,93.85,Xander,how much I don't have plans.
93.92,95.35,Buffy,No luck reaching Cordelia?
95.42,98.15,Xander,I've left a few messages.
98.22,101.95,Buffy,
102.03,103.86,Xander,But you know
102.03,103.86,Xander,what really bugs me?
103.93,106.06,Xander,"OK, we kissed."
103.93,106.06,Xander,It was a mistake.
106.13,109.07,Xander,But I know that was positively the last
106.13,109.07,Xander,time we were ever gonna kiss.
109.13,110.07,Willow,Darn tootin'.
110.13,111.8,Xander,And they burst in
110.13,111.8,Xander,rescuing us...
111.87,113.2,Xander,without even knocking?
113.27,117.07,Xander,"I mean, this is really"
113.27,117.07,Xander,all their fault.
117.14,119.84,Buffy,Your logic does not
117.14,119.84,Buffy,resemble our Earth logic.
119.91,121.71,Xander,Mine is much
119.91,121.71,Xander,more advanced.
121.78,123.08,Willow,At least tomorrow's Monday...
123.15,124.17,Willow,another school day.
124.25,126.77,Buffy,"Well, that's good."
124.25,126.77,Buffy,"You know, focus on school."
126.85,128.91,Buffy,That's the strong
126.85,128.91,Buffy,Willow way to heal.
128.99,131.11,Willow,"Actually, I was more"
128.99,131.11,Willow,thinking Oz will be there...
131.19,133.12,Willow,and I can beg
131.19,133.12,Willow,for forgiveness.
133.19,135.39,Buffy,"That works, too."
135.46,137.02,Willow,"I want to be strong, Willow."
137.09,138.12,Willow,But then I think...
138.2,140.99,Willow,I may never get to be
138.2,140.99,Willow,close to Oz again...
141.07,144.9,Willow,and it's like all the air
141.07,144.9,Willow,just goes out of the room.
144.97,146.53,Buffy,I know the feeling.
146.6,150.37,Xander,"Right. I mean, you went through it"
146.6,150.37,Xander,"with Angel, and you're still standing."
150.44,153.6,Xander,"So tell us, wise one,"
150.44,153.6,Xander,how do you deal?
153.68,155.41,Buffy,I have you guys.
157.62,157.62,Buffy,
157.62,159.71,Machine,"Hey, it's Xander."
159.78,161.98,Machine,"If you get this, call me."
164.56,167.89,Machine,
164.56,167.89,Machine,Hi. Xander.
167.96,172.36,Machine,"I, uh... Well, I'm in"
167.96,172.36,Machine,if you feel like calling.
172.43,173.79,,Bye.
177.64,181.44,Machine,
177.64,181.44,Machine,"Hi, Cordelia. Um..."
181.51,183.24,Machine,"if you get the chance,"
183.24,185.2,,"if we can talk, I'm here."
188.91,192.85,Machine,
188.91,192.85,Machine,"Hey, again. It's me."
192.92,195.51,Machine,I'm here. Again.
263.62,264.92,Buffy,How's it goin'?
264.99,267.42,Willow,Oz hasn't been
264.99,267.42,Willow,to his locker.
267.49,270.02,Willow,There may be books
267.49,270.02,Willow,in there that he needs...
270.09,272.03,Willow,"but still, he doesn't come."
272.1,273.15,Buffy,Has Xander seen Cordelia?
273.23,274.53,Willow,I don't think so.
274.6,277.09,Willow,But she is coming in today.
277.17,279.69,Willow,Amy saw her last night
277.17,279.69,Willow,at the mall.
279.77,281.24,Buffy,How was she?
281.31,282.77,Willow,I don't know.
282.84,285.83,Willow,Amy said she looked
282.84,285.83,Willow,pretty... scary.
312.24,313.33,Harmony,Cordelia!
313.4,315.34,Harmony,You look amazing.
317.91,319.77,Harmony,Oh. You have to meet Anya.
319.84,321.28,Harmony,She just moved here...
321.35,323.71,Harmony,and her dad just bought...
321.35,323.71,Harmony,What was it?
323.78,325.48,Harmony,Oh. A utility.
325.55,327.41,Harmony,Or something.
327.48,329.11,Anya,Nice bag. Prada?
329.19,330.59,Cordelia,Good call.
330.65,334.11,Cordelia,Most people around here
330.65,334.11,Cordelia,can't tell Prada from Payless.
334.19,336.18,Harmony,"God, Cordy!"
334.19,336.18,Harmony,When I heard about...
336.26,337.59,Harmony,"Well, I mean,"
336.26,337.59,Harmony,I couldn't believe it.
337.66,340.69,Harmony,"But it was smart,"
337.66,340.69,Harmony,"you know, the injury thing?"
340.76,342.46,Harmony,You take a week off...
342.53,344.33,Harmony,let everybody forget
342.53,344.33,Harmony,about the temporary insanity...
344.4,345.63,Harmony,that was Xander Harris.
345.7,347.53,Cordelia,Xander who?
347.6,348.97,Harmony,Oh!
350.54,352.51,Cordette,You know what
350.54,352.51,Cordette,you have to do.
352.58,356.02,Cordette,Start dating.
354.08,355.54,Cordette,Get back on the horse.
355.61,356.54,Cordelia,"Oh, absolutely!"
356.61,358.95,Cordelia,I am ready to ride!
359.02,362.21,Harmony,Then I have just the stallion.
359.02,362.21,Harmony,He's so you.
366.19,367.18,Harmony,
373.4,374.33,Harmony,
374.4,377.06,Harmony,I'm pretty sure
374.4,377.06,Harmony,he won't cheat on you.
377.13,379.03,Harmony,At least not for a while.
379.1,382.23,Harmony,"Plus, he's got a kill moped."
399.92,402.45,Willow,Oz. Wow.
402.53,404.65,Willow,"Look at us,"
402.53,404.65,Willow,running into each other...
404.73,407.2,Willow,as two people who go
404.73,407.2,Willow,to the same school...
407.26,410.89,Willow,are so likely to do
407.26,410.89,Willow,now and then.
410.97,411.9,Oz,Hey.
413.54,415.84,Willow,"Oz, wait. Please?"
415.91,417.24,Willow,What I did...
417.31,419.9,Willow,When I think that
417.31,419.9,Willow,I hurt you...
419.98,423.21,Oz,Yeah. You said all
419.98,423.21,Oz,this stuff already.
423.28,426.68,Willow,"Right, but... I want"
423.28,426.68,Willow,to make it up to you.
426.75,431.08,Willow,"I mean, if you let me,"
426.75,431.08,Willow,I want to try.
431.15,432.71,Oz,Just...
434.69,436.63,Oz,You can leave me alone.
438.46,440.26,Oz,I need to figure things out.
440.33,443.09,Willow,But maybe if we talk
440.33,443.09,Willow,"about it, we could..."
443.17,445.43,Oz,Look...
445.5,448.27,Oz,I'm sorry this is hard for you.
448.34,450.33,Oz,But I told you what I need.
450.41,451.72,Cordelia,So I can't help feeling
451.72,453.71,Oz,like the reason you want to talk...
453.78,457.21,Oz,is so you can feel
453.78,457.21,Oz,better about yourself.
457.28,458.87,Oz,That's not my problem.
483.64,485.47,Cordelia,"Hey, John Lee."
485.54,488.94,Cordelia,Do I have something
485.54,488.94,Cordelia,caught in my teeth?
503.33,505.85,Cordelia,So... what's new?
505.93,509.19,Cordelia,"God, it's been, like,"
505.93,509.19,Cordelia,a gazillion years.
509.27,511.39,John Lee,"Look, the guys are kinda"
509.27,511.39,John Lee,down on me lately.
511.47,513.49,John Lee,Coach just cut me back
511.47,513.49,John Lee,to second string.
513.57,517.02,John Lee,If anyone saw me hanging...
515.07,518.06,John Lee,with Xander Harris's
515.07,518.06,John Lee,castoff on top of that...
518.14,520.23,John Lee,"death, you know, but..."
520.31,524.8,John Lee,maybe... if you want to
520.31,524.8,John Lee,go someplace private...
526.08,527.38,Cordelia,What?
527.45,528.88,John Lee,Think about it.
534.42,535.69,Anya,Hey.
535.76,538.99,Cordelia,"Go ahead, dazzle me with"
535.76,538.99,Cordelia,your ohsobrilliant insults.
539.06,540.53,Cordelia,Just join the club.
540.6,541.66,Cordelia,"Hardly. Actually,"
541.66,543.29,Anya,I've been looking for you.
543.37,545.53,Anya,"Ever since we met this morning,"
543.37,545.53,Anya,"I was, like..."
545.6,547.73,Anya,thank God there's one other
545.6,547.73,Anya,person in this town
547.8,549.74,Anya,who actually reads W.
549.81,550.74,Cordelia,But Harmony...
550.81,552.4,Anya,"Oh, she follows me around."
552.48,556.81,Anya,"If that girl had an original thought,"
552.48,556.81,Anya,her head would explode.
556.88,558.31,Cordelia,Is that Gucci?
558.38,560.75,Anya,Um... no.
560.82,563.88,Anya,"It's an actual old thing,"
560.82,563.88,Anya,"sort of a, um..."
563.95,565.58,Anya,goodluck charm
563.95,565.58,Anya,my dad gave me.
565.66,569.32,Cordelia,Too bad I didn't have
565.66,569.32,Cordelia,one of those preXander.
569.39,572.85,Anya,Can I just say... men.
572.93,574.12,Cordelia,Second it.
574.2,575.53,Anya,Apart from being
574.2,575.53,Anya,without class...
575.6,577.03,Anya,the guy's obviously blind.
577.1,578.93,Anya,Deserves whatever he gets.
581.02,580.94,Cordelia,I'm not even
581.02,580.94,Cordelia,thinking about him.
583.02,584.63,Cordelia,I am past it.
583.02,584.63,Cordelia,I am living my life.
584.71,587.44,Anya,"Still, I mean..."
584.71,587.44,Anya,Don't you kinda wish...
587.51,589.41,Cordelia,I don't wish. I act.
589.48,591.95,Cordelia,"Starting now,"
589.48,591.95,Cordelia,Xander Harris is gonna get...
592.02,594.75,Cordelia,a bellyful of just
592.02,594.75,Cordelia,how over him I am.
594.82,597.48,Anya,
600.09,605.02,Anya,
609.98,614.02,Xander,Excuse me.
612.08,614.17,Xander,I need to be both giving
612.08,614.17,Xander,and receiving of mirth.
614.25,617.15,Buffy,Is it too much to ask
614.25,617.15,Buffy,for a little backup?
617.22,618.77,Buffy,"I'm here for you, Xand."
618.85,620.08,Buffy,I'm supportogal.
620.15,620.91,Buffy,I just...
620.91,622.78,Willow,feel a little weird...
622.85,625.52,Willow,about this
622.85,625.52,Willow,usagainstCordelia thing.
625.59,626.89,Willow,She's had a rough time.
628.86,633.02,Willow,It's true. Cordelia belongs
628.86,633.02,Willow,to the justified camp.
633.1,635.26,Willow,She should make us pay.
635.33,637.46,Xander,And pay and pay and pay...
637.54,638.45,Willow,"In fact, there's just not"
638.45,639.37,Xander,enough pay for what we...
639.44,642.9,Xander,"Look, you want to do"
639.44,642.9,Xander,"guiltapalooza, fine..."
642.97,644.17,Xander,but I'm done with that.
644.24,645.68,Xander,Starting this minute...
645.74,648.44,Xander,I'm gonna grab ahold of
645.74,648.44,Xander,that crazy little thing called life...
648.51,650.45,Xander,and let it do
648.51,650.45,Xander,its magical little healie thing.
650.52,652.68,Xander,What's done is done.
652.75,654.62,Xander,Let's be in the moment.
654.69,656.92,Xander,Behold the beauty
654.69,656.92,Xander,that is now.
656.99,658.48,Xander,Who's with me?
659.99,661.39,Buffy,He's actually making sense.
661.46,664.19,Buffy,We're young and free
661.46,664.19,Buffy,in America.
664.26,667.53,Buffy,How dare we be spun by love
664.26,667.53,Buffy,or the lack of same?
667.6,668.9,Willow,Absolutely.
668.97,670.9,Willow,IIt's selfindulgent.
670.97,672.23,Willow,II'm in.
672.3,674.77,Willow,I'm on the joy train.
681.71,683.81,Buffy,That didn't work.
681.71,683.81,Buffy,Who wants chocolate?
683.88,684.85,Buffy,I'm up.
687.72,689.15,Xander,Look at her.
689.22,691.88,Xander,"Tears of a clown, baby."
691.96,695.29,Xander,Or is it...
691.96,695.29,Xander,grins of a sad person?
695.36,696.29,Xander,Or maybe it's...
696.36,697.29,Willow,"Xander, your hand."
697.36,698.33,Xander,Oops! Sorry.
698.4,699.83,Xander,But why oops?
699.9,702.06,Xander,"I mean, we always touch digits."
702.13,703.4,Xander,It's a friend thing.
703.47,705.77,Xander,"Comfort, like chocolate."
705.84,709.8,Willow,"Maybe it used to be,"
705.84,709.8,Willow,but since we...
709.87,710.81,Willow,It's different.
712.84,714.24,Buffy,II'm sorry.
714.31,716.12,Willow,But if I want to make things
716.12,717.15,Buffy,right with Oz...
717.22,718.48,Buffy,"my hands,"
718.48,721.41,Willow,my... all my stuff...
721.49,723.65,Buffy,has to be for him only.
755.35,757.18,Buffy,"Hey, Cordelia, wait a second."
759.09,761.56,Cordelia,Did Xander send you
759.09,761.56,Cordelia,to beg for him?
761.63,762.82,Cordelia,Because if he did...
762.89,766.33,Buffy,"No. I'm a free agent,"
762.89,766.33,Buffy,I promise.
766.4,768.83,Buffy,I just wanted
766.4,768.83,Buffy,to see how you are.
768.9,771.43,Cordelia,Never been better.
771.5,773.77,Buffy,"Cordelia, I know what it's like"
771.5,773.77,Buffy,to be hurt by someone.
773.84,777.24,Buffy,Hurt so much that you don't think
773.84,777.24,Buffy,you're gonna make it.
777.31,780.74,Buffy,"But I told my friends how I felt,"
777.31,780.74,Buffy,and you know what?
780.81,783.08,Buffy,I got a little better.
783.15,784.58,Buffy,
794.33,796.26,Buffy,"Cordelia, look..."
796.33,797.26,Buffy,out.
830.66,834.89,Cordelia,You know what I've been
830.66,834.89,Cordelia,asking myself a lot this last week?
834.97,835.9,Cordelia,Why me?
835.97,838.3,Cordelia,Why do I get impaled?
838.37,840.36,Cordelia,Why do I get bitten
838.37,840.36,Cordelia,by snakes?
840.44,842.93,Cordelia,Why do I fall
840.44,842.93,Cordelia,for incredible losers?
845.02,846.31,Cordelia,"And you know,"
845.02,846.31,Cordelia,I think I finally figured it out...
846.38,848.64,Cordelia,what my problem is.
846.38,848.64,Cordelia,It's...
848.71,851.48,Cordelia,Buffy Summers. That's when
848.71,851.48,Cordelia,all my troubles started.
851.55,852.98,Cordelia,When she moved here.
853.05,854.48,Anya,Are you OK?
854.55,856.99,Cordelia,"Oh, I just pulled"
854.55,856.99,Cordelia,some stitches last night.
857.06,858.82,Cordelia,Know why?
858.89,860.62,Cordelia,Surprise.
858.89,860.62,Cordelia,It was Buffy's fault.
860.69,863.82,Harmony,"Oh, hey, it's garbage girl."
860.69,863.82,Harmony,"Loved the look last night, Cor."
863.9,865.41,Harmony,Dumpster chic
865.41,867.16,Anya,for the dumped.
872.34,873.57,Anya,Here.
873.64,877.54,Anya,I think you need this
873.64,877.54,Anya,more than I do right now.
877.61,880.44,Cordelia,"Yeah, I can use some luck."
880.51,883.34,Cordelia,"And a stick with pointy,"
880.51,883.34,Cordelia,sharp bits.
883.41,885.64,Cordelia,If that Buffy wasn't...
883.41,885.64,Cordelia,I swear...
885.72,887.62,Cordelia,She's a pain.
887.69,892.02,Anya,"But Xander,"
887.69,892.02,Anya,he's an utter loser.
892.09,893.06,Anya,Don't you wish...
893.12,894.03,Anya,I never would have
894.03,895.29,Cordelia,looked twice at Xander...
895.36,897.29,Cordelia,if Buffy hadn't made him
895.36,897.29,Cordelia,marginally cooler...
897.36,898.42,Cordelia,by hanging with him.
898.5,899.43,Anya,Really?
899.5,900.76,Cordelia,"Yeah, I swear."
900.83,904,Cordelia,I wish Buffy Summers
900.83,904,Cordelia,had never come to Sunnydale.
905.84,906.86,Cordelia,
906.94,907.87,Anyanka,Done.
920.22,921.21,Cordelia,Anya?
928.96,932.83,Cordelia,I wish Buffy Summers
928.96,932.83,Cordelia,had never come to Sunnydale.
935.73,939.19,Harmony,"She was, like..."
935.73,939.19,Harmony,a good fairy.
939.27,942.5,Harmony,"A scary, veiny..."
942.57,944.13,Harmony,good fairy.
945.64,946.7,Harmony,Ha ha!
960.75,963.41,Harmony,Where have you been?!
963.49,966.11,Harmony,Ted Chervin just totally
963.49,966.11,Harmony,went for third with Ginger...
966.19,968.71,Harmony,in front of everybody.
968.79,971.76,Cordette,Love the dress.
968.79,971.76,Cordette,It's so daring.
971.83,973.29,John Lee,John Lee: Cordelia.
973.36,975.63,Cordelia,Yeah?
975.7,978.43,John Lee,"Look, every guy on campus"
975.7,978.43,John Lee,has probably asked...
978.5,981.53,John Lee,but if you're not going
978.5,981.53,John Lee,to the winter brunch with anyone...
981.6,984.1,John Lee,"I'd be honored,"
981.6,984.1,John Lee,and we'd have fun.
985.41,987.38,Cordelia,I'll get back to you.
987.44,988.38,John Lee,Really?
988.44,989.38,Cordelia,Yeah.
989.45,990.64,John Lee,Great.
994.32,996.68,Harmony,"Cordy, you reign."
996.75,997.68,Cordelia,I do?
997.75,999.81,Cordelia,"I mean, I do."
999.89,1003.32,Cordelia,So what's with
999.89,1003.32,Cordelia,the winter brunch thing?
1003.39,1005.09,Cordelia,
1005.16,1007.09,Teacher,"All right. Now, don't forget..."
1007.16,1009.6,Teacher,"tomorrow we have our, uh,"
1007.16,1009.6,Teacher,monthly memorial...
1009.67,1011.76,Teacher,"so, uh, there's no class."
1013.87,1015.8,Cordelia,Cordelia: What's the rush?
1015.87,1018.43,Harmony,"Oh, you know, my mom"
1015.87,1018.43,Harmony,hates it when I'm late.
1018.51,1019.44,Cordelia,Since when?
1019.51,1022.2,Cordelia,Aren't we going out tonight?
1022.28,1024.25,Cordette,Girl: Curfew starts
1022.28,1024.25,Cordette,in an hour.
1024.31,1025.25,Cordette,Curfew?
1025.31,1027.11,Cordelia,"Come on, I'm in"
1025.31,1027.11,Cordelia,a really good mood.
1027.18,1029.58,Cordelia,Let's go to The Bronze.
1029.65,1031.62,Harmony,Is that a joke?
1031.69,1034.75,Cordelia,Oh! The Bronze isn't cool
1031.69,1034.75,Cordelia,in this reality.
1034.82,1038.82,Cordelia,I've got to make these
1034.82,1038.82,Cordelia,little adjustments.
1038.89,1040.92,Harmony,Cordy... what's with you?
1041,1044.3,Harmony,"I mean, you wear this"
1041,1044.3,Harmony,comebiteme outfit...
1044.37,1046.56,Harmony,you make jokes
1044.37,1046.56,Harmony,about The Bronze...
1046.64,1049.04,Harmony,and you're acting
1046.64,1049.04,Harmony,a little schizo.
1049.1,1050.07,Cordelia,You're right.
1050.14,1053.07,Cordelia,"I just... Well, I bumped"
1050.14,1053.07,Cordelia,my head yesterday...
1053.14,1055.84,Cordelia,and I keep forgetting stuff.
1055.91,1058.68,Cordelia,"Not that I care, but Xander Harris,"
1055.91,1058.68,Cordelia,"he's miserable, right?"
1058.75,1060.98,Cordelia,And that Willow freak
1058.75,1060.98,Cordelia,he hangs with...
1061.05,1063.45,Cordelia,not even a blip on
1061.05,1063.45,Cordelia,"the radar screen, right?"
1063.52,1065.61,Harmony,Well... yeah.
1065.69,1066.62,Harmony,They're dead.
1083.51,1085.03,Cordelia,OK.
1085.11,1087.08,Cordelia,Not funny.
1087.14,1089.47,Cordelia,You. Where did you
1087.14,1089.47,Cordelia,put my car?
1089.55,1091.1,Janitor,Pardon?
1091.18,1092.11,Cordelia,My auto!
1092.18,1094.78,Cordelia,El convertablo?
1094.85,1097.48,Janitor,You students aren't allowed
1094.85,1097.48,Janitor,"to drive, and you know it."
1097.55,1098,Cordelia,What?!
1098,1099.21,Janitor,"Go on now, miss."
1099.29,1101.48,Janitor,You better get in
1099.29,1101.48,Janitor,before the sun sets.
1118.44,1119.6,Cordelia,
1135.79,1136.72,Cordelia,
1136.79,1139.42,Xander,"Well, what do ya know?"
1139.5,1141.29,Xander,Cordelia Chase.
1141.36,1144.16,Cordelia,"What is this,"
1141.36,1144.16,Cordelia,some kind of sick joke?
1144.23,1145.89,Cordelia,Harmony told me
1144.23,1145.89,Cordelia,you were dead.
1145.97,1149.03,Xander,"Now, why would she"
1145.97,1149.03,Xander,say something like that?
1149.1,1150.09,Xander,Let's think.
1151.87,1154.54,Cordelia,Listen to me.
1151.87,1154.54,Cordelia,We have to find Buffy.
1154.61,1156.24,Cordelia,She'll figure out
1154.61,1156.24,Cordelia,a way to save us.
1156.31,1157.87,Cordelia,She was supposed
1156.31,1157.87,Cordelia,to be here...
1157.95,1160.74,Cordelia,and as much as it
1157.95,1160.74,Cordelia,kills me to admit it...
1160.82,1162.61,Cordelia,things were better
1160.82,1162.61,Cordelia,when she was around.
1162.68,1164.41,Xander,Buffy?
1164.49,1165.42,Xander,The slayer?
1165.49,1168.35,Cordelia,No! Buffy
1165.49,1168.35,Cordelia,the dogfaced girl!
1168.42,1170.92,Cordelia,Duh! Who do you think
1168.42,1170.92,Cordelia,I'm talking about?
1170.99,1172.22,Willow,Willow: Bored now.
1176.87,1179.3,Willow,This is the part
1176.87,1179.3,Willow,that's less fun.
1179.37,1183.46,Willow,When there isn't
1179.37,1183.46,Willow,any screaming.
1183.54,1185.97,Cordelia,What's up with you two
1183.54,1185.97,Cordelia,and the leather?
1186.04,1187.7,Willow,Play now?
1189.18,1192.34,Xander,It's not that I don't appreciate
1189.18,1192.34,Xander,"your appetite, Wil..."
1192.41,1194.78,Xander,but I thought we agreed
1192.41,1194.78,Xander,it was my turn.
1194.85,1196.32,Cordelia,No. No!
1196.39,1197.94,Cordelia,No way!
1198.02,1199.95,Cordelia,I wish us into Bizarro Land...
1200.02,1202.18,Cordelia,and you guys
1200.02,1202.18,Cordelia,are still together?!
1203.83,1205.95,Cordelia,I cannot win!
1206.03,1207.59,Xander,Probably not.
1209.73,1211.46,Xander,But I'll give you
1209.73,1211.46,Xander,a head start.
1211.53,1214.26,Cordelia,No!
1214.34,1216.86,Willow,I love this part.
1224.45,1226.38,Xander,You love all the parts.
1236.79,1237.72,Willow,No fun.
1237.79,1240.02,Willow,She didn't even
1237.79,1240.02,Willow,hardly fight.
1240.1,1241.93,Xander,
1242,1244.52,Xander,"Aw, swell."
1242,1244.52,Xander,It's the white hats.
1250.54,1253.24,Giles,I've got them!
1250.54,1253.24,Giles,Get the girl!
1267.09,1269.08,Oz,Oz: How's she doing?
1269.16,1270.65,Giles,Her pulse is strong.
1270.73,1272.82,Nancy,What was she doing
1270.73,1272.82,Nancy,wearing that?
1272.9,1275.59,Nancy,Everyone knows that vampires
1272.9,1275.59,Nancy,are attracted to bright colors.
1275.66,1278.57,Larry,That's Cordelia. It's better
1275.66,1278.57,Larry,to look good than to feel alive.
1278.63,1281.97,Giles,"Uh, go and watch"
1278.63,1281.97,Giles,the perimeters...
1282.04,1283.47,Giles,in case they follow.
1286.21,1289.7,Larry,
1311.4,1315.06,Larry,
1317.61,1319.8,Xander,"Man: Oh, my God!"
1325.71,1328.11,Xander,"Slap my hand,"
1325.71,1328.11,Xander,dead soul man.
1336.69,1337.81,Master,Ahh.
1337.94,1341.11,Master,Xander. Willow.
1341.18,1343.51,Master,Hungry?
1343.58,1345.64,Master,I've lost my appetite
1343.58,1345.64,Master,for this one.
1345.72,1348.24,Master,She keeps looking at me.
1348.32,1352.09,Master,"I'm trying to eat,"
1348.32,1352.09,Master,and she looks at me.
1352.16,1353.82,Master,Go on!
1363.34,1366.86,Master,I remember that lust
1363.34,1366.86,Master,for the kill.
1368.37,1371.71,Master,Now... what news
1368.37,1371.71,Master,on the Rialto?
1371.78,1373.44,Xander,Had a prime kill.
1373.51,1378.02,Xander,"Old crush, actually..."
1376.08,1378.71,Xander,till that wannaslay
1376.08,1378.71,Xander,librarian showed up.
1378.78,1381.31,Master,He'll be dealt with
1378.78,1381.31,Master,soon enough.
1381.39,1382.32,Xander,Weird thing.
1382.39,1385.32,Xander,Girl kept talking
1382.39,1385.32,Xander,about Buffy.
1385.39,1387.36,Xander,Gotta get Buffy here."
1387.43,1390.19,Xander,Isn't that what
1387.43,1390.19,Xander,they called the slayer?
1390.26,1391.19,Willow,Hmm.
1391.26,1394.29,Willow,Buffy. Ooh. Scary.
1394.37,1396.36,Xander,Someone has to talk
1394.37,1396.36,Xander,to her people.
1396.44,1399.73,Xander,That name is striking fear
1396.44,1399.73,Xander,in nobody's hearts.
1399.81,1402.07,Master,She talked of summoning
1399.81,1402.07,Master,a slayer here...
1402.14,1404.58,Master,"now, at this time..."
1404.64,1406.13,Master,and you didn't kill her?
1406.21,1407.74,Willow,"Well, they had crosses."
1407.81,1411.58,Master,The plant begins operation
1407.81,1411.58,Master,in less than 24 hours.
1412.95,1416.08,Master,You will find this girl.
1416.16,1421.35,Master,You will kill her before
1416.16,1421.35,Master,she contacts the slayer...
1421.43,1424.66,Master,or I'll see you two
1421.43,1424.66,Master,kissing daylight.
1427.2,1428.67,Master,
1430.97,1431.96,Giles,Hey! Hey...
1432.04,1433.97,Cordelia,Giles!
1432.04,1433.97,Cordelia,It's all my fault!
1434.04,1436.1,Cordelia,I wasn't... I made
1434.04,1436.1,Cordelia,this stupid wish...
1436.18,1437.4,Giles,Come on.
1436.18,1437.4,Giles,Please lie...
1437.48,1439.6,Cordelia,No! You have to get Buffy.
1439.68,1441.11,Cordelia,Buffy changes it.
1441.18,1442.77,Cordelia,It wasn't like this.
1441.18,1442.77,Cordelia,It was better.
1442.85,1444.71,Cordelia,"I mean,"
1442.85,1444.71,Cordelia,the clothes alone...
1444.78,1446.58,Giles,But people were happy.
1446.65,1447.58,Giles,Mostly.
1447.65,1449.68,Giles,And...
1449.76,1451.81,Giles,Wait.
1451.89,1454.55,Giles,Why are you here
1451.89,1454.55,Giles,and she's not?
1454.63,1457.6,Giles,"I mean, you... you"
1454.63,1457.6,Giles,were her watcher.
1457.66,1459.65,Giles,HHow do you know
1457.66,1459.65,Giles,I was a watcher?
1459.73,1462.36,Giles,I've never...
1459.73,1462.36,Giles,
1463.87,1465,Cordelia,What?
1466.31,1467.24,Cordelia,What?
1467.31,1468.74,Giles,I thought I heard
1467.31,1468.74,Giles,something.
1471.91,1474.35,Giles,"Now, I want you"
1471.91,1474.35,Giles,to start again...
1474.41,1477.25,Giles,and explain everything
1474.41,1477.25,Giles,very carefully.
1477.32,1480.05,Willow,You're in a big cage.
1480.12,1482.35,Xander,"Not too bright,"
1480.12,1482.35,Xander,book guy.
1485.86,1487.12,Xander,
1487.19,1489.06,Xander,"So you're a watcher, huh?"
1492.67,1493.89,Xander,Watch this.
1539.45,1541.04,Larry,They hit us right outside.
1541.11,1542.58,Giles,Nancy?
1542.65,1544.14,Oz,She's dead.
1546.19,1549.78,Giles,Um... would you mind...
1549.86,1551.88,Giles,Could you take her
1549.86,1551.88,Giles,to the incinerator?
1551.96,1553.89,Giles,I have some business to...
1565.37,1566.63,Giles,Wait a moment.
1586.56,1588.12,Xander,The deed is done.
1588.19,1590.32,Master,You killed the girl
1588.19,1590.32,Master,who sought the slayer?
1590.4,1591.83,Xander,It was too easy.
1591.9,1593.49,Willow,I felt cheap.
1593.57,1594.86,Master,Excellent.
1594.93,1598.43,Master,The opening will commence
1594.93,1598.43,Master,as scheduled.
1598.5,1601.5,Willow,So... you're pleased?
1601.57,1603.4,Master,Ecstatic.
1603.48,1606.77,Willow,Then... can I play
1603.48,1606.77,Willow,with the puppy?
1608.15,1610.12,Master,Be my guest.
1617.59,1620.85,Giles,"Yes, I understand, but it's"
1617.59,1620.85,Giles,imperative that I see her.
1620.93,1623.49,Giles,Here.
1623.56,1626.36,Giles,Well... when will you?
1626.43,1628.16,Giles,"Yeah, well,"
1626.43,1628.16,Giles,you are her watcher.
1628.23,1630.46,Giles,I'd expect her to at least
1628.23,1630.46,Giles,check in to...
1630.54,1632.66,Giles,"Yes, I'm aware that"
1630.54,1632.66,Giles,there's a great deal
1632.74,1634.9,Giles,of demonic activity
1632.74,1634.9,Giles,in Cleveland.
1634.97,1636.62,Giles,"It... Well, it happens,"
1636.62,1637.41,Willow,you know...
1637.48,1640.64,Willow,that... that Sunnydale
1637.48,1640.64,Willow,is on a hellmouth.
1640.71,1643.55,Willow,It... It is so.
1643.62,1645.52,Willow,Well... Just...
1645.58,1647.35,Willow,Just give her the message...
1647.42,1649.35,Willow,if you ever see her again.
1662.65,1664.27,Willow,Willow: Bored now.
1667.99,1670.96,Willow,Daytime is the worst.
1671.02,1673.58,Willow,Cooped up for hours.
1673.66,1675.22,Willow,Can't hunt.
1683.2,1685.9,Willow,But the Master said
1683.2,1685.9,Willow,I could play.
1688.81,1691.11,Willow,"Isn't that fun, puppy?"
1695.58,1697.34,Willow,Aw...
1697.42,1700.68,Willow,Puppy's being all quiet.
1700.75,1703.48,Willow,Come on.
1700.75,1703.48,Willow,Don't be a spoilsport.
1703.56,1705.35,Willow,
1708.79,1710.85,Willow,Guess what today is.
1712.86,1715.09,Willow,Today the plant opens.
1715.17,1716.83,Willow,It's a big party.
1716.9,1719.37,Willow,
1719.44,1723.46,Willow,You remember I told you
1719.44,1723.46,Willow,about the plant.
1723.54,1726.91,Willow,All those people
1723.54,1726.91,Willow,you tried to save?
1726.98,1729.74,Willow,It's gonna
1726.98,1729.74,Willow,be quick for them.
1729.81,1731.48,Willow,"Not for you, though."
1733.15,1736.05,Willow,It's gonna be slow for you.
1737.72,1740.28,Willow,"That's right, puppy..."
1740.36,1743.05,Willow,Willow's gonna make you bark.
1743.13,1744.6,Willow,Aah!
1744.66,1746.53,Willow,Oh...
1747.73,1751.33,Willow,Maybe I went too hard
1747.73,1751.33,Willow,on you last time.
1755.64,1756.73,Willow,Aah!
1756.81,1757.74,Willow,Ohh!
1757.81,1759.21,Willow,Too hard?
1759.28,1761.21,Xander,No such thing.
1761.28,1764.21,Willow,Watch it with those things.
1761.28,1764.21,Willow,You almost got my hair.
1764.28,1765.48,Xander,Sorry.
1765.55,1766.98,Xander,Got carried away.
1768.35,1769.88,Willow,Don't you want to?
1769.96,1772.22,Xander,"No, thanks, baby."
1772.29,1774.92,,I just want
1772.29,1774.92,,to watch you go.
1779.46,1780.67,Willow,
1780.67,1781.69,Willow,
1781.77,1783.2,Giles,Here it is!
1783.27,1785.7,Giles,I found it.
1785.77,1787.4,Giles,Look.
1787.47,1789.91,Giles,"It's what, um,"
1787.47,1789.91,Giles,Cordelia was wearing.
1789.98,1791.2,Giles,"It's the... the, uh..."
1791.28,1794.71,Giles,symbol of... of Anyanka.
1794.78,1796.87,Oz,I don't think I know her.
1796.95,1799.38,Giles,"Well, no. Um, um,"
1796.95,1799.38,Giles,Anyanka...
1799.45,1805.02,Giles,is sort of a patron saint
1799.45,1805.02,Giles,of scorned women.
1803.09,1804.49,Larry,What does she do?
1806.16,1808.06,Giles,"Uh, she grants wishes."
1808.13,1810.29,Oz,So Cordelia wished
1808.13,1810.29,Oz,for something?
1810.36,1811.59,Oz,"Well, if it was"
1810.36,1811.59,Oz,"a long, healthy life..."
1811.66,1812.82,Oz,she should get
1811.66,1812.82,Oz,her money back.
1812.9,1815.76,Giles,She said something about
1812.9,1815.76,Giles,everything being different...
1815.83,1817.68,Larry,that the... world wasn't
1817.68,1819.6,Giles,supposed to be like this.
1819.67,1822.66,Larry,"It was, um, better."
1822.74,1824.11,Giles,Before.
1824.18,1828.98,Larry,OK. The entire world sucks because
1824.18,1828.98,Larry,some dead ditz made a wish?
1830.35,1832.28,Larry,I just want it clear.
1832.35,1834.08,Giles,"She said the, uh..."
1834.15,1837.28,Giles,the slayer was supposed
1834.15,1837.28,Giles,to be here...
1837.36,1840.19,Giles,was meant
1837.36,1840.19,Giles,to have been here already.
1840.26,1842.52,Oz,Certainly would
1840.26,1842.52,Oz,have helped.
1842.59,1844.93,Giles,"Yes. I tried calling her,"
1842.59,1844.93,Giles,"but, um..."
1845,1847.69,Giles,"Look, I'm gonna have to..."
1847.77,1850.26,Giles,research this Anyanka
1847.77,1850.26,Giles,thing further.
1850.34,1853.1,Giles,"Um, I have some more..."
1853.17,1855.14,Giles,volumes at home.
1855.21,1857.04,Giles,You two get some sleep.
1857.11,1858.41,Oz,Watch your back.
1876.63,1879.43,Oz,Woman: No!
1876.63,1879.43,Oz,
1879.5,1882.49,Oz,Get up there!
1879.5,1882.49,Oz,
1886.37,1887.3,Oz,Hey!
1889.97,1891,Giles,Run!
1917.47,1919.13,Giles,Buffy Summers?
1919.2,1920.14,Buffy,That's right.
1922.11,1927.02,Buffy,Wanna tell me
1922.11,1927.02,Buffy,what I'm doing here?
1936.05,1938.55,Giles,Ah! Ah! Ah!
1938.62,1940.49,Giles,Yes!
1940.56,1942.55,Buffy,Here. "In order
1940.56,1942.55,Buffy,to defeat Anyanka...
1942.63,1944.69,Buffy,one must destroy
1942.63,1944.69,Buffy,her power center.
1944.76,1946.75,Buffy,This should reverse
1944.76,1946.75,Buffy,all the wishes she's granted...
1946.83,1948.86,Buffy,rendering her mortal
1946.83,1948.86,Buffy,and powerless again."
1948.93,1951.13,Buffy,You see? Without
1948.93,1951.13,Buffy,her power center...
1951.2,1953,Buffy,she'd just be
1951.2,1953,Buffy,an ordinary woman again.
1953.07,1955.44,Buffy,"And all this would be, um..."
1955.51,1956.77,Buffy,"well, different."
1958.64,1961.27,Buffy,"Well, I'd say that"
1958.64,1961.27,Buffy,my watcher muscles...
1961.35,1964.37,Buffy,haven't completely
1961.35,1964.37,Buffy,atrophied after all.
1964.45,1966.54,Buffy,Great.
1966.62,1968.05,Buffy,What's her power center?
1968.12,1970.75,Giles,"Um, well, um... um..."
1972.39,1974.26,Giles,It doesn't say.
1974.33,1976.71,Buffy,Why don't I just put
1974.33,1976.71,Buffy,a stake through her heart?
1976.84,1978.67,Giles,She's not a vampire.
1978.74,1981.11,Buffy,"Well, you'd be surprised"
1978.74,1981.11,Buffy,how many things that'll kill.
1981.18,1982.74,Giles,"I don't want to kill her,"
1981.18,1982.74,Giles,Miss Summers.
1982.81,1985.75,Giles,I want to reverse
1982.81,1985.75,Giles,whatever effect...
1985.82,1988.08,Giles,she's had on this... this world.
1988.15,1990.52,Buffy,
1990.59,1992.95,Buffy,You're taking an awful lot
1990.59,1992.95,Buffy,"on faith here, Jeeves."
1993.02,1993.95,Giles,Giles.
1995.26,1996.92,Buffy,Kill the bad fairy...
1996.99,1999.39,Buffy,destroy the bad fairy's
1996.99,1999.39,Buffy,"power center, whatever..."
1999.46,2001.33,Buffy,and all the troubles
1999.46,2001.33,Buffy,go away?
2001.4,2002.99,Giles,"Well, I'm sure"
2001.4,2002.99,Giles,"it's not that simple, but..."
2003.07,2004.62,Buffy,World is what it is.
2004.7,2006.79,Buffy,We fight. We die.
2006.87,2009,Buffy,Wishing doesn't change that.
2009.07,2011.2,Giles,I have to believe
2009.07,2011.2,Giles,in a better world.
2011.27,2012.4,Buffy,Go ahead.
2012.48,2015.6,Buffy,I have to live in this one.
2015.68,2019.64,Giles,Cordelia said she knew that
2015.68,2019.64,Giles,I was meant to be your watcher.
2019.72,2021.18,Giles,She said she knew you.
2021.25,2023.98,Buffy,She's probably
2021.25,2023.98,Buffy,just a big fan.
2024.05,2027.61,Giles,The Master sent his most
2024.05,2027.61,Giles,vicious disciples to kill her.
2027.69,2030.68,Giles,"Now, she must have posed"
2027.69,2030.68,Giles,some threat to him.
2030.76,2031.78,Buffy,The Master?
2031.86,2034.3,Giles,"Um, supreme vampire"
2031.86,2034.3,Giles,around these parts.
2034.36,2037.16,Giles,He lives on the outskirts
2034.36,2037.16,Giles,of town in an old club.
2037.23,2039.06,Buffy,You know where he lives...
2039.14,2041.19,Buffy,and no one's ever tried
2039.14,2041.19,Buffy,to take him out?
2041.27,2042.9,Giles,People have tried.
2044.27,2045.71,Buffy,"Well, point the way."
2045.78,2048.07,Buffy,I might as well do some good
2045.78,2048.07,Buffy,while I'm in this town.
2048.14,2049.13,Giles,You can't just walk
2048.14,2049.13,Giles,in there and...
2049.21,2051.98,Buffy,"Look, you wanna stay here"
2049.21,2051.98,Buffy,"and play makebelieve, fine."
2052.05,2053.45,Buffy,I'm not gonna be any help
2052.05,2053.45,Buffy,to you anyway.
2053.52,2055.48,Buffy,There's only one thing
2053.52,2055.48,Buffy,I'm good at.
2055.55,2057.75,Giles,At least let's muster
2055.55,2057.75,Giles,some kind of force.
2057.82,2060.45,Buffy,I don't play well
2057.82,2060.45,Buffy,with others.
2060.52,2061.85,Buffy,"Now, I'm gonna"
2060.52,2061.85,Buffy,ask you this once...
2061.92,2063.22,Buffy,and then I'm gonna get testy.
2063.29,2066.13,Giles,
2066.2,2067.59,Buffy,Where is this club?
2105.17,2107.64,Angel,Angel: Buffy.
2107.7,2109.3,Angel,Buffy Summers.
2117.38,2118.78,Angel,It's you.
2118.85,2122.18,Angel,I mean...
2118.85,2122.18,Angel,you don't remember.
2122.25,2123.72,Angel,How could you?
2123.79,2125.41,Buffy,How did you
2123.79,2125.41,Buffy,know my name?
2125.49,2129.12,Angel,I waited.
2129.19,2132.06,Angel,I waited here for you.
2132.13,2135.22,Angel,But you never...
2132.13,2135.22,Angel,I was supposed to help you.
2135.3,2137.23,Angel,
2137.3,2140.06,Buffy,You were gonna help me.
2140.14,2142.5,Angel,The Master rose.
2142.57,2146.41,Angel,He let me live...
2142.57,2146.41,Angel,to punish me.
2146.48,2152.02,Angel,I kept hoping
2146.48,2152.02,Angel,maybe you'd come.
2152.15,2154.08,Angel,My destiny.
2155.95,2158.22,Buffy,Is this a getinmypants thing?
2158.29,2160.95,Buffy,You guys in Sunnydale talk
2158.29,2160.95,Buffy,like I'm the Second Coming.
2161.02,2161.96,Angel,I'm sorry.
2162.02,2162.96,Angel,I just meant...
2163.03,2165.52,Buffy,"Look, I don't have time"
2163.03,2165.52,Buffy,for stories.
2165.6,2167.65,Angel,Where's the Master?
2167.73,2170.63,Angel,They're at his factory.
2170.7,2172.46,Angel,It starts tonight.
2172.54,2174.2,Buffy,Factory?
2174.27,2176.93,Angel,I... 
2174.27,2176.93,Angel,I can take you there.
2194.56,2196.22,Angel,
2196.29,2198.66,Buffy,"Oh, you gotta"
2196.29,2198.66,Buffy,be kidding me!
2198.73,2200.22,Angel,Wait! I won't hurt you.
2200.3,2202.29,Buffy,No. You'll leave that
2200.3,2202.29,Buffy,to your Master.
2202.37,2204.3,Angel,You don't believe
2202.37,2204.3,Angel,I want to help you?
2211.74,2214.11,Angel,Believe I want him dead.
2219.45,2222.41,Angel,The Master: And now behold
2222.41,2225.02,Master,the technical wonder...
2223.09,2226.58,Master,which is about to alter
2223.09,2226.58,Master,the very fabric of our society.
2226.66,2230.59,Master,Some have argued that such an
2226.66,2230.59,Master,advancement goes against our nature.
2230.66,2235.15,Master,They claim that death is our art.
2230.66,2235.15,Master,I say to them...
2235.23,2238.17,Master,"Well, I don't say anything"
2235.23,2238.17,Master,to them because I kill them.
2238.23,2241.6,Master,"Undeniably, we are"
2238.23,2241.6,Master,the world's superior race.
2241.67,2244.23,Master,Yet we have always been
2241.67,2244.23,Master,too parochial...
2244.31,2248.4,Master,too bound by the mindless
2244.31,2248.4,Master,routine of the predator.
2248.48,2252.04,Master,"Hunt and kill, hunt and kill."
2248.48,2252.04,Master,Titillating?
2252.11,2253.05,Master,Yes.
2253.12,2255.74,Master,Practical? Hardly.
2255.82,2259.45,Master,"Meanwhile, the humans,"
2255.82,2259.45,Master,with their plebeian minds...
2259.52,2260.82,"Practical? Hardly. Meanwhile, the humans, with their plebeian minds, have brought us a truly demonic concept",have brought us
2260.82,2263.08,Master,a truly demonic concept...
2263.16,2265.35,"Practical? Hardly. Meanwhile, the humans, with their plebeian minds, have brought us a truly demonic concept",mass production!
2265.43,2267.59,"Practical? Hardly. Meanwhile, the humans, with their plebeian minds, have brought us a truly demonic concept",Vampires: Yeah!
2267.66,2268.93,Vampires,Yeah!
2269,2273.23,Xander,We really are living
2269,2273.23,Xander,in a golden age.
2280.28,2282.73,Xander,O... Anyanka...
2282.73,2285.18,Giles,I beseech thee.
2285.25,2286.77,Giles,Um...
2289.92,2294.12,Giles,In the name
2289.92,2294.12,Giles,of all women scorned...
2294.19,2295.92,Giles,come before me.
2299.46,2300.66,Giles,Oh!
2302,2303.05,Anyanka,Do you have any idea
2302,2303.05,Anyanka,what I do to a man...
2303.05,2304.95,Anyanka,Do you have any idea
2303.05,2304.95,Anyanka,what I do to a man...
2305.02,2307.68,Anyanka,who uses that spell
2305.02,2307.68,Anyanka,to summon me?
2311.06,2312.42,Master,Bring on the first!
2312.49,2313.72,Master,Get back!
2315.59,2317.29,Vampire,You!
2318.53,2319.62,Cordette,Girl: Nooo!
2319.7,2323.33,Cordette,No! Please! No!
2319.7,2323.33,Cordette,Help me!
2323.4,2324.96,Cordette,No!
2325.04,2326.5,Cordette,Noooo!
2326.57,2331.02,,No... Oh!
2331.02,2331.02,Vampire,
2338.72,2340.78,Master,"She's still alive, you see..."
2340.85,2342.28,Master,for the freshness.
2378.39,2381.45,Angel,What's the plan?
2381.53,2383.15,Buffy,Don't fall on this.
2401.85,2404.28,Master,Welcome to the future.
2404.35,2406.15,Master,To the future!
2406.22,2407.45,Master,The future!
2407.52,2408.99,Master,The future!
2418.63,2420.22,Willow,Uhoh. Puppy got out.
2437.21,2439.71,Giles,Cordelia Chase...
