3.32,4.59,GILES,Why didn't your chip go off?
4.68,5.87,BUFFY,We were at the lnitiative...
5.96,7.1,SPIKE,There was a choice.
7.1,9.74,BUFFY,"Right. Either repair the chip, or remove it."
9.84,11.8,GILES,You removed the chip?
11.8,12.27,BUFFY,Yeah.
12.36,15.43,BUFFY,Spike has a soul now. That's what's
12.36,15.43,BUFFY,gonna stop him from hurting people.
15.52,16.17,GILES,Buffy...
16.17,19.35,BUFFY,"He can be a good man, Giles. l feel it."
20.8,22.75,BUFFY,How do you know about slayers?
22.84,25.43,ROBIN,My mother was one.
22.84,25.43,ROBIN,She was killed when l was four.
25.52,27.76,BUFFY,Something got her? A demon...?
27.76,28.51,ROBIN,A vampire.
28.6,30.61,ROBIN,How do you two know each other?
30.61,31.71,BUFFY,He works with me.
31.8,34.07,BUFFY,"You know, in the struggle against evil."
34.16,35.19,ROBIN,He's a vampire.
35.44,38.11,ROBIN,Nice coat. Where'd you get it?
38.11,38.91,SPIKE,New York.

54.8,58.63,SPIKE,"Got the moves, don't you? l wanna ride you"
54.8,58.63,SPIKE,"hard before l put you away, love."
58.72,62.83,NIKKI,You sure about that?
58.72,62.83,NIKKI,You actually look a little wet and limp to me.
62.92,65.48,NIKKI,And l ain't your love.
102.36,104.95,NIKKI,l spent a long time trying to track you down.
105.04,106.74,NIKKI,Don't really want the dance
106.74,108.75,SPIKE,"to end so soon, do you... Nikki?"
108.84,111.91,SPIKE,"The music's just starting, isn't it?"
115.64,117.63,SPIKE,By the way...
119.6,122.16,SPIKE,love the coat.
122.84,124.83,YOUNG ROBIN,Mama!
128.16,132.07,NIKKI,"You did a good job, baby boy."
128.16,132.07,NIKKI,You stayed down just like mama told you.
132.16,133.8,YOUNG ROBIN,Can we go home now?
133.8,136.83,NIKKI,Uhuh. lt's not safe there any more.
136.92,141.55,NIKKI,How about l take you to Crowley's house?
136.92,141.55,NIKKI,You can play with those spooky doodads.
141.64,144.07,YOUNG ROBIN,"No, l wanna stay with you."
146.16,148.15,NIKKI,"Yeah, l know you do, baby."
148.24,150.8,NIKKI,"But remember, Robin honey,"
148.24,150.8,NIKKI,what we talked about.
150.88,153.63,NIKKI,Always gotta work the mission.
154.16,155.99,NIKKI,Look at me.
156.08,160.15,NIKKI,"You know l love you, but l got ajob to do."
160.76,163.43,NIKKI,The mission is what matters. Right?
165.68,168.35,NIKKI,That's my boy. Come on.
177.96,179.11,NIKKI,Robin?
208.12,210.11,BUFFY,Spike!
223.64,225.63,SPIKE,"Little tip, mate."
227.08,229.31,SPIKE,Stake's your friend.
229.4,231.43,SPIKE,Don't be afraid to use it.
232.2,234.07,SPIKE,What?
242.96,245.23,ROBIN,Just waiting for my moment.
299.8,301.79,ROBIN,i></i>
309.04,311.47,BUFFY,Situation still normal.
311.56,314.63,BUFFY,Or as normal as this school ever sees.
315.44,317.03,ROBIN,So it appears.
317.12,320.07,BUFFY,"No fires, no one's head's going kablooey,"
320.16,325.11,BUFFY,and the swing choir and marching band are
320.16,325.11,BUFFY,"back to their normal, seething resentment."
325.2,328.59,ROBIN,"Yeah, it's been pretty quiet"
325.2,328.59,ROBIN,since you shut down that seal.
328.68,331.34,ROBIN,"You just may have stopped this thing, Buffy."
331.34,332.91,BUFFY,"No, it can't be that easy."
333,334.59,ROBIN,You call that easy?
334.68,338.83,BUFFY,"Any apocalypse l avert without dying,"
334.68,338.83,BUFFY,those are the easy ones.
339.68,342.87,BUFFY,"You know, you're something else,"
339.68,342.87,BUFFY,Ms Summers.
342.96,344.66,BUFFY,l've been watching you
344.66,347.75,ROBIN,"when we're out patrolling, and you're..."
347.84,349.91,ROBIN,"You remind me of my, um..."
350.92,352.8,BUFFY,Your mother?
352.8,353.59,ROBIN,Yeah.
353.68,356.14,ROBIN,"What l remember of her, anyway."
356.24,358.51,BUFFY,"Gotta say, not a line every girl likes to hear,"
358.6,361.71,BUFFY,but in this case compliment taken.
361.8,364.71,BUFFY,Maybe you're right.
361.8,364.71,BUFFY,Maybe everything is fine.
364.8,367.91,GILES,Everything's terrible. Total catastrophe.
368,369.13,BUFFY,"Giles, what's wrong?"
369.13,370.83,GILES,Have you seen the new library?
370.92,373.75,GILES,There's nothing but computers.
370.92,373.75,GILES,Not a book to be seen.
373.84,377.23,GILES,"l don't know where to begin, Buffy."
373.84,377.23,GILES,Who do we speak to?
377.32,379.47,ROBIN,That would be me. Hi.
379.56,381.19,ROBIN,l'm Robin Wood.
381.19,384.55,GILES,"Oh, sorry. Rupert Giles. Sorry."
384.64,388.55,GILES,Buffy tells me you're something
384.64,388.55,GILES,of a freelance demonfighter.
388.64,390.63,GILES,"Oh, yes."
391.48,393.83,GILES,l'm relieved.
393.92,397.07,GILES,We're running dangerously low on allies.
397.16,399.8,BUFFY,"So we didn't stop it, then?"
399.88,405.75,GILES,"No, the seers at the coven are certain"
399.88,405.75,GILES,the First is continuing to gather its forces.
406.32,409.23,GILES,l'm afraid war is inevitable.
410.84,414.03,GILES,So we should go before the school board.
414.03,414.43,ROBIN,What?
414.52,418.11,GILES,"Well, l can have my backup library"
414.52,418.11,GILES,sent from home in the meantime.
418.2,419.75,GILES,"lt's not much, but..."
419.75,420.19,BUFFY,Giles.
420.28,426.03,GILES,Knowledge comes from crafted bindings
420.28,426.03,GILES,"and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeros."
426.12,429.09,BUFFY,Did you bring back any potentials?
429.09,429.35,GILES,No.
429.44,433.55,GILES,"Actually, my trip was about"
429.44,433.55,GILES,something else. lt's regarding Spike.
433.64,435.51,BUFFY,Spike? What about him?
435.6,439.91,GILES,l told you my concerns when you recklessly
435.6,439.91,GILES,chose to remove the chip from his head.
440,441.46,ROBIN,"Wait, sorry. Chip?"
441.46,442.91,GILES,lt's a long story.
443,446.07,BUFFY,The military put a chip in his head
443,446.07,BUFFY,so he couldn't hurt anyone.
446.16,447.15,GILES,The abridged version.
447.24,450.35,BUFFY,But he wouldn't hurt anyone any more
447.24,450.35,BUFFY,because he has a soul now.
450.44,452.22,GILES,Unless the First triggers him.
452.22,452.75,ROBIN,The chip?
452.84,458.99,BUFFY,"No, the trigger's a posthypnotic thing."
452.84,458.99,BUFFY,The First put it in his head. lt... made him...
459.08,460.24,BUFFY,He was killing again.
460.24,462.39,ROBIN,"So he has a trigger, a soul and a chip?"
462.48,463.32,GILES,Not any more.
463.32,464.99,BUFFY,"lt was killing him, Giles."
465.08,465.72,ROBIN,The trigger?
465.72,467.59,BUFFY,The chip. The trigger's not active.
467.68,470.59,ROBIN,Because the military gave him a soul?
472.4,473.8,ROBIN,Sorry.
473.88,477.47,GILES,We don't know that the trigger is inactive.
478.12,481.03,GILES,"What l brought back may help us to disarm it,"
481.12,483.55,GILES,and to ascertain exactly what it is
483.55,485.63,BUFFY,that causes Spike's behaviour.
485.72,489.31,BUFFY,"lt was that song, Giles."
485.72,489.31,BUFFY,lt was that song that Spike was singing.
489.4,492.51,GILES,He has no memory of it.
489.4,492.51,GILES,ls there part of it that you remember?
492.6,495.46,GILES,"lt didn't have a catchy hook, like ""l'm coming"
495.46,498.07,BUFFY,"up, so you better get this party started."""
498.16,500.61,BUFFY,"Boring, old, and English."
500.61,503.55,ROBIN,Just like yo... ul... Brynner.
503.64,505.59,ROBIN,Yul Brynner.
506.52,509.43,ROBIN,A British Yul Brynner.
510.24,515.11,ROBIN,This thing you brought to keep Spike
510.24,515.11,ROBIN,from killing again. How's it work?
515.76,517.75,GILES,lt will require a bit of magic.
518.08,520.47,XANDER,We couldn't have
518.08,520.47,XANDER,put these chains back up a week ago.
520.56,523.28,XANDER,"No, we gotta work on Spike now of all times."
523.36,525.35,SPIKE,What?
526.48,528.47,XANDER,Nothin'.
531.92,534.59,SPIKE,What are you doing here?
531.92,534.59,SPIKE,You came to see the show?
534.68,536.87,ROBIN,l thought you might need support.
536.87,537.27,SPIKE,Uhhuh.
537.36,539.67,SPIKE,Let's get this over with.
537.36,539.67,SPIKE,What are you gonna do?
539.76,542.43,SPIKE,Some hypnobeam? A disarming spell?
542.52,546.43,GILES,Not exactly. The First has brainwashed you.
546.52,551.35,GILES,There's something in your subconscious
546.52,551.35,GILES,that it's using to provoke a violent reaction.
551.44,553.43,SPIKE,So...
554.24,556.75,GILES,we have to put this in your brain.
556.84,558.59,SPIKE,Bugger that!
558.68,564.83,GILES,The prokaryote stone will move within your
558.68,564.83,GILES,mind to reveal the root of the trigger's power.
564.92,568.43,GILES,"lt can unleash ideas, images, memories."
568.52,572.63,GILES,"Hopefully, once you understand"
568.52,572.63,GILES,"what it is that's... setting you off,"
572.72,574.87,GILES,you can break its hold on you.
574.96,577.99,DAWN,Hopefully? So it might not work?
578.08,581.63,GILES,The stone's just a catalyst for the process.
578.08,581.63,GILES,The rest is up to Spike.
581.72,584.75,SPIKE,And how do you get
581.72,584.75,SPIKE,that hunk of rubble into my cranium?
584.84,586.63,GILES,Willow?
586.63,587.4,WILLOW,OK.
587.48,591.36,WILLOW,l just hope my pronunciation
587.48,591.36,WILLOW,is in the ballpark.

608,611.23,SPIKE,"Oh, you have got to be joking? What now?"
611.32,615.1,GILES,lt has to access the cerebral cortex
611.32,615.1,GILES,via the optic nerve.
615.2,617.39,SPIKE,"Oh, bollocks."
617.48,622.23,SPIKE,All the rubbish people keep sticking in my
617.48,622.23,SPIKE,"head, it's a wonder there's room for my brain."
622.32,626.31,GILES,l don't think it takes up
622.32,626.31,GILES,"that much space, do you?"
636.4,637.55,SPIKE,Ow!
637.64,638.82,SPIKE,"Ow, ow!"
638.82,639.83,BUFFY,Spike!
642.12,643.68,BUFFY,"Spike, listen to me."
643.68,644.07,SPIKE,Yeah.
644.16,644.99,BUFFY,Are you all right?

860.32,865.23,SPIKE,"Oh, yeah, the song."
860.32,865.23,SPIKE,lt's called "Early One Morning". Old folk ditty.

865.32,867.78,ROBIN,Mean?
867.88,871.15,SPIKE,Nothing. lt's just... my mum.
871.64,875.91,SPIKE,lt was her favourite. She used to

931.48,934.59,SPIKE,l don't know. l got along fine with her.

946,948.17,BUFFY,Your prophylactic stone didn't work.
948.17,950.47,GILES,He's not cooperating. This takes time.

1016.12,1020.95,DRUSILLA,"lt's ripe and ready, my darling."
1016.12,1020.95,DRUSILLA,Waiting for us to devour its fruit.
1021.04,1026.63,WILLIAM,"We'll ravage this city together, my pet."
1021.04,1026.63,WILLIAM,Lay waste to all of Europe.
1027.24,1031.71,WILLIAM,The three of us will teach those snobs
1027.24,1031.71,WILLIAM,and elitists with their falderal just what...
1031.8,1032.34,DRUSILLA,Three?
1032.34,1034.07,WILLIAM,"You, me and Mother."
1034.16,1040.39,WILLIAM,We'll open up their veins and bathe in their
1034.16,1040.39,WILLIAM,blood as they scream our names across...
1040.48,1040.97,WILLIAM,What?
1040.97,1044.47,DRUSILLA,You... wanna bring your mum with us?
1045.32,1047.96,WILLIAM,"Well, yeah."

1051.6,1053.59,DRUSILLA,"To eat, you mean?"
1055.48,1056.73,MOTHER,William?
1056.73,1058.75,WILLIAM,Uh... Mother.
1058.84,1063.51,MOTHER,Where have you been?
1058.84,1063.51,MOTHER,l've been beside myself for days.
1063.6,1066.59,WILLIAM,"You needn't have worried, Mother."
1066.68,1069.83,WILLIAM,You'll never have to worry
1066.68,1069.83,WILLIAM,about anything again.
1069.92,1072.38,WILLIAM,Something has happened.

1075.62,1078.07,MOTHER,l don't... Who's this woman?
1078.16,1081.18,DRUSILLA,l'm the other that gave birth to your son.
1081.18,1082.47,MOTHER,l beg your pardon?
1082.56,1084.55,WILLIAM,"lt's true, Mother."
1087.32,1089.75,WILLIAM,Drusilla... she...
1091.72,1093.91,WILLIAM,She has made me what l am.

1098.84,1102.11,WILLIAM,l have become a creature of the night.
1102.2,1104.39,WILLIAM,A vampire.
1104.48,1106.23,MOTHER,Are you drunk?
1108.2,1110.19,WILLIAM,A little bit.
1111.52,1113.79,WILLIAM,Think of it.
1113.88,1116.03,WILLIAM,No more sickness.
1116.12,1118.71,WILLIAM,No more dying.
1118.8,1121.26,WILLIAM,You'll never age another day.

1123.77,1125.71,MOTHER,What are you talking about?
1125.8,1128.6,MOTHER,And why are you acting so strangely?
1128.6,1130.39,WILLIAM,"lt's all right, Mother."
1132.16,1134.15,WILLIAM,lt's only me.
1141.28,1144.47,WILLIAM,We'll be together... forever.
1146.4,1147.8,MOTHER,William...

1158.16,1160.15,MOTHER,i></i> Buffy?
1160.76,1165.51,WILLOW,l just got a phone call. l'm gonna have to
1160.76,1165.51,WILLOW,take off for a while. Maybe a day or two?
1165.6,1166.46,BUFFY,What's wrong?
1166.46,1168.59,WILLOW,Nothing you need to worry about.
1168.68,1173.07,WILLOW,l'll give you the full scoop later.
1168.68,1173.07,WILLOW,Maybe l'll even bring back some good news?
1173.56,1175.27,BUFFY,Could use a little of that.
1175.36,1179.75,BUFFY,OK. l guess now is as good a time
1175.36,1179.75,BUFFY,as we're likely to see for a while.
1179.84,1181.48,BUFFY,Just hurry back.
1181.48,1182.3,WILLOW,Will do.
1184.12,1186.43,GILES,Think about what you're doing.
1186.52,1188.51,BUFFY,l have.
1197,1198.14,GILES,Buffy...
1198.14,1198.99,BUFFY,Don't.
1203.28,1205.27,ROBIN,Mr Giles.
1207,1208.99,ROBIN,You got a moment?
1210.64,1212.05,GILES,What's on your mind?
1212.05,1214.23,ROBIN,The same thing that's on yours.
1214.32,1216.59,ROBIN,We got ourselves a problem.
1217.48,1217.95,GILES,Spike.
1217.95,1220.91,ROBIN,"Yeah. lf that trigger's still working,"
1221,1225.63,ROBIN,then the First must be waiting
1221,1225.63,ROBIN,forjust the right time to use it against us.
1225.72,1229.63,GILES,lt does seem doubtful the First simply
1225.72,1229.63,GILES,forgot it had such a powerful weapon.
1229.72,1235.59,ROBIN,"A while back, it slipped up."
1229.72,1235.59,ROBIN,lt told Andrew it wasn't time yet for Spike.
1235.68,1242.31,ROBIN,"So, whatever the First's ultimate plan is,"
1235.68,1242.31,ROBIN,Spike must play an integral part in that.
1242.92,1245.67,ROBIN,Something needs to be done.
1247.68,1249.87,GILES,Buffy would never allow it.
1249.96,1253.95,ROBIN,"Buffy would listen to her watcher,"
1249.96,1253.95,ROBIN,wouldn't she?
1254.04,1258.11,GILES,l don't think you have much of an idea
1254.04,1258.11,GILES,of the watcherslayer dynamic.
1258.2,1260.53,ROBIN,"Actually, l was raised by a watcher."
1260.53,1261.11,GILES,You what?
1261.2,1266.71,ROBIN,Bernard Crowley. Took me in
1261.2,1266.71,ROBIN,"when l was a young kid, trained me."
1266.8,1269.23,ROBIN,Crowley.
1269.32,1271.15,ROBIN,l remember the name.
1271.24,1276.31,GILES,New Yorkbased watcher.
1271.24,1276.31,GILES,Resigned shortly after his slayer was...
1281.6,1283.79,GILES,You're Nikki Wood's son.
1286.08,1287.43,ROBIN,Yes.
1288.92,1290.95,GILES,Spike killed your mother.
1292.52,1294.31,ROBIN,Yes.
1299,1301.15,GILES,Does Buffy know this?
1301.24,1303.91,ROBIN,She knows my mother was a slayer.
1304.56,1307.2,ROBIN,She... doesn't know about Spike.
1307.88,1311.95,GILES,And this has nothing to do
1307.88,1311.95,GILES,with personal vengeance?
1312.04,1314.55,ROBIN,Does it matter?
1314.64,1317.55,ROBIN,He's an instrument of evil.
1317.64,1320.71,ROBIN,He's gonna be our undoing
1317.64,1320.71,ROBIN,"in this fight, Buffy's undoing,"
1320.8,1323.75,ROBIN,"and she will never, <i>never</i> see it coming."
1323.84,1327.51,ROBIN,"Now, l'm talking about"
1323.84,1327.51,ROBIN,what needs to be done.
1329.8,1332.39,ROBIN,"For the greater good, Giles."
1333.44,1335.63,GILES,And you know l'm right.
1346.44,1348.59,GILES,What exactly do you propose?
1350.52,1353.91,ROBIN,l just need you
1350.52,1353.91,ROBIN,to keep Buffy away for a few hours.
1357,1360.88,BUFFY,"l don't know, Giles. ls this really"
1357,1360.88,BUFFY,a primo time for a training session?
1360.96,1363.19,BUFFY,"l'm still your teacher, Buffy."
1363.28,1368.15,GILES,"As adept as you are as a slayer,"
1363.28,1368.15,GILES,there are always new things to learn.
1368.24,1373.52,GILES,Now more than ever it's crucial
1368.24,1373.52,GILES,to maintain focus on your calling.
1373.6,1376.99,BUFFY,"ln case you haven't noticed,"
1373.6,1376.99,BUFFY,our plates are kinda full right now.
1377.08,1382.31,BUFFY,"Plus, l'm not sure how l feel about leaving"
1377.08,1382.31,BUFFY,Spike at Robin's house to watch over him.
1382.4,1387.99,GILES,"For what it's worth, everyone at your house"
1382.4,1387.99,GILES,seemed quite relieved at the arrangement.
1388.08,1391.03,GILES,Buffy...
1391.12,1395.95,GILES,While l'm not technically
1391.12,1395.95,GILES,"your watcher any more,"
1396.04,1398.76,GILES,the fact that your life is such chaos
1398.84,1403.47,GILES,only underscores the importance
1398.84,1403.47,GILES,of the lessons l can impart to you.
1403.56,1406.15,BUFFY,Fine. lmpart away.
1406.24,1409.63,GILES,We're on the verge of war.
1406.24,1409.63,GILES,lt's time you looked at the big picture.
1409.72,1412.71,GILES,Hello! All l do is look at the big picture.
1412.8,1416.35,BUFFY,"The other day, l gave an inspirational speech"
1412.8,1416.35,BUFFY,to the telephone man.
1416.44,1420.4,GILES,lt takes more than
1416.44,1420.4,GILES,"rousing speeches to lead, Buffy."
1420.48,1426.11,GILES,"lf you're gonna be a general, you need to"

1426.2,1428.76,BUFFY,Have you seen me with those girls?
1428.84,1434.04,BUFFY,The way l've treated my friends
1428.84,1434.04,BUFFY,and my family and Andrew?
1434.12,1437.03,BUFFY,Believe me. l know
1434.12,1437.03,BUFFY,how to make hard decisions.
1437.12,1439.39,GILES,That's what we're here to find out.
1441.96,1443.95,GILES,While we work on the basics.
1446.32,1448.19,SPIKE,You live in a garage?
1448.28,1452.55,ROBIN,This is just a workroom.
1448.28,1452.55,ROBIN,Kind of my... sanctuary.

1513.16,1516.47,ROBIN,"What kind of man are you, Spike?"
1516.56,1520.39,SPIKE,Sorry. Not much for selfreflection.
1520.8,1522.79,ROBIN,"Yeah, makes sense."
1526.24,1532.71,ROBIN,"See, you strike me as the kinda guy"
1526.24,1532.71,ROBIN,who just careens through life.

1876.68,1880.91,GILES,That we cannot allow any threat that
1876.68,1880.91,GILES,would jeopardise our chances of winning?
1881,1882.99,BUFFY,"Yes, l get it."
1883.08,1885.72,GILES,And yet there is Spike.
1888.04,1889.57,GILES,An animal like you
1889.57,1892.63,ROBIN,never cared for anyone but yourself.
1893.44,1895.43,ROBIN,No one else mattered.
1898.2,1901.71,ROBIN,Just... all about the hunt.
1908.08,1910.07,ROBIN,Yeah.
1919.76,1921.46,ROBIN,"You wanna run, don't you?"
1921.46,1924.67,MOTHER,Scamper off and cry to your new little trollop.
1924.76,1930.91,MOTHER,Do you think you'll be able to love her?
1924.76,1930.91,MOTHER,To touch her without feeling me?
1931,1934.43,MOTHER,All you've ever wanted was to be back inside.
1934.52,1940.71,MOTHER,"You finally got your wish, didn't you?"
1934.52,1940.71,MOTHER,Sank your teeth into me. An eternal kiss.
1940.8,1942.99,WILLIAM,No. l only wanted to make you well.
1943.08,1945.23,MOTHER,You wanted your hands on me.
1945.32,1948.19,MOTHER,Perhaps you'd like a chance
1945.32,1948.19,MOTHER,to finish what you started?
1948.28,1950.19,WILLIAM,l loved you. l did.
1950.28,1951.72,WILLIAM,Not like this.
1951.72,1953.27,MOTHER,Just like this.
1953.36,1955.92,MOTHER,This is what you've always wanted.
1956,1958.19,MOTHER,Who's my dark little prince?
1958.28,1960.19,WILLIAM,No!
1961.52,1962.63,MOTHER,Get out.
1963.6,1965.67,MOTHER,Get out!
1972.08,1974.91,MOTHER,"There, there, precious."
1975,1977.83,MOTHER,lt will only hurt for a moment.
1979.04,1980.99,WILLIAM,l'm sorry.
1981.08,1982.19,ROBIN,What?
1983.44,1984.99,SPIKE,l'm sorry.
2005.8,2009.43,ROBIN,Sorry? You think sorry's
2005.8,2009.43,ROBIN,gonna make everything right?
2009.52,2011.43,SPIKE,l wasn't talking to you.
2015,2019.59,SPIKE,l don't give a piss about your mum.
2015,2019.59,SPIKE,She was a slayer. l was a vampire.
2021.76,2024.44,SPIKE,That's the way the game is played.
2024.44,2024.83,ROBIN,Game?
2032.4,2034.33,SPIKE,She knew what she was signing up for.
2034.33,2035.59,ROBIN,l didn't sign up for it.
2035.68,2037.71,SPIKE,"That's the rub, isn't it? You didn't"
2037.71,2040.03,ROBIN,sign up for it and somehow it's my fault.
2040.12,2042.15,ROBIN,You took my childhood.
2042.24,2044.67,ROBIN,You took her away.
2046.84,2049.19,ROBIN,She was all l had. She was my world.
2049.28,2052.07,SPIKE,And you weren't hers.
2049.28,2052.07,SPIKE,Doesn't that piss you off?
2052.16,2054.8,ROBIN,Shut up. You didn't know her.
2059.04,2060.87,ROBIN,l know slayers.
2064.48,2068.26,SPIKE,No matter how many people
2064.48,2068.26,SPIKE,"they've got around them, they fight alone."
2068.36,2070.35,SPIKE,Life of the Chosen One.
2070.88,2074.23,SPIKE,The rest of us be damned.
2070.88,2074.23,SPIKE,Your mother was no different.
2074.32,2077.87,ROBIN,No. She loved me.
2079.2,2082.59,SPIKE,"But not enough to quit, though, was it?"
2082.68,2085.75,SPIKE,Not enough to walk away... for you.
2088.2,2091.79,SPIKE,l'll tell you a story about a mother and son.
2093.6,2096.47,SPIKE,"See, like you, l loved my mother."
2097.64,2100.71,SPIKE,So much so l turned her into a vampire.
2102.76,2105.07,SPIKE,So we could be together forever.
2106.12,2109.75,SPIKE,She said some nasty bits to me
2106.12,2109.75,SPIKE,after l did that.
2109.84,2113.11,SPIKE,Been weighing on me for quite some time.
2116.72,2119.71,SPIKE,But you helped me figure something out.
2119.8,2123.71,SPIKE,"You see, unlike you,"
2119.8,2123.71,SPIKE,l had a mother who loved me back.
2124.48,2129.68,SPIKE,"When l sired her, l set loose a demon,"
2124.48,2129.68,SPIKE,and it tore into me.
2130.64,2133.91,SPIKE,"But it was the demon talking, not her."
2137.24,2139.43,SPIKE,l realise that now.
2140.52,2143.91,SPIKE,My mother loved me... with all her heart.
2145.52,2147.51,RECORDED SONG,l was her world.
2149.6,2154.27,RECORDED SONG,i># Early one morning</i>
2149.6,2154.27,RECORDED SONG,i>just as the sun was rising</i>
2154.36,2156.11,RECORDED SONG,i># l heard a young maid sing...</i>
2156.2,2159.75,SPIKE,That's a nice little song you got there.
2162.6,2165.51,SPIKE,"Thanks, doc. You cured me after all."
2167.32,2169.31,SPIKE,l got my own free will now.
2169.4,2173.18,SPIKE,l'm not under the First's
2169.4,2173.18,SPIKE,or anyone else's influences now.
2175.16,2177.8,40 EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT,l just wanted you to know that...
2177.88,2180.55,40 EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT,before l kill you.
2188.04,2190.68,GILES,"Spike's a liability, Buffy."
2191.16,2193.95,GILES,"He refuses to see it, and so do you."
2195.16,2200.75,GILES,Angel left here because he realised
2195.16,2200.75,GILES,how harmful your relationship with him was.
2200.84,2203.71,GILES,"Spike, on the other hand,"
2200.84,2203.71,GILES,lacks such selfawareness.
2203.8,2207.58,BUFFY,Spike is here because l want him here.
2203.8,2207.58,BUFFY,We need him.
2207.68,2210.2,BUFFY,l'm in the fight of my life.
2210.2,2210.83,VAMPIRE,Really?
2211.32,2212.67,BUFFY,"Not you, Richard."
2212.76,2216.07,GILES,You want Spike here even after
2212.76,2216.07,GILES,what he's done to you in the past?
2216.16,2219.15,BUFFY,lt's different now. He has a soul.
2219.24,2223.51,GILES,And the First is exploiting that
2219.24,2223.51,GILES,to his advantage.
2223.6,2224.59,BUFFY,"Oh, my God."
2226.84,2230.47,BUFFY,You're stalling me. You're keeping me away...
2230.56,2236.19,GILES,lt's time to stop playing the role
2230.56,2236.19,GILES,"of general, and to start being one."
2237.64,2240.28,GILES,This is the way wars are won.
2248.36,2250.35,41 EXT. WORKSHOP AT ROBIN'S PLACE - NIGHT,Spike?
2251.24,2253.23,BUFFY,What happened?
2260.2,2263.19,BUFFY,"Oh, my God."
2260.2,2263.19,BUFFY,l gave him a pass.
2263.28,2267.27,SPIKE,"Let him live, on account"
2263.28,2267.27,SPIKE,of the fact l killed his mother.
2267.36,2270.03,SPIKE,But that's all he gets.
2270.12,2274.19,SPIKE,He even so much as
2270.12,2274.19,SPIKE,"looks at me funny again, l'll kill him."
2304.2,2307.31,BUFFY,l lost my mom a couple of years ago.
2308.68,2312.27,BUFFY,l came home
2308.68,2312.27,BUFFY,and l found her dead on the couch.
2313.2,2314.83,ROBIN,l'm sorry.
2316.72,2321.11,BUFFY,"l understand what you tried to do,"
2316.72,2321.11,BUFFY,but she's dead.
2321.2,2322.87,ROBIN,Because he murdered her.
2322.96,2326.87,,"l'm preparing for a war, and you want revenge"
2322.96,2326.87,,on a man that no longer exists.
2326.96,2331.87,,"Buffy, don't delude yourself."
2326.96,2331.87,,That man still exists.
2331.96,2335.19,,Spike is the strongest warrior we have.
2335.28,2339.55,,We are gonna need him
2335.28,2339.55,,if we're gonna come out of this thing alive.
2339.64,2342.87,,"lf you try anything again, he'll kill you."
2344.16,2348.07,,"More importantly, l'll let him."
2351.28,2353.51,,l have a mission.
2353.6,2357.07,,To win this war. To save the world.
2358.32,2360.99,,l don't have time for vendettas.
2363.52,2366.31,,The mission is what matters.
2390.68,2392.67,,Buffy...
2394.48,2396.47,,l...
2398.08,2400.15,,l understand your anger.
2401.64,2404.95,,"Please believe me, we did what we..."
2401.64,2404.95,,He's alive.
2405.36,2408.35,,Spike's alive. Wood failed.
2410.28,2413.63,,"Well, that doesn't change anything."
2413.72,2416.23,,What l told you is still true.
2416.32,2418.31,,You need to learn...
2416.32,2418.31,,No.
2419.48,2422.47,,l think you've taught me
2419.48,2422.47,,everything l need to know.
