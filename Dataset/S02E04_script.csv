1.9,4.86,,"In every generation there is a Chosen One,"
4.9,9.52,,"She alone will stand against the vampires,"
4.9,9.52,,"the demons and the forces of darkness,"
9.56,10.62,,"She is the Slayer,"
12.54,13.93,Buffy,This is so unfair.
13.93,16.09,Willow,I don't think it's that bad.
16.12,19.12,Buffy,It's the Ã¼bersuck.
16.12,19.12,Buffy,Mom could've at least warned me.
19.15,20.94,Xander,"Well, a lot of parents"
19.15,20.94,Xander,are doing it this year.
20.98,23.11,Xander,It's part of this whole
20.98,23.11,Xander,culturalexchange megillah.
23.14,24.42,Xander,The exhibit. The dance.
24.42,26.53,Willow,I have the best costume for the dance.
26.56,29.21,Buffy,A complete stranger
26.56,29.21,Buffy,in my house for two weeks.
29.24,33.26,Buffy,I'm gonna be insane. A danger to myself
29.24,33.26,Buffy,"and others within three days, I swear!"
33.29,35.58,Xander,I think the exchangestudent
33.29,35.58,Xander,program's cool.
35.69,39.01,Xander,I do! It's a beautiful melding
35.69,39.01,Xander,of two cultures.
39.05,41.35,Buffy,Have you ever done
39.05,41.35,Buffy,an exchange program?
41.39,45.5,Xander,My dad tried to sell me to some
41.39,45.5,Xander,Armenians once. Does that count?
55.78,57.59,Cordelia,Ooh! There's mine.
57.62,61.44,Cordelia,Sven. Isn't he lunchable?
57.62,61.44,Cordelia,Mine's definitely the best.
61.48,62.69,Buffy,What are you looking at?
62.69,64.7,Cordelia,Pictures of our exchange students. Look.
64.74,67.78,Cordelia,Swedish. 100% gorgeous.
67.81,70.3,Cordelia,staying at my house!
70.33,75.02,Cordelia,"So how's yours? Visually, I mean."
73.23,75.51,Buffy,I don't know. Guylike?
75.54,79.66,Xander,"By guylike, we are talking"
75.54,79.66,Xander,"big, beefy guylike girls, right?"
79.69,82.32,Buffy,I was just told "guy".
82.35,85.37,Cordelia,You didn't look at him first?
82.35,85.37,Cordelia,He could be dogly.
85.41,87.47,Cordelia,You live on the edge!
87.51,89.3,Xander,Hold on a sec.
89.3,92.26,Xander,So this person who's living with you
89.3,92.26,Xander,for two weeks is a man?
92.29,96.08,Xander,With man parts?
92.29,96.08,Xander,This is a terrible idea.
96.12,99.22,Willow,What about the beautiful melding
96.12,99.22,Willow,of two cultures?
99.26,103.1,Xander,"There's no melding, OK?"
99.26,103.1,Xander,He better keep his parts to himself.
103.79,105.66,Buffy,What's he doing?
106.39,110.96,Xander,That's Rodney Munson.
106.39,110.96,Xander,He's God's gift to the bell curve.
112.85,116.2,Xander,"What he lacks in smarts,"
112.85,116.2,Xander,he makes up in lackofsmarts.
116.24,120.43,Willow,You just don't like him 'cause of that time
116.24,120.43,Willow,he beat you up every day for five years.
120.46,123.08,Xander,Yeah. I'm irrational that way.
123.12,125.08,Buffy,I better stop him
123.12,125.08,Buffy,before he gets in trouble.
125.08,129.85,Willow,I got it. The nonviolent approach
125.08,129.85,Willow,is probably better here.
131.81,135.83,Buffy,I wasn't gonna use violence.
131.81,135.83,Buffy,I don't always use violence.
137.05,138.55,Buffy,Do I?
138.55,141.5,Xander,The important thing is...
138.55,141.5,Xander,you believe that.
142.05,145.62,Rodney,"What are you... Oh, Willow, hi."
145.66,148.38,Willow,That's probably not something
145.66,148.38,Willow,you're supposed to be doing.
148.38,150.13,Willow,You could get in trouble.
150.13,150.62,Rodney,"Oh, no."
150.65,153.03,Rodney,And they might kick me out of school?
153.06,155.7,Willow,Are we still on for
153.06,155.7,Willow,our chem tutorial tomorrow?
155.74,159.36,Rodney,Yeah. I think I got almost
155.74,159.36,Rodney,all 14 natural elements memorized.
159.39,161.52,Willow,There are 103.
162.07,167.9,Guide,"Welcome, students. We shall now"
162.07,167.9,Guide,proceed into the Incan burial chamber.
168.33,172.35,Guide,The human sacrifice is about to begin.
173.34,176.65,Xander,Typical museum trick.
173.34,176.65,Xander,Promise human sacrifice.
176.65,178.99,Xander,Deliver old pots and pans.
179.03,183.87,Guide,"years ago, the Incan people"
179.03,183.87,Guide,chose a beautiful teenage girl...
183.91,186.3,Guide,to become their princess.
186.34,190.32,Willow,I hope this story ends with
186.34,190.32,Willow,And she lived happily ever after."
190.36,195.46,Xander,"No, I think it ends with ""And she became"
190.36,195.46,Xander,"a scary, discolored, shriveled mummy."""
195.49,199.95,Guide,The Incan people sacrificed their
195.49,199.95,Guide,"princess to the mountain god, Sabancaya,"
200.87,205.08,Willow,an offering buried alive
200.87,205.08,Willow,for eternity in this dark tomb.
205.12,209.68,Willow,They could've at least wrapped her in those
205.12,209.68,Willow,"nice, white bandages  like in the movies."
209.72,214.12,Guide,"The princess remained there,"
209.72,214.12,Guide,protected only by a cursed seal...
214.15,218.49,Guide,placed there as a warning
214.15,218.49,Guide,to any who would wake her.
219.64,222.88,Xander,"So, Buffy, when's exchangeo boy"
219.64,222.88,Xander,making his appearance?
222.91,226.44,Buffy,His name's Ampata.
222.91,226.44,Buffy,He'll be at the bus station tomorrow night.
226.48,229.72,Xander,Oooh! The Sunnydale bus depot. Classy!
229.75,233.24,Xander,What a better way to introduce someone to
229.75,233.24,Xander,our country than with the stench of urine.
233.4,239.02,Guide,"Now, if you'll follow me this way, please."
271.03,273.3,Rodney,Cool!
286.35,288.35,Rodney,Damn!
345.32,350.79,Buffy,b>"Inca Mummy Girl"</b>
353.28,354.87,Buffy,So can I go?
354.87,356.46,Giles,I think not.
362.04,362.94,Buffy,How come?
362.94,366.02,Giles,Because you are the Chosen One.
366.06,368.5,Buffy,"Just this once, I'd like"
366.06,368.5,Buffy,to be the Overlooked One.
368.53,371.35,Giles,"Well, I'm afraid that is not..."
373.3,375.49,Giles,You have responsibilities
373.3,375.49,Giles,that other girls do not.
375.49,378.5,Buffy,Oh! I know this one!
375.49,378.5,Buffy,"Slaying entails certain sacrifices,"
378.54,382.28,Buffy,"blah, blah, bitty blah."
378.54,382.28,Buffy,"I'm so stuffy, give me a scone."""
382.32,384.65,Giles,It's as if you know me.
384.68,387.18,Giles,Your secret identity is gonna be
384.68,387.18,Giles,difficult enough to maintain
387.18,389.86,Giles,while this exchange student
387.18,389.86,Giles,is living with you.
389.89,391.59,Xander,Not...
391.62,395.03,Xander,with her.
391.62,395.03,Xander,In the same house as her.
395.07,398.58,Xander,Am I the only one who's objective enough
395.07,398.58,Xander,to make that distinction?
400.83,403.39,Buffy,So! I think going to the dance
400.83,403.39,Buffy,like a normal person
403.39,406.31,Buffy,would be the best way
403.39,406.31,Buffy,to keep that secret.
406.35,410.15,Buffy,"Giles, come on! Budge."
406.35,410.15,Buffy,No one likes an unbudger.
414.35,416.02,Giles,Fine!
416.68,417.26,Giles,Go.
417.26,419.37,Buffy,Yay! I win.
419.6,423.05,Giles,I'll just go and introduce
419.6,423.05,Giles,my shoulder to a... an ice pack.
423.09,425.06,Xander,So I guess we're dancebound. Cool.
425.09,427.07,Buffy,"I think I can get my mom's car,"
427.07,428.15,Xander,so I'm Wheel Man.
428.19,429.67,Buffy,I thought you were taking Willow?
429.67,431.19,Xander,"Well, yeah, I'm gonna take Willow,"
431.23,433.05,Xander,"but I'm not gonna ""take"" Willow,"
433.05,434.52,Buffy,in the sense of "take me".
434.62,437.54,Xander,"See, with you we're three and"
434.62,437.54,Xander,"everybody's safe. Without you, we're two."
437.58,440.52,Buffy,Ah. And we enter dateville.
437.58,440.52,Buffy,"Romance, flowers."
440.55,442.25,Xander,Lips.
442.29,444.86,Buffy,"Oh, come on. In all the years"
444.89,447.37,Buffy,"you've known Willow,"
444.89,447.37,Buffy,you've never thought about her lips?
447.4,451.43,Xander,"Buffy, I love Willow"
447.4,451.43,Xander,and she's my best friend...
451.51,455.24,Xander,which makes her not the kind of girl
451.51,455.24,Xander,who I think about her lips that much.
455.27,459.07,Xander,She's the kind of girl that...
455.27,459.07,Xander,I'm best friends with.
459.65,461.45,Willow,"Hey, guys."
461.48,464.84,Xander,Willow! Hi! We were just
461.48,464.84,Xander,talking about happy things.
464.88,467.74,Xander,Like the three of us
464.88,467.74,Xander,"going to the dance together, see?"
468.61,471.77,Xander,Happy. Not happy.
471.81,474.42,Willow,"No. Uh, oh, yyes."
474.46,476.54,Willow,No. Rodney's missing.
476.58,478.89,Giles,Trouble with Mr. Munson again?
478.93,481.48,Willow,His parents say
478.93,481.48,Willow,he never came home last night.
481.51,484.7,Buffy,"You know, I don't think I remember seeing"
481.51,484.7,Buffy,Rodney on the bus back from the field trip.
484.73,489.02,Willow,I didn't either. I hope
484.73,489.02,Willow,he didn't get in trouble at the museum.
489.05,491.37,Xander,"Hey, maybe he awakened the mummy."
491.41,493.72,Willow,"Right, and it rose from its tomb."
494.06,496.34,Buffy,And attacked him.
501.57,505.05,Willow,"On the other hand, maybe Rodney"
501.57,505.05,Willow,just stepped out for a smoke.
505.08,506.02,Xander,For 21 hours?
506.02,507.82,Willow,"It's addictive, you know."
507.86,511.84,Giles,We'll deal with that
507.86,511.84,Giles,when we've ruled out evil curses.
511.87,514.22,Buffy,One day I'm gonna live
511.87,514.22,Buffy,in a town where evil curses
514.22,516.73,Buffy,are just generally ruled out
514.22,516.73,Buffy,without even saying.
516.77,518.65,Giles,There was the seal?
518.65,521.02,Buffy,It was right here.
521.06,522.79,Buffy,And it's broken.
522.83,525.61,Willow,Does that mean the mummy's loose?
525.61,527.13,Buffy,No. Comfy as ever.
527.16,530.25,Giles,Look at this series of pictograms.
530.29,532.04,Giles,Look out!
540.99,543.29,Xander,"OK. I just saved us, right?"
543.29,544.48,Buffy,Something did.
544.51,546.79,Giles,Well we'll fret about the details later.
544.51,546.79,Giles,Let's just get out of here
546.8,549.65,Giles,before he comes back.
549.74,551.41,Willow,"Giles,"
551.62,554.22,Willow,were the Incas... very advanced?
554.26,556.19,Giles,"Yes. Yes, very."
556.22,559.29,Willow,Did they have orthodontists?
560.76,564.7,Willow,Rodney looked like he had been dead
560.76,564.7,Willow,for 500 years. How could that be?
564.73,567.72,Xander,Maybe we should ask that crazy man
564.73,567.72,Xander,with the big old knife.
567.89,570,Buffy,I don't think he seemed overly chatty.
570.03,574.64,Willow,The way he bolted when he saw Rodney?
570.03,574.64,Willow,I'd say he was as freaked as we were.
574.67,576.19,Giles,My resources on the subject
574.67,576.19,Giles,are extremely limited.
576.65,580.24,Giles,I gather that this particular mummy
576.65,580.24,Giles,was from the Sabancaya region
580.24,583.48,Giles,of eastern Peru. It's very remote.
580.24,583.48,Giles,"Now, if there's an answer,"
583.51,585.39,Giles,then it'sit's locked in...
585.39,586.26,Buffy,In the seal.
586.3,590.65,Giles,It could take me weeks to...
586.3,590.65,Giles,translate these pictograms.
590.68,592.8,Giles,"Well, we'll start tonight with..."
592.8,593.25,Buffy,Ampata!
593.28,594.66,Giles,I was gonna suggest hunting.
594.66,596.67,Buffy,"No, I'm late. I told mom I'd pick him up."
596.71,598.65,Xander,"Buffy, where are your priorities?"
598.69,601.73,Xander,Tracking down a mummifying killer
598.69,601.73,Xander,or making time for some Latin lover
601.73,604.18,Xander,whose stock in trade
601.73,604.18,Xander,is the breakage of hearts?
604.21,607.61,Buffy,Ampata's there alone.
604.21,607.61,Buffy,I don't know how good his English is.
607.64,610.44,Buffy,He's from South... South America.
610.47,612.5,Buffy,"Hey, you know, maybe"
610.47,612.5,Buffy,he could translate the seal.
612.5,614.51,Xander,"Oh, yeah. Fall for the old"
614.51,617.52,Xander,let me translate
614.51,617.52,Xander,that ancient seal for you" comeon.
617.55,620.35,Xander,Do you know
617.55,620.35,Xander,how many times I've used that?
626.14,628.48,Mummy,Ampata!
639.8,642.42,Mummy,Ampata!
646.72,648.52,Ampata,Hello?
658.57,661.08,Buffy,minutes late. Welcome to America.
661.08,662.9,Willow,What if he left already?
662.95,666.57,Buffy,Ampata! Ampata Gutierrez?
668.58,670.93,Xander,"So, do we have to speak Spanish"
668.58,670.93,Xander,when we see him?
670.96,674.62,Xander,Cause I don't know anything much
670.96,674.62,Xander,besides "Doritos" and "Chihuahua".
674.84,676.64,Buffy,Ampata!
676.64,677.93,Ampata,Here.
679.84,681.68,Ampata,Hello.
689.85,691.69,Ampata,I am Ampata.
692.98,697.84,Xander,Ay caramba! I can also say that.
700.49,703.66,Buffy,Dining room. And this...
704.25,705.52,Buffy,is kitchen.
705.52,707.25,Ampata,It's very good.
710.02,712.21,Buffy,"Yeah, you got your stove, your fridge."
710.02,712.21,Buffy,It's fully functional. We're very into it.
715.02,715.05,Xander,Would you like a drink?
715.05,719.89,Buffy,"Uh, let's see, we've got milk,"
715.05,719.89,Buffy,"and, uh, oh, older milk..."
719.92,721.06,Buffy,Juice?
721.06,722.39,Ampata,Please.
722.43,724.17,Willow,"So, Ampata,"
724.2,726.48,Willow,you're a girl.
726.87,729.73,Ampata,Yes. For many years now.
729.77,735.13,Willow,And not a boy. 'Cause we thought a boy was
729.77,735.13,Willow,"coming, and here you are in a... girl way."
735.17,738.15,Xander,"It's just one of those crazy mixups, Will."
738.18,740.44,Buffy,"So, have you ever been"
738.18,740.44,Buffy,to America before?
740.44,742.72,Ampata,"Uh, I, I have toured."
743.04,745.62,Xander,Where did... you go?
745.66,750.05,Ampata,"I was taken to Atlanta, Boston, New York."
750.55,754.23,Willow,New York! That's exciting.
750.55,754.23,Willow,What was that like?
754.3,756.14,Ampata,I did not see so much.
756.18,759.27,Xander,"Your English is very bueno,"
759.27,761.1,Ampata,I listened much.
761.14,764.24,Xander,"Well, that works out well"
761.14,764.24,Xander,because I talk much.
774.95,776.66,Buffy,Hey.
777.45,780.17,Buffy,Sorry about the teeniness of the room.
780.17,782.18,Ampata,My old one was much smaller.
783.08,785.51,Buffy,What's it like back home?
785.55,788.54,Ampata,Cramped and very dead.
788.58,791.27,Buffy,"Well, you'll feel right"
788.58,791.27,Buffy,at home in Sunnydale.
791.3,793.72,Ampata,"Oh, no!"
794.34,797.91,Ampata,But... But you have so much here.
799.98,802.35,Buffy,How about friends?
803.1,804.94,Ampata,They're...
806.86,809.35,Ampata,It is just me.
809.36,813.69,Buffy,"I've been there. But, hey,"
809.36,813.69,Buffy,you'll meet lots of people tomorrow.
813.74,816.37,Ampata,Thank you.
816.87,820.54,Ampata,You must teach me
816.87,820.54,Ampata,everything about your life.
821.87,827.53,Ampata,"I want to fit in, Buffy."
821.87,827.53,Ampata,Just like you. A normal life.
828.13,832.64,Buffy,One normal life... coming up.
836.01,838.41,Cordelia,"Devon, I told you"
836.01,838.41,Cordelia,I'd be at the dance tonight
838.41,841.87,Cordelia,but I am not one of your little groupies.
838.41,841.87,Cordelia,"I won't be all doeeyed,"
841.91,844.87,Cordelia,"looking up at you,"
841.91,844.87,Cordelia,standing at the edge of the stage.
844.91,845.51,Devon,Got it.
845.51,847.93,Cordelia,"So, I'll see you afterwards?"
847.97,849.92,Devon,Sure. Where do you wanna meet?
849.92,851.99,Cordelia,I'll be standing at the edge of the stage.
852.03,854.13,Devon,With that guy?
854.16,857.83,Cordelia,"Sven. Momento, Needa."
857.91,863.02,Cordelia,This whole student exchange thing
857.91,863.02,Cordelia,has been a horrible nightmare.
861.04,863.94,Cordelia,They don't even speak American.
863.97,867.1,Cordelia,So I'll see you later? Bye.
868.55,871.76,Cordelia,Sven! Come!
874.81,877.82,Devon,"Oz, man. What do you think?"
877.82,878.71,Oz,Of what?
878.74,880.93,Devon,"Cordelia, man!"
880.96,883.31,Oz,She's a wonderland tour.
883.57,885.84,Devon,"You gotta admit, the girl is hot."
885.84,887.42,Oz,"Yeah, she's a hot girl."
887.45,891.79,Devon,Let me guess. Not your type?
887.45,891.79,Devon,What does a girl have to do to impress you?
891.83,895.29,Oz,"Well, it involves a feathered boa"
891.83,895.29,Oz,"and the theme of A Summer Place,"
895.45,897.17,Oz,I can't discuss it here.
897.17,898.74,Devon,"You're too picky, man."
898.77,903.46,Devon,Do you know how many girls you could have?
898.77,903.46,Devon,"You're lead guitar, Oz. It's currency."
903.59,908.3,Oz,I'm not picky. You're just impressed
903.59,908.3,Oz,by any pretty girl that can walk and talk.
908.59,911.26,Devon,She doesn't have to talk.
912.35,916.1,Willow,I worked really hard on my costume.
912.35,916.1,Willow,It's pretty cool.
916.1,919.69,Xander,"OK, but what about me? I gotta think."
919.85,921.63,Willow,"Well, it's a celebration of cultures."
921.63,923.51,Xander,There are lots of dressup alternatives.
923.54,927.11,Xander,And a corresponding equal number
923.54,927.11,Xander,"of mocking alternatives, all aimed at me."
927.36,928.72,Willow,Bavarians are cool.
928.72,930.66,Xander,"OK. No shirts with ruffles,"
930.7,936.02,Xander,no hats with feathers
930.7,936.02,Xander,and definitely no lederhosen.
934.04,936.33,Xander,They... make my calves look fat.
936.37,939.51,Willow,Why are you suddenly so worried
936.37,939.51,Willow,about looking like an idiot?
939.55,944.02,Buffy,That came out wrong.
943.63,946.1,Buffy,Your first day at school. Nervous?
946.13,948.89,Ampata,It is just more people
946.13,948.89,Ampata,than I have seen in a long time.
948.93,951.65,Buffy,Don't worry.
948.93,951.65,Buffy,You'll have no problems making friends.
951.76,955.04,Buffy,"As a matter of fact,"
951.76,955.04,Buffy,I know someone who's dying to meet you.
955.52,957.95,Giles,How do you do?
958.02,961.77,Giles,"I was, I was wondering"
958.02,961.77,Giles,"if you could, um, translate... this?"
961.81,963.65,Buffy,That was in no way awkward.
966.78,971.58,Buffy,Is something wrong?
966.78,971.58,Buffy,No. It is...
971.79,973.87,Ampata,Why are you asking me?
973.87,975.29,Giles,"Well, uh, uh..."
975.33,978.74,Giles,"It's, well, it's an artifact..."
975.33,978.74,Giles,"from, from, uh, your... region."
978.77,985.02,Giles,It's from the tomb
978.77,985.02,Giles,"of an Incan mummy, actually."
983.05,985.5,Giles,We're trying to translate it...
985.5,987.63,Willow,"as a project for our, um..."
987.66,989.94,Willow,Our archaeology club.
989.98,990.75,Giles,Very good.
990.75,993.91,Ampata,It is broken. Where are the other pieces?
993.94,996.12,Buffy,That's all we found.
996.81,999.9,Ampata,It's very old. Valuable.
1001.19,1002.66,Ampata,You should hide it.
1002.66,1005.76,Giles,"Is, is, uh, anything you recognize here?"
1005.79,1010.74,Giles,"This, this, um... this chap here"
1005.79,1010.74,Giles,"with the knife, for instance?"
1011.2,1013.84,Ampata,"Well, I do not know exactly."
1013.88,1018.33,Ampata,But... I think this represents...
1018.36,1022.31,Ampata,"I believe, the word is... bodyguard?"
1023.72,1027.72,Giles,Bodyguard? Interesting.
1027.75,1032.85,Ampata,Legend has it that he guards the mummy
1027.75,1032.85,Ampata,against those who would disturb her.
1033.1,1039.39,Giles,"Well. Yes, that's a very good"
1033.1,1039.39,Giles,"starting point for our, um... club."
1040.61,1046.04,Buffy,"Oh! And, uh, as club president,"
1040.61,1046.04,Buffy,"I have, um, lots to do."
1046.07,1048.71,Buffy,Lots of stuff. Dull stuff.
1049.37,1051.01,Buffy,"Willow, maybe you could..."
1051.01,1052.84,Xander,Stay with Ampata for the day.
1052.87,1055.05,Xander,I'd love to.
1055.08,1058.07,Ampata,Yes. That will be fun.
1061.88,1064.68,Giles,Right. I'll...
1061.88,1064.68,Giles,continue with the translation.
1064.68,1067.02,Giles,"Buffy, you research this bodyguard thing."
1067.06,1070.05,Giles,"And, Willow... Willow!"
1070.64,1074.05,Willow,"Boy, they really like each other."
1077.53,1079.97,Xander,And this...
1082.02,1083.31,Xander,is called... a snack food.
1083.31,1083.86,Ampata,Snack food?
1083.89,1087.21,Xander,"Yeah. It's a delicious,"
1083.89,1087.21,Xander,"spongy, golden cake"
1087.25,1091.71,Xander,"stuffed with a delightful,"
1087.25,1091.71,Xander,creamy white substance of goodness.
1091.74,1094.04,Xander,And here's how you eat it.
1097.55,1100.2,Ampata,"Oh, but now I cannot try it."
1100.23,1102.98,Xander,That's why you bring two.
1107.56,1109.39,Ampata,Here goes.
1113.19,1114.98,Xander,"Good, huh?"
1114.98,1118.78,Xander,The exciting part is that they have
1114.98,1118.78,Xander,no ingredients that a human can pronounce.
1118.82,1123.76,Xander,So it doesn't leave you with that heavy...
1118.82,1123.76,Xander,food feeling" in your stomach.
1123.83,1125.13,Ampata,You are strange.
1125.13,1127.4,Xander,Girls always tell me that...
1127.43,1129.46,Xander,right before they run away.
1129.49,1130.82,Ampata,I like it.
1130.82,1133.34,Xander,I like you like it.
1135.09,1137.82,Xander,"Please, don't learn from my English."
1138.88,1142.63,Buffy,Ha! Or possible ha.
1142.64,1145.6,Buffy,Do you think this matches?
1147.03,1148.75,Buffy,Hey!
1148.75,1150.04,Willow,Oh.
1150.15,1154.18,Willow,Yes. I'm caring about mummies.
1154.53,1157.14,Buffy,Ampata's only staying two weeks.
1157.18,1162.9,Willow,Yeah. And then Xander can find
1157.18,1162.9,Willow,someone else who's not me to obsess about.
1162.93,1166.64,Willow,At least with you
1162.93,1166.64,Willow,I knew he didn't have a shot.
1167.04,1170.36,Willow,"Well, you know, I have a choice."
1170.4,1172.69,Willow,I can spend my life waiting for Xander
1172.73,1175.16,Willow,to go out with
1172.73,1175.16,Willow,every other girl in the world...
1175.2,1177.74,Willow,"until he notices me, or..."
1177.77,1180.91,Willow,I can just get on with my life.
1180.95,1183.01,Buffy,Good for you.
1183.05,1185.24,Willow,"Well, I didn't choose yet."
1185.27,1187.77,Giles,Good Lord. Good work.
1187.81,1189.59,Buffy,My work?
1189.59,1190.48,Giles,Yes.
1190.52,1193.12,Giles,This is most illuminating.
1193.16,1197.27,Giles,It seems Rodney's killer
1193.16,1197.27,Giles,might be the mummy.
1197.31,1199,Willow,Where does it say that?
1199,1199.81,Giles,"Well, here."
1199.85,1204.25,Giles,It implies that the mummy is capable
1199.85,1204.25,Giles,"of feeding on the life force of a person,"
1204.29,1207.29,Giles,"effectively freezedrying them,"
1204.29,1207.29,Giles,you might say.
1207.71,1208.53,Giles,Extraordinary.
1208.53,1210.86,Buffy,"So, then we just have to stop the mummy."
1210.9,1214.71,Buffy,"Which leads to the question, how do we"
1210.9,1214.71,Buffy,find and (b) stop the mummy?
1214.74,1217.87,Giles,"Well, the answer to that"
1214.74,1217.87,Giles,is somewhere still in here.
1217.91,1220.14,Giles,Or in the rest of the seal.
1222.98,1226.12,Bodyguard,You stole the seal! Where is it?
1231.73,1234.1,Bodyguard,It is you!
1244.25,1245.31,Giles,Here you are.
1245.31,1246.13,Ampata,Thank you.
1246.16,1249.81,Willow,Why is this guy so into us?
1246.16,1249.81,Willow,"I mean, what's he want?"
1249.88,1251.94,Xander,He said "Give me the seal."
1251.94,1254.05,Giles,Apparently this is more popular
1251.94,1254.05,Giles,than we realized.
1254.08,1256.48,Giles,I just don't know what we...
1254.08,1256.48,Giles,we should do with it.
1256.51,1258.99,Ampata,Destroy it.
1259.02,1261.38,Ampata,"If you do not, someone could die."
1261.77,1264.5,Giles,I'm afraid someone already has.
1264.54,1266.54,Ampata,"You mean, the man with the knife"
1264.54,1266.54,Ampata,killed someone?
1266.58,1270.03,Buffy,"Uh, no. Well... not exactly."
1270.53,1273.67,Ampata,You are not telling me everything.
1275.53,1279.97,Xander,"You're right, Ampata. And it's time we do."
1282.02,1284.06,Xander,We're not an archaeology club. We're in...
1286.79,1289.51,Xander,"We're in the crime club,"
1286.79,1289.51,Xander,"which is kinda like the chess club,"
1289.51,1293.72,Xander,"only with crime and, uh... no chess."
1293.76,1297.53,Ampata,Please understand me.
1293.76,1297.53,Ampata,That seal nearly got us killed.
1297.53,1300.38,Ampata,It must be destroyed!
1303.06,1304.9,Xander,Ampata!
1314.42,1316.41,Xander,"Ampata, listen to me."
1316.45,1318.7,Xander,Nobody's gonna hurt you.
1316.45,1318.7,Xander,I won't let them.
1318.74,1323.56,Ampata,Your investigation is dangerous.
1318.74,1323.56,Ampata,I do not want that. Just normal life!
1330.59,1332.59,Willow,Is she OK?
1333.09,1335.93,Xander,Wigged. I'm trying to convince her
1333.09,1335.93,Xander,that our lives aren't just
1335.93,1338.6,Xander,danger and peril around here.
1339.35,1340.71,Willow,You should take her to the dance.
1340.71,1342.06,Xander,That's a good idea! We'll all go!
1342.48,1344.17,Willow,"No, I mean just you."
1344.17,1345.94,Xander,But you were psyched.
1345.97,1347.83,Xander,And your costume.
1347.83,1349.9,Willow,I'll see you there.
1349.99,1353.81,Xander,"You know what, Willow?"
1349.99,1353.81,Xander,You're my best friend.
1357.17,1359.27,Willow,I know.
1359.31,1362.2,Buffy,I don't get it. Why would
1359.31,1362.2,Buffy,the bodyguard have such a jones
1362.2,1365.21,Buffy,for a broken piece of rock?
1365.63,1368.74,Giles,"Well, um... Perhaps..."
1368.78,1371.24,Giles,he needs to put it together
1368.78,1371.24,Giles,with the other pieces.
1371.27,1373.97,Buffy,If he has them.
1371.27,1373.97,Buffy,"I mean, we didn't find them."
1376.02,1377.2,Giles,"If he didn't,"
1376.02,1377.2,Giles,then they'd still be at the museum.
1377.23,1381.26,Buffy,So maybe we should go there and find them.
1377.23,1381.26,Buffy,"And odds are he'll show up too, right?"
1381.27,1383.25,Giles,"And hopefully, we'll be ready."
1383.28,1386.76,Buffy,Hey! Look at us!
1383.28,1386.76,Buffy,We came up with a plan. A good plan.
1386.9,1389.83,Giles,Right. We'll meet there tonight
1386.9,1389.83,Giles,after it closes.
1389.86,1395.04,Buffy,No! Bad plan.
1389.86,1395.04,Buffy,I have other plans. Dance plans.
1396.91,1399.97,Buffy,Cancel plans.
1400.04,1403.05,Xander,OK. I have something to tell you.
1403.17,1406.94,Xander,And it's kind of a secret
1403.17,1406.94,Xander,and it's a little bit scary.
1407.55,1410.41,Xander,I like you... a lot.
1410.68,1412.64,Xander,And I want you to go...
1412.64,1414.43,Ampata,with me to the dance.
1415.68,1417.44,Ampata,Why was that so scary?
1417.56,1420.05,Xander,"Well, 'cause you never know"
1417.56,1420.05,Xander,if a girl's gonna say yes...
1420.08,1423.39,Xander,or if... she's gonna laugh in your face
1420.08,1423.39,Xander,and pull out your still beating heart
1423.43,1426.3,Xander,and... crush it into the ground
1423.43,1426.3,Xander,with her heel.
1426.32,1428.73,Ampata,Then you are very courageous.
1430.07,1432.42,Ampata,Can I tell you a secret?
1430.07,1432.42,Ampata,Yeah.
1432.58,1433.89,Ampata,"I like you, too."
1433.89,1434.46,Xander,Really?
1434.49,1436.96,Xander,Really.
1434.49,1436.96,Xander,That's great! Really?
1436.99,1437.96,Ampata,Really.
1437.96,1439.77,Xander,That's great!
1439.81,1442.59,Xander,"You're not a praying mantis, are you?"
1442.59,1445.25,Xander,Sorry. Someone else.
1445.72,1447.34,Ampata,I will return to you.
1447.34,1448.89,Xander,Where are you going?
1449.47,1452.14,Ampata,Where you cannot follow.
1453.85,1456.81,Xander,I'll... wait outside.
1469.49,1471.75,Ampata,I beg you...
1475.12,1476.81,Ampata,do not kill me.
1476.81,1479.17,Bodyguard,You are already dead.
1479.5,1482.4,Bodyguard,For 500 years.
1482.43,1485.53,Ampata,But it was not fair. I was innocent.
1485.56,1489.63,Bodyguard,The people you kill now...
1485.56,1489.63,Bodyguard,so that you may live...
1489.64,1491.92,Bodyguard,They are innocent.
1492.64,1494.48,Ampata,Please.
1496.4,1497.73,Ampata,I am in love.
1497.73,1500.08,Bodyguard,You are the Chosen One.
1500.78,1505.46,Bodyguard,You must die. You have no choice.
1513.92,1515.88,Ampata,"Yes, I do."
1527.68,1530.49,Ampata,I have thought. The dance?
1530.81,1533.55,Ampata,I will go with you.
1533.58,1536.13,Ampata,Gladly.
1543.11,1545.64,Ampata,"Buffy, I do not have any lipstick."
1545.68,1548.81,Buffy,"Oh, you can borrow one of mine."
1545.68,1548.81,Buffy,There should be some on the desk.
1548.85,1549.51,Ampata,What is that?
1549.51,1551.54,Buffy,The station sent the rest of your stuff.
1551.87,1554.77,Ampata,Of course. I forgot all about it.
1554.8,1556.54,Ampata,I will unpack it later.
1556.54,1558.35,Buffy,No worries. I can do it.
1559.38,1563.19,Ampata,But... you must get ready for the dance.
1563.23,1564.76,Buffy,I'm not going.
1564.76,1565.64,Ampata,Why not?
1565.67,1569.73,Buffy,I have work to do. Crime club work.
1565.67,1569.73,Buffy,It's nothing for you to worry about.
1570.02,1573.54,Ampata,"Oh, I am not worried, thanks to Xander."
1573.77,1576.82,Buffy,He seems very happy around you.
1576.82,1578.39,Ampata,"I am happy, too."
1580.03,1582.33,Ampata,Mmm... This one?
1582.37,1585.86,Buffy,"Oh, no. That clashes. There should be"
1582.37,1585.86,Buffy,a gold one in there somewhere.
1586.29,1590.37,Ampata,Thank you. You're always thinking
1586.29,1590.37,Ampata,of others before yourself.
1590.41,1592.79,Ampata,You remind me of someone from
1592.79,1595.5,You remind me of someone from very long ago,very long ago. The Inca princess.
1595.67,1598.37,Buffy,Cool. A princess.
1598.8,1601.96,Ampata,They told her that she was the only one.
1602.55,1606,Ampata,That only she could defend her people
1602.55,1606,Ampata,from the nether world.
1606.31,1611.31,Ampata,"Out of all the girls in her generation,"
1606.31,1611.31,Ampata,she was the only one...
1611.35,1612.34,Buffy,Chosen.
1612.34,1615.04,Ampata,You know the story?
1615.07,1618.08,Buffy,It's fairly familiar.
1620.07,1626.12,Ampata,"She was 16, like us. She was offered"
1620.07,1626.12,Ampata,as a sacrifice and went to her death.
1626.33,1631.33,Ampata,Who knows what she had to give up
1626.33,1631.33,Ampata,to fulfill her duty to others?
1631.37,1633.25,Ampata,What chance at love?
1633.84,1637.1,Ampata,Who knows?
1639.47,1641.3,Buffy,I'll just unpack
1639.47,1641.3,Buffy,the rest of your stuff for you.
1641.35,1643.76,Ampata,"No, really. Let me."
1645.1,1647.31,Buffy,That's Xander and Willow. I'll get it.
1664.5,1666.49,Xander,I've come for the dance.
1666.49,1668.57,Buffy,And what culture are you?
1668.88,1671.1,Xander,I'm from the country of Leone.
1671.38,1674.46,Xander,"It's in Italy, pretending to be Montana."
1674.5,1676.49,Xander,Where are you from?
1674.5,1676.49,Xander,The country of white trash?
1676.5,1678.26,Buffy,Mm. New lineup.
1678.3,1682.28,Buffy,You and Willow are taking Ampata.
1678.3,1682.28,Buffy,Giles and I are hunting mummies.
1682.64,1685.44,Xander,Where's you and Willow?
1682.64,1685.44,Xander,She's not coming... with us.
1685.77,1688.55,Buffy,Oh! On a date.
1688.59,1690.8,Buffy,Romance. Lips.
1693.9,1695.21,Ampata,"Hello, Xander."
1695.21,1697.18,Xander,Ho he ththee ai uh...
1697.22,1699.56,Buffy,I can translate
1697.22,1699.56,Buffy,American salivating boytalk.
1699.56,1701.07,Buffy,He says you're beautiful.
1701.1,1702,Xander,Hav su...
1702,1703.49,Buffy,You're welcome.
1704.54,1708.67,Joyce,"Ampata, don't you look wonderful!"
1708.71,1711.13,Joyce,"Oh, I wish you could talk my daughter"
1708.71,1711.13,Joyce,into going with you.
1711.42,1714.82,Ampata,"I tried, but she is very stubborn."
1714.86,1717.63,Joyce,"Well, I'm glad someone else sees that."
1717.68,1720.79,Ampata,"Well, good night, then."
1726.44,1728.66,Xander,Be careful.
1728.66,1730.08,Buffy,I will.
1730.19,1732.03,Cordelia,Hey!

1897.08,1902.98,Buffy,Yep. Not at the dance. Not with my friends.
1897.08,1902.98,Buffy,Not with a life. What are you doing here?
1903.02,1905.22,Buffy,I thought we were gonna meet
1903.02,1905.22,Buffy,at the museum to find the bodyguard.
1905.25,1909.71,Giles,No. He's already been found...
1905.25,1909.71,Giles,"in the school rest room, mummified."
1909.74,1912.72,Buffy,"OK, I don't get it. Why would the mummy"
1909.74,1912.72,Buffy,kill her own bodyguard?
1912.76,1916.96,Giles,"Well, I've crossreferenced"
1912.76,1916.96,Giles,and I've looked at the pictograms anew.
1916.99,1919.41,Giles,"He was a guard, all right."
1916.99,1919.41,Giles,But it was his job to ensure
1919.41,1921.48,Giles,that the mummy didn't
1919.41,1921.48,Giles,awaken and escape.
1921.52,1924.19,Buffy,So Ampata translated it wrong?
1924.22,1926.06,Giles,Perhaps.
1926.1,1930.87,Buffy,Hold on a sec. She was wiggy
1926.1,1930.87,Buffy,about the seal from minute one.
1930.9,1933.85,Giles,"Yes, I suppose she was."
1934,1935.42,Buffy,Her trunks!
1935.42,1937.74,Giles,I beg your pardon?
1937.75,1940.21,Giles,It's definitely all boys' clothes.
1940.88,1943.3,Giles,Why would a girl pack these?
1949.64,1951.59,Giles,How about this one?
1951.59,1955.51,Buffy,What kind of girl travels
1951.59,1955.51,Buffy,with a mummified corpse...
1955.9,1959.27,Buffy,and doesn't even pack lipstick?

2113.86,2117.12,Xander,OK. At least I can rule out
2113.86,2117.12,Xander,something I said.
2128.88,2132.48,Buffy,I should have guessed.
2128.88,2132.48,Buffy,Remember Ampata wanted us to hide the seal?
2132.51,2135.46,Giles,Then she wanted us to destroy it because...
2135.49,2137.86,Buffy,"Oh, wait!"
2139.51,2141.29,Buffy,Uh... waiting.
2141.32,2144.6,Giles,"Well, we already know that the seal"
2141.32,2144.6,Giles,was used to contain the mummy.
2144.64,2146.31,Giles,If breaking it freed her...
2146.39,2148.82,Buffy,Reassembling it will trap her.
2148.9,2150.86,Giles,I'll go to the museum.
2148.9,2150.86,Giles,I'll drop you off.
2150.86,2153.8,Giles,I'll try and piece together
2150.86,2153.8,Giles,the fragments there.
2153.84,2158.88,Buffy,OK. I'll still get Xander... before
2153.84,2158.88,Buffy,he gets smoochy with mummy dearest.
2160.78,2163.18,Xander,Have you seen Ampata?
2163.29,2164.45,Xander,What was that?
2164.45,2165.37,Willow,I shrugged.
2165.79,2168.93,Xander,Next time you should
2165.79,2168.93,Xander,probably say "shrug".
2170.8,2172.25,Willow,Sigh.
2172.67,2175.37,Sven,I thought this exchange student thing
2172.67,2175.37,Sven,would be a great deal.
2175.41,2179.95,Sven,But look what I got stuck with!
2175.41,2179.95,Sven,"Momento"", ""Punchy fruity drinky""."
2180.18,2182.66,Sven,Is Cordelia even from this country?
2196.66,2201.45,Jonathon,Your hands feel kinda... rough.
2204.16,2206.71,Jonathon,Aren't you with Xander?
2207.92,2212.29,Ampata,Does it look like I'm with Xander?
2216.05,2217.89,Xander,Ampata!
2219.18,2221.06,Jonathon,That's my cue to leave.
2229.19,2232.88,Xander,There you are. Why'd you run away?
2235.45,2239.8,Ampata,Because... I do not deserve you.
2241.08,2245.51,Xander,What... You think that
2241.08,2245.51,Xander,you don't deserve me?
2247.34,2249.67,Xander,"Man, I love you!"
2254.22,2256.71,Xander,Are those tears of joy?
2256.75,2260.43,Xander,Pain? Revulsion?
2262.98,2266.16,Ampata,I am very happy.
2266.73,2270.14,Ampata,And very sad.
2271.11,2274.85,Xander,Then talk to me. Let me know what's wrong.
2274.87,2278.35,Ampata,I can't.
2281.75,2284.81,Xander,"Hey, I know why you can't tell me."
2284.88,2289.42,Xander,"It's a secret, right?"
2284.88,2289.42,Xander,"And if you told me, you'd have to kill me."
2290.51,2293.64,Xander,Oh! That was a... bad joke.
2293.67,2296.93,Xander,"And the delivery was off, too. I'm sorry."
2296.96,2299.27,Xander,"I, uh..."
2304.27,2306.97,Xander,I'm sorry.
2345.57,2348.56,Ampata,No! I can't.

2370.02,2371.25,Giles,"Oh, here. Its paler twin."
2375.52,2377.35,Ampata,The seal.
2381.77,2382.64,Buffy,Where's Xander?
2382.64,2384.03,Willow,He's looking for Ampata.
2384.28,2387.24,Buffy,We need to find him.
2384.28,2387.24,Buffy,Ampata's the mummy.
2387.4,2390.45,Willow,Oh... Good... Xander!
2391.16,2392.24,Buffy,Where'd they go?
2392.24,2393.53,Willow,"Backstage, I think."
2393.66,2395.5,Oz,"Hey, I..."
2397.42,2399.59,Oz,Who is that girl?
2399.92,2401.75,Buffy,Are you OK?
2402.42,2404.3,Xander,I think so.
2404.92,2406.68,Xander,"Boy, that was some kiss."
2406.8,2407.9,Buffy,Where's Ampata?
2407.9,2410.38,Xander,She said something about the seal.
2410.42,2412.27,Buffy,The seal. Giles! Come on.
2412.27,2413.45,Xander,What's going on?
2413.49,2414.63,Willow,He doesn't know?
2414.63,2416.47,Buffy,We'll tell him on the way.
2433.71,2436.29,Giles,There. That's it.
2436.32,2438.04,Giles,Just one more piece.
2446.85,2449.08,Buffy,I'll say one thing for you Incan mummies.
2449.08,2450.39,Ampata,You don't kiss and tell.
2455.6,2459.39,Ampata,Looks like you've been
2455.6,2459.39,Ampata,"keeping secrets from me,"
2462.49,2464.96,Ampata,You're not a normal girl.
2464.96,2466.15,Buffy,And you are?
2485.44,2487.72,Ampata,This won't hurt.
2487.94,2489.85,Xander,Let her go!
2491.89,2495.65,Xander,"If you're gonna kiss anybody,"
2491.89,2495.65,Xander,it should be me.
2495.68,2498.15,Ampata,"Xander, we can be together."
2498.19,2501.28,Ampata,Just... Just let me have this one.
2501.31,2503.71,Xander,That's never gonna happen.
2503.71,2504.91,Ampata,I must do it.
2505.03,2508.08,Ampata,"I must do it now,"
2505.03,2508.08,Ampata,or it is the end for me and for us.
2508.16,2510,Ampata,No!
2511.29,2515.32,Xander,You want life...
2511.29,2515.32,Xander,you're gonna have to take mine.
