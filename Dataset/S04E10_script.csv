2.65,5.8,,So this is what it is.
2.65,5.8,,We're talking about communication.
5.89,9.28,,We're talking about language.
5.89,9.28,,Not the same thing.
9.37,14.89,,"It's about inspiration. Not the idea, but"
9.37,14.89,,the moment before the idea when it's total.
14.97,17.81,,When it blossoms in your mind
14.97,17.81,,and connects to everything.
17.89,22.52,,It's about the thoughts and experiences
17.89,22.52,,that we don't have a word for.
22.61,25.45,,A demonstration. Buffy Summers.
27.29,29.89,,Come on down to the front here.
35.65,38.49,Walsh,"A typical college girl, one assumes."
38.57,40.85,Walsh (to buffy),Lie down on my desk.
40.93,41.31,Buffy,What?
41.31,43.73,Walsh,"Go ahead, you're perfectly safe."

55.17,57.29,Walsh,"Riley, if you could oblige."
59.53,61.94,Riley,"A demonstration, right?"
61.94,63.41,Walsh,Be a good boy.
76.61,79.05,Buffy,This feels very strange.
79.13,82.76,Riley,"Don't worry. If I kiss you,"
79.13,82.76,Riley,it'll make the sun go down.
111.37,113.36,Riley,See?
116.05,118.04,Buffy,Fortune favours the brave.
123.53,125.81,Buffy,Do you hear that?
129.25,132.72,Walsh,"Can't even shout, can't even cry"
132.81,136.41,Walsh,The Gentlemen are coming by
136.49,139.72,Walsh,"Looking in windows, knocking on doors"
139.81,145.02,Walsh,They need to take seven
139.81,145.02,Walsh,and they might take yours
143.61,149.02,Walsh,"Can't call to Mom, can't say a word"
147.09,150.72,Walsh,You're gonna die screaming
147.09,150.72,Walsh,but you won't be heard
153.25,156.37,Walsh,So I'll see you all Monday
153.25,156.37,Walsh,for a final review session.
156.45,159.92,Willow,"Man, that was an exciting class, huh?"
160.01,161.17,Buffy,"Oh, yeah, well..."
161.17,163.97,Willow,And the last 20 minutes was a revelation.
164.05,166.93,Willow,Just laid out everything
164.05,166.93,Willow,we need to know for the final.
167.01,168.9,Willow,I'd hate to have missed that.
168.9,170.72,Buffy,Just tell me I didn't snore.
170.81,173.16,Willow,Very discreet. Minimal drool.
173.16,173.81,Buffy,"Oh, yay."
176.21,177.83,Willow,So were you dreaming?
177.83,180.37,Buffy,Yeah. And it was kind of intense.
180.45,185.21,Riley,Intense? Really?
180.45,185.21,Riley,Cos you seemed so peaceful.
185.29,187.43,Buffy,"Of course, it was only for a moment."
187.43,189.81,Riley,Right. You guys headed over toward Judd?
189.89,192.49,Riley,Student centre.
189.89,192.49,Riley,"Oh, great. So this dream..."
192.57,196.25,Willow,"You know, you guys go."
192.57,196.25,Willow,I'm gonna do the thing.
196.33,199.61,Willow,So I'll see you after Wicca group.
196.33,199.61,Willow,OK. Bye.
199.69,201.52,Willow,Bye.
201.61,207.25,Riley,So tell me about your dream.
201.61,207.25,Riley,"As a psych major, I'm qualified to go ""hm""."
207.33,209.48,Buffy,I don't really remember it.
209.57,212.57,Riley,"Well, did I appear at all in this dream?"
213.65,215.5,Buffy,There might have been a cameo.
215.5,216.37,Riley,Is that right?
216.45,218.68,Buffy,Maybe more like a featured role.
218.77,219.91,Riley,Romantically?
219.91,221.85,Buffy,I'm not saying a word.
222.57,225.53,Riley,So what have you got goin' on tonight?
222.57,225.53,Riley,Patrolling.
225.61,228.76,Riley,Patrolling?
225.61,228.76,Riley,Petroleum.
228.85,230.65,Riley,Petroleum?
230.73,233.09,Riley,Tonight you have crude oil?
233.17,235.16,Buffy,And homework.
236.41,238.64,Buffy,What about you?
238.73,241.29,Riley,"You know, grading papers."
241.37,242.42,Buffy,That'll be fun.
242.42,245.37,Riley,"Not petroleum fun, but it passes the time."
246.89,249.88,Buffy,So I...
249.88,252.02,Riley,Yeah.
252.61,254.92,Riley,I guess I won't see you until...
255.89,257.53,Buffy,Yeah.
260.97,263.19,Buffy,What papers?
263.19,264.49,Riley (confused),Papers?
266.65,270.53,Buffy,Grading what papers? We only have the final.
271.85,273.33,Riley,Yeah...
273.41,276.25,Riley,"No, I... Late papers I gotta look at."
277.93,280.32,Buffy,OK. Neat.
281.45,282.56,Riley,So...
282.56,283.89,Buffy,Class.
284.77,286.33,Riley,I'll see you then.
286.33,286.76,Buffy,Yeah.
290.29,292.28,Buffy (petulantly),Fortune favours the brave.
347.45,351.13,Giles,"Can't even shout, can't even cry."
347.45,351.13,Giles,The Gentlemen are coming by."
351.21,356.24,Giles,It sounds vaguely familiar. You're sure it's
351.21,356.24,Giles,nothing you heard when you were a child?
356.33,358.72,Giles,All right. Nothing else?
360.17,364.29,Giles,"Well, it could definitely be"
360.17,364.29,Giles,"one of your prophetic dreams,"
364.37,367.6,Giles,or it could just be
364.37,367.6,Giles,the eternal mystery that is your brain.
367.69,371.29,Giles,I'll check it out
367.69,371.29,Giles,and I'll let you know if I find something.
371.37,373.36,Giles,All right. Byebye.
375.25,378.49,Giles,You heard of a group called the Gentlemen?
378.49,379.57,Spike,Group of what?
379.65,380.76,Giles,The Gentlemen.
380.76,381.64,Spike,Don't know.
381.73,382.68,Giles,You certain?
382.68,384.73,Spike,No. We're out of Weetabix.
385.73,388.49,Giles,We are out of Weetabix because you ate it all.
388.57,389.91,Giles,Again.
389.91,393.02,Spike,Get some more.
391.09,394.4,Giles,I thought vampires
391.09,394.4,Giles,were supposed to eat blood.
394.49,398.45,Spike,"Yeah, well, sometimes I like to"
394.49,398.45,Spike,crumble up the Weetabix in the blood.
398.53,400.52,Spike,Gives it a little texture.
401.77,406.61,Giles,Since the picture you just painted means that
401.77,406.61,Giles,"I will never touch food of any kind again,"
406.69,411.32,Giles,you'll just have to pick it up yourself.
411.32,412.02,Spike,Sissy.
410.53,412.09,Xander,Where is this coming from?
412.09,413.76,Anya,What am I supposed to think?
413.85,415.77,Xander,How could you say I'm using you?
415.77,417.81,Anya,You don't care about what I think.
417.89,419.16,Anya,You don't ask about my day.
419.16,420.57,Xander,You did turn into a real girl.
420.65,425.12,Anya,See? And you make jokes during my pain.
420.65,425.12,Anya,You don't care about me at all.
425.21,426.77,Xander,I care about you.
426.77,427.6,Anya,How much?
429.69,431.68,Anya,What do I mean to you?
429.69,431.68,Anya,I...
434.01,436.32,Xander,"We, you know, we spend..."
436.32,438.72,Anya,We'll talk about it later.
439.41,441.43,Anya,I think we should talk about it now.
441.43,442.72,Giles,Thank you for knocking.
442.81,444.88,Xander,If you don't know how I feel about...
444.88,445.33,Anya,I don't.
445.41,450.81,Anya,This isn't a relationship. You don't need me.
445.41,450.81,Anya,All you care about is lots of orgasms.
453.49,457.45,Xander,OK. Remember how we talked
453.49,457.45,Xander,about private conversations?
457.53,459.97,Xander,How they're less private
457.53,459.97,Xander,in front of my friends?
460.09,462.1,Spike,We're not your friends. Go on.
462.1,462.97,Giles,Please don't.
463.05,464.06,Anya,This is important.
464.06,465.12,Giles,But why is it here?
465.21,467.6,Xander,Mom said you wanted me to swing by.
467.69,470.38,Xander,"Oh, yes. Well, I meant after sunset."
470.38,473.37,Giles,I need you to take Spike for a few days.
473.45,474.49,Xander,What?
473.45,474.49,Xander,What?
474.57,474.94,Xander,What?
474.94,476.8,Spike,I'm not staying with him.
476.89,480.36,Giles,"I've a friend who's coming to town,"
476.89,480.36,Giles,and I'd like us to be alone.
480.45,482.13,Anya,You mean an orgasm friend?
482.21,485.84,Giles,"Yes, that's exactly the most"
482.21,485.84,Giles,appalling thing you could have said.
485.93,487.95,Xander,"If he stays with me, he'll get tied up."
487.95,489.61,Anya,What about our romantic evening?
489.69,492.08,Spike,I'm not having them shag
489.69,492.08,Spike,while I'm tied to a chair.
492.17,493.48,Xander,Hardly my fantasy either.
493.48,495.21,Anya,You're blowing off our evening...
495.29,496.52,Xander,I don't want him to come.
497.89,501.21,Xander,"We come together, daughters of Gaea,"
501.21,503.05,Wicca1,sisters to the moon.
503.81,508.57,Wicca1,"We walk with the darkness,"
503.81,508.57,Wicca1,"the wolf at our side,"
508.65,514.44,Wicca1,through the waterfall of power
508.65,514.44,Wicca1,to the blackest heart of eternity.
515.81,517.8,Wicca1,I think we should have a bake sale.
517.89,518.57,Wicca2,I don't know.
518.57,520.28,Wicca1,"You guys like a bake sale, right?"
520.37,523.84,Wicca1,"We need money for the dance recital,"
520.37,523.84,Wicca1,and I do an empowering lemon Bundt.
523.93,526.65,Wicca2,The most important thing
523.93,526.65,Wicca2,is the Gaea newsletter.
526.73,530.17,Wicca2,We need to get the message
526.73,530.17,Wicca2,of blessing out to the sisters.
530.25,534.45,Wicca2,"Also, who left their scented candles"
530.25,534.45,Wicca2,dripping all over my womanpower shrine?
534.53,537.17,Willow,"Well, this is good."
537.25,540.05,Willow,"I mean, this is all fun, you know."
540.13,545.33,Willow,But there's also other stuff that we might
540.13,545.33,Willow,"show an interest in, as a Wicca group."
546.29,551.02,Wicca1(hesistantly),Like what?
549.09,554.65,Willow,"Well, there's the wacky notion of spells."
549.09,554.65,Willow,"You know, conjuring, transmutation."
554.73,559.89,Willow,"Yeah, then we could get on our broomsticks"
554.73,559.89,Willow,and fly around on our broomsticks.
559.97,562.97,Willow,"You know, certain stereotypes"
559.97,562.97,Willow,are not very empowering.
563.05,566.41,Willow,I think that...
563.05,566.41,Willow,One person's energy can suck the power
566.49,569.09,Willow,from an entire circle. No offence.
569.17,572.64,Willow,"Well, maybe we could..."
569.17,572.64,Willow,"Yeah, Tara?"
572.73,575.53,wicca2,"Guys, quiet. Do you have a suggestion?"
581.41,584.69,wicca2,"OK, let's talk about the theme"
581.41,584.69,wicca2,for the bacchanal.
585.93,587.8,Buffy,"So not stellar, huh?"
587.8,589.21,Willow,Talk. All talk.
589.29,594.02,Buffy,"Blah, blah, Gaea. Blah, blah, moon."
592.09,594.77,Buffy,Menstrual lifeforce power thingy.
594.85,601.02,Buffy,"After a couple of sessions, I was hoping"
594.85,601.02,Buffy,"we would get into something real, but..."
599.09,601.53,Buffy,No actual witches in your witch group?
601.61,604.81,Willow,No. Bunch of wannablessedbes.
604.89,608.52,Willow,"You know, nowadays every girl"
604.89,608.52,Willow,with a henna tattoo and a spice rack
608.61,611.14,Willow,thinks she's a sister to the dark ones.
611.14,612.69,Buffy,I'm sorry it was a bust.
612.77,614.13,Willow,I know you wanna go further
614.13,615.08,Buffy,in that department.
615.17,618.77,Willow,I'd just like to float something
615.17,618.77,Willow,bigger than a pencil someday.
618.85,626.02,Willow,"Hey, how's with you and Riley?"
618.85,626.02,Willow,You two seemed pretty snuggly after class.
624.09,626.97,Buffy,"See above, re talk. All talk."
627.61,630.38,Willow,Do I have to tie you two together?
630.38,631.77,Buffy,"We almost, but..."
631.85,635.16,Willow,"Well, get with it."
631.85,635.16,Willow,I need my vicarious smoochies.
636.25,638.02,Buffy (whiny),I don't know. I get nervous
638.02,639.4,Buffy,and I start babbling.
639.49,642.77,Buffy,And he starts babbling and it's a babblefest.
642.85,645.32,Buffy,"Plus, every time we talk, I have to lie."
645.81,650.84,Buffy,The Slayer thing comes up one way
645.81,650.84,Buffy,or another. I wish I could just come clean.
650.93,652.36,Forrest,"Well, you can't."
652.36,654.24,Riley,"Yeah, I know I can't."
654.33,656.66,Riley,But it bugs me this time.
656.66,660.02,Forrest,"This is the burden we bear, brother."
658.09,665.02,Forrest,We have a gig that would inevitably cause
658.09,665.02,Forrest,any girl living to think we are cool upon cool.
663.09,668.49,Forrest,Yet we Clark Kent our way through the dating
663.09,668.49,Forrest,"scene, never to use our unfair advantage."
669.13,670.77,Forrest,Thank God we're pretty.
670.77,672.92,Riley,But it's just Buffy's special.
673.01,677.4,Forrest,You think she's special? Wow. The first
673.01,677.4,Forrest,"times you told me, it didn't register,"
677.49,680.53,Forrest,but now I see that you think she's special.
680.61,684.73,Riley,"See, you're naturally inclined"
680.61,684.73,Riley,to talk too much. I don't have that.
684.81,687.2,Forrest,Then get with the kissin'.
688.37,689.21,Riley,Riley Finn.
689.21,691.97,Elevator,Initiative vocalcode match complete.
693.81,696,Spike,Don't see why I have to be tied up.
696,697.81,Xander,It's just while I'm sleepin'.
697.89,699.93,Spike,Like I'd bite you anyway.
700.01,701.02,Xander,"Oh, you would."
701.02,702.32,Spike,Not bloody likely.
703.29,707.29,Xander,"I happen to be very biteable, pal."
703.29,707.29,Xander,I'm moist and delicious.
707.37,710.76,Spike,"All right, yeah, fine. You're a nummy treat."
711.17,713.64,Xander,And don't you forget it.
716.49,720.04,Spike,"Xander, don't you care about me?"
720.13,721.06,Xander,Shut up.
721.06,722.69,Spike,We never talk.
723.29,725.73,Xander,Shut up.
725.81,726.59,Spike,Xander.
726.59,727.49,Xander,Shut up.
728.45,730.44,Giles (musing),They need to take seven."
732.45,734.81,Giles (musing),Take seven what?
741.41,742.03,Giles,Olivia.
742.03,743.61,Olivia,Sorry I'm so late.
743.69,746.42,Olivia,The flight was a horror.
746.42,747.21,Giles,"Oh, no."
747.29,748.8,Giles,Bad weather?
748.8,750.68,Olivia,Baseball movie.
750.77,752.18,Giles (amused),So sorry.
752.18,752.97,Olivia,Yeah.
753.05,755.85,Olivia,"That's enough small talk, don't you think?"
