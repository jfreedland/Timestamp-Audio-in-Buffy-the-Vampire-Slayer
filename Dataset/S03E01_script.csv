32.06,33.55,,That's right. Big boy.
34.93,35.95,Willow,Come and get it.
40.2,41.82,Xander,I got him! Go!
43.33,44.43,Xander,Any time now...
52.08,53.17,Willow,He's getting away!
53.24,57.02,Willow,And... ow.
64.66,68.28,Oz,That really never works.
68.36,69.79,Oz,Are you guys all right?
69.86,72.89,Xander,First of all. What was
69.86,72.89,Xander,with the acrobatics?
72.96,74.73,Xander,How did that happen?
74.8,77.43,Oz,Wasn't Andy Hoelich
74.8,77.43,Oz,on the gymnastics team?
77.5,80.8,Xander,That's right. He was.
77.5,80.8,Xander,Cheater!
80.87,84.97,Xander,OK. And the second problem
80.87,84.97,Xander,I'm having...
85.04,86.81,Xander,Come and get it. Big boy"?
86.88,88.21,Willow,Well...
88.28,91.04,Willow,Well. The slayer
88.28,91.04,Willow,always says a pun
91.12,92.74,Willow,or a witty play on words.
92.82,94.98,Willow,And I think it throws
92.82,94.98,Willow,the vampires off
95.05,97.68,Willow,and it makes them frightened
95.05,97.68,Willow,because I'm wisecracking.
97.76,100.32,Willow,OK. I didn't really have
97.76,100.32,Willow,a chance to work on that one.
100.39,102.15,Willow,but you try it every time.
102.23,103.56,Oz,Uh. If I may suggest...
103.63,105.65,Oz,This time it's personal."
105.73,107.99,Oz,I mean. There's a reason
105.73,107.99,Oz,why it's a classic.
108.07,111.09,Xander,I've always been amazed
108.07,111.09,Xander,with how Buffy fought. But...
111.17,113.9,Xander,in a way. I feel like
111.17,113.9,Xander,we took her punning for granted.
113.97,116,Willow,Xander. Past tense rule.
116.07,120.27,Xander,Oh. Sorry. I just meant we
116.07,120.27,Xander,in the past took it for granted
120.34,123.37,Xander,and. Uh. We won't
120.34,123.37,Xander,when she gets back.
125.25,127.88,Willow,Do you think Buffy knows
125.25,127.88,Willow,school's starting tomorrow?
127.95,130.44,Willow,Tomorrow.
130.52,131.85,Oz,Right.
131.92,133.29,Oz,Big day.
133.36,136.02,Willow,Oh. I'm gonna be busy a lot.
136.09,137.92,Willow,but. But only till 3:00.
138,139.9,3,and that's when
138,139.9,3,you usually get up.
139.96,142.93,Xander,I can't wait to see Cordelia.
145.02,145.06,Xander,I can't believe
145.02,145.06,Xander,I can't wait to see Cordelia.
145.14,147.73,Willow,I wonder what our first
145.14,147.73,Willow,homework assignment's gonna be.
151.02,152.1,Willow,Hey. You're excited
151.02,152.1,Willow,over Cordelia. OK?
152.18,154.14,Willow,We've all got issues.
154.21,156.54,Oz,I guess we should pack it in.
156.61,157.55,Xander,Yeah.
159.88,162.51,Willow,Wouldn't it be great if Buffy
159.88,162.51,Willow,just showed up tomorrow?
162.59,164.08,Willow,Like nothing happened?
164.15,166.59,Xander,She just can't show up.
164.15,166.59,Xander,she got kicked out.
166.66,170.53,Willow,Well. Yeah. I know.
166.66,170.53,Willow,I just wish...
170.59,172.56,Willow,I wish we knew where she was.
198.66,201.06,Buffy,How did you find me here?
201.13,203.22,Angel,If I was blind.
201.13,203.22,Angel,I would see you.
209.83,210.89,Buffy,Stay with me.
210.97,212.6,Angel,Forever.
212.67,216.16,Angel,That's the whole point.
216.24,218.83,Angel,I'll never leave.
218.91,221.14,Angel,Not even if you kill me.
323.31,324.94,Buffy,Anything else?
325.02,326.78,Roughneck,That'll do us. Peaches.
326.85,330.02,Buffy,Pay at the counter.
328.09,330.49,Roughneck,Sure you don't want me
328.09,330.49,Roughneck,to work it off for you?
335.03,337.59,Buffy,Ha ha ha ha.
345.29,346.22,Buffy,You guys ready?
346.29,348.85,Rickie,Yeah. I think we're good.
348.92,351.25,Buffy,Um..."Anne."
353.63,354.56,Buffy,What'll you have?
354.63,359.16,Rickie,Well. OK... what can
354.63,359.16,Rickie,we get with this?
360.77,361.7,Buffy,Um...
361.77,363.36,Lily,Can we get cake?
363.44,364.66,Lily,Don't be stupid.
364.74,366.53,Lily,We gotta eat healthy.
366.61,368.77,Lily,We can't have cake.
368.84,370.33,Lily,Can we get pie?
370.41,372.47,Buffy,We've got a peach pie.
372.55,375.21,Buffy,I can't guarantee
372.55,375.21,Buffy,there's a peach in it.
375.28,377.31,Lily,We shouldn't have
375.28,377.31,Lily,blown all our money.
377.38,380.78,Rickie,Come on. It was worth it.
380.85,383.65,Rickie,Hey. Check this out.
385.73,387.85,Buffy,It's nice.
387.93,390.29,Buffy,It's nice and. Uh. Permanent.
390.36,393.26,Rickie,Yeah. Forever.
393.33,394.68,Rickie,I mean. That's
394.68,396.23,Lily,the whole point.
399.87,401.17,Lily,Hey. Do I know you?
401.24,403.77,Buffy,I don't think so.
403.84,406.28,Lily,Really? Where are you from?
406.35,407.75,Buffy,I'll get your pie.
413.15,414.41,Buffy,I'm not feeling great.
414.49,416.42,Buffy,Do you think you
414.49,416.42,Buffy,can cover for me?
416.49,418.32,Waitress,Sure. Okay.
422.23,423.92,Giles,So. No joy at the cemetery?
424,425.99,Willow,No. He got away.
426.07,428.06,Willow,We still have some
426.07,428.06,Willow,glitches in the system.
428.13,429.12,Willow,like...
429.2,430.57,Willow,vampires getting away.
430.64,432.13,Willow,But I think we're improving.
432.21,434.26,Giles,For God's sake be careful.
434.34,436.74,Giles,I mean. Uh.
434.34,436.74,Giles,I appreciate your efforts
436.81,438.47,Giles,to keep the vampire population down
438.54,439.67,Giles,until Buffy returns.
439.75,443.81,Giles,but. Uh. Well. If anything
439.75,443.81,Giles,should happen to you...
443.88,445.25,Giles,you should be killed.
445.32,446.38,Giles,I should take it somewhat amiss.
446.45,448.22,Willow,You'd be cranky?
448.29,449.45,Giles,Entirely.
449.52,451.05,Willow,Well. We try not to get killed.
451.12,453.18,Willow,That's part of our whole
451.12,453.18,Willow,mission statement.
453.26,454.62,Willow,Don't get killed."
454.69,455.68,Giles,Good.
455.76,457.39,Giles,I think you're going
455.76,457.39,Giles,to love that one.
459.23,459.46,Willow,Hi.
459.46,460.39,Cordelia,Hey. Willow.
460.47,462.13,Willow,How was your summer?
462.2,464.07,Willow,Oh. I can't believe
462.2,464.07,Willow,you brought that up.
464.14,466.5,Willow,Las Palmas was
464.14,466.5,Willow,the nightmare resort.
466.57,469.8,Willow,They order you around and
466.57,469.8,Willow,make you have organized "fun."
469.88,471.84,Willow,and I use sarcastic quote marks.
471.91,474.4,Willow,Plus the fact there are
471.91,474.4,Willow,cockroaches in Mexico
474.48,476.41,Willow,big enough to own property.
476.48,477.74,Willow,It was all about dread.
477.82,481.02,Willow,How was your summer?
479.09,480.75,Willow,Oh. It was OK.
480.82,482.08,Cordelia,Is Xander around?
482.16,483.68,Willow,Well. Uh. Yeah. Somewhere.
483.76,487.09,Cordelia,Good. Great.
483.76,487.09,Cordelia,I haven't seen him yet.
487.16,488.53,Cordelia,Do I look OK?
488.59,489.32,Willow,Oh. Yeah.
489.32,490.46,Cordelia,How's my hair?
490.53,492.26,Cordelia,Uh. It's good.
492.33,494.16,Cordelia,He didn't meet anybody
492.33,494.16,Cordelia,over the summer. Did he?
494.23,496.83,Cordelia,No. Who's he gonna meet
494.23,496.83,Cordelia,in Sunnydale.
496.9,499.37,Cordelia,but monsters and stuff?
499.44,502.7,Cordelia,But then again he's always
499.44,502.7,Cordelia,been attracted to monsters.
502.78,503.9,Cordelia,How's my hair?
503.98,505.81,Willow,Still good.
505.88,506.81,Willow,Hi.
506.88,508.68,Cordelia,Maybe he's forgotten me.
508.75,510.02,Cordelia,Well. I'll just
510.02,512.21,Willow,have to make him remember.
512.29,513.88,Cordelia,See ya.
513.95,515.72,Willow,You came to visit me.
515.79,517.15,Willow,You came with books?
517.22,518.52,Willow,Are they books for me?
518.59,520.42,Oz,Actually. They're kind of for me.
520.49,522.02,Willow,I don't get it.
522.1,523.86,Oz,Well. It's sort of a funny story.
523.93,525.86,Oz,You remember when I didn't graduate?
525.93,527.9,Oz,Well. I know you had
525.93,527.9,Oz,a lot of incompletes.
527.97,530.03,Oz,but that's what
527.97,530.03,Oz,summer school was for.
530.1,532.5,Oz,Yeah. Remember when I didn't go?
532.57,534.34,Teacher,Whoa. Slow down. People.
534.41,536.47,Teacher,Summer is over.
536.54,537.87,Teacher,Be somber.
537.94,539.47,Willow,But you never said anything.
539.55,542.57,Willow,How am I supposed to react
539.55,542.57,Willow,to this rather alarming news?
542.65,546.02,Oz,Well. Actually. I was pretty much
542.65,546.02,Oz,banking on you finding it cute.
546.09,550.35,Willow,Traditionally. You know. Repeating
546.09,550.35,Willow,a grade isn't exactly a turnon.
550.42,552.22,Willow,AndAnd you're
550.42,552.22,Willow,practically a genius.
552.29,554.59,Oz,You're Mr. Test Scores.
554.66,556.53,Willow,It's all a little weird.
556.6,558.15,Oz,So the cute thing is out?
558.23,559.53,Xander,Have you guys seen Cordelia?
559.6,561.79,Willow,Yeah. She's around here somewhere.
561.87,563.13,Willow,I don't want to
561.87,563.13,Willow,come on too geeky.
563.2,566.1,Willow,But. Uh. OK. I'm psyched.
566.17,567.09,Willow,There's gonna be some heat.
567.09,567.9,Xander,if you know what I mean.
567.97,571.27,Willow,So you guys might want
567.97,571.27,Willow,to duck and cover.
571.34,574.37,Willow,And I'm starting to be geeky.
574.45,576.54,Willow,OK. Bye.
576.62,578.45,Willow,How's my...
576.62,578.45,Willow,Your hair is fine.
578.52,579.99,Xander,Cool.
580.05,581.45,,This is our year.
580.05,581.45,,I'm telling you.
581.52,583.49,,Best football season ever.
583.56,585.72,,I'm so in shape. I'm a rock.
585.79,587.16,,It's all about egg whites.
587.23,589.52,,If we can focus.
587.23,589.52,,keep discipline.
589.6,592.03,,and not have quite
589.6,592.03,,as many mysterious deaths.
592.1,594.36,,Sunnydale is gonna rule!
594.43,596.4,,I'm trying to get
594.43,596.4,,to cute. Really.
596.47,598.56,,But I'm still sorta
596.47,598.56,,stuck on "strange."
598.64,600.83,,Well. I'd be willing
598.64,600.83,,to bargain down to "eccentric"
600.91,605.02,,with an option on "cool."
603.08,607.02,,Hey.
603.08,607.02,,Hey.
605.08,609.02,Xander,Good summer?
607.08,609.05,Cordelia,It was all right.
609.12,610.95,Xander,Cool.
611.02,613.35,Cordelia,Yeah.
613.42,616.05,Xander,Well. I'll see ya.
616.12,618.25,Cordelia,Yeah. Whatever.
650.39,653.65,Homeless woman,I'm no one.
653.73,654.89,Homeless woman,I'm no one.
657.06,658.62,Homeless woman,I'm no one.
658.7,661.69,Giles,Yes? Thank you. Thank you.
664.54,665.9,Giles,I have a lead.
665.97,667.3,Giles,A friend in Oakland
667.37,670.71,Giles,has a sketchy report
667.37,670.71,Giles,of a young girl
670.78,671.91,Giles,fending off a group
671.91,673.64,Xander,of vampires about a week ago.
673.71,675.54,Xander,There's a plane out
673.71,675.54,Xander,in about an hour.
675.61,679.35,Xander,And what makes this different
675.61,679.35,Xander,from the last 9 leads?
679.42,682.91,Giles,Well. I believe there's
679.42,682.91,Giles,a meal on this flight.
682.99,685.75,Xander,Look. I don't mean
682.99,685.75,Xander,to poop the party here.
685.82,688.26,Xander,it's just. You get
685.82,688.26,Xander,your hopes all up.
688.33,691.63,Xander,and then it's just a big fat
688.33,691.63,Xander,raspberry. And I feel bad.
691.7,694.22,Willow,But it's good that
691.7,694.22,Willow,you're looking. Though.
694.3,696.29,Willow,You shouldn't give up.
696.37,697.86,Xander,Oh. Yeah. Definitely.
697.94,699.17,Giles,Yes. One must try.
699.24,701.43,Giles,Well. I should go.
704.14,707.2,Willow,You don't think
704.14,707.2,Willow,maybe he'll find her?
707.28,710.08,Xander,I think he'll find her
707.28,710.08,Xander,when she wants to be found.
714.35,716.22,Lily,Anne?
716.29,718.12,Lily,Anne?
718.19,720.12,Lily,Buffy?
721.93,723.45,Lily,Don't be mad.
723.53,725.46,Lily,I won't turn you in or nothing.
725.53,727.52,Lily,I guess you don't recognize me.
730.7,733.04,Buffy,Lily?
733.11,737.02,Lily,I mean from before.
735.07,738.17,Lily,I was calling myself
735.07,738.17,Lily,Chantarelle then.
738.24,739.94,Lily,I used to...
742.02,745.02,Lily,Well. I was in this cult
742.02,745.02,Lily,that worshipped vampires.
743.08,745.45,Lily,So lame. I know.
745.52,748.45,Buffy,Yeah...
745.52,748.45,Buffy,I. Uh. I remember.
748.52,752.42,Lily,But you kinda saved us.
752.49,755.69,Lily,I never thanked you or anything.
755.76,758.29,Buffy,Did you tell anyone who I was?
758.36,760.73,Lily,Oh. No.
758.36,760.73,Lily,Not even Rickie.
760.8,763.46,Lily,I mean. I was so surprised
760.8,763.46,Lily,to see you here.
763.54,764.63,Lily,waiting tables...
766.47,768.44,Lily,But I wouldn't tell.
768.51,771.14,Lily,I know how it is
768.51,771.14,Lily,when you gotta get lost.
775.55,778.21,Buffy,Do you. Uh...
775.55,778.21,Buffy,Do you live nearby?
778.28,780.48,Lily,Well. There's
778.28,780.48,Lily,a couple of places.
780.55,785.05,Lily,Uh. They're abandoned. And
780.55,785.05,Lily,a lot of people stay there.
785.12,788.62,Lily,So how come you
785.12,788.62,Lily,came up with Anne?
788.69,790.96,Buffy,It's my middle name.
791.03,792.43,Lily,Lily's from a song.
792.5,794.9,Lily,Rickie picked it.
794.97,797.99,Lily,I'm always changing anyway.
798.07,803.13,Lily,Chantarelle was part
798.07,803.13,Lily,of my exotic phase.
803.21,806.84,Buffy,It's nice.
803.21,806.84,Buffy,It's a mushroom.
806.91,809.51,Lily,It is?
809.58,811.81,Lily,That's really embarrassing.
811.88,814.35,Buffy,Um. Well. It's
811.88,814.35,Buffy,an exotic mushroom.
814.42,816.65,Buffy,if that's any comfort.
816.72,819.42,Lily,Well. Before that. I was
816.72,819.42,Lily,following this loser preacher
819.49,821.79,Lily,and calling myself
819.49,821.79,Lily,Sister Sunshine.
821.86,824.66,Buffy,What do they
821.86,824.66,Buffy,call you at home?
829.54,832.13,Buffy,I like Lily.
832.2,837.02,,It's cool for now.
835.07,837.3,,Hey. Do you have any money?
837.38,840.5,,I didn't mean that like...
840.58,844.14,,Well. I just mean.
840.58,844.14,,I know this guy.
844.22,847.55,,he's gonna have this kinda
844.22,847.55,,rave thing in his basement.
847.62,849.31,,We could go.
849.39,852.05,,I mean. I could show you
849.39,852.05,,if you had...
852.12,854.15,,Cause I'm broke.
854.23,857.56,Buffy,I don't think so.
857.63,861.03,Buffy,I just kind of...
857.63,861.03,Buffy,I want to be alone.
861.1,863.07,Lily,I didn't mean to bug you.
863.14,866,Lily,No. I didn't mean
866,869.02,Buffy,that. It's just...
867.07,870.06,Buffy,A lot of people like that...
867.07,870.06,Buffy,It's too much.
870.14,871.61,Buffy,I do have the money.
870.14,871.61,Buffy,though. So.
871.68,872.77,Buffy,why don't you and Rickie go.
872.85,873.97,Buffy,and then maybe
872.85,873.97,Buffy,I could meet you...
874.05,878.04,Lily,No. It's OK.
874.05,878.04,Lily,Forget about it.
878.12,880.24,Lily,That's not very polite.
885.49,886.55,Buffy,Are you OK?
889.29,890.96,Homeless man,I'm no one.
913.32,914.81,Lily,Are you OK?
914.89,917.15,Driver,Geez. I didn't see you.
917.22,919.16,Lily,Maybe you shouldn't move.
919.22,921.62,Driver,Maybe you should lie down.
919.22,921.62,Driver,Somebody call an ambulance!
921.69,923.09,Buffy,No! I'm OK. I just...
923.16,924.65,Buffy,I need to go.
930.1,931.73,Ken,Whoa.
931.8,933.7,Ken,Oh.
933.84,935.33,Ken,where are you running to?
935.4,938.2,Buffy,Sorry.
938.27,941.33,Ken,Maybe I should ask.
938.27,941.33,Ken,where are you running from?
945.01,947.85,Ken,You're pretty new around here.
947.92,949.18,Ken,You've got the look. Though.
949.25,950.81,Buffy,The look?
950.89,954.29,Ken,Like you had to grow up
950.89,954.29,Ken,way too fast.
954.36,956.76,Ken,What's your name?
956.83,959.85,Ken,Hey. Um. I'm Ken.
959.93,961.19,Ken,Here. Go ahead.
959.93,961.19,Ken,take one of these.
963.77,965.46,Ken,Don't be shy
963.77,965.46,Ken,about stopping by.
965.53,967.02,Ken,I guess you're not
965.53,967.02,Ken,starving. But...
967.1,969.9,Ken,we're not just interested
967.1,969.9,Ken,in feeding the body.
969.97,972.57,Ken,You might find something
969.97,972.57,Ken,you're missing.
972.64,973.7,Buffy,I'm all right.
973.78,976.47,Ken,Then why are you here?
977.88,983.02,Ken,This is not a good place
977.88,983.02,Ken,for a kid to be.
981.08,983.35,Ken,You get old fast here.
983.42,987.41,Ken,The thing that drains
983.42,987.41,Ken,the life out of them is despair.
987.49,991.89,Ken,I mean. Kids come here. And
987.49,991.89,Ken,they got nothing to go home to.
991.96,996.4,Ken,This ends up being
991.96,996.4,Ken,the last stop for a lot of them.
996.47,998.4,Ken,Shouldn't have to be that way.

1061.93,1065.59,Xander,Boy. I'm glad we showed up
1061.93,1065.59,Xander,for "Depressing Night."
1065.67,1067.76,Willow,I wonder what she's
1065.67,1067.76,Willow,doing right now.
1067.84,1069.24,Xander,Oh. I know what she's doing.
1069.3,1072.33,Xander,Gabbing to all of her friends
1069.3,1072.33,Xander,about her passionate affair
1072.41,1073.77,Xander,with Pedro the cabana boy
1073.84,1075.47,Xander,laughing about me thinking
1075.54,1077.48,Xander,how she still might have
1075.54,1077.48,Xander,feelings about me.
1079.92,1082.44,Xander,Oh. It's possible you were
1079.92,1082.44,Xander,talking about Buffy.
1082.52,1084.45,Xander,It's possible.
1084.52,1087.61,Willow,The Bronze just never
1084.52,1087.61,Willow,seems the same without her.
1087.69,1089.88,Xander,And the slaying isn't
1087.69,1089.88,Xander,getting any easier. Either.
1089.96,1092.86,Oz,I don't know. I think we're
1089.96,1092.86,Oz,kinda getting a rhythm down.
1092.93,1094.79,Xander,We're losing half the vamps.
1094.86,1096.83,Oz,Yeah. But. Rhythmically.
1096.9,1099.3,Willow,We just need to work
1096.9,1099.3,Willow,on our timing. I think.
1099.37,1102.63,Xander,No. I know what we need.
1102.7,1103.86,Oz,A vampire slayer?
1103.94,1105,Xander,Next best thing.
1108.24,1110.51,Xander,Bait.
1120.16,1121.45,Xander,
1130.73,1132.29,Joyce,Uh. Hello.
1132.37,1134.23,Giles,Hello. Um. May I...
1134.3,1137.14,Joyce,Oh. Uh. Of course.
1134.3,1137.14,Joyce,Come on in.
1137.21,1139.37,Giles,I've just come back from Oakland.
1139.44,1142.84,Giles,A friend of mine
1139.44,1142.84,Giles,called with a lead.
1142.91,1146.21,Giles,Stories about someone
1142.91,1146.21,Giles,fighting vampires.
1146.28,1150.02,Giles,It didn't pan out.
1146.28,1150.02,Giles,I'm afraid.
1149.65,1150.95,Joyce,No Buffy.
1151.02,1153.61,Giles,No vampires.
1153.69,1155.49,Giles,Bunch of schoolkids
1153.69,1155.49,Giles,in heavy mascara
1155.56,1158.29,Giles,listening to extremely
1155.56,1158.29,Giles,silly music.
1158.36,1160.06,Joyce,Well. Thank you for going.
1160.13,1162.62,Joyce,I can hardly...
1162.7,1164.16,Joyce,I can hardly leave the house.
1164.23,1167.07,Joyce,I'm just afraid she'll call
1164.23,1167.07,Joyce,and she'll need my help.
1167.14,1172.23,Giles,Buffy is the most capable
1167.14,1172.23,Giles,child I've ever known.
1172.31,1174.33,Giles,I mean. She may be
1172.31,1174.33,Giles,confused. Unhappy.
1174.41,1177.11,Giles,but I honestly believe
1174.41,1177.11,Giles,she's in no danger.
1177.18,1181.08,Joyce,I just wish
1177.18,1181.08,Joyce,I could talk to her.
1181.15,1183.78,Joyce,The last thing
1181.15,1183.78,Joyce,we did was fight.
1183.85,1188.02,Giles,Joyce. You mustn't blame
1183.85,1188.02,Giles,yourself for her leaving.
1188.09,1190.65,Joyce,I don't.
1193.16,1194.49,Joyce,I blame you.
1196.97,1201.56,Joyce,You've been this huge
1196.97,1201.56,Joyce,influence on her. Guiding her.
1201.64,1205.7,Joyce,You had this whole relationship
1201.64,1205.7,Joyce,with her behind my back.
1205.77,1208.87,Joyce,I feel like you've
1205.77,1208.87,Joyce,taken her away from me.
1213.31,1215.91,Giles,I didn't make Buffy
1213.31,1215.91,Giles,who she is.
1215.98,1218.85,Joyce,And who exactly is she?
1224.59,1226.89,Lily,Buff... Uh. Anne?
1226.96,1228.36,Lily,Can I talk to you?
1228.43,1230.26,Buffy,Look. This really isn't
1228.43,1230.26,Buffy,a good time. Can it wait?
1230.33,1232.63,Lily,Rickie's gone.
1232.7,1234.13,Lily,I haven't seen him
1232.7,1234.13,Lily,for more than a day.
1234.2,1236.43,Lily,I... He's never left
1234.2,1236.43,Lily,for that long.
1236.5,1238.73,Lily,I think something's...
1236.5,1238.73,Lily,happened.
1238.81,1240.43,Lily,Maybe something's happened.
1240.51,1242.07,Buffy,Well. Did you call the police?
1242.14,1243.08,Buffy,
1243.14,1245.58,Lily,Rickie skipped out on his parole.
1245.65,1248.71,Lily,They would just cause
1245.65,1248.71,Lily,more trouble.
1248.78,1252.08,Buffy,I don't know.
1248.78,1252.08,Buffy,did you ask around?
1252.15,1255.05,Lily,Can you help me?
1255.12,1257.02,Buffy,Uh. I can't.
1257.09,1259.08,Lily,But that's who you are
1257.09,1259.08,Lily,and stuff. Right?
1259.16,1261.59,Lily,I mean. You help people.
1259.16,1261.59,Lily,and. You know...
1261.66,1264.43,Buffy,I can't get into this.
1261.66,1264.43,Buffy,I'm sorry. Lily.
1264.5,1267.09,Lily,You know how to do stuff.
1267.17,1270.19,Buffy,I don't. Not anymore.
1270.27,1274.94,Lily,But... I don't know
1270.27,1274.94,Lily,what to do.
1280.78,1284.34,Lily,We gave blood lots of times
1280.78,1284.34,Lily,cause you get a few bucks
1284.42,1286.18,Lily,and they have cookies.
1286.25,1288.31,Buffy,You're a fan of the sugar rush?
1288.39,1289.41,Lily,It's nice.
1289.49,1291.79,Nurse,Hi. Are you here to donate blood?
1291.86,1293.16,Buffy,Uh. We're looking for a friend.
1293.23,1295.75,Lily,Rickie T.?
1293.23,1295.75,Lily,We come in sometimes.
1295.83,1297.99,Nurse,Rickie. Sure.
1295.83,1297.99,Nurse,Uh. He's not here.
1298.07,1300.47,Buffy,Well. Do you know if he's
1298.07,1300.47,Buffy,been in the last day or so?
1300.54,1302.23,Nurse,Let me check the sheet.
1304.74,1308.14,Buffy,This'll probably go
1304.74,1308.14,Buffy,faster if we split up.
1308.21,1310.04,Lily,Can I come with you?
1310.11,1313.57,Buffy,OK. Where did I lose you
1310.11,1313.57,Buffy,on the whole splitting up thing?
1313.65,1315.13,Lily,Oh. Sorry.
1315.26,1317.6,Buffy,I was thinking we could check out
1315.26,1317.6,Buffy,some of your hangouts
1317.67,1321.54,Buffy,and then. I guess.
1317.67,1321.54,Buffy,meet later at my place.
1321.6,1322.87,Lily,OK.
1322.94,1324.7,Nurse,Sorry. Guys.
1324.77,1326.37,Nurse,He hasn't been here.
1326.44,1327.93,Buffy,Thanks.
1330.02,1329.44,Nurse,I'll tell him you were looking.
1329.51,1330.91,Buffy,Great.
1407.96,1409.65,Buffy,Rickie?
1424.41,1427.04,Buffy,Did you find Rickie?
1427.11,1428.41,Lily,I thought of...
1428.48,1430.04,Lily,Well. He likes to go
1428.48,1430.04,Lily,to this movie house.
1430.11,1431.64,Lily,you can get in
1430.11,1431.64,Lily,around the back...
1431.71,1433.34,Buffy,Lily...
1435.48,1437.65,Buffy,I think he's dead.
1442.56,1444.05,Lily,But...
1444.13,1446.69,Lily,he takes care of me.
1446.76,1449.56,Buffy,I'm sorry.
1449.63,1453.19,Lily,We're gonna get a place.
1453.27,1455.76,Lily,His cousin can get him
1453.27,1455.76,Lily,a job at the car wash.
1455.84,1457.07,Buffy,Lily. There's...
1457.14,1459.07,Buffy,there's something else.
1460.61,1463.58,Buffy,The person that I found...
1464.81,1465.91,Buffy,was old.
1465.98,1467.04,Buffy,He looked about 80.
1467.12,1468.24,Lily,Well. That's not Rickie.
1468.32,1469.81,Buffy,I'm sure it was.
1472.79,1476.19,Buffy,I don't know how. But...
1476.26,1479.52,Buffy,it was like something
1476.26,1479.52,Buffy,drained the life out of him.
1479.6,1482.09,Lily,Do you mean like a vampire?
1482.16,1483.96,Buffy,No.
1484.03,1488.27,Buffy,A vampire couldn't accelerate
1484.03,1488.27,Buffy,the aging process.
1488.34,1491.17,Buffy,Maybe it was something
1488.34,1491.17,Buffy,in his blood.
1491.24,1493.04,Buffy,When was the last time
1491.24,1493.04,Buffy,you guys gave blood together?
1493.11,1495.34,Lily,I don't understand.
1495.41,1496.94,Lily,Maybe it's not Rickie. OK?
1497.01,1499.21,Buffy,Lily. This is something you're
1497.01,1499.21,Buffy,just gonna have to deal with.
1499.28,1501.05,Lily,But he didn't do anything wrong.
1501.12,1502.35,Lily,why would this happen to him?
1502.42,1503.94,Buffy,That's not the point.
1505.32,1506.48,Buffy,These things happen all the time.
1506.56,1508.39,Buffy,You can't just...
1506.56,1508.39,Buffy,close your eyes
1508.46,1511.02,Buffy,and hope that they're
1508.46,1511.02,Buffy,gonna go away.
1513.46,1515.29,Lily,Is it 'cause of you?
1515.36,1517.96,Buffy,What?
1518.03,1524.17,Lily,You know about monsters
1518.03,1524.17,Lily,and stuff.
1524.24,1526.23,Lily,You could have brought
1524.24,1526.23,Lily,this with you.
1526.31,1529.94,Buffy,I didn't bring
1526.31,1529.94,Buffy,anything with me.
1532.02,1532.57,Buffy,And I didn't ask for you
1532.02,1532.57,Buffy,to come to me with your problems.
1532.65,1534.45,Buffy,I just wanted to be left alone.
1534.52,1536.85,Buffy,If you can't deal.
1534.52,1536.85,Buffy,then don't lay it off on me.
1555.57,1556.9,Ken,Are you OK?
1559.14,1561.84,Ken,Hey. It's OK.
1561.91,1565.24,Ken,Maybe I can help.
1565.31,1567.94,Lily,You can't.
1568.02,1571.08,Ken,Look. I know you all think
1568.02,1571.08,Ken,I'm a big square
1571.15,1574.02,Ken,handing out leaflets
1571.15,1574.02,Ken,about hope.
1574.09,1576.02,Ken,But hope is a real thing.
1576.09,1578.22,Ken,just like despair.
1578.29,1582.56,Ken,Hope can fill up the part
1578.29,1582.56,Ken,of you that's missing.
1582.63,1585.07,Lily,But Rickie...
1585.13,1587.13,Lily,Rickie?
1587.2,1590.9,Ken,Say. Are you Lily?
1590.97,1593.91,Ken,Right. He was
1590.97,1593.91,Ken,talking about you.
1596.05,1597.31,Lily,You've seen Rickie?
1597.38,1599.58,Ken,Oh. Sure.
1599.65,1603.35,Ken,Rickie's with us now.
1603.42,1604.72,Lily,She said he was dead.
1604.79,1607.45,Ken,Well. Someone's sure
1604.79,1607.45,Ken,handed you a tall tale.
1607.52,1610.69,Ken,Rickie's no more dead
1607.52,1610.69,Ken,than I am.
1610.76,1612.96,Ken,Why don't you come
1610.76,1612.96,Ken,to Family Home?
1613.03,1615.19,Ken,We'll get you taken care of.
1650.4,1652.34,Buffy,Candidate for what?
1654.91,1656.5,Buffy,What are you doing?
1656.58,1659.67,Buffy,Breaking into your office and
1656.58,1659.67,Buffy,going through your private files.
1659.75,1661.51,Buffy,Candidate for what?
1661.58,1663.48,Nurse,I'm calling the police.
1666.09,1668.35,Buffy,Now. You've got a whole bunch
1666.09,1668.35,Buffy,of candidates here.
1668.42,1670.58,Buffy,I wonder if any of them
1668.42,1670.58,Buffy,are missing like Rickie.
1670.66,1673.63,Buffy,Gosh. I bet they are.
1673.69,1674.99,Nurse,You're getting yourself
1673.69,1674.99,Nurse,in a lot of trouble.
1675.06,1677.39,Buffy,I don't want any trouble.
1677.47,1680.9,Buffy,I just want to be alone
1677.47,1680.9,Buffy,and quiet in a room
1680.97,1684.56,Buffy,with a chair and a fireplace
1680.97,1684.56,Buffy,and a tea cozy.
1684.64,1687.4,Buffy,I don't even know what
1684.64,1687.4,Buffy,a tea cozy is. But I want one.
1687.48,1689.07,Buffy,Instead. I keep
1687.48,1689.07,Buffy,getting trouble.
1689.14,1691.81,Nurse,which I am more than
1689.14,1691.81,Nurse,willing to share.
1693.41,1695.44,Nurse,What are you doing
1693.41,1695.44,Nurse,with these kids?
1695.52,1697.25,Nurse,Nothing.
1697.32,1699.12,Buffy,I just...
1699.19,1702.18,Nurse,I give him the names
1699.19,1702.18,Nurse,of the healthy ones.
1704.33,1706.82,Buffy,Give them to who?
1706.89,1708.09,Ken,Well...
1708.16,1710.1,Ken,don't you look nice?
1710.16,1711.6,Lily,I guess.
1711.67,1714.4,Ken,Well. You don't want to wear
1711.67,1714.4,Ken,your own outfit to the cleansing.
1714.47,1715.44,Lily,It'll get soaked.
1715.5,1718.94,Lily,A cleansing is
1715.5,1718.94,Lily,like a baptism? Right?
1721.02,1720.94,Ken,Not quite the same.
1723.02,1722.44,Lily,Will I see Rickie after?
1722.51,1724.44,Ken,Oh. Of course.
1722.51,1724.44,Ken,He's waiting for you.
1724.51,1726.45,Ken,He's very excited.
1730.02,1730.62,Ken,Cordelia:
1730.62,1732.28,Cordelia,Why do I have to be bait?
1732.35,1733.79,Cordelia,I'm always bait.
1733.85,1735.95,Cordelia,Why can't Willow be bait?
1736.02,1737.96,Xander,He's already seen Willow.
1738.03,1740.96,Xander,And could you complain louder
1738.03,1740.96,Xander,so all the vampires leave?
1742.03,1744.46,Oz,I think this is a good spot.
1744.53,1745.62,Oz,Is everybody packin'?
1749.37,1750.3,Oz,Let's do it.
1757.55,1759.64,Cordelia,I'm doing this
1757.55,1759.64,Cordelia,for Buffy's sake.
1759.71,1761.31,Cordelia,This has nothing to do with you.
1761.38,1763.82,Xander,Yeah. Like I needed
1761.38,1763.82,Xander,that cleared up.
1763.88,1765.48,Xander,Go away.
1763.88,1765.48,Xander,This is my hiding spot.
1765.55,1766.49,Cordelia,Where do I hide?
1766.55,1768.15,Xander,You don't hide.
1766.55,1768.15,Xander,You're bait.
1768.22,1769.88,Xander,Go act baity.
1769.96,1771.19,Cordelia,What's the plan?
1771.26,1773.25,Xander,The vampire attacks you.
1773.33,1774.09,Cordelia,And then what?
1774.16,1775.25,Xander,The vampire kills you.
1775.33,1777.39,Xander,We watch. We rejoice.
1777.46,1779.43,Cordelia,Cordelia:
1777.46,1779.43,Cordelia,Everything's a joke with you.
1779.5,1781.09,Xander,Xander:
1779.5,1781.09,Xander,No. Just our relationship.
1781.17,1782.26,Cordelia,What relationship?
1782.34,1783.77,Xander,Right. I forgot.
1782.34,1783.77,Xander,We actually want
1783.84,1786.24,Xander,to bury that piece
1783.84,1786.24,Xander,of the past. Don't we?
1786.31,1791.44,Ken,We come to this station
1786.31,1791.44,Ken,to wash away the past.
1791.51,1793.45,Ken,Go ahead. Kneel.
1797.02,1801.78,Ken,We let the water
1797.02,1801.78,Ken,run over the sin
1801.86,1803.45,Ken,and the pain
1803.52,1805.96,Ken,and the uncertainty.
1806.03,1808.29,Lily,It looks kinda... dirty.
1808.36,1809.69,Ken,Yeah.
1809.76,1811.13,Buffy,Buffy:
1809.76,1811.13,Buffy,You know. I just...
1811.2,1813.46,Buffy,I woke up.
1811.2,1813.46,Buffy,and I looked in the mirror.
1813.53,1814.47,Ken,and I thought.
1814.54,1816.63,Buffy,hey. What's with all the sin?
1816.7,1818.8,Ken,I need to change.
1818.87,1819.97,Ken,I'm...
1820.04,1821.06,Ken,I'm dirty.
1821.14,1822.97,Ken,I'm...
1821.14,1822.97,Ken,I'm bad with the...
1823.04,1824.98,Buffy,sex and the envy
1825.05,1828.98,Ken,and that loud music
1825.05,1828.98,Ken,us kids listen to nowadays.
1830.32,1831.31,Buffy,Uh...
1831.39,1833.32,Buffy,Oh. I just suck at undercover.
1833.39,1834.68,Ken,Where's Ken?
1852.11,1854.17,Ken,This is a private moment.
1854.24,1855.5,Ken,If you could just...
1855.58,1859.02,Buffy,How do you make 'em old. Ken?
1857.08,1859.34,Buffy,Do you feed on youth?
1857.08,1859.34,Buffy,What's the deal?
1859.41,1861.61,Ken,Do you really wanna know?
1861.68,1863.31,Lily,What's going on?
1863.38,1865.78,Lily,Aaaaah!
1875.26,1877.96,Lily,Unh! Ohh...
1883.87,1885.17,Lily,Oh! Unh!
1885.24,1886.3,Lily,Ohh...
1886.37,1887.97,Lily,Ohh...
1890.38,1892.14,Lily,Ken: Oh. My face.
1892.21,1895.15,Ken,Ow! My face!
1895.22,1899.65,Ken,Do you have any idea
1895.22,1899.65,Ken,how hard it is
1899.72,1901.62,Ken,to glue that thing on?!
1905.39,1906.86,Ken,Guards!
1915.2,1917.67,Ken,Heavy Blows.
1915.2,1917.67,Ken,Metal Striking Metal]
1917.74,1919.67,Ken,
1952.94,1954.77,Ken,Welcome to my world.
1954.84,1956.78,Ken,I hope you like it.
1961.05,1962.98,Ken,You're never leaving.
1969.12,1972.49,Xander,Let me ask... How long did it
1969.12,1972.49,Xander,take you to forget me?
1972.56,1974.08,Xander,Were you still taxiing
1972.56,1974.08,Xander,down the runway.
1974.16,1975.65,Xander,or was it actually
1974.16,1975.65,Xander,in the cab?
1975.73,1977.16,Cordelia,Oh. Yeah! Mr. Faithful?!
1977.23,1979.83,Cordelia,You probably met up with some
1977.23,1979.83,Cordelia,hot little Inca mummy girl.
1979.9,1981.66,Cordelia,Yeah. I heard about her.
1981.74,1983.2,Ken,
1983.33,1985.3,Willow,Aah! Help!
1985.37,1987,Cordelia,Aah!
1996.21,1997.51,Cordelia,Xander!
2018.14,2022.23,Buffy,Oh. Unh...
2024.47,2025.74,Buffy,Lily...
2027.31,2030.75,Lily,Always knew
2027.31,2030.75,Lily,I would come here...
2030.81,2032.41,Lily,sooner or later.
2034.82,2036.91,Lily,I knew I belonged here.
2036.99,2039.05,Buffy,Where?
2039.12,2041.11,Lily,Hell.
2041.19,2043.18,Buffy,This isn't hell.
2043.26,2045.23,Ken,Isn't it?
2045.3,2046.89,Buffy,Unh...
2046.96,2048.69,Ken,What is hell
2048.77,2050.46,Ken,but the total
2048.77,2050.46,Ken,absence of hope?
2050.53,2052.26,Ken,The substance.
2052.34,2055.2,Ken,the tactile proof of despair.
2055.27,2056.53,Ken,You're right. Lily.
2056.61,2058.8,Ken,This is where you've
2056.61,2058.8,Ken,been heading all your life.
2058.88,2060.37,Ken,Just like Rickie.
2060.44,2061.64,Lily,Rickie...
2061.71,2063.2,Ken,He forgot you.
2063.28,2065.37,Ken,Well. It took him a long time.
2065.45,2066.71,Ken,He remembered your name
2066.78,2069.41,Ken,years after he'd
2066.78,2069.41,Ken,forgotten his own.
2069.49,2071.72,Ken,But in the end...
2071.79,2072.81,Lily,Years?
2072.89,2073.88,Lily,But...
2073.96,2076.15,Ken,Oh. Interesting thing...
2076.23,2080.13,Ken,Time moves more quickly here
2076.23,2080.13,Ken,than in your reality.
2080.2,2082.06,Ken,A hundred long years
2080.2,2082.06,Ken,will pass here.
2082.13,2085.33,Ken,On Earth...
2082.13,2085.33,Ken,it's just a day.
2085.4,2089.9,Buffy,So you just work us till we're
2085.4,2089.9,Buffy,too old and spit us back out.
2089.97,2093,Ken,That's the plan.
2093.08,2094.67,Ken,See. Lily.
2094.75,2097.68,Ken,you'll die of old age
2097.75,2100.24,Ken,before anyone wonders where
2097.75,2100.24,Ken,you went. Not that anyone will.
2100.32,2101.94,Ken,That's why we chose you.
2102.02,2104.11,Buffy,You didn't choose me.
2104.19,2105.52,Ken,No.
2105.59,2106.68,Ken,But...
2106.76,2108.35,Ken,I know you...
2108.43,2110.36,Ken,Anne. Heh.
2110.43,2112.26,Ken,So afraid.
2112.33,2115.7,Ken,So pathetically
2112.33,2115.7,Ken,determined to run away
2115.77,2118.63,Ken,from whatever it is
2115.77,2118.63,Ken,you used to be.
2118.7,2121.87,Ken,to disappear.
2121.94,2123.43,Ken,Congratulations.
2125.51,2130.02,Ken,You got your wish.
2136.62,2137.88,Guard,Guard: You work...
2137.95,2139.05,Guard,and you live.
2139.12,2141.09,Guard,That is all.
2141.16,2144.86,Guard,You do not complain or laugh
2141.16,2144.86,Guard,or do anything besides work.
2144.93,2147.23,Guard,Whatever you thought.
2147.3,2149.82,Guard,whatever you were
2147.3,2149.82,Guard,does not matter.
2149.9,2152.13,Guard,You are no one now.
2152.2,2154.36,Guard,You mean nothing.
2157.74,2159.17,Guard,Who are you?
2159.24,2160.64,Aaron,Aaron.
2167.25,2168.88,Guard,Who are you?
2170.12,2171.14,Lily,No one.
2174.42,2175.36,Guard,Who are you?
2175.43,2177.48,Lily,No one.
2181.26,2182.99,Guard,Who are you?
2185.27,2186.53,Buffy,I'm Buffy.
2186.6,2190.02,Buffy,The vampire slayer.
2186.6,2190.02,Buffy,And you are...?
2188.07,2189.5,Buffy,Raaagghh!
2195.85,2198.18,Buffy,Anyone who's not
2195.85,2198.18,Buffy,having fun here.
2198.25,2199.22,Buffy,follow me.
2217.15,2221.59,Buffy,Buffy: There's no way we can get back
2217.15,2221.59,Buffy,up there without meeting new people.
2221.66,2225.59,Buffy,OK. Lily.
2221.66,2225.59,Buffy,when those guards leave.
2225.66,2227.6,Buffy,and they will leave.
2227.66,2230.79,Buffy,I want you to take these people
2227.66,2230.79,Buffy,and get them up there. OK?
2230.87,2233.23,Buffy,Fast and quiet.
2233.3,2235.03,Lily,You're leaving me? But...
2235.11,2236.37,Buffy,Lily...
2236.44,2238.53,Buffy,you can handle this.
2238.61,2240.2,Buffy,Cause I say so.
2242.11,2246.55,Buffy,We've gone public.
2242.11,2246.55,Buffy,Quick. Get them up. Go! Quiet!
2246.62,2248.61,Lily,I'm sorry I said
2246.62,2248.61,Lily,this was your fault before.
2248.69,2250.05,Buffy,Lily. This can wait.
2250.12,2251.38,Lily,Well. In case we die...
2251.45,2252.89,Buffy,Go! Go!
2287.22,2288.61,Guard,Come on. Come on!
2288.61,2290.09,Lily,Everybody go! Run!
2305.14,2307.54,Ken,Humans don't fight back.
2307.61,2307.61,Lily,
2307.61,2310.41,Ken,Humans don't fight back!
2312.72,2315.15,Ken,That's how this works!
2324.83,2327.06,Ken,Get down there!
2371.67,2373.11,Ken,
2373.18,2374.7,Ken,
2390.63,2393.56,Ken,Ken: One of you fights...
2395.4,2397.06,Ken,and you all die!
2400.7,2401.8,Ken,That...
2401.87,2402.96,Ken,was not...
2403.04,2404.77,Ken,permitted.
2404.84,2406.74,Buffy,Yeah. But it was fun.
2408.31,2410.07,Ken,You've got guts.
2410.15,2413.31,Ken,I think I'd like to slice you open
2410.15,2413.31,Ken,and play with them.
2414.72,2416.62,Ken,Let everyone know!
2416.69,2419.09,Ken,This is the price
2419.16,2420.25,Ken,of rebellio...
2420.32,2423.59,Ken,Aaagh!
2444.68,2446.44,Lily,They'll be coming.
2447.68,2448.88,Buffy,Unh! Unh!
2450.52,2451.78,Buffy,OK...
2451.86,2453.05,Buffy,this works...
2453.12,2455.11,Buffy,the abs...
2455.19,2456.78,Buffy,and the glutes. Unh!
2460.7,2464.9,Buffy,Ohh. I'm gonna feel this
2460.7,2464.9,Buffy,for a week.
2464.97,2466.2,Buffy,Raaagghh!
2467.27,2470.14,Buffy,Aahaahaaaah!
2470.21,2473.97,Buffy,Yaaaaggghhh!
2487.72,2490.66,Ken,You've ruined...
2490.73,2491.82,Ken,You've...

2493.1,2494.65,Buffy,wanna see my impression
2494.65,2495.33,Lily,of Gandhi?
2502.11,2503.7,Lily,Gandhi?
2503.77,2505.54,Buffy,Well. You know.
2505.61,2507.2,Buffy,if he was really pissed off.
2513.78,2515.38,Lily,Ooh!
2518.96,2520.72,Lily,What do we do about...?
2530.51,2532.27,Buffy,Let me give you the tour.
2535.52,2537.61,Buffy,This concludes our tour.
2539.02,2542.45,Lily,It's really nice.
2542.52,2545.46,Buffy,All the rent's paid up
2542.52,2545.46,Buffy,for the next 3 weeks.
2545.53,2548.29,Buffy,I spoke to Mitch at the diner.
2551.86,2554.63,Buffy,He said you can start
2551.86,2554.63,Buffy,on Thursday.
2554.7,2556.79,Buffy,He's. Uh...
2556.87,2559.13,Buffy,He's kind of... repulsive.
2559.21,2562.64,Buffy,but. Uh. He won't give you
2559.21,2562.64,Buffy,a hard time.
2566.05,2567.67,Buffy,Um...
2567.75,2570.81,Buffy,I'll call and
2567.75,2570.81,Buffy,check up on you.

2575.56,2579.89,Lily,great at taking
2575.56,2579.89,Lily,care of myself.
2581.39,2583.66,Buffy,Gets easier.
2583.73,2585.66,Buffy,Takes practice.
2594.57,2595.97,Lily,Hey...
2598.91,2601.21,Lily,Can I be "Anne"?
