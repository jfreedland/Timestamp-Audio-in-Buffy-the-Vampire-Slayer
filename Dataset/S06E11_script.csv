2.08,2.96,GILES VOICEOVER,Previously:
3.08,4.23,SPIKE VOICEOVER,Last night changed things.
4.36,7.08,BUFFY,The only thing different
4.36,7.08,BUFFY,is that I'm disgusted with myself.
7.2,8.43,DAWN,Is this the way to the movies?
9.16,10.31,DAWN,What is this place?
10.44,11.76,WILLOW,I'll just be a minute.
11.88,12.59,WILLOW,Willow and Dawn
12.59,13.92,BUFFY,have been missing for hours.
14.04,15.57,DAWN,Do you know how long I've been here?
15.57,16.47,WILLOW,Let's get outta here.
18.4,20.6,WILLOW,"Dawnie, I'm sorry!"
20.72,22.12,BUFFY,You could have killed her!
22.12,22.76,WILLOW,I need help.
23.68,25.59,WILLOW,No more spells. I'm finished.
28.6,29.02,WARREN,Got it.
29.02,29.92,JONATHAN,It's beautiful.
30.04,31.87,WARREN,Phase one of the plan is now complete.

35.02,39.07,WARREN,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
43.56,46.36,DAWN,Candles? We can't have candles?
46.48,49.92,BUFFY,"Dawn, it's a magic clearance."
46.48,49.92,BUFFY,Everything must go.
50.04,52.47,DAWN,But they're just candles.
53.68,56.2,BUFFY,"Well, to you and me they're just candles,"
56.24,59.92,BUFFY,but to witches they're like bongs.
64.02,65.07,BUFFY,"So, no candles, no charms, no..."
65.2,66.13,WILLOW,Bird.
66.13,67.63,BUFFY,No bird?
68.32,71.84,WILLOW,The peacock on the table.
68.32,71.84,WILLOW,It has two crystals in it.
74.92,78.23,BUFFY,Tara left them.
79.84,82.27,BUFFY,I'll make sure she gets them.
87.24,90.71,BUFFY,"Dawn, can you grab the fertility god statue"
87.24,90.71,BUFFY,on the desk over there?
90.84,93.75,DAWN,Kokopelli? No! I love him.
93.88,96,DAWN,And he was Mom's.
97.44,100.19,DAWN,Why do we have to get rid of
97.44,100.19,DAWN,so many things I like?
100.32,104.6,BUFFY,"Dawn, I explained this to you."
100.32,104.6,BUFFY,Willow has a problem.
104.72,108.43,BUFFY,The next few weeks are gonna be
104.72,108.43,BUFFY,crazy hard on her as it is.
108.56,112.39,BUFFY,Any reminder of what it is
108.56,112.39,BUFFY,that she's trying to stay away from
112.52,115.27,BUFFY,could cause her to give in to temptation.
124.4,126.68,BUFFY,And that would be bad.
141.8,146.67,WARREN,"OK, that's it. It's finally done."
141.8,146.67,WARREN,"It still needs a trial run, but it's..."
146.8,148.24,JONATHAN,Kinda clunkylookin'.
148.24,148.6,WARREN,What?
148.72,152.19,ANDREW,I pictured something cooler.
148.72,152.19,ANDREW,"More ILM, less Ed Wood."
152.32,155.28,WARREN,You wanna see cool? I'll show you cool.
171.08,172.91,JONATHAN,Mama!
174.96,177.39,JONATHAN,Did it...? Is it...?
177.52,179.08,ANDREW,Yeah.
192.92,195.24,JONATHAN,I'd call that a successful test.
195.24,197.55,WARREN,"Well, that's just half the test."
197.68,199.16,JONATHAN,Hey!
204.84,205.69,JONATHAN,You penis!
205.69,207.04,WARREN,"Cheer up, Frodo."
207.16,211.44,WARREN,"Thanks to my brains and our mystical gem,"
207.16,211.44,WARREN,we got an invisibility ray.
211.56,214.55,WARREN,And I'd say that makes us
211.56,214.55,WARREN,pretty much unstoppable.
267.96,272.35,BUFFY,"Dawn, come on. You gotta eat breakfast."
267.96,272.35,BUFFY,Xander's gonna be here any second.
272.48,275.07,BUFFY,She's gonna be late for school again.
279.6,281.13,BUFFY,How are you doing?
281.13,281.72,WILLOW,I'm OK.
281.84,286.96,WILLOW,"Not ""ready to head back to classes,"
281.84,286.96,WILLOW,"face the world"" OK,"
287.08,289.64,WILLOW,but the shakiness is only semi now.
289.76,295.15,WILLOW,I thought I'd spend the day fishing the Net
289.76,295.15,WILLOW,for more poop on the stolen diamond.
295.28,297.56,BUFFY,I called you before.
297.68,299.99,DAWN,Didn't hear you.
300.12,303.16,WILLOW,"Dawnie, I'm making you a nice omelette."
303.28,305.19,DAWN,Not hungry.
305.32,307.36,BUFFY,"Dawn, you need to eat something."
307.48,309.79,DAWN,Thanks for your concern.
312.84,317.28,WILLOW,"OK, I deserve the wrath of Dawn,"
312.84,317.28,WILLOW,but why is she taking it out on you?
318.64,321,BUFFY,Because I let it happen.
321.12,323.06,WILLOW,"Buffy, I was the one who..."
323.06,325.43,BUFFY,Who was drowning. My best friend.
326.68,329.96,BUFFY,I was too wrapped up
326.68,329.96,BUFFY,in my own dumb life to even notice.
339.08,340.04,SPIKE,Morning.
340.8,343.79,BUFFY,What are you doing? And here?
344.32,348,SPIKE,Just took a stroll.
344.32,348,SPIKE,Found myself in your neck of the woods.
348.76,351.96,BUFFY,Couldn't find a less flammable
348.76,351.96,BUFFY,time of day to take a stroll?
352.08,354.55,SPIKE,"Well, the fact is my lighter's gone missing."
354.68,356.83,SPIKE,Thought I might've dropped it here.
356.96,358.95,BUFFY,Haven't seen it.
359.68,363.04,WILLOW,I'm gonna head back
359.68,363.04,WILLOW,"to my room, get dressed."
370.56,371.44,BUFFY,Lame.
371.44,372.31,SPIKE,What?
372.44,374.51,BUFFY,You. Making up excuses.
374.64,378.92,SPIKE,"Don't flatter yourself, love."
374.64,378.92,SPIKE,Bloody fond of that lighter.
379.04,382.24,BUFFY,Stop trying to see me.
379.04,382.24,BUFFY,And stop calling me that.
385.2,388.56,SPIKE,"So, what should I call you then?"
389.84,391.4,SPIKE,Pet?
392.24,393.47,SPIKE,Sweetheart?
394.68,396.99,SPIKE,My little Goldilocks?
402.02,403.39,SPIKE,I love this hair.
402.02,403.39,SPIKE,The way it bounces around when...
404.56,406.68,SPIKE,This flapjack's not ready to be flipped.
406.8,409.47,BUFFY,What the hell is that supposed to...?
413.16,415.23,BUFFY,Stop that.
415.36,417.19,XANDER,"Good Godfrey Cambridge, Spike!"
417.84,421.83,XANDER,Still trying to mack on Buffy?
417.84,421.83,XANDER,Wake up already. Never gonna happen!
421.96,424.35,XANDER,Only a complete loser
421.96,424.35,XANDER,would hook up with you.
424.48,428.71,XANDER,"Unless she's a simpleton like Harmony,"
424.48,428.71,XANDER,or a nut sack like Drusilla...
428.84,432.36,BUFFY,You really need to get Dawn
428.84,432.36,BUFFY,"off to school. Let's go fetch her, OK?"
432.48,435.07,BUFFY,"You can let yourself out, right, Spike?"
435.2,436.88,BUFFY,Dawn! Xander's here!
436.88,437.63,DAWN,I'm here.
437.76,440.07,BUFFY,You have everything?
437.76,440.07,BUFFY,"And after school, you..."
440.2,441.84,DAWN,"Yeah, yeah. Let's go, Xander."
441.84,443.43,BUFFY,You will come straight home?
443.56,448.32,DAWN,Sure. Maybe we can find some time
443.56,448.32,DAWN,for you to get me into another car accident.
449.12,451.38,MS. KROGER,Good morning. You must be Dawn.
451.38,452.48,BUFFY,May I help you?
452.6,456.64,MS. KROGER,"I'm Doris Kroger, from Social Services."
452.6,456.64,MS. KROGER,We had an appointment?
456.76,458.16,BUFFY,For Wednesday.
458.16,459.96,MS. KROGER,This is Wednesday.
462.4,464.79,BUFFY,"Right. Well, Dawn, you better..."
466.4,469.16,BUFFY,"And, Xander, you'll drive safely?"
469.16,470.08,XANDER,"Yes, ma'am."
471.72,473.79,MS. KROGER,"Little bit on the tardy side, isn't she?"
473.92,475.31,MS. KROGER,"Yeah, well, it's been"
475.31,477.44,BUFFY,"one of those mornings, you know?"
477.56,479.36,BUFFY,Come on in.
480.36,483.51,BUFFY,Sorry about the mess.
480.36,483.51,BUFFY,We're doing a little houseclean.
483.64,486.2,SPIKE,"So, we gonna chat this out, or what?"
488.84,492.23,BUFFY,Now's really not a good time.
488.84,492.23,BUFFY,I have company.
493.44,495.59,SPIKE,No worries. I'll wait.
496.64,499.39,MS. KROGER,"Ms Summers, if you"
496.64,499.39,MS. KROGER,and your boyfriend would like...
499.52,501.83,BUFFY,He's not...
501.96,504.79,BUFFY,Not my boyfriend. He's just a...
506.48,510.79,BUFFY,"Spike, this nice woman"
506.48,510.79,BUFFY,is from Social Services.
511.44,513.4,SPIKE,Right.
514.6,519.31,SPIKE,Buffy's a great mom.
514.6,519.31,SPIKE,She takes good care of her little sis.
519.64,524.95,SPIKE,"Like, when Dawn was hanging out too much"
519.64,524.95,SPIKE,"in my crypt, Buffy put a right stop to it."
525.68,527.8,MS. KROGER,"I'm sorry, did you say..."
527.8,529.91,BUFFY,Crib. Crib. He said crib.
530.04,533.64,BUFFY,You know kids today
530.04,533.64,BUFFY,and their buggin' street slang.
533.76,537.23,BUFFY,"Spike, didn't you have to go now,"
533.76,537.23,BUFFY,because of that thing?
537.36,539.51,SPIKE,"Thing, yeah. My blanket."
550.6,552.8,MS. KROGER,He sleeps here?
552.92,555.04,BUFFY,What? No! No.
555.16,557.47,BUFFY,"Oh, the blanket."
557.6,560.59,BUFFY,That's a security thing.
560.72,562.79,BUFFY,He has issues.
562.92,565.48,BUFFY,"Nope, just me and Dawn living here."
565.6,569.51,WILLOW,"Buffy, I'm not feeling hot,"
565.6,569.51,WILLOW,"so I'm gonna take a quick nap, OK?"
569.64,571.92,BUFFY,"OK, Will!"
573.2,577.99,BUFFY,That's Willow.
573.2,577.99,BUFFY,"She kinda lives here too, actually."
578.12,580.84,MS. KROGER,So you live with another woman?
580.96,584.27,BUFFY,"It's not a gay thing, you know."
584.4,587.2,BUFFY,"Well, she's gay, but we don't... gay."
587.32,589.75,BUFFY,Not that there's anything wrong with...
589.88,594.08,BUFFY,"I know what that looks like,"
589.88,594.08,BUFFY,but I swear it's not what it looks like.
594.2,596.24,BUFFY,It's magic weed.
596.36,598.32,BUFFY,It's not mine.
599.28,601.24,MS. KROGER,I think I've seen enough.
601.36,604,BUFFY,"No, actually,"
601.36,604,BUFFY,I really don't think that you have.
604.68,608.28,BUFFY,It's been kind of a bad time.
608.4,611.6,MS. KROGER,"It's been a bad time now for a while,"
608.4,611.6,MS. KROGER,"hasn't it, Ms Summers?"
611.72,614.68,MS. KROGER,Your sister's grades
611.72,614.68,MS. KROGER,"have fallen sharply in the last year,"
614.8,618.24,MS. KROGER,due in large part
614.8,618.24,MS. KROGER,to her frequent absences and lateness.
618.84,621.67,BUFFY,But there are good reasons.
618.84,621.67,BUFFY,I'm sure there are.
621.8,625.68,MS. KROGER,But my interest is in Dawn's welfare
621.8,625.68,MS. KROGER,and the stability of her home life 
625.8,630.24,MS. KROGER,something I'm just not convinced that an
625.8,630.24,MS. KROGER,unemployed young woman can provide.
630.36,632.43,BUFFY,I can. I do.
632.56,635.44,MS. KROGER,We'll just have to see
632.56,635.44,MS. KROGER,"about that then, won't we?"
635.56,639.95,MS. KROGER,I'm going to recommend
635.56,639.95,MS. KROGER,immediate probation in my report.
640.08,641.12,BUFFY,What does that mean?
641.24,644.31,MS. KROGER,It means that I'll be monitoring you
641.24,644.31,MS. KROGER,"very closely, Ms Summers."
644.44,646.72,MS. KROGER,And if I don't see
644.44,646.72,MS. KROGER,"that things are improving,"
646.84,650.36,MS. KROGER,I'll be forced to recommend that
646.84,650.36,MS. KROGER,you be stripped of your guardianship.
650.48,652.55,BUFFY,You can't do that.
654.6,659.23,MS. KROGER,"I do what is in Dawn's best interest,"
654.6,659.23,MS. KROGER,as should you.
660.12,662.48,MS. KROGER,Have a nice day.
670.02,670.28,SPIKE,"Didn't go well, huh?"
671.88,674.44,BUFFY,Why won't you go?
674.56,676.56,SPIKE,I just thought you'd want...
676.56,677.71,BUFFY,Get out of here!
684.64,687.03,SPIKE,"Just getting what I came for, love."
689.36,691.48,SPIKE,"So long, Goldilocks."
734.52,737.51,CLEO,"Well, I think I can work with this."
737.64,740.52,CLEO,What exactly would you like me to do?
740.64,743.52,BUFFY,Just make me different.
745.56,746.75,ANDREW,What if we get caught?
746.75,748.2,JONATHAN,No way. We'll be invisible.
748.32,750.03,JONATHAN,Plus their security's gotten lax.
750.03,752.11,WARREN,You should know. You've cased it enough.
753.48,755.68,WARREN,"OK, this is it."
755.8,758.68,WARREN,"Remember, we're professionals."
762.24,762.9,ANDREW,Slayer!
762.9,764.04,WARREN,What? Where?
764.16,766.2,ANDREW,There. Headed this way.
771.04,771.5,JONATHAN,Give it!
771.5,772.84,ANDREW,I need to be invisible!
772.96,775.39,JONATHAN,I need it more! Buffy can't see me!
775.52,778.08,WARREN,Watch it! Don't touch the...
787.64,788.71,ANDREW,Oopsie.
793.6,795.99,XANDER,What happened to Buffy? She's gone.
796.12,799.35,ANYA,She's right here.
796.12,799.35,ANYA,Table four. I put her with your family.
799.48,801.76,XANDER,Great. Except we don't hate Buffy.
801.88,803.92,XANDER,Let's put her back at table one.
804.04,805.63,ANYA,Where do I put D'Hoffryn?
805.63,807.48,XANDER,We're not inviting D'Hoffryn.
807.6,811.23,ANYA,"I have to, he's my exboss."
807.6,811.23,ANYA,You're inviting your work buddies.
811.36,812.96,INVISIBLE BUFFY,She's got a point.
812.96,814.11,XANDER,"Hey, Buffy..."
816.04,818.43,XANDER,Where are you?
818.56,820.68,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"At table four, apparently."
821.32,824.47,ANYA,"Well, that remains to be seen. Like you."
825.6,829.48,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Don't strain yourself looking, Xander."
825.6,829.48,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I'm Invisible Girl.
830.68,831.91,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Xander?
831.91,832.96,XANDER,Sorry!
833.76,837.8,XANDER,Her clothes are invisible too.
839.32,841.28,XANDER,"Buffy, how did this hap..."
842.12,844.68,XANDER,Wait a sec.
842.12,844.68,XANDER,Have you been feeling ignored lately?
844.8,848.79,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Yeah, ignored  I wish."
844.8,848.79,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"No, this isn't a Marcie deal."
848.92,851.75,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I left Main Street
848.92,851.75,INVISIBLE BUFFY,after getting my hair cut...
851.88,853.91,ANYA,You cut your hair?
853.91,854.47,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Yeah.
854.6,856.24,ANYA,Really? How short?
856.36,859.96,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"About up to here. If you could see my hand,"
856.36,859.96,INVISIBLE BUFFY,it's kind of above my shoulders.
860.08,862.96,ANYA,Sounds adorable!
860.08,862.96,ANYA,I was thinking of getting my hair cut...
863.08,866.47,XANDER,Can we get back to freaking out
863.08,866.47,XANDER,about noshow Buffy? This is serious.
866.6,869.48,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I know. It kinda fits the day I've had.
870.44,873.03,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Willow's still a wreck,"
870.44,873.03,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Dawn's mad at both of us,"
873.16,877.92,INVISIBLE BUFFY,and the social services lady put me through
873.16,877.92,INVISIBLE BUFFY,a wringer. Says she's gonna "watch" me.
878.04,882.59,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Like to see her try now. You know,"
878.04,882.59,INVISIBLE BUFFY,there may be an upside to nosee me.
882.72,886.23,XANDER,"Buff, did you see anyone"
882.72,886.23,XANDER,or anything suspicious...
886.26,890.2,XANDER,before you cleared up?
890.32,895,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Nope, didn't see nothin'."
890.32,895,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"See what I did there, with the eyeballs?"
896.12,898.55,ANYA,Why would anyone
896.12,898.55,ANYA,make her invisible anyway?
898.68,902.88,ANYA,An invisible slayer's gotta be way more
898.68,902.88,ANYA,effective than the standard variety.
905.02,905.36,XANDER,I'm less with the why
905.02,905.36,XANDER,and more with the how.
905.48,909.52,XANDER,"We get the how, then we got how to make"
905.48,909.52,XANDER,"her unseen sight seen again, right?"
909.64,911.28,INVISIBLE BUFFY,S all right!
911.4,913.28,XANDER,"Buffy, could you focus, please?"
913.4,916.28,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I am. This is kinda fun.
916.4,921.39,ANYA,"Well, it would help if we had a little bit"
916.4,921.39,ANYA,more to go on. Or anything to go on.
922.16,926.39,XANDER,I could go check the spot
922.16,926.39,XANDER,"where Buffy disappeared, snoop for clues."
927.24,929.23,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Yeah, right."
929.36,932.32,INVISIBLE BUFFY,You know what? I'm just gonna go for a walk.
932.44,933.19,XANDER,A walk?
933.19,935.35,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Yeah. Clear my head.
936.04,938.32,INVISIBLE BUFFY,You guys keep working
936.04,938.32,INVISIBLE BUFFY,on the whats and hows.
938.44,940.4,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Clear my head!
940.4,941.24,XANDER,Buffy!
945.92,950.31,ANYA,"Well, seems pretty obvious it's some"
945.92,950.31,ANYA,kind of spell that's done this to her.
950.44,951.67,XANDER,A spell from who?
951.8,956,XANDER,"You said it yourself, it makes no sense for"
951.8,956,XANDER,one of her enemies to make her invisible.
956.12,957.82,ANYA,Maybe it's a mistake.
957.82,959.27,XANDER,A magical mistake.
959.4,961.87,XANDER,Who'd be messing with that kind of pow...
977.36,978.68,XANDER,Willow.
978.68,980,WILLOW,Xander.
980.12,982,XANDER,How's it goin'?
982,982.63,WILLOW,Good.
983.52,988.44,WILLOW,I found out some stuff about
983.52,988.44,WILLOW,the diamond stolen from the museum.
988.56,993.11,WILLOW,It's called the llluminata. There's rumours
988.56,993.11,WILLOW,it has quasimystical quantum properties.
993.24,995.88,XANDER,"Willow, we need to talk."
998.02,999.04,WILLOW,"We are. Well, I'm talking"
998.02,999.04,WILLOW,and you're looking at me funny.
999.16,1001.59,XANDER,Is there something you wanna tell me?
1003.84,1006.35,WILLOW,It was nothing. I didn't slip.
1006.48,1010.39,XANDER,"Will, nobody's mad. Relapse is"
1006.48,1010.39,XANDER,"a part of recovery, we understand that."
1010.52,1013.35,XANDER,We just have to figure a way to fix it.
1013.48,1014.6,WILLOW,Fix what?
1014.6,1015.84,XANDER,Fix Buffy.
1016.24,1017.2,WILLOW,Buffy's broken?
1017.2,1019.36,XANDER,"Will, you know what I'm talkin'..."
1020.12,1022.4,XANDER,You don't know.
1023.24,1025.52,XANDER,Rhymes with blinvisible?
1025.84,1026.96,WILLOW,What?
1027.08,1029.8,XANDER,Buffy was leaving the haircutting place
1027.08,1029.8,XANDER,when she...
1029.92,1031.85,WILLOW,Buffy got her hair cut?
1031.85,1034.12,XANDER,"Yeah! Adorable, apparently."
1034.24,1037.23,XANDER,"I personally couldn't tell,"
1034.24,1037.23,XANDER,since she's all blinvisible.
1037.36,1039.83,WILLOW,And you think I have
1037.36,1039.83,WILLOW,something to do with this?
1039.96,1041.6,XANDER,No.
1043.32,1047.92,XANDER,"Will, your spells have caused weird stuff to"
1043.32,1047.92,XANDER,happen to each of us at one time or another.
1048.04,1050.1,XANDER,And let's not forget the recent forgetting.
1050.14,1051.91,WILLOW,I see.
1051.96,1055.59,WILLOW,"So now when anything nasty happens,"
1051.96,1055.59,WILLOW,I get conveniently blamed for it?
1055.72,1057.39,XANDER,No one's blaming.
1057.52,1061.59,WILLOW,So I guess it wouldn't matter
1057.52,1061.59,WILLOW,"if I just jump off the wagon completely,"
1061.72,1064.15,WILLOW,since you already think
1061.72,1064.15,WILLOW,I'm making pit stops.
1064.28,1066.67,XANDER,If you say you didn't do it...
1066.8,1068.36,XANDER,"Willow, where you going?"
1068.36,1069.08,WILLOW,For a walk.
1073.76,1077.15,WARREN,Couple of circuits are burned out
1073.76,1077.15,WARREN,and the wiring's all fried.
1077.28,1079.16,ANDREW,But we had so many plans.
1079.28,1081.04,ANDREW,"Naked women, and all..."
1081.04,1083.03,JONATHAN,"well, all the naked women."
1083.16,1085.03,ANDREW,It's your fault. If you hadn't grabbed it...
1085.03,1087.36,JONATHAN,"We got bigger problems, bonehead."
1087.48,1089.52,JONATHAN,The Slayer's invisible now?
1089.64,1094.95,ANDREW,He's right. She could be anywhere.
1089.64,1094.95,ANDREW,"Even here, right now."
1095.96,1099.4,ANDREW,"Watching, listening to every word we say."
1099.52,1102.51,ANDREW,"For all we know, she could be one of us."
1106.84,1109.04,ANDREW,"No, wait, guys, that isn't true."
1109.16,1111.44,WARREN,I wouldn't sweat the Slayer too much.
1111.56,1116.16,JONATHAN,"Says you. In my book, an invisible slayer"
1111.56,1116.16,JONATHAN,means a whole world of trouble.
1123.24,1126.55,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I am the ghost of fashion victims past.
1126.68,1129.07,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Studded caps? Not a good idea.
1130.6,1132.96,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I'm doing you a favour!
1136.2,1138.16,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Nah. Too easy.
1145.24,1146.96,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"So long, copper!"
1148.48,1150.44,COP,That's mine! Stop!
1158.02,1157.96,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Hello, Mrs Kroger."
1180.2,1182.48,MS. KROGER,What? Where's my...
1187.8,1189.79,MS. KROGER,Losing my mind.
1200.44,1202.56,MS. KROGER,"OK, who's the..."
1205.8,1208.31,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Kill. Kill. Kill.
1208.44,1209.19,MS. KROGER,What?
1209.84,1211.98,COWORKER,I didn't say anything.
1211.98,1213.63,MS. KROGER,Not you. The mug.
1219.44,1221.91,MS. KROGER,But I heard something.
1224.96,1227.6,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Kill, Doris. Kill everybody."
1227.72,1229.14,INVISIBLE BUFFY,You know you want to.
1229.14,1231.24,MS. KROGER,"Shut up, shut up! Just shut up!"
1240.72,1243.84,INVISIBLE BUFFY,OK. No... No...
1245.56,1247.52,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Yahtzee!
1257.56,1259.12,BOSS,Doris.
1259.24,1262.95,BOSS,"I've got a few, so if you wanna"
1259.24,1262.95,BOSS,discuss that case file now.
1263.08,1268.47,MS. KROGER,"What? Oh, yes, the Summers file."
1263.08,1268.47,MS. KROGER,It's right over here.
1271.76,1276.3,MS. KROGER,"It's a 15yearold girl, living"
1271.76,1276.3,MS. KROGER,under her sister's guardianship.
1276.33,1277.04,MS. KROGER,The house is a complete...
1277.16,1280.79,BOSS,What is this? "All work and no play
1277.16,1280.79,BOSS,make Doris a dull girl"?
1280.92,1281.26,MS. KROGER,What?
1281.26,1283.67,BOSS,All work and no play make Doris... "
1283.8,1286.44,BOSS,The pages are filled with it.
1290.4,1292.63,MS. KROGER,I didn't do this.
1294.16,1296.17,MS. KROGER,It was the voice.
1296.17,1297.36,BOSS,Excuse me?
1297.48,1301.76,MS. KROGER,There was a voice before.
1297.48,1301.76,MS. KROGER,It made my coffee dance.
1301.88,1304.59,MS. KROGER,It told me to...
1304.59,1305.95,BOSS,To what?
1307.96,1309.76,MS. KROGER,Nothing.
1310.64,1313.79,BOSS,"Doris, take the rest of the day off."
1313.92,1315.11,BOSS,See your doctor.
1315.11,1316.59,MS. KROGER,What about my cases?
1316.72,1319,BOSS,We'll put someone else on them.
1319.12,1322.16,BOSS,And have them redo the Summers interview.
1322.28,1325.88,MS. KROGER,I'm not crazy. I am not crazy.
1337.12,1339.68,XANDER,"Hey, Will. Whatcha doin'?"
1340.76,1344.39,WILLOW,I figured out this was where Buffy
1340.76,1344.39,WILLOW,"disappeared from what you told me,"
1344.52,1347.24,WILLOW,so don't start jumpin' to any conclusions.
1347.36,1349.75,XANDER,"No jumpin'. Look, feet firmly planted."
1351.8,1354.68,WILLOW,I'm not feeling like myself right now.
1351.8,1354.68,WILLOW,Sorry.
1354.8,1356.76,XANDER,Me too. Sorry.
1357.72,1359.68,XANDER,"So, what have we found out so far?"
1359.8,1361.28,WILLOW,Take a look at that!
1361.4,1365.36,WILLOW,Something sped outta here pretty damn quick
1361.4,1365.36,WILLOW,to make that kind of tread mark.
1365.48,1367.98,XANDER,This could have been made any time.
1367.98,1369.55,WILLOW,"Yeah, but this wasn't."
1371.72,1372.76,XANDER,What is it?
1372.88,1375.18,WILLOW,Paint that I scraped off the fire hydrant.
1375.18,1376.16,XANDER,What fire hydrant?
1377.76,1380.04,WILLOW,That one.
1380.16,1383.28,WILLOW,Whatever hit this hydrant
1380.16,1383.28,WILLOW,hit it after it was made invisible.
1383.4,1389.16,WILLOW,Betcha by golly wow that something was the
1383.4,1389.16,WILLOW,same something that shot out of that alley.
1389.28,1391.95,XANDER,Black paint? Buffy's phantom van.
1392.68,1394.72,XANDER,We need to let Buffy...
1394.84,1397.67,XANDER,There's something there.
1399.4,1402.87,WILLOW,It's a pylon 
1399.4,1402.87,WILLOW,one of those orange traffic cones.
1405.02,1404.96,WILLOW,You should take it to the Magic Box.
1405.08,1407.88,WILLOW,It might help you and Anya
1405.08,1407.88,WILLOW,figure out what spell was used.
1410.02,1410.87,XANDER,What about you?
1410.87,1413.15,WILLOW,I got paint scrapings and the tyre mark.
1413.28,1416.4,WILLOW,I'm gonna find this van
1413.28,1416.4,WILLOW,that's been stalking Buffy.
1416.52,1418.67,WILLOW,"By the way, where is Buffy?"
1420.24,1423.52,WOMAN ON TV,"Oh, my God, the blood!"
1420.24,1423.52,WOMAN ON TV,Look at all the blood!
1449.32,1453.55,SPIKE,"Whatever beastie you are,"
1449.32,1453.55,SPIKE,I know you're here. And I hurt beasties.
1455.16,1456.59,SPIKE,Watch it.
1459.92,1464.07,SPIKE,"A ghost, is it?"
1459.92,1464.07,SPIKE,"Go and haunt the living, like a good spook."
1485.24,1485.75,SPIKE,Buffy?
1485.75,1488.63,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"I told you, stop trying to see me."
1494.96,1496.03,ANYA,I got it!
1496.03,1496.87,XANDER,Really?
1499.02,1499.23,ANYA,We'll put D'Hoffryn at your parents' table
1499.36,1503.07,ANYA,and move your Uncle Rory
1499.36,1503.07,ANYA,to a table five near the bar.
1503.92,1507.15,XANDER,"An, honey, we're looking"
1503.92,1507.15,XANDER,for invisibility spells here.
1507.28,1509.71,ANYA,Obviously I haven't found anything yet.
1509.84,1514.07,ANYA,"At least, nothing that would explain"
1509.84,1514.07,ANYA,why things near Buffy become invisible.
1516.4,1517,ANYA,Xander.
1517,1518.2,XANDER,What happened?
1518.32,1522.52,ANYA,"An unpleasant tactile experience,"
1518.32,1522.52,ANYA,like putting my hand in pudding.
1526.32,1529.92,ANYA,"Like pudding, am I right?"
1526.32,1529.92,ANYA,Rice or tapioca  lumpy like that.
1530.04,1532.24,XANDER,We have to find Buffy. She's gotta know.
1532.36,1534.72,ANYA,I don't think Buffy will be
1532.36,1534.72,ANYA,broken up over a pylon.
1534.84,1538.8,XANDER,"Anya, whatever's happening to the pylon"
1534.84,1538.8,XANDER,will probably happen to her.
1538.92,1543.36,XANDER,"If we don't find Buffy... I mean, if we"
1538.92,1543.36,XANDER,don't figure out how this was done...
1543.48,1545.6,ANYA,She's pudding?
1550.68,1552.64,JONATHAN,"What do you mean, she'll fade away?"
1552.76,1555.48,WARREN,The Slayer got slammed
1552.76,1555.48,WARREN,with a bigass dose of radiation.
1555.6,1557.32,WARREN,Her cells are mutating.
1557.44,1561.48,WARREN,Eventually her molecular makeup
1557.44,1561.48,WARREN,will lose its integrity and then...
1561.6,1564.02,ANDREW,But wouldn't that kill her?
1564.02,1565.72,WARREN,Let me think. Yeah.
1565.84,1569.96,JONATHAN,Wait a minute. We're not killing anybody.
1565.84,1569.96,JONATHAN,Especially not Buffy.
1570.08,1572.56,WARREN,You guys are so immature. We're villains!
1572.59,1573.43,JONATHAN,When will you get that
1573.43,1574.31,WARREN,into your thick skulls?
1574.44,1576.87,JONATHAN,"We're not killers, we're crime lords!"
1576.87,1578.32,ANDREW,Yeah. Like Lex Luthor.
1578.44,1581.51,ANDREW,"He tries to take over Metropolis,"
1578.44,1581.51,ANDREW,but he doesn't kill Superman.
1581.64,1584.2,WARREN,"Because it's Superman's book, you moron!"
1584.32,1586.83,ANDREW,"But Lex doesn't kill him, does he?"
1587.84,1590.31,JONATHAN,"Listen, Warren, you get that ray working..."
1590.44,1592.87,JONATHAN,and the first thing we're gonna do
1590.44,1592.87,JONATHAN,is find Buffy and revisible her...
1592.91,1594.68,JONATHAN,before it's too late.
1598.02,1598.43,JONATHAN,You got me?
1598.56,1600.31,WARREN,Fine.
1603.4,1605.55,WARREN,Whatever you guys say.
1611.96,1613.79,XANDER,Spike?
1630.28,1632.51,XANDER,Spike?
1633.6,1635.56,XANDER,What are you doing?
1636.56,1641.55,SPIKE,"What does it look like I'm doing, you nit?"
1636.56,1641.55,SPIKE,"I'm exercising, aren't I?"
1643.36,1645.19,SPIKE,Exercising.
1645.32,1646.67,XANDER,Naked.
1646.8,1648.76,XANDER,In bed.
1649.44,1653.51,SPIKE,A man shouldn't use immortality
1649.44,1653.51,SPIKE,as an excuse to let himself go.
1653.64,1656.28,SPIKE,You gotta keep fit for the killing.
1658.76,1662.28,XANDER,Looks like you had a little trouble
1658.76,1662.28,XANDER,upstairs. Mini disaster area.
1662.4,1665.07,SPIKE,You come here
1662.4,1665.07,SPIKE,to criticise my housekeeping?
1665.48,1667.85,XANDER,"No, no. I'm looking for Buffy."
1667.85,1669.19,SPIKE,Haven't seen her.
1669.32,1673.11,XANDER,You wouldn't. She's come down
1669.32,1673.11,XANDER,with a slight case of invisibility.
1673.24,1675.36,SPIKE,Yeah? How did...?
1675.48,1677.55,XANDER,We don't know yet.
1678.12,1681.64,XANDER,"Anyway, she's not at the house,"
1678.12,1681.64,XANDER,"and I really, really need to find her."
1681.76,1685.83,SPIKE,"Tell you what, I'll take a peek around"
1681.76,1685.83,SPIKE,"first chance I get,"
1686.72,1691.19,SPIKE,"and if we bump into each other,"
1686.72,1691.19,SPIKE,I'll clue her that you're on the lookout.
1692.04,1695.19,XANDER,After your exercises.
1695.56,1697.87,SPIKE,"Yeah, right."
1699.88,1704.87,XANDER,"You know, kidding aside, Spike,"
1699.88,1704.87,XANDER,you really should get a girlfriend.
1707.68,1709.48,SPIKE,That was bloody stupid.
1709.6,1712.59,INVISIBLE BUFFY,What's the matter?
1709.6,1712.59,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Ashamed to be seen with me?
1712.72,1716.71,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Come on. He had no idea I was here.
1712.72,1716.71,INVISIBLE BUFFY,This is perfect.
1717.56,1719.44,SPIKE,Perfect for you.
1719.56,1724.08,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Well, picture me confused."
1719.56,1724.08,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I thought this is what you wanted.
1724.2,1726.16,SPIKE,What I want...
1730.36,1733.8,SPIKE,This vanishing act's
1730.36,1733.8,SPIKE,"right liberating for you, innit?"
1733.92,1736.72,SPIKE,Go anywhere you want.
1733.92,1736.72,SPIKE,Do anything you want.
1737.56,1738.25,SPIKE,Or anyone.
1738.25,1740.12,INVISIBLE BUFFY,What are you talking about?
1740.24,1742.91,SPIKE,The only reason you're here
1740.24,1742.91,SPIKE,is that you're not here.
1743.04,1746.11,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Of course. As usual,"
1743.04,1746.11,INVISIBLE BUFFY,there's something wrong with Buffy.
1746.24,1749.95,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"She came back all wrong. You know,"
1746.24,1749.95,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I didn't ask for this to happen to me.
1750.08,1752.15,SPIKE,"Not too put off by it though, are you?"
1752.28,1756.64,INVISIBLE BUFFY,No! Maybe cos for the first time since...
1752.28,1756.64,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I'm free.
1757.92,1760.12,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Free of rules and reports.
1761.12,1762.9,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Free of this life.
1762.9,1764.19,SPIKE,Free of life.
1764.32,1766.6,SPIKE,Got another name for that  dead.
1767.56,1771.44,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Why do you always have to...
1767.56,1771.44,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I thought we were having fun.
1771.88,1773.36,SPIKE,Yeah. Now.
1773.48,1778.08,SPIKE,But sooner or later your chums will work out
1773.48,1778.08,SPIKE,a way to bring you back to living colour.
1780.24,1785.63,SPIKE,You need to go. Get dressed if you can
1780.24,1785.63,SPIKE,"find your clothes, and push off."
1785.76,1788.35,SPIKE,"If I can't have all of you, I'd rather..."
1788.48,1789.44,SPIKE,That's cheating.
1824.72,1830,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I don't believe this.
1824.72,1830,INVISIBLE BUFFY,He threw me out? He threw me.
1830.56,1833.44,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Did I fall into some
1830.56,1833.44,INVISIBLE BUFFY,backward dimension here?
1833.56,1835.99,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Is this Bizarro World?
1836.12,1841.04,INVISIBLE BUFFY,And after he's always going on and on about
1836.12,1841.04,INVISIBLE BUFFY,being the only one that understands me.
1841.16,1845.84,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"We're alike, you and me."
1841.16,1845.84,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Birds of a bloody feather. "
1847.84,1850.23,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I'm walking here!
1850.68,1852.83,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Insensitive. That's what he is.
1858.84,1861.07,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Willow? Willow?
1862.92,1864.11,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Dawn?
1864.24,1867.6,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Dawn, come here."
1864.24,1867.6,INVISIBLE BUFFY,You wanna see somethin' neat?
1888.32,1889.97,INVISIBLE BUFFY,There you are!
1889.97,1892.44,DAWN,Buffy? Where are you?
1893.32,1895.99,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I'm invisible. Check this out.
1898.8,1902.16,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Unidentified flying pizza,"
1898.8,1902.16,INVISIBLE BUFFY,comin' in for a landing.
1904.44,1905.75,DAWN,What are you talking...
1905.75,1907.51,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"OK, not the most clever ad lib."
1907.64,1909.91,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"But, come on, points for spontaneity!"
1909.91,1911.08,DAWN,Stop it! Just stop.
1911.2,1915.16,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Sorry, Dawn. I'm sorry."
1911.2,1915.16,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I didn't mean to freak you out.
1915.28,1918.11,DAWN,What did you think would happen?
1915.28,1918.11,DAWN,"You're invisible, Buffy."
1918.24,1921.44,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I know. Xander and Anya are on it.
1918.24,1921.44,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Muldering out what happened.
1921.56,1924.36,DAWN,What about you?
1921.56,1924.36,DAWN,Shouldn't you be working on it?
1924.48,1925.18,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Of course I...
1925.18,1927.04,DAWN,Do you even care who did this to you?
1927.16,1931.15,DAWN,Or if you're gonna be stuck this way?
1927.16,1931.15,DAWN,You're making jokes and flying pizzas.
1931.28,1932.12,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I don't think that's...
1932.12,1935.16,DAWN,I can't talk to you like
1932.12,1935.16,DAWN,this. I can't see you!
1935.28,1938.18,DAWN,How can I talk to you if I can't see you?
1938.18,1938.96,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Dawn! Dawn!
1946.24,1950.2,XANDER,"Buffy, it's Xander. Where are you?"
1946.24,1950.2,XANDER,We got a new problem here.
1950.32,1950.99,ANYA,Tell her.
1950.99,1951.8,XANDER,I'm trying.
1951.92,1954.39,XANDER,We think whatever made you invisible
1951.92,1954.39,XANDER,is killing you.
1954.52,1956.24,ANYA,Tell her about the pudding.
1956.24,1956.56,XANDER,Anya!
1956.68,1960.7,XANDER,"Buff, if this isn't reversed,"
1956.68,1960.7,XANDER,you're gonna...
1960.7,1964.71,XANDER,"well, dissolve, or fade into nothing."
2048.64,2049.91,WARREN,Now!
2052.8,2053.84,WILLOW,Let go of me!
2053.84,2057.19,INVISIBLE WARREN,Congratulations. You're our first hostage.
2063.6,2066.11,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Dawn, I'm going out to find Xander."
2063.6,2066.11,INVISIBLE BUFFY,If he calls...
2073.56,2074.36,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Xander?
2074.48,2077.6,JONATHAN,"Just listen, Slayer."
2074.48,2077.6,JONATHAN,You don't have a lot of time.
2077.72,2079.95,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Who is this? You sound familiar.
2080.08,2084.63,JONATHAN,I'm nobody. No one you know.
2080.08,2084.63,JONATHAN,"We've got your friend Willow,"
2084.76,2089.52,JONATHAN,and if you don't want anything nasty to
2084.76,2089.52,JONATHAN,"happen to her, you'd better meet us. Alone."
2089.64,2091.04,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Where?
2108.8,2110.87,INVISIBLE WARREN,Stay still and you won't get hurt.
2113.02,2112.87,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"You OK, Will?"
2112.87,2112.8,WILLOW,Buffy?
2112.92,2114.26,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Where are the bad guys?
2114.3,2116.52,INVISIBLE WARREN,"All round you, Slayer,"
2114.3,2116.52,INVISIBLE WARREN,so don't try anything.
2116.64,2119.63,WILLOW,"He's bluffing, Buffy."
2116.64,2119.63,WILLOW,"There's just three of them, I think."
2119.76,2123.07,INVISIBLE WARREN,More than enough to cause
2119.76,2123.07,INVISIBLE WARREN,"serious carnage, right, guys?"
2123.2,2124.24,INVISIBLE WARREN,Guys? Guys!
2124.24,2126.03,INVISIBLE JONATHAN,Kick! Use the kick!
2126.16,2129.39,INVISIBLE ANDREW,I tried. He blocks it
2126.16,2129.39,INVISIBLE ANDREW,with his drunkenmonkey fist!
2129.52,2131.48,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Scary video carnage.
2132.76,2133.71,INVISIBLE WARREN,Slayer's here.
2133.71,2135.19,INVISIBLE ANDREW,Sorry. Didn't see her.
2135.32,2138.63,INVISIBLE WARREN,Let's continue in a less crowded area.
2135.32,2138.63,INVISIBLE WARREN,Like over there.
2138.76,2139.63,ALL,Where?
2139.63,2141.07,INVISIBLE WARREN,Follow me.
2144.24,2146.88,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"I'm gonna guess,"
2144.24,2146.88,INVISIBLE BUFFY,you're the ones that did this to me?
2149.02,2148.88,INVISIBLE JONATHAN,It was an accident!
2148.88,2148.8,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Who's that?
2148.92,2149.92,INVISIBLE JONATHAN,Nobody you know.
2149.92,2152.36,WILLOW,They're the ones from your mystery van.
2152.48,2156.76,INVISIBLE BUFFY,You. So what annoying thing
2152.48,2156.76,INVISIBLE BUFFY,are you gonna do to me now?
2156.88,2158.6,INVISIBLE WARREN,Save your life. Make you visible.
2158.6,2159.95,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I'm meant to believe that?
2160.08,2163.6,WILLOW,"They told me everything, Buffy."
2160.08,2163.6,WILLOW,"Something's happening, you're..."
2163.72,2165.52,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Fading away. I know.
2165.52,2166.87,INVISIBLE WARREN,I can fix that.
2169.02,2169.44,INVISIBLE WARREN,Pick up that airhockey mallet.
2169.44,2169.56,INVISIBLE BUFFY,What for?
2169.68,2171.72,INVISIBLE WARREN,It'll give me a target to aim at.
2173.76,2176.51,INVISIBLE WARREN,Now hold still
2173.76,2176.51,INVISIBLE WARREN,and all your troubles will soon be gone.
2176.64,2178.53,WILLOW,You're on the wrong setting.
2178.53,2178.87,INVISIBLE WARREN,What?
2181.02,2182.28,WILLOW,The gun  it's not set
2181.02,2182.28,WILLOW,for reversing the particle ionisation.
2182.4,2185.12,WILLOW,It'll accelerate her molecular dissolution!
2185.24,2186.9,INVISIBLE WARREN,Mind your own business.
2186.9,2188.2,INVISIBLE JONATHAN,What's she saying?
2188.32,2189.99,WILLOW,"Buffy, he's trying to kill you!"
2190.12,2191.44,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Willow!
2193.24,2194.41,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"OK, playtime's over."
2194.41,2196.04,INVISIBLE WARREN,"You haven't won yet, Slayer."
2196.16,2196.82,INVISIBLE WARREN,No. That comes
2196.82,2198.36,INVISIBLE BUFFY,after I beat the snot out of you.
2198.48,2202.08,INVISIBLE WARREN,You'll have to find me first. There's
2198.48,2202.08,INVISIBLE WARREN,"three of us, against just one of you."
2202.2,2203.11,INVISIBLE JONATHAN,You lied to us.
2203.11,2204.27,INVISIBLE ANDREW,Fight her yourself.
2204.4,2206.09,INVISIBLE WARREN,"I go down, we all go down!"
2206.09,2208.23,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"I promise, you're all going down."
2208.36,2213.12,INVISIBLE WARREN,"We may not have your powers, Slayer,"
2208.36,2213.12,INVISIBLE WARREN,but you'll find we are not so easy to...
2213.24,2214.28,INVISIBLE WARREN,Get her!
2224.08,2226.47,INVISIBLE JONATHAN,Wait a minute! Who's biting my leg?
2226.6,2228.74,INVISIBLE ANDREW,Sorry! Where is she?
2228.74,2229.27,INVISIBLE BUFFY,Here.
2236.2,2239.16,INVISIBLE WARREN,She can't find us if we split up.
2239.28,2240.21,INVISIBLE WARREN,You go that way.
2240.21,2240.79,INVISIBLE JONATHAN,Which way?
2240.92,2242.88,INVISIBLE WARREN,That way! Over...
2243.68,2245.83,INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Just keep talking, boys."
2248.68,2250.55,INVISIBLE JONATHAN,Watch the chest hair!
2250.55,2253.04,INVISIBLE BUFFY,I know that voice. You're...
2254.76,2255.99,BUFFY,Jonathan?
2256.12,2258.27,BUFFY,You have chest hair?
2260.64,2262.55,BUFFY,Warren?
2267.2,2268.79,BUFFY,Who are you?
2268.79,2269.71,ANDREW,Andrew.
2271.08,2275.28,ANDREW,I summoned the flying monkeys
2271.08,2275.28,ANDREW,that attacked the high school?
2280.16,2281.57,ANDREW,During the school play?
2281.57,2282.91,WARREN,He's Tucker's brother.
2283.04,2285.4,JONATHAN,"Yeah, he's Tucker's brother."
2288.4,2292.63,BUFFY,"So you three have, what,"
2288.4,2292.63,BUFFY,banded together to be pains in my ass?
2293.04,2295.79,BUFFY,We're your archnemesises... ses.
2296.8,2302.24,,"You may have beaten us this time, Slayer,"
2296.8,2302.24,,but next time...
2303.24,2305.2,JONATHAN,Maybe not!
2307.88,2309.29,WARREN,It's locked? You were supposed to check it!
2309.38,2311.27,ANDREW,I forgot.
2312.48,2315.87,BUFFY,I give you my archnemesises... ses.
2318.02,2320.63,GUARD,What's goin' on in here? I got a bunch of
2318.02,2320.63,GUARD,scared kids saying this place is haunted!
2323.4,2325.07,WILLOW,"Oh, my God, Buffy!"
2325.2,2327.95,BUFFY,I know. They're gone.
2325.2,2327.95,BUFFY,I guess we should chase them.
2328.08,2331.12,WILLOW,"No, your hair! It is adorable."
2335.28,2337.71,BUFFY,"Pretty neat, you finding the van."
2339.12,2344.43,BUFFY,"So, how did you manage to do it exactly?"
2339.12,2344.43,BUFFY,"I mean, to locate it?"
2344.56,2347.63,WILLOW,The hard way. The spellfree way.
2347.76,2352.91,WILLOW,"The ""oh, my God, my head's gonna fall off,"
2347.76,2352.91,WILLOW,my feet are killing me" way.
2359.84,2362.88,WILLOW,I don't know how I got through this day.
2364.2,2369.51,BUFFY,The important thing is that you did.
2364.2,2369.51,BUFFY,It's a good first step.
2371.16,2373.99,WILLOW,"How are you doing, postinvisibleness?"
2375.68,2377.65,WILLOW,OK. I still have to do
2377.65,2381.04,BUFFY,some damage control from my giddyfest.
2384.02,2384.64,BUFFY,Dawn was pretty freaked out.
2384.76,2389.07,BUFFY,The whole "taking a vacation from me"
2384.76,2389.07,BUFFY,thing didn't work out too well.
2389.2,2391.16,WILLOW,Tell me about it.
2395.02,2397.23,BUFFY,"Except, when I got Xander's message "
2397.36,2400.24,BUFFY,"you know, that I was fading away "
2401.72,2404.63,BUFFY,I actually got scared.
2404.76,2407.19,WILLOW,Yeah. Who wouldn't?
2408.32,2411.31,WILLOW,Me. I wouldn't.
2412.96,2416.35,BUFFY,Not too long ago
2412.96,2416.35,BUFFY,I probably would have welcomed it.
2417.52,2419.48,BUFFY,But I realise...
2420.32,2424.47,BUFFY,I'm not saying that I'm doing
2420.32,2424.47,BUFFY,"backflips about my life, but..."
2425.88,2430.64,BUFFY,I didn't... I don't wanna die.
2432.96,2435.63,BUFFY,"That's something, right?"
2435.76,2438.12,WILLOW,It's something.
2440.84,2444.47,WILLOW,So I guess we both made good first steps.
2446.44,2448.4,,I guess.
2449.56,2452.84,,Yay for us.
