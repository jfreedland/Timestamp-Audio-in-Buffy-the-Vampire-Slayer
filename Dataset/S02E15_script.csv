9.37,12.22,,She is the Slayer.
27.84,28.11,,Hi.
28.11,31.03,Oz,"Oh, that's what I was gonna say."
31.6,33.14,Willow,What you lookin' at?
33.14,35.06,Oz,This cheerleading trophy.
35.09,38.61,Oz,It's like its eyes follow you
35.09,38.61,Oz,wherever you go.
41.02,41.36,Oz,I like it.
41.36,42.67,Willow,"So, did you like the movie last night?"
42.7,46.83,Willow,I don't know. Today's movies are
42.7,46.83,Willow,"kinda like... popcorn, you know?"
46.86,47.89,Willow,You forget about 'em
47.89,49.13,Oz,as soon as they're done.
49.17,54.02,Oz,I do remember
49.17,54.02,Oz,"I liked the popcorn, though."
52.05,53.9,Willow,"Yeah, it was good."
54.14,57.94,Willow,And I had a really fun time with the rest.
54.14,57.94,Willow,"I mean, the part with you."
58.53,61.45,Oz,"Well, that's great."
58.53,61.45,Oz,My time was also... of the good.
61.66,63.96,Willow,Mine too.
64,66.11,Willow,"Well, then..."
69.17,71.63,Willow,"Oh, there! I have..."
72.3,74.43,Willow,"my friend, so I will... go to her."
74.81,76.68,Oz,"I'll see you, then..."
77.21,79.19,Oz,Later.
79.22,81.03,Oz,Ohh...
82.32,86.22,Larry,Man! Oz!
82.32,86.22,Larry,I would love to get me some of that
86.26,88.58,Larry,Buffy and Willow action
86.26,88.58,Larry,if you know what I mean.
88.62,92.5,Oz,"That's great, Larry."
88.62,92.5,Oz,You've really mastered the single entendre.
94.84,95.66,Girl,Hey!
95.66,96.68,Larry,Oops.
98.6,101.02,Larry,"Oh, thank you, Thighmaster!"
103.61,106.52,Larry,"So, Oz, man, what's up with that?"
106.52,111.02,Larry,Dating a junior?
106.52,111.02,Larry,"Oh, let me guess."
109.04,115.02,Larry,"That little, innocent schoolgirl thing"
109.04,115.02,Larry,"is just, uh, just an act, right?"
113.04,116.89,Oz,"Yeah. Yeah, she's actually"
113.04,116.89,Oz,an evil mastermind. It's fun.
116.93,118.37,Oz,"I mean, she's gotta be puttin' out,"
118.37,119.19,Larry,or what's the point?
119.19,121.73,Larry,What are you gonna do? Talk?
123.02,126.04,Larry,"Come on, fess up. How far have you got?"
126.15,128.73,Willow,"Nowhere. I mean,"
126.15,128.73,Willow,he said he was gonna wait
128.76,131.37,Willow,"until I was ready, but I'm ready!"
131.4,133.42,Willow,"Honest, I'm good to go here."
133.67,138.02,Buffy,I think it's nice
133.67,138.02,Buffy,if he's not just being an animal.
136.17,138.48,Willow,It is nice. He's great!
138.51,141.43,Willow,We have a lot of fun.
138.51,141.43,Willow,But I want smoochies!
141.81,143.51,Buffy,Have you dropped any hints?
143.51,144.77,Willow,I've dropped anvils.
144.94,149.44,Buffy,"Oh, he'll come around. What guy"
144.94,149.44,Buffy,could resist your wily Willow charms?
149.47,152.45,Willow,"At last count, all of them,"
149.47,152.45,Willow,maybe more.
152.49,155.59,Buffy,None of them know a thing.
152.49,155.59,Buffy,They all get an F in Willow.
155.62,160.64,Willow,But I want Oz to get an A.
155.62,160.64,Willow,"And oh, one of those... gold stars."
160.68,161.43,Buffy,He will.
161.43,163.69,Willow,"Well, he'd better hurry."
163.73,168.09,Willow,I don't wanna be the only girl
163.73,168.09,Willow,in school without a real boyfriend.
169.99,172.87,Willow,"Oh, I'm such an idiot! I'm sorry."
173.12,175.95,Willow,I shouldn't even be talking about...
175.99,177.74,Willow,Do you want me to go away?
177.74,179.08,Buffy,I wish you wouldn't.
179.12,181.45,Willow,"How are you holding up, anyway?"
181.45,182.35,Buffy,I'm holding.
182.51,185.44,Buffy,I was going on two minutes there
182.51,185.44,Buffy,without thinking about Angel.
185.48,186.41,Willow,"Well, there you go!"
186.41,187.73,Buffy,But I would do a lot better
187.77,190.98,Buffy,if you and Xander and I could do that
187.77,190.98,Buffy,sharing our misery" thing tonight.
191.01,193.16,Willow,Great. I'll give Xander a call.
193.19,197.66,Willow,"What's his number? Oh, yeah,"
193.19,197.66,Willow,I'mDatingASkankyHo.
197.69,198.95,Buffy,Meow!
198.95,200.72,Willow,Really?
200.75,203.7,Willow,Thanks. I've never gotten
200.75,203.7,Willow,a "meow" before.
203.74,204.64,Buffy,Well deserved.
204.64,205.48,Willow,Darn tootin'!
205.52,210.55,Willow,"I'm just saying, Xander and Cordelia?"
205.52,210.55,Willow,"What does he see in her, anyway?"
213.2,215.84,Xander,What could she possibly see in him?
215.87,218.83,Cordelia,Excuse me?! We didn't come here
215.87,218.83,Cordelia,to talk about Willow.
218.87,221.58,Cordelia,We came here to do things
218.87,221.58,Cordelia,"I can never tell my father about,"
221.58,223.84,Cordelia,because he still thinks
221.58,223.84,Cordelia,I'm a... good girl.
223.88,226.87,Xander,I just don't trust Oz with her.
223.88,226.87,Xander,"I mean, he's a senior."
226.91,230.36,Xander,He's attractive.
226.91,230.36,Xander,"OK, maybe not to me, but..."
230.53,233.33,Xander,And he's in a band! And we know
230.53,233.33,Xander,what kind of element that attracts.
233.37,235.53,Cordelia,I've dated lots of guys in bands.
235.53,236.19,Xander,Thank you.
236.23,237.69,Cordelia,Do you even wanna be here?
237.69,238.87,Xander,I'm not running away.
238.91,240.83,Cordelia,Because when you're not babbling about
240.83,242.8,Xander,"poor defenseless Willow, you are raving"
242.84,247.05,Xander,about the allpowerful Buffy
242.84,247.05,Xander,I do not babble. I occasionally run on.
247.08,248.64,Xander,Every now and then I yammer.
248.64,249.03,Cordelia,Xander.
249.03,249.72,Xander,Yeah?
249.72,251.39,Cordelia,Look around.
251.43,254.75,Cordelia,We're in my daddy's car.
251.43,254.75,Cordelia,It's just the two of us.
254.79,258.08,Cordelia,"There is a beautiful,"
254.79,258.08,Cordelia,big full moon outside tonight.
258.12,262.04,Cordelia,It doesn't get more romantic than this.
258.12,262.04,Cordelia,So shut up!
326.29,331.48,Xander,b>"Phases"</b>
334.3,335.67,Xander,Did you hear that?
335.67,336.81,Cordelia,What is it now?
339.02,339.63,Xander,I thought I heard something.
339.63,340.39,Cordelia,Iis Willow sending out some sort of
340.43,341.61,Cordelia,distress signal
341.61,343.41,Xander,that only you can hear?
350.46,352.32,Xander,"OK, now I know I heard something!"
352.36,357.02,Cordelia,"All right, that's it! You know"
352.36,357.02,Cordelia,your mind hasn't been here all night.
355.04,357.07,Cordelia,How about I just drop you off...
358.1,359.98,Xander,Get us outta here!
360.43,361.89,Cordelia,I can't find the key!
361.89,363.98,Xander,We should be movin'! Let's go!
377.02,377.64,Xander,Told ya I heard somethin'.
381.27,383.3,Buffy,And you're sure it was a werewolf?
383.3,384.62,Xander,"Well, let's see, um..."
384.65,389.1,Xander,"Six feet tall, claws, a big old snout"
384.65,389.1,Xander,"in the middle of his face, like a wolf."
389.13,391.88,Xander,"Um, yeah,"
389.13,391.88,Xander,I'm stickin' with my first guess.
391.88,392.72,Oz,Seems wise.
392.72,393.94,Xander,"Oh, oh, and then"
393.98,395.71,Xander,there was that thing
393.98,395.71,Xander,where it tried to bite us.
395.74,397.44,Cordelia,It was so awful!
397.44,398.18,Xander,I know.
398.21,400.66,Cordelia,Daddy just had this car detailed!
401.31,402.22,Buffy,"So, what's the word?"
402.22,403.58,Giles,"Well, it seems there were, uh,"
403.61,406.51,Giles,a number of other attacks
403.61,406.51,Giles,by a "wild dog" around town.
406.55,408.93,Giles,Several animal carcasses
406.55,408.93,Giles,were found mutilated.
408.96,412.07,Willow,You mean like bunnies and stuff?
408.96,412.07,Willow,"No, don't tell me."
412.11,414.2,Oz,"Oh, don't worry."
412.11,414.2,Oz,"I mean, they might not look it,"
414.24,416.73,Oz,but bunnies can really
414.24,416.73,Oz,take care of themselves.
416.77,418.21,Willow,Yeah.
416.77,418.21,Willow,Yeah.
418.25,422.03,Giles,"Yes, uh, um, fortunately,"
418.25,422.03,Giles,no people were injured.
422.07,424.01,Buffy,That falls into "That's a Switch" column.
424.01,425.9,Giles,"Well, for now, but my guess is that this"
425.93,426.96,Giles,werewolf will be back
426.96,428.23,Willow,at next month's full moon.
428.27,431.37,Willow,What about tonight's full moon?
431.37,432.07,Giles,Pardon?
432.1,434.11,Willow,"Well, last night was"
432.1,434.11,Willow,"the night before the full moon,"
434.12,437.79,Willow,traditionally known as...
434.12,437.79,Willow,the night before the full moon.
437.83,439.61,Giles,Meaning the accepted legend that...
439.61,442.05,Giles,werewolves only prowl during a full moon
439.61,442.05,Giles,might be erroneous.
442.08,443.45,Cordelia,Or it could be a crock.
443.45,444.16,Xander,"Well, unless"
444.16,446.57,Xander,the werewolf was using
444.16,446.57,Xander,last year's almanac.
446.61,448.27,Buffy,Looks like Giles
446.61,448.27,Buffy,has some schoolin' to do.
448.27,450.12,Giles,"Yes, I must admit I, I am intrigued."
450.15,452.28,Giles,Werewolves. It's one of the classics.
452.66,456.33,Giles,I'm sure my books and I are
452.66,456.33,Giles,in for a fascinating afternoon.
458.29,460.3,Buffy,He needs to get a pet.
460.33,463.81,Coach,Sunnydale is becoming
460.33,463.81,Coach,more dangerous all the time.
463.84,469.02,Coach,And full moon like tonight
463.84,469.02,Coach,tends to bring out the crazies.
467.04,469.69,Coach,But with some simple basics
467.04,469.69,Coach,"of selfdefence,"
469.72,472.25,Coach,each of you can learn
469.72,472.25,Coach,how to protect yourself.
472.29,472.85,Buffy,Here's a suggestion 
472.85,473.41,Coach,What you wanna do...
473.41,474.93,Coach,move away from the Hellmouth.
473.41,474.93,Coach,is gain advantage of the situation
474.96,476.61,Coach,as quickly as possible.
476.64,476.84,Oz,Tag.
476.84,477.93,Coach,Your attacker may have
477.93,478.55,Coach,the benefit of surprise.
478.55,479.15,Xander,Would you look at that!
479.19,480.25,Xander,"He's all over her! Psst! Hey, buddy!"
480.25,481.29,Coach,"But if you plot ahead, then you can"
481.29,482.36,Xander,This is a public forum here!
482.36,483.59,Coach,turn that advantage to yourself.
483.63,485.39,Cordelia,I think you've splashed on just
483.63,485.39,Cordelia,a little too much Obsession for Dorks.
487.85,488.32,Cordelia,i></i>
488.32,491.69,Coach,"OK, everyone get into your assigned groups."
500.37,501.52,Xander,What happened?
501.52,503.75,Larry,"Oh, last week some huge dog"
503.78,506.37,Larry,jumped out of the bushes and bit me.
506.4,509.66,Larry,stitches.
506.4,509.66,Larry,They oughta shoot those strays.
509.77,513.43,Oz,"I've been there, man. My cousin Jordy"
509.77,513.43,Oz,just got his grownup teeth in.
513.52,515.69,Oz,Does not like to be tickled.
521.66,525.87,Larry,"Theresa! Be still, my shorts."
525.91,529.45,Larry,We're in the same group.
525.91,529.45,Larry,I may have to attack you.
529.48,533.04,Theresa,"No, actually, I think in our group"
529.48,533.04,Theresa,there are a few of us.
533.07,535.52,Buffy,And I'm one of the few.
538.57,541.58,Willow,"Don't forget, you're supposed to be"
538.57,541.58,Willow,"a meek little girlie girl,"
541.59,544.32,Willow,like the rest of us.
544.83,547.24,Buffy,Spoil my fun!
547.27,549.62,Coach,"OK, everyone listen up."
547.27,549.62,Coach,I wanna show you
549.62,552.59,Coach,what to do should you
549.62,552.59,Coach,be attacked from behind.
552.63,555.17,Coach,"In this situation, bend forward,"
555.2,559.44,Coach,using your back and shoulders
555.2,559.44,Coach,to flip the assailant over to the ground.
565.5,567.33,Buffy,Nuh!
570.02,570.1,Buffy,Nuh!
570.1,570.76,Larry,"Oh, Summers, you are turnin' me on!"
576.14,577.9,Oz,"And that works, too."
580.53,583.33,Giles,"And, uh, while there's absolutely"
580.53,583.33,Giles,no scientific explanation for
583.33,585.54,Giles,"lunar effect on the human psyche, uh,"
585.57,589.55,Giles,the phases of the moon do seem to exert
585.57,589.55,Giles,a great deal of psychological influence.
589.92,592.75,Giles,"And ththe full moon is, is,"
589.92,592.75,Giles,seems to bring out our darkest qualities.
592.79,595.98,Xander,"And yet, ironically,"
592.79,595.98,Xander,it led to the invention of the MoonPie.
596.63,598.49,Giles,Oh
598.69,600.94,Giles,"Yes, MoonPie!"
604.95,609.02,Giles,"You see,"
604.95,609.02,Giles,"the werewolf is such a potent, extreme"
609.02,611.84,Giles,representation
609.02,611.84,Giles,"of our inborn animalistic traits,"
611.87,614.59,Giles,it emerges for three
611.87,614.59,Giles,full consecutive nights 
614.59,616.85,Giles,the full moon
614.59,616.85,Giles,and the two nights surrounding it.
616.88,618.7,Xander,Quite the party animal.
618.7,621.55,Giles,"Quite, and it acts on pure instinct."
621.58,624.25,Giles,"No conscience. Predatory and,"
621.58,624.25,Giles,and aggressive.
624.36,626.5,Buffy,"In other words, your typical male."
626.5,628.27,Xander,On behalf of my gender  hey!
628.31,630.33,Giles,"Yes, let's not jump to any conclusions."
630.33,631.05,Buffy,I didn't jump.
631.08,633.51,Buffy,I took a tiny step
631.08,633.51,Buffy,and there conclusions were.
633.54,636.79,Giles,The point is that our wolfman
633.54,636.79,Giles,"could also be a wolfwoman,"
636.79,638.08,Xander,or anyone who was bitten
638.08,638.84,Giles,by a werewolf.
638.87,641.8,Xander,"So, then I'm guessing your standard"
638.87,641.8,Xander,silver bullets are in order here?
641.81,643.69,Giles,"No, no bullets."
643.77,646.86,Giles,"No matter who this werewolf is,"
643.77,646.86,Giles,"iit's still a human being,"
646.9,651.78,Giles,who may be completely unaware
646.9,651.78,Giles,of his or her condition.
651.81,654.89,Buffy,"So, tonight we bring him back alive."
667.57,668.53,Giles,Anything yet?
668.53,671.33,Buffy,"Yes, and you won't believe what I saw!"
671.36,673.57,Buffy,Brittany Podelle was making out
671.36,673.57,Buffy,"with Owen Stadeal,"
673.57,676.57,Buffy,but he goes with Bara Williams.
673.57,676.57,Buffy,If she ever foun...
676.96,680.03,Buffy,"No, um, no, no sign of the werewolf."
676.96,680.03,Buffy,How about you?
680.06,681.93,Giles,"Uh, the same."
681.97,683.59,Giles,"I thought we might, uh..."
683.59,685.46,Giles,I thought we might
683.59,685.46,Giles,"knock on a few windows, uh..."
685.5,687.32,Giles,ask if anyone has seen anything yet.
687.35,690.37,Buffy,"Giles, no one's seen anything."
690.74,692.53,Giles,Oh. Yes. No.
693.24,695.55,Giles,"Ofofof course not, no."
696.27,697.83,Giles,Yes.
728.4,730.31,Cain,Gotcha!
735.56,738,Cain,What the hell...?
738,739.86,Buffy,Giles! Giles!
740.45,742.24,Giles,Hey!
743.19,744.85,Giles,Whoa! Whoa.
744.88,746.6,Cain,Hands are good right about there.
746.6,748.4,Giles,Who are you? What are you doing?
748.43,750.49,Cain,The name's Cain.
748.43,750.49,Cain,"I'm the one with the gun,"
750.49,752.83,Cain,which means I'm the one
750.49,752.83,Cain,who gets to do the interviewing.
752.86,755.28,Buffy,"Ahem. Hey,"
752.86,755.28,Buffy,"before we get all chummy here,"
755.28,758.6,Buffy,how about we do something
755.28,758.6,Buffy,about me being in this net thing?
768.83,771.97,Giles,Are you all right?
771.97,772.84,Buffy,Yeah.
773.21,775.11,Cain,"I gotta say, I'm impressed."
775.11,775.81,Giles,Excuse me?
775.85,778.65,Cain,"Oh, it's good to get the fruit"
775.85,778.65,Cain,while it's fresh.
778.65,780.72,Giles,You'd be wise to take that back.
780.76,783.31,Cain,"Hey, what a man and a girl do"
780.76,783.31,Cain,in Lovers' Lane at night is nobody's...
783.86,787.11,Buffy,"Oh, OK, hey, enough, Repulsive Brain!"
783.86,787.11,Buffy,It's not what you think.
787.41,790.16,Buffy,We're... hunting werewolves.
792.82,795.68,Buffy,"OK, it's funny if you don't"
792.82,795.68,Buffy,believe in werewolves.
795.75,798.88,Cain,"No, it's funny thinking about"
795.75,798.88,Cain,you two catching one.
798.92,802.45,Cain,This guy looks like
798.92,802.45,Cain,he's auditioning to be a librarian and...
802.45,805.22,Cain,"You, well... You're a girl."
805.26,808.03,Giles,"I assure you, she's quite capable."
808.03,808.52,Cain,Uhhuh.
808.9,812.36,Cain,"Let me ask you somethin', sweetheart."
808.9,812.36,Cain,Exactly how many of these animals
812.4,814.17,Cain,have you taken out?
814.17,815.29,Buffy,As of today?
815.33,819.51,Cain,I tore a tooth from the mouth
815.33,819.51,Cain,of every werewolf that I killed.
819.55,821.06,Buffy,This next one'll bring
821.06,822.91,Cain,the total to an even dozen.
822.94,824.6,Buffy,"So, you're just gonna kill it?"
824.6,826.14,Cain,"Well, see, that's the thing."
826.17,828.46,Cain,Their pelts fetch
826.17,828.46,Cain,"a pretty penny in Sri Lanka,"
828.46,830.79,Cain,and it's a little hard
828.46,830.79,Cain,to skin 'em when they're alive.
830.83,833.01,Giles,You hunt werewolves for sport?
833.01,835.84,Cain,"No, no. I'm in it purely for the money."
835.87,840.43,Buffy,It doesn't bother you that a werewolf is
835.87,840.43,Buffy,a person 28 days out of the month?
840.84,843.98,Cain,That's why I only hunt 'em the other three.
845.02,848.48,Cain,"I'd really love to stay and chat,"
845.02,848.48,Cain,but I'm on a tight schedule.
848.98,852.69,Cain,Any idea where else the boys and girls
848.98,852.69,Cain,like to get together around here?
852.74,855.13,Buffy,You're looking for a party?
855.13,857.25,Cain,"No, but the werewolf is."
857.28,859.92,Cain,They're suckers for that whole
857.28,859.92,Cain,sexual heat thing.
859.92,862.03,Cain,Sense it miles away.
862.06,866.51,Cain,"If this little doggy ain't here,"
862.06,866.51,Cain,I guess he found another place.
866.55,869.24,Buffy,Sorry. Wish I could help you.
869.28,873.74,Cain,But you don't know squat?
869.28,873.74,Cain,"Gee, what a surprise!"
877.16,878.11,Giles,Where are we going?
878.11,879.56,Buffy,I think I know where to look.
879.6,883.59,Buffy,We just have to make it there
879.6,883.59,Buffy,before "Mein Furrier".
909.32,910.29,Angelus,Everything OK?
910.29,911.6,Theresa,"Yeah, I just, uh..."
911.64,914.71,Theresa,I thought I heard something...
911.64,914.71,Theresa,behind me.
919.74,921.54,Angelus,No one there.
921.54,921.95,Theresa,Oh.
924.12,927.15,Theresa,I guess I was wrong. I coulda sworn...
927.19,930.4,Angelus,It's OK. It can get pretty scary
927.19,930.4,Angelus,"out here, all alone at night."
930.51,932.79,Theresa,Yeah.
932.83,935.44,Angelus,"Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?"
935.48,938.44,Angelus,Don't you go to school with Buffy?
938.47,940.13,Theresa,"Oh, you know Buffy?"
940.13,941.97,Angelus,"Yes, I do, very well."
942.94,945.75,Angelus,Come on. I'll get you home.

970.33,974.05,Cordelia,"I mean, with Xander, it's always"
970.33,974.05,Cordelia,"Buffy did this, Willow said that."""
974.09,978.21,Cordelia,"Buffy, Buffy, Willow, Willow."""
974.09,978.21,Cordelia,It's like I don't even exist!
978.44,979.72,Willow,I sometimes feel like that.
979.72,981.18,Cordelia,"And then when I call him on it,"
981.22,983.64,Cordelia,he acts confused.
981.22,983.64,Cordelia,Like I'm the one with a problem.
983.68,985.75,Willow,His "Do I smell something?" look.
985.79,990.08,Cordelia,All a part of his little guy games.
985.79,990.08,Cordelia,"It's like he's there, then he's not there."
990.12,992.17,Cordelia,"He wants it, but then"
990.12,992.17,Cordelia,he doesn't want it.
992.2,995.02,Willow,He's so busy looking around
992.2,995.02,Willow,"at everything he doesn't have,"
995.06,997.33,Willow,doesn't even realise
995.06,997.33,Willow,what he does have.
997.33,1000.39,Cordelia,"Well, he should at least realize"
997.33,1000.39,Cordelia,that you have Oz.
1000.43,1002.25,Willow,"Hm, I'm not sure I do."
1002.25,1003.45,Willow,Oz and I are in...
1003.45,1005.38,Cordelia,some sort of holding pattern.
1005.41,1009.02,Cordelia,Except... without the holding or...
1005.41,1009.02,Cordelia,anything else.
1009.05,1013.83,Cordelia,What's he waiting for? What's his problem?
1009.05,1013.83,Cordelia,"Oh, that's right. He's a guy."
1013.86,1015.56,Willow,"Yeah, him and Xander. Guys!"
1015.56,1017.26,Cordelia,Who do they think they are?
1017.3,1019.35,Willow,Couple of guys.
1030.54,1031.91,Giles,Looks as though your hunch was right.
1031.91,1033.09,Buffy,Who could resist Sunnydale's own
1033.09,1035.72,Buffy,house of hormones?
1037.33,1039.75,Willow,"The werewolf, it's in there!"
1039.75,1041.05,Buffy,Comin' through!
1108.29,1110,Cain,You let it get away.
1110,1112.39,Buffy,I didn't let it do anything.
1112.47,1115.75,Buffy,I had the chain around its neck.
1112.47,1115.75,Buffy,Chain?!
1115.78,1117.83,Cain,What were you gonna do?
1115.78,1117.83,Cain,Take it for a walk?
1117.87,1119.97,Buffy,I was going to lock it up.
1122.02,1121.6,Cain,That's beautiful.
1121.6,1125,Cain,This is what happens
1121.6,1125,Cain,when a woman tries to do a man's job.
1125.03,1128.31,Giles,"Now you look here, Mr... Cain."
1128.31,1130.08,Giles,"This girl risked her life,"
1130.08,1132.88,Giles,trying to capture a beast
1130.08,1132.88,Giles,that you haven't as yet been able to find.
1132.93,1137.88,Cain,Uhhuh. And Daddy's doing a great job
1132.93,1137.88,Cain,carrying her bag of MilkBones.
1139.24,1142.35,Cain,"You know, sis,"
1139.24,1142.35,Cain,"if that thing out there harms anyone,"
1142.59,1145.03,Cain,it's going to be
1142.59,1145.03,Cain,on your pretty little head.
1145.07,1147.19,Cain,I hope you can live with that.
1147.19,1149.09,Buffy,I live with that every day.
1149.13,1152.49,Cain,First they tell me I can't
1149.13,1152.49,Cain,hunt an elephant for its ivory.
1152.55,1157.06,Cain,Now I've gotta deal with People for
1152.55,1157.06,Cain,the Ethical Treatment of Werewolves!
1157.56,1161.28,Giles,"Pillock! Right, let's move out."
1205.02,1207.06,Buffy,Giles? Giles!
1209.41,1212.12,Buffy,I didn't see you there.
1209.41,1212.12,Buffy,I thought something had happened.
1212.15,1214.27,Giles,"Oh, no, I'm, I'm, uh..."
1215.04,1216.79,Giles,"I'm OK. I'm just, um, fine..."
1216.92,1221.2,Giles,"Er, just, uh, I'm, uh..."
1221.3,1223.52,Giles,"Er, any sign of the, uh, werewolf?"
1224.43,1227.14,Buffy,No. I'm guessing
1224.43,1227.14,Buffy,"you didn't see anything either,"
1227.17,1229.44,Buffy,from that vantage point
1227.17,1229.44,Buffy,of having your eyes closed.
1229.48,1232.68,Giles,"It's, uh, it's, it's, uh, gonna"
1229.48,1232.68,Giles,"be light soon, so we'd better..."
1232.72,1232.97,Buffy,Wait!
1232.97,1234.57,Radio newscaster,Police say that the incident was
1234.6,1237.16,Radio newscaster,apparently connected
1234.6,1237.16,Radio newscaster,to the animal mutilation
1237.19,1238.97,Radio newscaster,which occurred two nights ago.
1238.97,1241.4,Radio newscaster,The coroner's office
1238.97,1241.4,Radio newscaster,has identified the body
1241.48,1243.72,Radio newscaster,as that of Sunnydale High School
1243.72,1246.17,Giles,"student Theresa Klussmeyer, age 17,"
1246.2,1248.51,Giles,"Buffy, we're gonna get this thing."
1248.51,1251.05,Giles,We have another whole night.
1251.36,1256.11,Giles,There's nothing more we can do now.
1251.36,1256.11,Giles,It's... nearly sunrise.
1256.37,1260.02,Giles,That werewolf won't be
1256.37,1260.02,Giles,a werewolf much longer.
1316.37,1318.2,Oz,Huh.
1320.24,1322.75,Oz,"Aunt Maureen? Hey, it's me."
1322.78,1327.34,Oz,"Uh, what? Oh, it's..."
1322.78,1327.34,Oz,"Actually, it's healin' OK."
1327.38,1331.84,Oz,That's pretty much the reason I called.
1327.38,1331.84,Oz,"Um, I wanna ask you somethin'."
1333.39,1336.08,Oz,Is Jordy a werewolf?
1336.48,1338.5,Oz,Uhhuh.
1339.65,1342.59,Oz,And how long has that been goin' on?
1343.28,1345.25,Oz,Uhhuh.
1345.29,1347.98,Oz,"What? No, no reason. Um..."
1350.02,1351.59,Buffy,"Thanks. Yeah, love to Uncle Ken."
1371.14,1373.18,Buffy,I can't believe
1371.14,1373.18,Buffy,I let that thing get away!
1373.18,1375.99,Buffy,Cain was right.
1373.18,1375.99,Buffy,I shoulda killed it when I had the chance.
1376.02,1377.2,Oz,Killed what?
1377.2,1379.56,Buffy,"Uh, the... the werewolf."
1379.59,1381.89,Buffy,Ititit was out last night.
1381.92,1385.97,Oz,Is everybody OK? Did anybody get...
1381.92,1385.97,Oz,"bitten or, or scratched?"
1388.02,1387.58,Willow,"No, we're fine."
1388.25,1389.07,Oz,Gladness.
1389.07,1392.16,Buffy,"Yeah, but it got someone. Theresa."
1392.63,1395.15,Oz,"Got, as in...?"
1397.02,1399.55,Oz,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1400.15,1402.8,Buffy,And I coulda stopped it.
1402.83,1405.85,Giles,"Well, we... We have one more night."
1406.41,1407.55,Oz,Another night?
1407.55,1408.29,Buffy,"Oh, yeah."
1408.32,1411.54,Buffy,"Believe me, I'm gonna give"
1408.32,1411.54,Buffy,that wolfie somethin' to howl about.
1412.04,1413.8,Xander,"But while we hang here doing nothing,"
1413.83,1418.11,Xander,there's a human werewolf walking around
1413.83,1418.11,Xander,"out there, probably making fun of us."
1418.14,1420.8,Willow,The way werewolves always do.
1420.84,1422.9,Oz,But there's really no way
1420.84,1422.9,Oz,to tell who it is.
1422.9,1425.06,Xander,"Oh, sure there is. Giles knows stuff"
1425.09,1427.35,Xander,and I'm practically
1425.09,1427.35,Xander,an expert on the subject.
1427.39,1429.73,Willow,On account of once you were a hyena?
1429.77,1433.54,Xander,I know what it's like to...
1429.77,1433.54,Xander,crave the taste of freshlykilled meat.
1433.56,1436.99,Xander,To be taken over by
1433.56,1436.99,Xander,those uncontrollable urges.
1437.03,1440.22,Buffy,You said you didn't remember
1437.03,1440.22,Buffy,anything about that.
1442.73,1445.76,Buffy,I said I didn't remember
1442.73,1445.76,Buffy,anything about that.
1445.79,1446.51,Buffy,"Look, the point is that"
1446.51,1447.61,Xander,I have an affinity with this thing.
1447.61,1450.17,Xander,I can get inside of its head.
1454.74,1458.58,Xander,I'm a big bad wolf. I'm on the prowl.
1458.89,1463.66,Xander,"I'm sniffin', I'm snarlin',"
1458.89,1463.66,Xander,"I'm a slobbering predator, I'm..."
1464.73,1467.01,Xander,Wait a second!
1467.05,1469.44,Xander,It's right in front of us!
1469.47,1472.67,Buffy,It's obvious who I am!
1472.7,1474.44,Buffy,I'm Larry!
1474.47,1478.18,Buffy,The guy has practically got "Wolf Boy"
1474.47,1478.18,Buffy,stamped on his forehead.
1478.5,1480.68,Buffy,"You got the dog bite,"
1478.5,1480.68,Buffy,"you got the aggression,"
1480.68,1482.9,Buffy,not to mention excessive back hair.
1482.93,1485.39,Buffy,And he was awfully gleeful
1482.93,1485.39,Buffy,about tormenting Theresa.
1485.43,1487.68,Giles,"Still, that doesn't necessarily mean..."
1487.68,1488.95,Xander,I'm gonna talk to him.
1488.98,1492.23,Xander,Gonna force a confession outta him.
1492.23,1493.06,Giles,Good. Go.
1493.43,1497.52,Giles,"Uh, in the meantime, we need to"
1493.43,1497.52,Giles,"cover our bases. Willow, um..."
1497.55,1501.62,Giles,"check the student files,"
1497.55,1501.62,Giles,see if anybody else... fits the profile.
1501.67,1502.32,Giles,Buffy?
1502.32,1504.39,Buffy,Where are we going?
1504.81,1508.26,Giles,"If none of that works,"
1504.81,1508.26,Giles,I think I may have an alternative.
1508.3,1511.11,Buffy,"Yeah, me and the werewolf"
1508.3,1511.11,Buffy,alone in a cage for three minutes.
1511.11,1513.11,Buffy,That's all I ask.
1514.52,1516.25,Willow,Are you OK?
1516.25,1517.03,Oz,What?
1517.06,1519.53,Willow,You kind of knew Theresa.
1519.53,1521.31,Oz,"Oh, yeah, I, uh..."
1521.35,1524.28,Oz,I'm tryin' not to think about it. It's...
1524.31,1525.95,Oz,It's a lot.
1525.95,1526.85,Willow,It is.
1526.88,1531.44,Willow,But we can do stuff to help.
1526.88,1531.44,Willow,Sometimes it feels good to help.
1531.92,1532.66,Oz,Uhhuh.
1532.66,1536.14,Willow,"Well, like looking up stuff."
1536.34,1539.33,Willow,I'm gonna be doing that
1536.34,1539.33,Willow,most of the night. You could...
1539.33,1542.79,Willow,help me. Help together?
1542.83,1546.4,Oz,"I can't. Um, uh... I'm busy."
1546.46,1549.8,Willow,Oh. So...
1550.22,1553.18,Oz,I... I gotta go.
1576.59,1580.15,Larry,"Harris! Cheesh! Next time, wear a bell."
1580.18,1582.24,Xander,"Why so jumpy, Larry?"
1582.27,1583.84,Larry,Geeks make me nervous.
1583.84,1585.13,Xander,"Is that really it,"
1585.16,1588.25,Xander,or is there something you're hiding?
1588.29,1591.26,Larry,I could hide my fist in your face.
1591.3,1593.97,Xander,"I know your secret, big guy."
1591.3,1593.97,Xander,I know what you been doin' at night.
1594.55,1597.25,Larry,"You know, Harris,"
1594.55,1597.25,Larry,that nosey little nose of yours
1597.25,1600.19,Larry,is gonna get you into trouble someday.
1600.22,1600.94,Larry,Like today.
1600.94,1603.62,Xander,Hurting me isn't gonna make this go away.
1603.66,1606.25,Xander,People are still gonna find out!
1610.21,1613.16,Larry,"All right, what do you want?"
1613.16,1614.92,Larry,Hush money? Is that what you're after?
1614.95,1617.21,Xander,I don't want anything.
1614.95,1617.21,Xander,I just wanna help!
1617.21,1619.17,Larry,"What, you think you have a cure?"
1619.21,1621.42,Xander,"No, it's just..."
1621.45,1624.02,Xander,"I know what you're goin' through,"
1621.45,1624.02,Xander,because I've been there.
1624.05,1626.2,Xander,That's why I know
1624.05,1626.2,Xander,you should talk about it.
1626.23,1627.74,Larry,That's easy for you to say.
1627.78,1630.33,Larry,"I mean, you're nobody."
1627.78,1630.33,Larry,I've got a reputation here.
1630.87,1633.05,Xander,"Larry, please,"
1630.87,1633.05,Xander,before someone else gets hurt!
1633.09,1637.69,Larry,"Look, if this gets out..."
1633.09,1637.69,Larry,it's over for me.
1638.39,1643.04,Larry,"I mean, forget about playin' football."
1638.39,1643.04,Larry,They'll run me out of this town.
1643.4,1649.03,Larry,"I mean, come on! How are people gonna"
1643.4,1649.03,Larry,look at me after they find out I'm gay?
1652.16,1655.92,Larry,Wow. I said it.
1655.96,1660.18,Larry,And it felt... OK.
1661.56,1663.61,Larry,I'm gay.
1664.06,1667.08,Larry,I... am gay!
1667.19,1668.95,Xander,I heard you the first time.
1668.95,1671.49,Larry,I can't believe it. It was almost easy.
1671.57,1674.42,Larry,I've never felt I could tell anyone.
1674.71,1677.26,Larry,"And then you, you of all people,"
1677.26,1679.09,Xander,you bring it out of me!
1679.12,1682.22,Xander,"It probably woulda slipped out,"
1679.12,1682.22,Xander,even if I wasn't here.
1682.26,1685.58,Larry,"No! No, because knowing"
1682.26,1685.58,Larry,you went through the same thing
1685.58,1687.86,Larry,made it easier for me to admit.
1687.89,1689.71,Xander,The same thing...
1689.71,1690.99,Larry,It's ironic.
1691.02,1693.69,Larry,"I mean, all those times"
1691.02,1693.69,Larry,I beat the crap outta you...
1694.12,1697.52,Larry,It must've been because
1694.12,1697.52,Larry,I recognised something in you...
1697.55,1700.72,Larry,that I didn't wanna believe
1697.55,1700.72,Larry,about myself.
1703.02,1703.83,Xander,"Larry, no. I am not..."
1703.83,1704.76,Larry,Of course. Of course not.
1704.8,1708.52,Larry,Don't worry. I wouldn't do that to you.
1708.56,1712.14,Larry,Your secret's safe with me.
1714.16,1716.18,Larry,"Oh, wow."
1725.43,1729.74,Buffy,"So, what's the scuttlebutt? Anybody"
1725.43,1729.74,Buffy,besides Larry fit our werewolf profile?
1729.81,1732.49,Willow,There is one name
1729.81,1732.49,Willow,that keeps getting spit out.
1732.94,1736.03,Willow,"Aggressive behaviour,"
1732.94,1736.03,Willow,runins with authorities...
1736.07,1738.58,Willow,About a screenful of violent incidents.
1738.58,1740.9,Buffy,"OK, most of those were not my fault."
1741.08,1743.49,Buffy,Somebody else started 'em.
1741.08,1743.49,Buffy,I was just standing up for myself.
1743.52,1746.09,Willow,They say it's a good idea
1743.52,1746.09,Willow,to count to ten when you're angry.
1746.13,1747.97,Buffy,One. Two.
1748.6,1749.13,Buffy,Three.
1749.13,1750.73,Willow,I'll keep looking!
1751.1,1753.61,Buffy,"I, um... noticed you were lookin' solo."
1753.64,1758.21,Willow,Yeah. Oz...
1753.64,1758.21,Willow,wanted to be someplace that was...
1758.24,1760.5,Willow,away... from me.
1760.53,1761.76,Buffy,I'm sorry.
1761.76,1764.58,Willow,I can't figure him out.
1764.61,1768.96,Willow,"I mean, he's so hot and cold."
1764.61,1768.96,Willow,Or lukewarm and cold.
1769,1773.02,Buffy,Welcome to the mystery that is men.
1769,1773.02,Buffy,I think it goes something like...
1773.05,1776.74,Buffy,"They grow body hair, they lose all ability"
1773.05,1776.74,Buffy,to tell you what they really want.
1776.78,1778.99,Willow,That doesn't seem like a fair trade.
1779.03,1781.69,Buffy,"Well, if you wanna up"
1779.03,1781.69,Buffy,"the speed quotient with Oz,"
1781.72,1783.86,Buffy,maybe you need to do something daring.
1783.9,1786.98,Buffy,Maybe you need to make the first move.
1787.95,1789.99,Willow,That won't make me a slut?
1789.99,1792.84,Buffy,I think your reputation
1789.99,1792.84,Buffy,will remain intact.
1793.06,1795.88,Willow,It used to be so much easier
1793.06,1795.88,Willow,to tell if a boy liked you.
1795.91,1799.31,Willow,He'd punch you on the arm
1795.91,1799.31,Willow,and then run back to his friends.
1799.32,1802.37,Buffy,Those were the days.
1802.37,1802.98,Xander,Hey.
1805.02,1805.8,Willow,I'll see you guys later.
1805.02,1805.8,Willow,Cordelia asked me to
1805.8,1807.98,Willow,look over her history homework
1805.8,1807.98,Willow,before class.
1808.02,1810.56,Xander,I think that means I might have to do it.
1811.84,1814.91,Xander,"Wow, those two gals"
1811.84,1814.91,Xander,are hanging out a lot together.
1814.94,1817.28,Xander,This'd be a good time to panic.
1817.31,1818.84,Buffy,"So, how'd it go with Larry?"
1818.84,1820.48,Xander,What's that supposed to mean?
1820.61,1821.79,,"I think it's supposed to mean,"
1821.79,1822.86,Buffy,So how'd it go with Larry'?
1822.86,1824.61,Xander,He's not the werewolf.
1822.86,1824.61,Xander,Can't we just leave it at that?
1824.64,1827.37,Xander,Must you continue to push and push?
1827.5,1828.8,Buffy,"Sorry, I was just wondering."
1828.8,1829.5,Xander,"Well, he's not."
1832.02,1831.58,Buffy,OK.
1832.02,1831.58,Buffy,OK.
1831.62,1833.55,Buffy,"But there goes our lead suspect,"
1833.55,1835.97,Xander,which then puts us back at square boned.
1838.02,1837.6,Xander,"You're not boned, you're Buffy."
1837.77,1842.15,Xander,"Eradicator of evil, defender of, um..."
1837.77,1842.15,Xander,things that need defending.
1842.19,1844.61,Buffy,Tell that to Theresa.
1842.19,1844.61,Buffy,She could've used my defending
1844.61,1846.9,Buffy,before she was ripped apart by that...
1846.93,1848.83,Xander,Werewolf.
1848.84,1852.86,Buffy,Nowhere in any of the reports did it
1848.84,1852.86,Buffy,say anything about her being mauled.
1852.89,1854.93,Buffy,"I mean, they were linked to the"
1852.89,1854.93,Buffy,"animal attacks from the other night,"
1854.93,1858.1,Xander,so we just assumed werewolf.
1854.93,1858.1,Xander,What else should we have assumed?
1860.11,1861.02,Buffy,Vampire.
1861.02,1863.65,Xander,"So, that's good, right?"
1863.65,1866.95,Xander,"I mean, in the sense of"
1863.65,1866.95,Xander,the werewolf didn't get her and...
1868.68,1871.98,Xander,"No, there is no good here."
1872.21,1876.52,Buffy,No good. Instead of not protecting
1872.21,1876.52,Buffy,"Theresa from the werewolf,"
1876.59,1880.72,Buffy,I was able to not protect her
1876.59,1880.72,Buffy,from something just as bad.
1882.86,1885.11,Buffy,She had a lot of friends.
1886.61,1890.2,Xander,"Buffy, you can't blame yourself"
1886.61,1890.2,Xander,for every death that happens in Sunnydale.
1890.37,1893.51,Xander,If it weren't for you people'd be lined up
1890.37,1893.51,Xander,five deep waitin' to get themselves buried.
1893.55,1897.88,Xander,Willow would be Robbie the Robot's
1893.55,1897.88,Xander,"love slave, I wouldn't have a head and..."
1897.92,1899.89,Theresa,Theresa's a vampire.
1911.16,1913.66,Theresa,Angel sends his love.
1929.82,1931.57,Theresa,Angel...
1936.21,1938.55,Xander,Are you OK?
1939.74,1942.56,Buffy,This isn't happening.
1944.45,1946.34,Buffy,He's gonna keep coming after me.
1946.34,1947.81,Xander,Don't let him get to you.
1947.98,1950.64,Xander,He's not the same guy you knew.
1961.76,1964.9,Xander,"Oh, no, my life's not too complicated."
2042.08,2043.61,Oz,"Willow, what are you doing here?"
2043.61,2045.23,Willow,I had this whole thing worked out.
2045.27,2048.31,Willow,"And I had it written down, uh,"
2045.27,2048.31,Willow,but then it didn't make any sense
2048.32,2051.22,Oz,when I was reading it back.
2048.32,2051.22,Oz,"Willow, this is not a very good time."
2051.26,2053.19,Willow,"I mean, what am I supposed to think?"
2053.22,2055.26,Willow,"First you buy me popcorn, and then"
2055.26,2057.53,Oz,you're all glad that I didn't get bit.
2057.57,2059.61,Willow,And you put the tag back in my shirt.
2059.61,2061.81,Oz,"But I guess none of that means anything,"
2061.85,2062.62,Willow,because instead of
2062.62,2063.69,Oz,"looking up names with me,"
2063.72,2065.87,Oz,"here you are, all alone in your house,"
2065.87,2067.39,Willow,"doing nothing, by yourself!"
2067.42,2069.14,Oz,"Willow, we'll talk about this tomorrow!"
2069.14,2072.28,Oz,"No, dammit!"
2069.14,2072.28,Oz,We'll talk about this now!
2072.6,2075.85,Willow,Buffy told me that sometimes what
2072.6,2075.85,Willow,a girl makes has to be the first move
2075.89,2077.83,Willow,"and now that I'm saying this,"
2075.89,2077.83,Willow,I'm starting to think
2077.83,2080.28,Willow,that the written version
2077.83,2080.28,Willow,"sounded pretty good, but..."
2080.35,2081.58,Willow,You know what I mean.
2081.58,2083.21,Oz,"I know, I know. It's me. I'm"
2083.24,2085.81,Oz,I'm going through some... changes.
2085.85,2088.16,Willow,"Well, welcome to the world!"
2088.42,2091.57,Willow,Things happen!
2088.42,2091.57,Willow,Don't you think I'm going through a lot?
2091.61,2092.51,Oz,Not like me.
2092.51,2094.92,Willow,"Oh, what? So now you're special?"
2094.96,2097.41,Willow,You're Special Boy.
2097.44,2100.19,Willow,With... chains and stuff?
2100.21,2103.44,Willow,Why do you have... chains and stuff?
2105.02,2107.58,Oz,"Willow, please!"
2107.75,2110.06,Oz,Get outta here!
2113.89,2115.72,Willow,Oz?
2116.29,2118.17,Willow,"Oz, what is it?"
2122.78,2124.52,Willow,What's wrong?
2163.48,2165.45,Cain,There you are!
2173.86,2178.84,Buffy,Sorry I'm late. I had to do some
2173.86,2178.84,Buffy,unscheduled slayage in the form of Theresa.
2179.27,2180.89,Giles,She's a vampire?
2180.89,2181.3,Buffy,Was.
2181.3,2183.98,Buffy,Angel sent her to me.
2181.3,2183.98,Buffy,A little token of his affection.
2184.02,2185.49,Giles,"Buffy, I'm so sorry."
2185.49,2186.59,Buffy,"Not now, Giles."
2186.62,2190.08,Buffy,We can all have ourselves a good cry
2186.62,2190.08,Buffy,after we bag us a werewolf.
2226.79,2228.76,Giles,All set. Let's go find this thing.
2228.76,2229.63,Buffy,One question...
2229.63,2231.78,Buffy,How exactly do we find this thing?
2231.78,2232.86,Willow,It's Oz! It's Oz!
2233.15,2234.03,Buffy,Whawhat's Oz?
2234.03,2234.9,Willow,The werewolf.
2234.93,2235.61,Giles,Are you certain?
2235.61,2236.96,Willow,Can't you just trust me on this?
2237,2239.31,Willow,"He, he said he was"
2237,2239.31,Willow,"going through all these changes,"
2239.31,2242.32,Willow,then... he went through
2239.31,2242.32,Willow,all these... changes.
2242.35,2243.07,Buffy,Where is he now?
2243.07,2243.65,Willow,In the woods.
2243.68,2244.14,Giles,Let's go.
2244.14,2245.93,Willow,Go where? You're not gonna kill Oz!
2245.96,2248.57,Willow,"Yeah, he's a werewolf,"
2245.96,2248.57,Willow,but he doesn't mean to be!
2248.61,2250.18,Buffy,"Don't worry, Willow."
2248.61,2250.18,Buffy,We're not going to hurt him.
2250.22,2252.65,Giles,We've put enough phenobarbital in this
2250.22,2252.65,Giles,to sink a small elephant.
2252.65,2255.54,Giles,It shoud be enough
2252.65,2255.54,Giles,for a large werewolf.
2266.64,2269.08,Cain,That's it. Let me see you.
2269.11,2271.79,Cain,"Come on, suppertime!"
2275.64,2277.81,Cain,Good doggy!
2278.92,2280.97,Cain,Now play dead.
2296.15,2297.73,Willow,Careful!
2299.2,2300.95,Giles,Dammit!
2322.27,2324.69,Willow,I shot Oz!
2325.2,2327.71,Giles,You saved us.
2331.36,2334.37,Cain,No wonder this town's
2331.36,2334.37,Cain,overrun with monsters.
2334.41,2336.55,Cain,No one here's man enough to kill 'em!
2336.55,2338.58,Buffy,"Oh, I wouldn't be too sure of that."
2345.12,2349.77,Buffy,How about you let the door
2345.12,2349.77,Buffy,hit you in the ass on the way outta town?
2365.83,2367.92,Willow,Is he gonna be OK?
2369.66,2373.85,Giles,"He'll be a little sore in the morning,"
2369.66,2373.85,Giles,but... he'll be Oz.
2378.88,2381.03,Xander,"This is all so weird. I mean,"
2381.06,2383.06,Xander,how are we supposed to act
2381.06,2383.06,Xander,when we see him?
2383.1,2385.99,Buffy,"It's gotta be weird for him too,"
2383.1,2385.99,Buffy,now that we know so much.
2386.19,2389.32,Xander,All I know is I'll never be able
2386.19,2389.32,Xander,to look at him the same again.
2389.35,2391.04,Buffy,He's still a human being...
2391.04,2392.19,Buffy,Most of the time.
2392.19,2393.89,Xander,Who are we talking about?
2393.93,2397.21,Buffy,Oz. Who are you talking about?
2397.21,2397.98,Xander,No one.
2401.22,2402.75,Larry,"Here, let me get those."
2402.85,2403.96,Girl,Thanks.
2403.96,2406.96,Larry,"Hey, what was that?"
2407.82,2411.3,Larry,"Hey, Xander! Look, about what you did."
2411.33,2413.06,Larry,"I, I owe you."
2413.06,2415.2,Buffy,What did you do?
2415.23,2421.02,,It's really nothing
2415.23,2421.02,,we should be talking about. Ever.
2419.04,2422.01,,"I know, I know. It's just, well..."
2422.05,2424.27,Girl,Thanks.
2427.52,2429.34,Buffy,That was weird.
2429.34,2429.95,Xander,What?
2429.99,2431.75,Xander,It's not OK for one guy
2429.99,2431.75,Xander,"to like another guy,"
2431.79,2434.26,Xander,just because he happened to be
2431.79,2434.26,Xander,in the locker room with him
2434.27,2437,Xander,when absolutely nothing happened?
2434.27,2437,Xander,And I thought I told you not to push!
2437.03,2439.3,Buffy,All I meant is that
2437.03,2439.3,Buffy,he didn't try to look up my skirt.
2439.3,2444.02,Xander,"Oh, oh, yeah, that's..."
2439.3,2444.02,Xander,that's the weirdness.
2442.04,2444.43,Buffy,Weirdness abounds lately.
2442.04,2444.43,Buffy,Maybe it's the moon.
2444.47,2446.34,Buffy,It does stuff to people.
2446.34,2447.58,Xander,I've heard that.
2447.61,2450.74,Buffy,It's certainly gonna put a strain
2447.61,2450.74,Buffy,on Willow and Oz's relationship.
2450.78,2454.65,Xander,"What relationship? I mean, what life"
2450.78,2454.65,Xander,could they possibly have together?
2454.69,2457.12,Xander,We're talking
2454.69,2457.12,Xander,"obedience school, papertraining..."
2457.16,2459.31,Xander,"Oz is always in the back,"
2457.16,2459.31,Xander,burying their things
2459.31,2461.34,Xander,and that kind of breed
2459.31,2461.34,Xander,can turn on its owner.
2461.37,2466.02,Buffy,I don't know.
2461.37,2466.02,Buffy,I kind of see Oz as the loyal type.
2466.02,2466.25,Xander,All I'm saying is she's not safe with him.
2466.02,2466.25,Xander,If it were up to me...
2466.29,2468.27,Buffy,Xander.
2468.89,2471.54,Buffy,It's not up to you.
2475.74,2478.35,Willow,Hey.
2475.74,2478.35,Willow,Hey.
2479.5,2482.23,Willow,Did you wanna go first?
2482.63,2485.81,Oz,I spoke to Giles. He said I'll be OK.
2485.85,2488.57,Oz,I just have to lock myself up
2485.85,2488.57,Oz,around the full moon.
2488.6,2492.16,Oz,Only he used more words
2488.6,2492.16,Oz,than that. And a globe.
2492.19,2496.53,Willow,"I'm sorry about how all this ended up,"
2492.19,2496.53,Willow,with me shooting you an' all.
2496.57,2499.81,Oz,It's OK. I'm sorry I almost ate you.
2499.85,2501.8,Oz,It's OK.
2501.84,2504.36,Willow,I kinda thought you would have told me.
2504.36,2506.04,Oz,I didn't know what to say.
2506.43,2511.03,Oz,It's not every day you find out you're...
2506.43,2511.03,Oz,a werewolf. That's fairly freaksome.
2511.07,2513.67,Oz,It may take a couple of days
2511.07,2513.67,Oz,getting used to.
2513.67,2516.71,Willow,"Yeah, it's a complication."
2517.5,2519.15,,So...
2520.2,2524.54,,Maybe it'd be best
2520.2,2524.54,,if I just... sorta...
2525.21,2527.12,,What?
2527.15,2530.68,,"Well, you know, like..."
2527.15,2530.68,,stayed out of your way for a while.
2530.85,2532.73,,I don't know.
2532.76,2536.13,,I'm kind of OK
2532.76,2536.13,,with you being in my way.
2537.74,2540.55,,"You mean, you'd still...?"
2540.87,2543.79,,"Well, I like you."
2544,2547.28,,You're nice and you're funny.
2547.32,2549.53,,And you don't smoke.
2549.57,2553.72,,"Yeah, OK, werewolf, but..."
2549.57,2553.72,,that's not all the time.
2555.27,2557.59,,"I mean, three days out of the month,"
2557.63,2560.7,,"I'm not much fun to be around, either."
2560.9,2564.19,,You are quite a human.
2565.91,2569.83,,So... I'd still if... you'd still.
2569.87,2572.25,,I'd still. I'd very still.
2572.29,2574.19,,OK.
2574.22,2577.14,,"No biting, though."
2574.22,2577.14,,Agreed.
2590.96,2593.69,,A werewolf in love!
