1.44,4.44,,"In every generation, there is a Chosen One,"
4.47,9.48,,"She alone will stand against the vampires,"
4.47,9.48,,"the demons and the forces of darkness,"
9.51,11.75,,She is the Slayer.
19.75,23.99,,"Come on, Stephan, rise and shine. Some"
19.75,23.99,,of us have a ton of trig homework waiting.
28.15,29.65,,Hey.
29.68,30.69,Angel,Is this a bad time?
30.69,31.44,Buffy,Are you crazy?
31.44,33.89,Buffy,You don't just sneak up
31.44,33.89,Buffy,on people in a graveyard.
33.92,38.15,Buffy,You make noise when you walk.
33.92,38.15,Buffy,You stomp or... yodel.
38.19,39.8,Angel,I heard you were on the hunt.
39.8,41.24,Buffy,"I'm supposed to be, but..."
41.27,46.02,Buffy,lazybones here
41.27,46.02,Buffy,doesn't wanna come out and play.
44.05,47.95,Angel,"When you first wake up,"
44.05,47.95,Angel,it's a little disorienting. He'll show.
47.98,50.27,Buffy,It's weird to think of
47.98,50.27,Buffy,you going through that.
50.27,52.73,Angel,It's weird to go through.
52.77,56.36,Angel,"So, uh, you're here alone?"
56.4,58.54,Buffy,Yeah. Why?
58.54,60.7,Angel,I just thought you'd have
58.54,60.7,Angel,somebody with you.
60.74,62.19,Angel,"Xander, or someone."
62.19,62.73,Buffy,Xander?
62.76,64.95,Angel,Or someone.
64.95,65.95,Buffy,Nope.
65.98,69.13,Buffy,Why? Are you jealous?
69.16,72.24,Angel,Of Xander? Please! He's just a kid.
72.24,74.97,Buffy,Is it 'cause I danced with him?
77.02,78.34,Angel,Danced with" is a pretty loose term.
77.02,78.34,Angel,Mated with" might be a little closer.
78.37,80.51,Buffy,Don't you think
78.37,80.51,Buffy,you're being a little unfair?
80.55,83.29,Buffy,"It was... one little dance, which..."
83.29,86.39,Buffy,I only did to make you crazy.
83.29,86.39,Buffy,"By the way, behold my success."
86.43,88.58,Angel,I am not jealous!
86.43,88.58,Angel,You are not jealous.
88.58,90.48,Buffy,"What, vampires don't get jealous?"
90.48,91.8,Angel,"See? Whenever we fight,"
91.83,93.58,Angel,you always bring up the vampire thing.
93.58,95.14,Buffy,"Well, I didn't come here to fight!"
96.58,99.55,Buffy,"Oh, right, I did!"
104.89,108.87,Buffy,Where's my stake? I know I had a stake!
108.87,111.02,Angel,I didn't see a stake.
128.89,133.14,Buffy,"What d'you mean, he's just a kid?"
128.89,133.14,Buffy,"Does that mean I'm just a kid, too?"
133.17,137.65,Angel,"Look, obviously I made"
133.17,137.65,Angel,a mistake coming here tonight.
137.68,140.69,Buffy,"Oh, no, you don't. You can't just turn"
137.68,140.69,Buffy,and walk away from me like that.
141.4,144.51,Buffy,It takes more than that to get rid of me!
151.07,153.12,Angel,You OK?
153.93,156.61,Buffy,I'm fine.
158.33,162.06,Buffy,I wish people wouldn't leave
158.33,162.06,Buffy,open graves laying around like this.
162.09,167.58,Angel,So... another vampire has risen tonight.
169.62,174.08,Buffy,I don't think so. Look at those tracks.
174.11,178.4,Buffy,Whoever was buried here
174.11,178.4,Buffy,didn't rise from this grave.
186.47,189.65,Buffy,She was dragged from it.
239.89,245.04,Giles,b>"Some Assembly Required"</b>
245.38,249.66,Giles,"Wwwhat I'm proposing is,"
245.38,249.66,Giles,and I don't mean to appear indecorous...
249.7,254.27,Giles,"isis, um, aa social engagement,"
249.7,254.27,Giles,"aa date, if you're amenable."
256.02,258.47,Giles,You idiot!
258.51,261.65,Buffy,"Boy, I guess we never realized"
258.51,261.65,Buffy,how much you like that chair.
261.69,263.85,Giles,II was just working on...
263.85,265.41,Buffy,Your pickup lines?
265.44,268.54,Giles,"Um... in a manner of speaking, yes."
268.57,270.63,Buffy,Then if you wouldn't mind
268.57,270.63,Buffy,"a little Gene and Roger,"
270.63,272.71,Buffy,you might wanna
270.63,272.71,Buffy,leave off the "idiot" part.
272.75,275.87,Buffy,Being called an idiot tends
272.75,275.87,Buffy,to take people out of the dating mood.
276.05,278.53,Xander,It actually kinda turns me on.
278.57,281.09,Buffy,I fear you.
281.12,283.42,Buffy,You also might wanna avoid words like
283.43,285.93,Buffy,"amenable"" and ""indecorous"","
283.43,285.93,Buffy,"you know? Speak English,"
285.96,287.81,Buffy,not whatever they speak in...
287.81,288.32,Giles,England?
288.35,291.89,Buffy,"Yeah. You just say ""Hey,"
288.35,291.89,Buffy,I got a thing. You maybe have a thing.
291.89,293.05,Buffy,Maybe we could have a thing".
293.08,294.72,Giles,"Oh, thank you, Cyrano."
294.72,295.98,Daryl,I'm not finished.
296.02,298.17,,Then you say
296.02,298.17,,How do you feel about Mexican?"
298.2,299.87,Giles,About Mexicans?
299.87,301.42,Buffy,Mexican. Food.
301.45,303.89,Buffy,"You take her for food,"
301.45,303.89,Buffy,for which you then pay.
303.92,305.45,Giles,"Oh, right."
305.45,308.35,Xander,So this chairwoman?
308.38,310.21,Xander,"We are talking Ms Calendar, right?"
310.21,311.61,Giles,What makes you think that?
311.65,315.37,Xander,Simple deduction.
311.65,315.37,Xander,"Ms Calendar is reasonably dollsome,"
315.4,318.45,Xander,especially for someone in your age bracket.
315.4,318.45,Xander,She already knows that
318.45,320.44,Xander,"you're a school librarian,"
318.45,320.44,Xander,so you don't have to worry about
320.44,322.28,Xander,how to break
320.44,322.28,Xander,that embarrassing news to her.
322.31,324.88,Buffy,And she's the only woman we've
322.31,324.88,Buffy,actually ever seen speak to you.
324.88,327.37,Buffy,"Add it up, it all spells ""Duh!""."
327.4,330.08,Xander,"Now, is it time to have a talk"
327.4,330.08,Xander,about the facts of life?
330.5,332.71,Giles,"You know, I'm suddenly deciding"
330.5,332.71,Giles,this is none of your business.
335.02,337.5,Xander,"You know, 'cause that whole"
335.02,337.5,Xander,stork thing is a smoke screen.
338.64,343.64,Giles,"So, how did things go last night?"
338.64,343.64,Giles,Did Mr... Korshak show up on schedule?
343.68,346.05,Buffy,More or less.
343.68,346.05,Buffy,Angel and I took care of him.
346.09,346.76,Xander,Angel.
346.76,350.24,Buffy,"There's something else, though."
350.27,352.31,Buffy,We found an empty grave.
352.34,353.78,Giles,Another vampire?
352.34,353.78,Giles,No.
353.78,356.1,Buffy,"No, this one was dug up"
353.78,356.1,Buffy,and the body was taken out.
356.14,359.48,Giles,Grave robbing? That's new. Interesting.
359.51,362.21,Buffy,I know you meant to say:
359.51,362.21,Buffy,gross and disturbing".
362.5,367.51,Giles,"Yes, yes, of course. Terrible thing."
362.5,367.51,Giles,Mustmust put a stop to it... Damn it.
367.54,371.69,Xander,"So, why does someone"
367.54,371.69,Xander,want to dig up graves?
371.89,374.37,Giles,"Well, I'll collate some theories."
374.37,376.92,Giles,It would help if we knew
374.37,376.92,Giles,who the body belonged to.
376.95,379.94,Buffy,Meredith Todd. Ring a bell?
379.94,380.27,Xander,No.
380.31,383.76,Buffy,She died recently. She was our age.
383.76,385.34,Xander,Drawin' a blank.
385.66,391.91,Giles,Why don't we ask Willow to fire... this
385.66,391.91,Giles,"thing"" up, and... track Meredith down?"
403.18,404.86,Eric,Smile.
404.86,405.98,Willow,Hey!
408.02,408.74,Eric,"Oh, look at those legs."
408.74,409.18,Willow,"No, thank you."
409.21,412.71,Chris,"Eric, will you knock it off?"
412.75,414.99,Willow,"Hey, Chris."
414.99,415.81,Chris,Hey.
416.95,420.76,Willow,"Oh, I was just wondering"
416.95,420.76,Willow,what you were gonna do this year.
420.79,421.17,Chris,Why?
421.17,423.47,Willow,Cause every year you win
423.5,426.76,Willow,"and I place second, so I just thought"
423.5,426.76,Willow,I'd see what I'm up against.
426.97,430.99,Chris,You know what the key is? If Dr Clark
426.97,430.99,Chris,"doesn't understand your experiment,"
431.02,436.35,Chris,he gives you higher marks so it looks like
431.02,436.35,Chris,he understands your experiment.
436.39,438.03,Chris,Effects of Subviolet Light
438.03,439.48,Cordelia,Spectrum Depravation...
439.52,441.92,Chris,on the Development of Fruit Flies"?
441.92,443.64,Cordelia,That should do the trick!
443.86,446.24,Cordelia,"OK, I'm doing this under protest."
446.37,450.93,Cordelia,It is not fair they're making participation
446.37,450.93,Cordelia,in this year's science fair mandatory.
450.97,453.29,Cordelia,I don't think anyone should have to do
450.97,453.29,Cordelia,"anything educational in school,"
453.32,455.19,Cordelia,if they don't want to.
455.19,457.92,Willow,The Tomato: Fruit or Vegetable?"
457.95,460.79,Cordelia,I wanted to do something
457.95,460.79,Cordelia,"I could finish in a weekend, all right?"
461.39,463.87,Cordelia,Stop it! What are you doing?!
461.39,463.87,Cordelia,We are under
463.91,465.42,Cordelia,fluorescent lights for God's sake!
465.42,466.36,Eric,The camera loves you.
466.39,469.8,Cordelia,I didn't think yearbook nerds
466.39,469.8,Cordelia,came out of hibernation till spring.
470.15,472.21,Eric,It's for my private collection.
472.21,473.74,Chris,"Eric, will you quit it?"
473.77,476.78,Buffy,Coming through. Sorry.
477.08,479.38,Buffy,"Sorry to interrupt, Willow,"
477.08,479.38,Buffy,but it's the Batsignal.
479.41,481.74,Willow,"OK, sure."
479.41,481.74,Willow,"See you later, Chris."
481.74,484.43,Willow,Thanks for the tip.
484.43,484.86,Chris,OK.
490.8,494.97,Eric,Cordelia's so fine.
490.8,494.97,Eric,"You know, she'd be just perfect for us."
497.02,498.82,Chris,Don't be an idiot. She's alive.
502.27,505.57,Willow,This shouldn't take long.
502.27,505.57,Willow,I'm probably the only girl in school
505.61,508.63,Willow,who has the coroner's office
505.61,508.63,Willow,bookmarked as a favorite place.
508.66,511.51,Cordelia,Hi. Sorry to interrupt
508.66,511.51,Cordelia,"your little undead playgroup,"
511.51,514.15,Cordelia,but I need to ask Willow if she'll help me
511.51,514.15,Cordelia,with my science fair project.
514.18,515.08,Willow,It's a fruit.
515.08,517.44,Cordelia,"I would've asked Chris to help me,"
517.47,520.47,Cordelia,but then that would've brought back
517.47,520.47,Cordelia,too many memories of Daryl.
520.85,525.78,Willow,I found it! Meredith Todd died
520.85,525.78,Willow,in a car accident last week.
525.85,528.02,Cordelia,"Of course, I have learnt"
525.85,528.02,Cordelia,to deal with my pain.
528.36,529.64,Buffy,How was her neck?
529.64,531.91,Willow,"Fine, except for being broken."
531.95,534.41,Cordelia,"Hello! Can we deal with my pain, please?"
534.45,537.27,Giles,"There, there."
537.31,541.35,Willow,It says that Meredith and two other girls
537.31,541.35,Willow,in the car were killed instantly.
541.5,545.55,Willow,They were all on the Fondren High
541.5,545.55,Willow,"Pep Squad, on the way to a game."
545.59,546.63,Buffy,You know what this means?
546.63,547.76,Xander,That Fondren might actually
547.79,550.75,Xander,beat Sunnydale in the crosstown
547.79,550.75,Xander,body count competition this year?
550.89,553.77,Buffy,She wasn't killed by vampires.
550.89,553.77,Buffy,Somebody did dig up her corpse.
553.81,558.31,Cordelia,Eww! Why is it that every conversation
553.81,558.31,Cordelia,you have has the word "corpse" in it?
558.35,560.85,Xander,"OK, so we've got a body snatcher."
558.35,560.85,Xander,What does that mean?
560.88,562.21,Giles,Here's what I've come up with.
562.21,565.49,Giles,Demons who eat the flesh of the dead
562.21,565.49,Giles,to absorb their souls.
565.52,568.55,Giles,Or it could obviously be
565.52,568.55,Giles,a voodoo practitioner.
568.58,570.39,Willow,"You mean, making a zombie?"
570.39,572.13,Giles,"Uh, zombies, more likely."
572.16,574.37,Giles,"For most traditional purposes,"
574.4,576.65,Giles,a voodoo priest would require
574.4,576.65,Giles,more than one.
576.77,580.02,Buffy,"So, we should see if the other girls"
576.77,580.02,Buffy,"in the accident are AWOL, too."
580.05,582.28,Buffy,Maybe we can figure out what this creep
580.05,582.28,Buffy,has in mind if we know whether or not
582.29,583.51,Buffy,he's dealing in volume.
583.51,585.25,Xander,So we dig up some graves tonight?
585.28,588.44,Willow,"Oh, boy, a field trip!"
585.28,588.44,Willow,You gonna call Angel?
588.47,589.81,Buffy,I don't think so.
589.81,591.86,Xander,"Yeah, why bother him, huh?"
591.9,595.25,Buffy,"Angel and I have been, um..."
591.9,595.25,Buffy,Never mind.
595.32,597.83,Buffy,"As far as Angel's concerned,"
595.32,597.83,Buffy,"I'm taking the night off, OK?"
597.86,601.79,Xander,So we're set then.
597.86,601.79,Xander,Say nineish? BYO shovel.
601.82,605.09,Willow,And I'll pack some food. Who else likes
601.82,605.09,Willow,those little powdered doughnuts?
605.34,607.31,Willow,Hey!
605.34,607.31,Willow,Cordelia?
607.35,609.99,Cordelia,"Darn, I have cheerleader practice tonight."
610.03,612.72,Cordelia,"Boy, I wish I knew we were gonna be"
610.03,612.72,Cordelia,digging up dead people sooner.
612.72,613.59,Cordelia,I would've canceled.
613.59,615.03,Xander,All right. But if you come across
615.07,618.72,Xander,"the army of zombies, can you"
615.07,618.72,Xander,page us before they eat your flesh?
620.98,621.96,Giles,Xander?
621.96,622.52,Xander,Huh?
622.86,625.62,Giles,Zombies don't eat the flesh of the living.
626.62,630.71,Xander,"Yeah, I knew that."
626.62,630.71,Xander,But did you see that look on her face?
633.5,635.77,Buffy,I couldn't believe Angel.
635.77,638.61,Buffy,He was acting all jealous
635.77,638.61,Buffy,and he wouldn't even admit it.
638.65,640.81,Willow,Jealous of what?
640.81,642.16,Buffy,Of Xander.
642.2,644.14,Willow,Because you did that
642.2,644.14,Willow,sexy dance with him?
644.24,647.31,Buffy,Am I ever gonna live that down?
647.31,647.8,Willow,Nope.
647.83,650.91,Buffy,"Anyway, he was being totally irrational."
650.91,653.07,Willow,Love makes you do the wacky.
653.11,653.77,Buffy,That's the truth.
653.77,655.16,Xander,"You know, this might go a lot faster"
655.2,657.28,Xander,if you femmes actually
655.2,657.28,Xander,"picked up a shovel, too."
657.32,658.03,Giles,"Here, here."
658.03,660.29,Buffy,"Sorry, but I'm an oldfashioned gal."
660.41,665.09,Buffy,I was raised to believe that men dig up
660.41,665.09,Buffy,the corpses and women have the babies.
665.13,667.03,Buffy,"So, speaking of the wacky,"
667.03,670.74,Willow,what was Cordelia's whole riff
667.03,670.74,Willow,about painful memories? Who's Daryl?
670.77,673.44,Willow,Daryl Epps. Chris's older brother.
673.48,676.75,Willow,He was a big football star.
673.48,676.75,Willow,Allstate two years ago.
676.9,679.12,Willow,He was a running...
679.16,683.23,Willow,He was a running...
679.16,683.23,Willow,Someone who runs and catches.
683.27,684.43,Buffy,Was he a studly?
684.43,685.09,Willow,Big time.
685.09,687.11,Willow,All the girls were crazy for him.
687.11,688.77,Buffy,And he broke Cordy's heart?
688.81,691.49,Buffy,Thus possibly proving its existence.
691.52,695.45,Willow,"He died. Rock climbing,"
691.52,695.45,Willow,or something. He fell.
695.49,698.33,Buffy,"Man, that's lousy. Poor Chris."
698.36,701.84,Willow,"Ever since then,"
698.36,701.84,Willow,Chris has been real quiet.
701.84,704.37,Willow,Kind of in his own world.
704.4,708.41,Willow,I heard their mother doesn't even
704.4,708.41,Willow,leave the house any more.
708.45,710.75,Giles,I think we're there.
713.82,718.73,Willow,"By the way, are we hoping"
713.82,718.73,Willow,"to find a body, or no body?"
718.77,724.02,Xander,"Call me an optimist, but I'm hoping"
718.77,724.02,Xander,to find a fortune in gold doubloons.
722.04,725.18,Giles,"Um, body would mean flesheating demon."
725.22,729.99,Giles,No body would point towards the army
725.22,729.99,Giles,"of zombies thing. Take your pick, really."
730.03,733.09,Giles,"Right then, go on."
733.22,735,Xander,You're closer.
735,736.78,Buffy,Pathetic much?
736.81,738.89,Buffy,Move over.
747.66,750.3,Cordelia,"Guys, if we don't"
747.66,750.3,Cordelia,"get this down by tomorrow,"
750.3,751.3,Cordelia,no one's gonna be led by our cheers.
752.93,754.7,Cordelia,Practice.
754.7,755.29,Girl,OK.
755.32,757.99,Girl,See you later.
772.17,774.85,Cordelia,Hello?
793.25,797.09,Cordelia,"Xander Harris,"
793.25,797.09,Cordelia,if this is some kind of joke...
830.8,835.22,Angel,Cordelia. This is the last place
830.8,835.22,Angel,I expected you to hang out.
835.25,836.87,Cordelia,"Oh, God."
837.16,839.55,Cordelia,"God, it's you. Why were you following me?"
839.55,841.54,Angel,I wasn't sure it was you at first.
841.57,843.94,Angel,I'm looking for Buffy.
841.57,843.94,Angel,Buffy?
843.98,847.49,Cordelia,"Well, she's, uh, big shock,"
843.98,847.49,Cordelia,she's at the graveyard.
849.39,850.64,Angel,She said she'd be home.
850.64,852.53,Cordelia,"Well, she lied. Isn't she a rascal?"
852.56,856.24,Cordelia,"Well, you're in luck."
852.56,856.24,Cordelia,It just so happens that my night is free.
857.19,860.18,Cordelia,"Oh, hold on. My skirt is caught."
860.94,862.78,Cordelia,There.
871.58,873.42,Xander,"So, both coffins are empty. That makes"
873.42,875.8,Xander,three girls signed up
873.42,875.8,Xander,for the army of zombies.
875.83,878.23,Willow,Is it an army if you just have three?
878.23,879.72,Buffy,Zombie drill team then.
879.75,881.76,Angel,You're back.
882.85,884.2,Buffy,Angel.
884.2,885.78,Angel,Xander.
885.81,886.1,Xander,Angel.
886.1,888.05,Angel,I thought you were taking the night off?
888.08,891.1,Buffy,"I, I was, um, but something came up."
891.14,893.37,Angel,Cordelia told me the truth.
893.37,895.36,Xander,That's gotta be a first.
895.4,899.86,Giles,"Um, as long as you're here,"
895.4,899.86,Giles,perhaps you could be of some help. Hm?
902.88,907.16,Buffy,We were investigating. Somebody's
902.88,907.16,Buffy,been digging up the bodies of dead girls.
907.19,909.46,Angel,I know. We found some of them.
909.5,911.53,Buffy,"You mean, like, two of the three?"
911.53,914.67,Angel,"I mean, like, some of them. Like parts."
914.7,917.46,Cordelia,It was horrible.
914.7,917.46,Cordelia,Angel saved me from an arm.
917.46,919.77,Cordelia,"God, there were so many parts."
917.46,919.77,Cordelia,They were everywhere.
919.81,922.8,Cordelia,Why are these terrible things
919.81,922.8,Cordelia,always happening to me?
922.84,923.44,Xander,Karma.
923.44,926.46,Willow,So much for our zombie theory.
926.49,928.88,Giles,So much for all our theories.
928.88,930.11,Buffy,I don't get it.
930.15,932.2,Buffy,Why go to all the trouble
930.15,932.2,Buffy,"to dig up three girls,"
932.2,935.53,Buffy,only to chop them up and throw them away?
932.2,935.53,Buffy,It doesn't make any sense!
935.57,938.09,Angel,Especially from
935.57,938.09,Angel,a timemanagement standpoint.
938.12,941.05,Angel,What I saw didn't
938.12,941.05,Angel,add up to three whole girls.
941.09,943.11,Angel,I think they kept some parts.
943.11,944.71,Buffy,Could this get yuckier?
944.74,946.85,Willow,They probably kept the other parts to eat!
946.85,948.17,Buffy,Question answered.
948.21,953.17,Giles,Why dispose of the remains five miles from
948.21,953.17,Giles,"the cemetery, at a school, of all places?"
953.21,955.88,Buffy,Maybe because whoever did it
953.21,955.88,Buffy,had some business in the neighborhood.
955.88,959.22,Buffy,"Like, say, classes?"
959.22,960.45,Giles,Oh. Ah.
960.49,961.98,Angel,This was no hatchet job.
961.98,964.64,Angel,Whoever made those incisions
961.98,964.64,Angel,really knew what they were doing.
964.67,968.73,Giles,"Yes, really. What student here is gonna be"
964.67,968.73,Giles,that well versed in... physiology?
968.76,972.97,Willow,"Well, I can think of five or six guys"
968.76,972.97,Willow,in the science club. And me.
975.02,974.43,Xander,"So, Will, come clean."
974.43,978.64,Xander,"Promise to never do it again,"
974.43,978.64,Xander,and we'll call it a night.
978.67,980.48,Xander,He joked!
980.52,983.58,Buffy,"Willow, why don't you get these guys'"
980.52,983.58,Buffy,locker numbers so we can do some checking?
983.61,987.99,Cordelia,No. I have to go home now.
983.61,987.99,Cordelia,I have to take a bath and burn my clothes.
988.03,991.45,Xander,You have to go?
988.03,991.45,Xander,"Ah, too bad. Keep in touch. Byebye."
991.48,995.93,Cordelia,I don't wanna go alone. I'm still fragile.
995.96,998.77,Cordelia,Can you take me?
1001.76,1003.85,Cordelia,Great. I'll drive.
1013.03,1017.14,Xander,How about that? I always pegged him
1013.03,1017.14,Xander,as a onewoman vampire.
1032.43,1035.21,Chris,"I'm going out, Mom."
1041.19,1044.46,Chris,"I'll be back later, OK?"
1044.65,1047.28,Chris,Mom?
1049.83,1056.52,Video,Daryl! Daryl! Daryl!
1065.2,1067.55,Giles,"You understand, in my capacity"
1065.2,1067.55,Giles,"as school official,"
1067.55,1071.03,Giles,"this search is completely unauthorized,"
1067.55,1071.03,Giles,"and I, I cannot condone it."
1071.07,1074.37,Buffy,"Fine, your butt's covered."
1071.07,1074.37,Buffy,Wanna grab a locker?
1074.41,1076.58,Giles,"Oh, yes. Yes, of course."
1076.62,1081.63,Buffy,"OK, Eric, let's see"
1076.62,1081.63,Buffy,what's on your annoying little mind.
1083.12,1086.48,Willow,Nothing in here but back issues
1083.12,1086.48,Willow,"of Scientific American,"
1086.88,1089.52,Willow,"Ooh, I haven't read this one."
1090.63,1095.02,Giles,Nothing remarkable here.
1093.46,1095.43,Xander,Guys.
1098.15,1100.15,Xander,Your friend Chris Epps' locker.
1100.55,1103.55,Willow,"Grey's Anatomy,"
1100.55,1103.55,Willow,"Mortician's Desk Reference,"
1103.55,1104.71,Willow,Robicheaux's
1104.71,1107.53,Giles,"Guide to Muscles and Tendons,"
1107.57,1110.35,Giles,I think it's fair to say
1107.57,1110.35,Giles,Chris is involved.
1110.35,1113.49,Xander,"He's into corpses, all right,"
1110.35,1113.49,Xander,but we still don't know why.
1113.53,1115.54,Buffy,"Yes, we do."
1121.3,1124.77,Eric,i># I guess you say</i>
1125.06,1128.52,Eric,i># What can make me feel this way?</i>
1129.34,1131.27,Eric,i># My girl</i>
1131.32,1134.12,Eric,i># Talkin' 'bout my girl</i>
1134.35,1136.32,Eric,i># My girl!</i>
1136.42,1139.36,Chris,How's my baby?
1136.42,1139.36,Chris,She's not your baby.
1139.45,1141.92,Eric,She's not gonna be anybody's baby
1139.45,1141.92,Eric,if we don't finish her soon.
1141.92,1144.36,Chris,I'm working on it!
1144.36,1147.74,Eric,"So am I, friend. So am I."
1157.6,1159.65,Xander,Any sign of our suspects?
1159.65,1160.31,Buffy,Not yet.
1161.36,1164.81,Buffy,I don't get it. Why would
1161.36,1164.81,Buffy,anybody wanna make a girl?
1164.85,1167.88,Xander,You mean when there's so many
1164.85,1167.88,Xander,premade ones just laying around?
1167.91,1170.78,Buffy,The things we do for love.
1167.91,1170.78,Buffy,Love has nothing to do with this.
1170.82,1172.61,Xander,"Maybe not, but I'll tell you this:"
1172.65,1175.13,Xander,people don't fall in love with
1172.65,1175.13,Xander,what's right in front of them.
1175.16,1177.87,Xander,People want the dream.
1175.16,1177.87,Xander,What they can't have.
1177.91,1181.73,Xander,"The more unattainable, the more attractive."
1182.44,1186.92,Willow,"And for Eric, the unattainable"
1182.44,1186.92,Willow,would include everyone that's alive.
1186.95,1189.13,Buffy,Eric's sick enough
1186.95,1189.13,Buffy,"to do something like this, but"
1189.13,1190.38,Willow,what about Chris?
1190.38,1192.65,Buffy,He seems like a "human" person.
1192.69,1196.5,Willow,I don't know. That thing
1192.69,1196.5,Willow,with his brother was really hard on him.
1197.03,1198.91,Willow,And he talked about death a lot.
1198.95,1200.33,Buffy,Maybe he just wanted
1200.33,1201.64,Willow,to get oneup on it.
1201.67,1203.72,Buffy,But it's not doable.
1203.75,1207.74,Buffy,"I mean, making someone from scraps,"
1203.75,1207.74,Buffy,actually making them live.
1208,1212.28,Willow,"If it is, my science project's"
1208,1212.28,Willow,definitely coming in second this year.
1212.68,1214.89,Xander,And speaking of love...
1215.18,1217.95,Willow,We were talking about
1215.18,1217.95,Willow,the reanimation of dead tissue.
1220.02,1220.18,Xander,Do I deconstruct your segues? Huh?
1220.21,1222.13,Buffy,Hey.
1222.17,1224.37,Giles,"Oh, yes. Hello."
1224.41,1226.92,Buffy,Still no sign of our mad doctors?
1226.92,1227.3,Giles,What?
1227.33,1230.9,Giles,"Oh, corpses. Yes, evil. Very good."
1231.15,1233.51,Jenny,Did you bring it? Tomorrow...
1233.51,1234.32,Giles,Very good.
1234.36,1238.87,Buffy,"OK, Giles, just remember. ""I feel a thing."
1234.36,1238.87,Buffy,You feel a thing." But personalize it.
1238.9,1240,Giles,Personalize it?
1240,1241.99,Buffy,"She's a technopagan, right?"
1242.03,1244.45,Buffy,Ask her to bless your laptop.
1245.12,1247.83,Giles,Have fun.
1245.12,1247.83,Giles,"What? Oh, don't..."
1247.86,1249.5,Xander,Best of luck.
1249.5,1250.26,Giles,leave.
1250.86,1252.2,Jenny,"Good morning, Rupert."
1252.2,1252.96,Giles,Ms Calendar?
1253,1255.86,Jenny,"Oh, no, please, call me Jenny."
1253,1255.86,Jenny,Ms Calendar" is my father.
1255.9,1257.74,Giles,"Jenny, then."
1257.78,1262.12,Giles,"You know, uh, Jenny,"
1257.78,1262.12,Giles,"um, would it appear indecorous..."
1262.16,1264.56,Giles,"No, not indecorous. Uh..."
1264.6,1265.71,Jenny,Yeah?
1265.74,1269.67,Giles,"Well... Oh, dear. II, um..."
1270.16,1273.29,Jenny,"Rupert, look, I've got to get inside"
1270.16,1273.29,Jenny,and set up the lab.
1273.32,1275.05,Giles,What I'm proposing is...
1275.05,1275.27,Jenny,Ah!
1275.3,1276.89,Jenny,I gotta go! Sorry.
1281.95,1283.9,Giles,Idiot!
1284.03,1287.4,Jenny,"Hey. Listen, if it's important,"
1284.03,1287.4,Jenny,why don't you just tell me at the game?
1287.43,1291.14,Giles,"Game? Oh, you're going"
1287.43,1291.14,Giles,to the football game?
1291.17,1294.04,Jenny,Yeah. You seem surprised.
1291.17,1294.04,Jenny,"No, no, uh..."
1294.07,1296.94,Giles,IIIII just assumed that
1294.07,1296.94,Giles,youyouyou spent your evenings
1296.94,1299.94,Giles,downloading incantations
1296.94,1299.94,Giles,"and, and casting bones."
1299.98,1302.43,Jenny,On game night? Are you nuts?
1302.5,1304.23,Jenny,"You're going too, right?"
1304.23,1305.24,Giles,"Oh, of course."
1305.28,1306.45,Giles,Always. Always do.
1306.45,1308.4,Jenny,So we should just go together.
1308.44,1310.46,Jenny,"Look, I could pick you up after school,"
1310.5,1312.72,Jenny,and we'll grab a bite to eat
1310.5,1312.72,Jenny,on the way if you like.
1312.75,1314.87,Jenny,How do you feel about Mexican?
1314.91,1318.22,Jenny,Good! OK! And whatever it is you wanna
1314.91,1318.22,Jenny,"tell me, you can just tell me then."
1318.22,1320.08,Jenny,OK?
1318.22,1320.08,Jenny,OK.
1320.12,1323.16,Giles,"Uh, tonight, then."
1325.56,1327.54,Giles,That went well.
1327.57,1329.67,Giles,I think.
1332.64,1335.59,Willow,I still don't get how Chris could do it.
1335.59,1338.55,Willow,"I mean, arresting cell deterioration"
1335.59,1338.55,Willow,"is one thing, but..."
1338.58,1341.89,Xander,"Hello. I wanna get ahead,"""
1342.45,1346.11,Willow,Maybe an electrical current
1342.45,1346.11,Willow,combined with an adrenaline boost.
1346.14,1349.54,Xander,"For the love of God,"
1346.14,1349.54,Xander,can somebody scratch my nose?"
1350.59,1353.39,Buffy,"Well, it's official. Chris and Eric"
1350.59,1353.39,Buffy,didn't come to school today.
1353.39,1354.55,Xander,That's no coincidence.
1354.55,1356.35,Willow,Maybe they finished their project.
1356.38,1359.9,Buffy,God. What if it worked? What if
1356.38,1359.9,Buffy,that poor girl is walking around?
1359.93,1361.23,Xander,"Poor girls, technically."
1361.23,1362.69,Buffy,What could she be thinking?
1362.72,1365.41,Willow,And... what are they gonna... do with her?
1365.44,1366.67,Willow,I don't think we have
1366.67,1368.38,Giles,to worry about that just yet.
1368.44,1371.93,Giles,I spoke to a press person this morning
1368.44,1371.93,Giles,about the remains.
1371.97,1374.31,Giles,The police have finished
1371.97,1374.31,Giles,sorting through them and
1374.34,1376.96,Giles,"apparently, they found"
1374.34,1376.96,Giles,three heads in the dumpster.
1376.96,1378.4,Buffy,They only had three girls.
1378.4,1378.95,Giles,Precisely.
1378.99,1381.98,Willow,"So they don't have the whole,"
1378.99,1381.98,Willow,"uh, package?"
1382.01,1389.02,Xander,Heads must be no good.
1382.01,1389.02,Xander,Huh. I found 'em attractive enough.
1388.34,1390.75,Xander,"Well, obviously"
1388.34,1390.75,Xander,I'm not as sick as Chris and Eric.
1390.75,1393.36,Giles,"Based on what the police have put together,"
1393.39,1397.13,Giles,I would say they're one step short
1393.39,1397.13,Giles,of completing their masterpiece.
1397.17,1400.46,Willow,One step...
1404.46,1406.17,Eric,We're running out of time.
1406.34,1410.36,Eric,"If we wait too long, the onset of atrophy"
1406.34,1410.36,Eric,in the limbs will be irreversible.
1410.4,1413.88,Chris,We can turn up the current.
1410.4,1413.88,Chris,That'll buy us a day at least.
1413.92,1416.75,Eric,We will lose the body
1413.92,1416.75,Eric,if we don't attach a head soon!
1416.79,1419.02,Chris,We have time.
1419.02,1420.57,Eric,We don't!
1420.73,1423.35,Eric,The crash with the girls was lucky.
1423.44,1426.19,Eric,But we can't just keep waiting around
1423.44,1426.19,Eric,for another lucky accident
1426.2,1429.67,Eric,to drop a head in our laps.
1430.26,1433.27,Eric,You know what we have to do.
1433.45,1436.02,Eric,"Hell, it's just one lousy girl."
1436.02,1437.18,Chris,I won't do it.
1437.41,1438.76,Chris,I...
1438.79,1442.19,Chris,I can't... kill anyone.
1445.24,1448.25,Chris,Please... understand.
1448.28,1451.48,Chris,II can't do that.
1451.5,1453.46,Chris,Please don't make me.
1453.46,1455.88,Daryl,But you gave me your word.
1455.92,1458.85,Daryl,"You promised me, little brother,"
1462.02,1464,Daryl,that I wouldn't be alone.
1466.2,1471.2,Eric,The body is perfect. And if we harvest
1466.2,1471.2,Eric,"a head tonight, she'll be ready by sunrise."
1471.24,1475.12,Daryl,"When you brought me back,"
1471.24,1475.12,Daryl,you promised you'd take care of me.
1475.18,1477.36,Chris,"I need this, Chris."
1477.4,1480.16,Chris,I need someone.
1481.22,1486.54,Chris,Please don't ask me to do this.
1481.22,1486.54,Chris,Don't ask me to take a life.
1486.55,1489.55,Eric,I tried to tell him. If you take a life
1486.55,1489.55,Eric,"in order to make a life,"
1489.55,1493.13,Eric,the whole thing is a wash.
1489.55,1493.13,Eric,"No harm, no foul."
1493.17,1495.68,Chris,Maybe you could... you could go out.
1495.71,1495.98,Daryl,No!
1495.98,1497.42,Chris,Let people know.
1497.49,1500.22,Daryl,They can't see me!
1500.65,1504.37,Daryl,"Chris, you've always been smarter than me."
1504.41,1507.13,Daryl,You were always the brains.
1507.5,1511.58,Daryl,You're the only one who can help me now.
1511.62,1515.14,Daryl,"Third and long, seconds to go."
1515.18,1517.64,Chris,Where do you throw?
1517.67,1520.02,Chris,Where do you throw?
1520.06,1522.35,Chris,Number five.
1523.78,1525.65,Chris,Daryl's gonna drive.
1525.69,1529.03,Daryl,"Help me, brother."
1532.44,1535.19,Daryl,Thank you.
1536.29,1538.58,Daryl,Show me!
1545.68,1547.35,Daryl,This one!
1547.35,1548.28,Eric,Haha.
1549.44,1551.27,Eric,A man of taste.
1555.3,1557.26,Eric,i># My girl</i>
1559.68,1561.64,Eric,i># Talkin' 'bout</i>
1562.18,1564.02,Eric,i># My girl</i>
1565.31,1566.56,Eric,i># My girl</i>
1566.6,1569.93,Willow,I checked the obits. Nothing
1566.6,1569.93,Willow,that would make a likely candidate.
1570.32,1573.05,Xander,They seem kinda picky for guys
1570.32,1573.05,Xander,who had three heads to begin with.
1573.08,1574.6,Willow,Formaldehyde.
1574.64,1577.2,Willow,Come again?
1574.64,1577.2,Willow,"Formaldehyde. Oh, yes, yes, yes,"
1577.2,1580.63,Giles,"yes, of course! It accelerates"
1577.2,1580.63,Giles,neural decay in the brain cells.
1580.67,1584.8,Willow,After a couple of days they're useless.
1580.67,1584.8,Willow,They're gonna need something really fresh.
1584.83,1585.78,Buffy,How fresh?
1585.78,1587.79,Willow,As fresh as possible.
1588.47,1590.34,Willow,"Buffy, you don't think that they would..."
1590.38,1591.17,Willow,I think anyone who
1591.17,1592.66,Buffy,cuts dead girls into little pieces
1592.66,1595.34,Buffy,does not get the benefit of any doubt.
1592.66,1595.34,Buffy,I wanna end this thing now.
1595.38,1596.05,Giles,I second that.
1596.05,1597.58,Buffy,"OK, fine. You guys go to Eric's,"
1597.61,1599.41,Buffy,"we can go to Chris', and meet up."
1599.41,1600.93,Giles,I'm supposed to be at the...
1600.97,1604.48,Buffy,big game". II believe it's called.
1600.97,1604.48,Buffy,Fine. Go ahead. We'll take care of this.
1604.52,1606.66,Giles,"Yes, but shouldn't I... I'm..."
1606.66,1609.3,Buffy,"OK, then why don't we all meet there?"
1609.34,1610.66,Giles,Fine. Yes.
1611,1613.27,Willow,Buffy?
1613.3,1617.83,Willow,Don't be too hard on Chris.
1613.3,1617.83,Willow,"I mean, he's not a vampire."
1617.88,1622.12,Buffy,"No, he's just a ghoul."
1628.65,1633.03,Buffy,"Hi. Um, I'm a friend of Chris's."
1628.65,1633.03,Buffy,I kinda need to talk to him.
1633.06,1635.07,Buffy,D'you know if he's home?
1646.8,1649.33,Buffy,"So, is he home?"
1649.36,1654.15,Mrs. Epps,"Westbury game. November 17th, '95."
1654.31,1661.02,Mrs. Epps,Daryl rushed 185 yards that night.
1654.31,1661.02,Mrs. Epps,Four TDs.
1659.04,1663.39,Mrs. Epps,He was MVP and he made
1659.04,1663.39,Mrs. Epps,allcity that season.
1663.7,1666.82,Buffy,"Yeah, that was a great one."
1663.7,1666.82,Buffy,But is Chris home?
1666.86,1670.51,Mrs. Epps,I don't know. Is today a school day?
1670.58,1672.25,Mrs. Epps,"Oh, watch! Watch this move!"
1672.46,1676.78,Mrs. Epps,Daryl takes a kickoff.
1672.46,1676.78,Mrs. Epps,"He sheds one, two, three defenders."
1676.84,1681.59,Mrs. Epps,And he breaks into the open field
1676.84,1681.59,Mrs. Epps,for a 95yard touchdown.
1688.73,1692.23,Mrs. Epps,He would have been 19 next week.
1748.41,1750.15,Buffy,Cordelia.
1762.5,1764.7,Joy,"Cordelia, 'you coming?"
1764.7,1767.1,Cordelia,"Yeah, I'll be right out."
1773.76,1777.55,Cordelia,"Oh, God. Chris, you scared me."
1777.58,1780.12,Cordelia,What are you doing in here?
1780.65,1783.39,Cordelia,Is something wrong?
1789.41,1791.03,Buffy,"Joy, Lisa, where's Cordelia?"
1791.03,1793.05,Joy,Cordelia has a game to think about.
1793.09,1796.2,Joy,She doesn't need losers like you.
1796.23,1798.9,Buffy,I'm sorry. What did you say?
1808.02,1808.08,Buffy,Are you OK?
1808.08,1808.19,Cordelia,"Oh, my God, Buffy."
1808.22,1809.96,Buffy,Don't worry. He's gone.
1809.96,1812.25,Cordelia,I was on my way down to the field
1809.96,1812.25,Cordelia,when Chris came in
1812.28,1814.08,Cordelia,and all of a sudden someone jumped me.
1814.08,1815.83,Buffy,Shh! Quiet down. Relax. Take it easy.
1817.58,1819.77,Cordelia,"That's the fight song. Oh, my God,"
1819.77,1821.96,Cordelia,it's time for the cheerleader pyramid
1819.77,1821.96,Cordelia,at midfield. I've gotta go.
1821.99,1823.25,Buffy,Are you sure you're OK to go out there?
1823.25,1824.13,Cordelia,"Yeah, you don't understand."
1824.13,1828.09,Cordelia,I have to go. I'm the apex!
1832.6,1834.06,Buffy,Chris?
1835.73,1837.77,Buffy,I know what you're trying to do.
1838.23,1840.07,Buffy,You and Eric.
1841.36,1843.73,Chris,I know about the bodies from the cemetery.
1844.49,1847.2,Chris,But you haven't hurt anyone yet.
1850.75,1856.18,Buffy,"Look, I know what it's like"
1850.75,1856.18,Buffy,to lose someone that you're close to.
1856.21,1858.59,Chris,But that's no excuse.
1858.88,1860.97,Buffy,What you're doing is wrong.
1860.97,1862.98,Chris,I have to do this for him.
1865.14,1866.68,Chris,He needs someone.
1866.68,1867.58,Buffy,Who? Eric?
1867.58,1869.7,Buffy,He needs industrialstrength therapy!
1869.74,1873.07,Chris,He always... looked out for me.
1873.9,1876.46,Chris,Stood up for me.
1877.66,1880.53,Chris,He's all alone.
1880.79,1884.64,Chris,Everybody loved him...
1880.79,1884.64,Chris,and now he's all alone.
1884.68,1887.7,Buffy,Who are you talking...
1890.8,1892.15,Buffy,"Oh, my God."
1892.19,1893.81,Daryl,You promised me!
1893.93,1896.37,Daryl,You promised!
1896.43,1898.84,Daryl,I wouldn't have to be alone!
1898.87,1901.23,Eric,It's not too late.
1906.45,1910.75,Eric,Nothing's changed.
1906.45,1910.75,Eric,"We can still do this, you and me."
1910.83,1914.23,Eric,Your brother's not the only one
1910.83,1914.23,Eric,who can create life.
1914.27,1916.27,Eric,What d'you say?
1922.72,1925.07,Eric,Let's go scare you up a date.
1933.99,1935.82,Buffy,Daryl!
1938.99,1940.33,Buffy,Daryl?
1940.67,1942.96,Buffy,Daryl! What...
1943.8,1946.5,Buffy,He's not here. Where else could he be?
1946.54,1949.81,Chris,But... he would never go out.
1950.26,1951.13,Chris,Unless...
1951.13,1954.79,Buffy,He's gonna pick up where you left off.
1957.32,1960.99,Squad,"Go, Greenbacks, go! Go, team, go!"
1963.03,1965.02,Squad,"Go, team, go!"
1971.79,1973.99,Jenny,I don't know what it is
1971.79,1973.99,Jenny,about football does it for me.
1974.29,1981.03,Jenny,"I mean, it lacks the grace of basketball,"
1974.29,1981.03,Jenny,"the, uh, poetry of baseball."
1981.18,1986.18,Jenny,"At its best, it's unadorned aggression."
1981.18,1986.18,Jenny,It's such a rugged contest.
1986.22,1988.97,Giles,Rugged? American football?
1988.97,1991.61,Jenny,And that's funny because?
1991.82,1996.4,Giles,"No, I just think it's rather odd that"
1991.82,1996.4,Giles,a nation that prides itself on its virility
1996.43,1999.22,Giles,should feel compelled to strap on
1996.43,1999.22,Giles,lbs of protective gear
1999.22,2001.53,Giles,just in order to play rugby.
2001.57,2003.65,Jenny,Is this your normal strategy
2001.57,2003.65,Jenny,for a first date:
2003.65,2007.46,Jenny,dissing my country's national pastime?
2007.5,2011.34,Giles,Did you just say... "date"?
2011.38,2012.9,Jenny,"You noticed that, huh?"
2012.9,2014.77,Willow,"Hi, Ms Calendar. Hi, Giles."
2014.81,2015.9,Jenny,Hey. What's up?
2015.9,2018.3,Willow,Eric's was a bust. Nothing there.
2018.34,2021.16,Xander,Nothing much but computer equipment
2018.34,2021.16,Xander,and a pornography collection
2021.16,2023.11,Xander,"so prodigious it even scared me,"
2023.14,2025.17,Willow,Did Buffy get back yet?
2025.17,2026.14,Giles,"No. Uh, no."
2026.17,2028.86,Giles,"Perhaps you should, uh,"
2026.17,2028.86,Giles,circulate nearer the field
2028.86,2031.96,Giles,and see what you can find.
2033.12,2035.75,Xander,So what's the score?
2116.89,2120.26,Buffy,I don't see her. Do you?
2120.26,2120.68,Chris,No.
2122.95,2125.13,Cordelia,"Please, what's going on?"
2125.16,2129.63,Cordelia,Just take off the blindfold.
2125.16,2129.63,Cordelia,I promise I won't scream. I promise.
2129.67,2131.94,Daryl,She's beautiful.
2131.94,2132.36,Eric,No!
2132.4,2135.43,Eric,It's bad luck for the groom
2132.4,2135.43,Eric,to see the bride before the wedding.
2135.79,2141.65,Cordelia,"Please, just take off the blindfold."
2135.79,2141.65,Cordelia,I promise I won't scream. I promise.
2141.68,2143.19,Daryl,Cordelia...
2148.41,2151.24,Eric,Scream all you want.
2148.41,2151.24,Eric,We're in an abandoned building.
2151.27,2153.41,Eric,Help!
2153.45,2156.17,Eric,"OK, that's enough."
2157.95,2163.94,Daryl,"You were always good to me,"
2157.95,2163.94,Daryl,"always noticed me, but I ignored you."
2164.05,2169.54,Daryl,I'm sorry. I'm glad I have
2164.05,2169.54,Daryl,a second chance to tell you that.
2169.69,2171.69,Cordelia,DDaryl?
2172.19,2175.32,Daryl,I was thoughtless. I see that now.
2175.36,2177.82,Daryl,But I've changed.
2177.86,2180.81,Daryl,I've learned to appreciate
2177.86,2180.81,Daryl,how much it meant...
2180.82,2183.26,Daryl,that you wanted to be with me.
2183.29,2184.37,Eric,We're ready.
2184.37,2186.34,Cordelia,Ready? Ready for what?
2186.59,2190.54,Eric,"You're gonna feel a little pinch,"
2186.59,2190.54,Eric,maybe some discomfort around the neck area.
2190.58,2194.95,Eric,But don't worry. When you wake up
2190.58,2194.95,Eric,you'll have the body of a 17yearold.
2194.98,2198.24,Eric,"In fact, you'll have the body of several."
2203.18,2206.44,Buffy,"He was here, Chris. Where did he take her?"
2206.61,2208.78,Chris,To the rest of the body. To the lab.
2208.78,2209.62,Buffy,Where is that?
2209.74,2210.91,Chris,I promised him...
2210.91,2212.29,Buffy,He'll kill Cordelia!
2212.87,2215.23,Buffy,You can't just
2212.87,2215.23,Buffy,give and take lives like that.
2215.27,2218.63,Buffy,It's not your job.
2219.13,2222.89,Chris,He's in the old science lab.
2219.13,2222.89,Chris,Everything's set up there.
2222.92,2224.7,Buffy,Thank you.
2224.73,2228.96,Buffy,"Now find Xander and Willow,"
2224.73,2228.96,Buffy,and tell them what's going on.
2232.27,2235.61,Cordelia,"Daryl, please. You don't have to do this."
2235.65,2238.33,Daryl,"We have to, so we can be together."
2239.16,2242.19,Cordelia,We'll be together anyway.
2239.16,2242.19,Cordelia,"I'll be with you, I promise."
2242.22,2244.17,Daryl,Is that right?
2242.22,2244.17,Daryl,Uhhuh.
2244.2,2247.13,Daryl,You see anything you like?
2249.8,2253.4,Daryl,"And when you're finished,"
2249.8,2253.4,Daryl,"you won't go out, you won't run away,"
2253.41,2255.79,Daryl,but we can hide together.
2255.83,2257.09,Cordelia,Please. Please!
2257.09,2260.03,Eric,Sterile enough for government work.
2261.3,2262.75,Eric,No!
2262.94,2264.88,Cordelia,No! Please!
2267.86,2269.91,Cordelia,"Buffy, help me!"
2270.37,2272.31,Buffy,"Daryl, listen."
2270.37,2272.31,Buffy,"I know what you're doing, OK?"
2272.34,2273.8,Buffy,Your brother sent me to stop you.
2273.8,2274.69,Daryl,He wouldn't do that.
2274.69,2275.83,Daryl,My brother loves me.
2275.83,2277.03,Cordelia,"Buffy, they're crazy."
2277.07,2278.75,Buffy,"It's OK, Cordelia."
2277.07,2278.75,Buffy,I'm gonna get you out of here.
2278.79,2284.1,Daryl,"No, I'm not done with her yet."
2278.79,2284.1,Daryl,I'm not finished!
2292.6,2295.42,Daryl,I won't live alone!
2296.65,2298.27,Eric,I'm gettin' outta here!
2298.27,2299.68,Daryl,You have to help me.
2299.72,2301.81,Eric,Let go!
2318.89,2319.85,Xander,Buffy!
2319.85,2321.94,Buffy,Get Cordelia!
2322.02,2323.85,Cordelia,Xander!
2324.32,2327.61,Cordelia,Get me out of here!
2334.96,2339.39,Cordelia,"Come on, Xander, come on!"
2334.96,2339.39,Cordelia,Come on! Get it off!
2339.64,2343.54,Cordelia,Get it off! Get me out of here! Come on!
2351.76,2354.65,Cordelia,Hurry up!
2375.02,2374.85,Chris,Daryl!
2376.02,2378.77,Chris,Don't!
2383.03,2385.7,Daryl,Shshe's mine!
2385.7,2386.93,Chris,Daryl!
2387.08,2388.96,Chris,Daryl!
2388.99,2393.54,Daryl,No. We'll be together always. No.
2393.57,2396.51,Daryl,Mine.
2413.17,2416.14,Chris,"The first time he woke up, after..."
2417.02,2420.78,Chris,He said I shouldn't've brought him back.
2420.81,2423.54,Chris,I was just trying to look out for him.
2423.58,2427.42,Angel,Like... he would have done for me.
2429.54,2432.24,Angel,I saw the fire. I figured you'd be here.
2432.28,2434.54,Angel,Is everyone OK?
2434.54,2435.29,Buffy,Yeah.
2435.47,2437.68,Buffy,We're OK.
2441.11,2443.22,Giles,Sorry about all this.
2443.22,2444.03,Jenny,It's OK.
2444.07,2446.58,Jenny,Although a good rule of thumb
2444.07,2446.58,Jenny,for a first date is:
2446.58,2449.89,Jenny,don't do anything so exciting
2446.58,2449.89,Jenny,it'll be hard to top on a second date.
2449.93,2452.87,Giles,"Believe it or not, since I've moved here"
2449.93,2452.87,Giles,"to live on top of the Hellmouth,"
2453,2456.86,Giles,the events of this evening
2453,2456.86,Giles,actually qualify as a slow night.
