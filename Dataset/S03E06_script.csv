7.7,12.14,,And on that tragic day.
7.7,12.14,,an era came to its inevitable end."
12.2,14.93,,That's all there is.
12.2,14.93,,Are you ready?
17.02,16.4,,Hit me.
16.47,19.84,,Which of the following best expresses
16.47,19.84,,the theme of the passage?
19.91,21.38,,A": violence breeds violence...
21.45,23.41,,B": all things must end...
23.48,24.45,,C"...
24.52,28.02,,B." I'm going with "B."
26.08,27.98,,We haven't had a "B" in forever.
28.05,31.65,,This is the S.A.T.s. Buffy. Not

31.72,35.45,,A low score could seriously harm
31.72,35.45,,your chances of getting into college.
35.53,37.49,,Gee. Thanks. That takes
35.53,37.49,,the pressure right off.
37.56,40.12,,This isn't meant to be easy. You know.
37.56,40.12,,It's a rite of passage.
40.2,41.93,,Is it too late to join a tribe
42,43.76,,where they just pierce something
42,43.76,,or cut something off?
43.83,46.27,Giles,Buffy. Please concentrate.
47.91,48.84,Buffy,Roll!
48.91,50.93,Giles,What? Huh!
52.34,53.28,Buffy,Unh!
57.02,61.07,Buffy,Advertise your product or brand here
57.02,61.07,Buffy,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
64.36,65.41,Buffy,Unh!
67.93,69.92,Buffy,Hmm. I broke
67.93,69.92,Buffy,my number two pencil.
69.99,72.39,Buffy,We'll have to do this
69.99,72.39,Buffy,again sometime.
72.46,74.9,Giles,C": all systems tend
72.46,74.9,Giles,towards chaos.
74.97,77.59,Buffy,I just know that us
74.97,77.59,Buffy,and the undead
77.67,80.9,Buffy,are the only people in Sunnydale
77.67,80.9,Buffy,working this late.
82.27,84.24,Mayor Wilkins,Mayor:
82.27,84.24,Mayor Wilkins,I appreciate you coming.
84.31,88.87,Mayor Wilkins,I realize it is early...
84.31,88.87,Mayor Wilkins,for you...
88.95,90.88,Mayor Wilkins,but I think you'll agree
90.95,92.64,Mayor Wilkins,that this matter is urgent.
92.64,93.71,Trick,also... delicate.
93.78,95.72,Trick,I'm a very delicate person.
95.79,97.91,Mayor Wilkins,So you feel you can handle this?
97.99,100.01,Trick,It's a little out of my element...
100.09,102.08,Trick,but I can get you what you need.
102.16,104.22,Trick,I know a beast who knows a guy.
104.3,107.36,Mayor Wilkins,Are you sure that subcontracting
104.3,107.36,Mayor Wilkins,is the way to go here?
107.43,109.73,Trick,Well. This guy's worked
107.43,109.73,Trick,your town before...
109.8,114,Trick,and if he lives up to his rep.
109.8,114,Trick,this place will be in flames.
114.07,117.73,Mayor Wilkins,I've made certain deals
114.07,117.73,Mayor Wilkins,to get where I am today.
117.81,119.74,Mayor Wilkins,This demon requires his tribute.
119.81,124.21,Mayor Wilkins,See. That's what separates me
119.81,124.21,Mayor Wilkins,from other politicians. Mr. Trick.
129.92,132.91,Mayor Wilkins,I keep my campaign promises.
136.33,138.06,Mayor Wilkins,
138.13,141.26,Mayor Wilkins,Where'd I put that scotch?
200.79,201.1,Mayor Wilkins,Buffy:
201.1,202.49,Buffy,And then I was being chased
202.56,205.5,Buffy,by an improperly filledin answer
202.56,205.5,Buffy,bubble screaming. "None of the above!"
205.56,209.12,Willow,Wow. I hope that wasn't one
205.56,209.12,Willow,of your prophecy dreams.
209.2,210.6,Willow,Probably not.
210.67,214.37,Oz,You know. I took it last year.
210.67,214.37,Oz,I could help you get ready.
214.44,215.83,Willow,There's this whole trick
215.83,216.93,Oz,to antonyms. But...
219.02,218.41,Willow,this isn't the place.
218.48,221.44,Willow,Oz is the highestscoring person
218.48,221.44,Willow,ever to fail to graduate.
221.51,223.21,Buffy,Isn't she cute when she's proud?
223.28,224.47,Oz,She's always cute.
224.55,226.21,Willow,We could work on it tonight.
226.28,227.65,Xander,Work on what tonight?
227.72,229.41,Cordelia,Oh. God. Are we
227.72,229.41,Cordelia,killing something again?
229.49,230.92,Buffy,Only my carefree spirit.
230.99,232.46,Oz,Buffy S.A.T. prep.
232.52,234.62,Willow,Oz is helping.
232.52,234.62,Willow,He's the highestscoring...
234.69,237.13,Cordelia,We know. We did
234.69,237.13,Cordelia,the impressed thing already.
237.19,239.25,Xander,I hate they make us
237.19,239.25,Xander,take that thing.
239.33,241.03,Xander,It's totally fascist.
239.33,241.03,Xander,and personally...
241.1,243.33,Xander,I think it discriminates
241.1,243.33,Xander,against the uninformed.
243.4,245.46,Cordelia,Actually.
243.4,245.46,Cordelia,I'm looking forward to it.
245.54,247.6,Cordelia,I do well on standardized tests.
247.67,249.54,Cordelia,What? I can't have layers?
249.61,251.07,Willow,So. Buff. Study tonight?
251.14,254.58,Buffy,Yes on the studying. No on tonight.
251.14,254.58,Buffy,I'm putting in Mom time.
254.65,257.91,Buffy,She's been drastic ever since
254.65,257.91,Buffy,I got back. And Giles is even worse.
257.98,259.45,Buffy,I'm supervised 247.
259.52,263.04,Buffy,It's like being in
259.52,263.04,Buffy,the Real World house. Only real.
263.12,267.02,Willow,Hmm. Ooh. Candy bars...
263.12,267.02,Willow,lots of'em!
267.09,268.58,Xander,Principal Snyder. Thank you!
268.66,270.15,Xander,You weren't visited
270.23,273.16,Xander,by the ghost of Christmas past.
270.23,273.16,Xander,by any chance?
273.23,274.7,Snyder,It's band candy.
274.77,277.79,Buffy,Let's hear it for the band. Huh?
274.77,277.79,Buffy,Very generous.
277.87,280.46,Snyder,You will sell it to raise money
277.87,280.46,Snyder,for the marching band.
280.54,281.97,Snyder,They need new uniforms.
282.04,284.23,Xander,Yeah. Those tall. Fuzzy hats
282.04,284.23,Xander,ain't cheap. Huh?
284.31,285.8,Oz,But they go with everything.
285.88,288.17,Buffy,I'm sure we love the idea
285.88,288.17,Buffy,of going all Willy Loman...
288.25,290.08,Joyce,but we're not in the band.
290.15,293.74,Joyce,And if I'd handed you a trombone.
290.15,293.74,Joyce,that would've been a problem. Summers.
293.82,295.44,Joyce,It's candy.
295.52,297.42,Joyce,Sell it.
297.49,299.89,Joyce,Joyce:
297.49,299.89,Joyce,But you're not in the band.
299.96,301.72,Buffy,And yet.
301.79,304.59,Joyce,Buffy. What would I do
301.79,304.59,Joyce,with 40 chocolate bars?
304.66,307.03,Buffy,You could hand them out
304.66,307.03,Buffy,at the gallery.
307.1,309.46,Buffy,Buy something preColumbian.
307.1,309.46,Buffy,get a free cavity."
312.27,313.76,Buffy,You're a good mom.
313.84,315.36,Joyce,I'm the best.
315.44,319.4,Buffy,No. I'm pretty sure the best moms
315.44,319.4,Buffy,let their daughters drive.
319.48,320.47,Joyce,And yet.
320.54,322.14,Buffy,Oh. Come on!
322.21,327.02,Joyce,Look. Let's not have
322.21,327.02,Joyce,this conversation.
325.08,327.24,Buffy,But I took the class.
327.32,329.95,Buffy,I watched the filmstrips with the blood
327.32,329.95,Buffy,and the death and the corpses.
330.02,330.99,Buffy,I'm prepped.
331.06,333.11,Joyce,Honey.
331.06,333.11,Joyce,you failed the written test.
333.19,335.89,Joyce,They wouldn't even let you
333.19,335.89,Joyce,take the road test.
335.96,338.86,Buffy,That was a year ago.
335.96,338.86,Buffy,and I don't test well...
338.93,341.56,Buffy,she said. Two days
338.93,341.56,Buffy,before the S.A.T.s.
341.63,343.93,Joyce,I spend enough time
341.63,343.93,Joyce,not knowing where you are.
346.02,346.3,Joyce,I don't want to add to that
346.02,346.3,Joyce,the possibility
346.37,348.63,Joyce,that you're on
346.37,348.63,Joyce,the highway to Chicago.
348.71,350.04,Joyce,I can't believe you.
350.11,351.8,Joyce,I'm not taking off again.
351.88,353.57,Joyce,Besides. If I wanted to...
353.64,355.81,Joyce,I could just get on a bus.
355.88,358.21,Joyce,Stop. Don't.
359.38,361.94,Joyce,I just don't want you driving. OK?
362.02,363.35,Joyce,I want you here.
363.42,366.08,Joyce,I'm here. Hmm? See me here.
366.16,368.15,Joyce,Mmhmm?
368.23,369.99,Joyce,Mmm... I got to go.
370.06,371.76,Joyce,What. You're going out?
371.83,374.8,Buffy,Giles. Slaystudy double feature.
371.83,374.8,Buffy,Could be late.
374.87,376.96,Joyce,Again? Honey.
374.87,376.96,Joyce,don't you think Mr. Giles
377.03,379.13,Joyce,is monopolizing
377.03,379.13,Joyce,an awful lot of your time?
379.2,381.6,Buffy,And does he ever say he's sorry?
381.73,382.99,Buffy,Ow!
383.07,384.47,Giles,Sorry.
384.54,387.5,Buffy,Why do I put up with this?
387.57,389.54,Giles,Because it is your destiny...
389.61,392.74,Giles,and because I just bought
389.61,392.74,Giles,cocorific" candy bars.
394.21,397.61,Buffy,OK. You're just doing this
394.21,397.61,Buffy,to take funny pictures of me.
397.68,400.98,Giles,I'm doing it to test your awareness
397.68,400.98,Giles,of an opponent's location
401.05,403.18,Giles,during a fight in total darkness.
403.25,404.65,Giles,Now. Wait 5 seconds
404.72,406.99,Giles,and then throw the ball at me.
407.06,410.76,Buffy,You ran out of new training ideas
407.06,410.76,Buffy,about a week ago. Huh?
410.83,414.59,Buffy,OK. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1.
419.1,421.09,Giles,It's not that simple. Is it...
421.17,424.51,Giles,Ow. Ahem.
421.17,424.51,Giles,Yes. Well. Very good.
424.58,426.51,Buffy,Thanks.
427.61,429.67,Giles,Where are you going?
427.61,429.67,Giles,We have to patrol.
429.75,431.41,Buffy,I can't.
429.75,431.41,Buffy,Mom's in hyperdrive.
431.48,433.18,Buffy,She wants me home tonight.
431.48,433.18,Buffy,I told you.
433.25,434.88,Giles,But... I...
434.95,438.39,Buffy,I know. I know. She's out of control.
434.95,438.39,Buffy,Enjoy the candy.
501.32,503.38,Angel,Buffy.
506.32,508.76,Buffy,I didn't know you could do that.
511.03,513.79,Angel,I... I'm feeling better.
513.86,515.42,Buffy,Angel!
520.34,522.36,Buffy,Let's... get you inside.
530.35,532.78,Angel,It's late.
530.35,532.78,Angel,How'd you get away?
532.85,536.98,Buffy,Aw. It was easy. Started a fire
532.85,536.98,Buffy,in the prison laundry room.
537.05,538.99,Buffy,Rode out in the garbage truck.
539.06,539.99,Angel,Oh.
541.29,544.23,Buffy,I'm joking. No garbage.
544.3,545.73,Buffy,Smell me.
560.88,564.25,Angel,How is... Scott?
564.32,566.72,Angel,Scott?
566.78,569.69,Buffy,Oh. Um... boyfried Scott.
569.75,573.16,Buffy,Uh... actually. He's not...
574.39,576.02,Buffy,He's fine.
577.06,579.15,Buffy,Uh. That's for you.
579.23,582.32,Buffy,Uh... it's fresh from the butcher.
582.4,583.96,Angel,Thanks.
584.03,585.5,Angel,
592.91,597.02,Angel,You're being careful. Right?
595.08,596.91,Buffy,With Scott?
596.98,598.21,Angel,The slaying.
598.28,601.65,Buffy,Oh. Uh... yeah. Of course.
601.72,603.71,Buffy,Full of carefulness.
603.79,606.45,Buffy,I worry about you.
608.73,610.28,Buffy,I worry about you:
611.73,613.53,Angel,I'm getting stronger.
613.6,616.29,Buffy,Pretty soon.
613.6,616.29,Buffy,you won't even need me.
616.37,618.43,Angel,That'll be better.
621.64,622.83,Buffy,Yeah.
636.75,639.59,Buffy,Hey. Uh. Sorry I'm late.
639.66,642.59,Buffy,You know Giles...
639.66,642.59,Buffy,all slay. All the time.
644.46,646.19,Giles,Hello. Buffy.
648.1,650.36,Buffy,Do you guys want to watch
648.1,650.36,Buffy,some television?
650.43,652.7,Buffy,I hear there's
650.43,652.7,Buffy,a very insightful Nightlie on.
652.77,654.17,Joyce,Joyce:
652.77,654.17,Joyce,Buffy. You lied to us...
654.24,656.33,Joyce,and you made us into your alibis.
656.41,657.75,Giles,That's playing us against each other.
657.75,658.47,Joyce,and that's not fair.
658.54,660.03,Giles,I called Willow.
660.11,663.77,Giles,You also lied to her about your
660.11,663.77,Giles,whereabouts. We were all concerned.
665.78,667.65,Giles,Oh. Thank you.
667.72,670.38,Buffy,Look. I'm sorry. But I had to...
670.45,672.18,Joyce,Were you at The Bronze?
672.26,674.95,Joyce,What was happening there
672.26,674.95,Joyce,that was so important?
675.03,678.26,Buffy,Bronze things.
675.03,678.26,Buffy,Things of bronze.
678.33,680.06,Joyce,You're acting really
678.33,680.06,Joyce,immature. Buffy.
680.13,682.62,Giles,I know I'm not your parent.
680.13,682.62,Giles,but I am responsible for you.
682.7,684.17,Giles,I think your mum's right.
684.24,686.1,Buffy,OK. Fine.
684.24,686.1,Buffy,I'm acting like a child.
686.17,687.97,Buffy,Maybe that's because you're both
686.17,687.97,Buffy,treating me like a child.
688.04,689.13,Joyce,Buffy.
689.21,691.4,Buffy,You're both scheduling me
689.21,691.4,Buffy,hours a day.
691.48,693.07,Buffy,Between the two of you.
693.07,694.17,Joyce,that's 48 hours.
694.25,695.8,Buffy,I just want to be able to make
695.8,697.15,Joyce,a few decisions on my own.
697.21,699.34,Joyce,The last time you made a decision
697.21,699.34,Joyce,on your own. You split.
699.42,701.58,Buffy,Yeah. And I took care of myself:
701.65,703.78,Buffy,I don't need this much
701.65,703.78,Buffy,active parenting.
703.85,707.72,Joyce,You can't be trying to use this summer
703.85,707.72,Joyce,as a reason you should be trusted.
707.79,709.32,Buffy,You can't babysit me
707.79,709.32,Buffy,all the time.
709.39,710.99,Buffy,I need you to back off a little.
711.06,712.48,Giles,All right. Come on.
712.48,714.19,Buffy,Let's not... freak out.
714.27,715.63,Buffy,Freak out"?
715.7,718.63,Giles,What? Uh. I think
715.7,718.63,Giles,you should go to bed.
718.7,720.07,Giles,We're all tired.
728.28,731.77,Joyce,Oh. She just drives me crazy.
735.79,738.22,Joyce,I just want to protect her.
738.29,740.22,Giles,Don't all parents want that?
740.29,743.56,Joyce,Yeah. But at least
740.29,743.56,Joyce,most parents have some idea
743.63,745.86,Joyce,what to protect
743.63,745.86,Joyce,their children from.
745.93,749.92,Giles,Yeah. And I think we should
745.93,749.92,Giles,both be especially careful.
752.02,751.47,Joyce,Mmm.
754.04,755.44,Joyce,
759.81,761.28,Ethan,Trust me.
764.21,766.61,Ethan,You don't want to eat that.
775.43,777.36,Boy,Dude. Think fast.
782.97,784.76,Cordelia,I heard that there was
782.97,784.76,Cordelia,this secret rule
784.84,788.6,Cordelia,that if a teacher's more than
784.84,788.6,Cordelia,minutes late. We can all leave.
788.67,791.61,Buffy,It's Giles' turn to watch
788.67,791.61,Buffy,study hall. He'll be here.
791.68,793.23,Buffy,He's allergic to late.
793.31,795.24,Cordelia,He is wound a little tight.
795.31,798.71,Cordelia,I had this philosophy book checked out
795.31,798.71,Cordelia,from the library for. Like. A year...
798.78,801.91,Cordelia,and he made me pay the fine.
798.78,801.91,Cordelia,even though it was huge.
801.99,803.56,Cordelia,I was sad to return it.
803.69,807.13,Cordelia,It was perfect for starting
803.69,807.13,Cordelia,conversations with college boys.
807.2,809.49,Cordelia,Of course. That was B.X.
807.2,809.49,Cordelia,B.X.?
810.9,813.09,Buffy,Before Xander. Clever.
813.17,816.07,Xander,I like chocolate.
813.17,816.07,Xander,There is no bad here.
816.14,820.44,Willow,You still have some left? I went to.
816.14,820.44,Willow,like. 4 houses. And they were gone.
820.51,823.14,Willow,It's like trickortreating
820.51,823.14,Willow,in reverse.
823.21,825.74,Xander,I know. These things
823.21,825.74,Xander,are selling like hotcakes...
825.81,828.54,Xander,which is ironic. 'cause
825.81,828.54,Xander,the hotcakes really aren't moving.
832.02,835.18,Xander,And it's. Uh. Fun
832.02,835.18,Xander,to sell chocolate.
839.33,842.73,Willow,And we're raising a lot
839.33,842.73,Willow,of money for the band.
844.87,846.36,Xander,The band. Yeah.
846.43,847.92,Xander,They're great.
850.02,849.49,Xander,They march.
849.57,851.84,Willow,Like an army.
854.68,858.81,Willow,Except with music
854.68,858.81,Willow,instead of bullets...
858.88,861.82,Willow,and... usually no one dies.
865.99,867.45,Cordelia,I can't believe this.
867.52,868.75,Cordelia,
868.82,870.38,Cordelia,Cordelia:
868.82,870.38,Cordelia,Where is Giles already?
870.46,872.98,Cordelia,I'm bored. And he's not here
870.46,872.98,Cordelia,to give me credit for it.
875.53,877.69,Snyder,The big pinhead librarian
875.53,877.69,Snyder,didn't show up...
877.77,880.03,Snyder,and I don't want to do it.
880.1,881.5,Snyder,You do it.
881.57,886.02,Ms. Barton,All right. Fine. I'll do it.
885.84,888.78,Snyder,Everybody expects me
885.84,888.78,Snyder,to do everything around here
888.84,890.78,Snyder,because I'm the principal.
890.85,893.51,Snyder,It's not fair.
894.75,895.31,Ms. Barton,
895.38,897.21,Ms. Barton,Teacher: Hey!
897.29,898.98,Ms. Barton,We're all stuck here. OK?
899.05,901.92,Ms. Barton,So now let's just
899.05,901.92,Ms. Barton,sit quietly and...
901.99,903.89,Ms. Barton,pretend we're reading something
903.96,907.09,Ms. Barton,until we're really sure that
903.96,907.09,Ms. Barton,old Commandant Snyder's gone.
907.16,909.6,Xander,Then we're all out of here.
909.66,912.13,Xander,Does anyone else want
909.66,912.13,Xander,to marry Ms. Barton?
912.2,913.03,Cordelia,Get in line.
913.1,915.54,Willow,I guess Giles isn't coming.
915.6,917.3,Buffy,I guess not.
934.82,936.55,Giles,Buffy.
936.62,938.11,Buffy,Uh... sorry.
938.19,939.66,Buffy,I was just worried.
939.73,941.85,Buffy,You were a big notthere
939.73,941.85,Buffy,in study hall...
941.93,944.12,Buffy,and after your lecture
941.93,944.12,Buffy,to me on not ducking out...
944.2,946.22,Buffy,And what is my mother
944.2,946.22,Buffy,doing here?
946.3,948.46,Giles,We had an opportunity
946.3,948.46,Giles,for a...
948.54,950.37,Giles,you might say... summit meeting.
950.44,952.67,Giles,It took priority over study hall.
952.74,956.02,Giles,I called in.
954.08,955.17,Buffy,Oh.
955.24,958.58,Joyce,We decided that you made
955.24,958.58,Joyce,a good point earlier.
958.65,959.94,Buffy,I did. Yeah.
961.02,962.74,Buffy,Which was...?
962.82,964.79,Joyce,About us overscheduling you.
964.85,967.32,Giles,Pulling you in two directions...
967.39,970.76,Giles,Your home life and your duties
967.39,970.76,Giles,as a slayer.
970.83,973.32,Buffy,Oh. That was a good point.
973.39,976.16,Joyce,We're working out
973.39,976.16,Joyce,a coordinated schedule for you.
976.23,979.43,Giles,It'll be tight.
976.23,979.43,Giles,but we think we can fit in
979.5,981.33,Giles,all your responsibilities.
981.4,983.34,Buffy,Sounds nice and structured.
983.4,986,Joyce,We've got more work
983.4,986,Joyce,to do here. Honey.
986.07,988.74,Joyce,Why don't you give us
986.07,988.74,Joyce,a little more time?
988.81,990.24,Joyce,Um...
990.31,993.77,Joyce,take the car. And Mr. Giles
990.31,993.77,Joyce,can drive me home.
993.85,995.94,Buffy,What?
996.02,998.11,Buffy,Excuse me. I meant what?!
998.19,999.81,Joyce,Keys. Take them.
999.89,1002.75,Buffy,You don't have to tell me twice.
1002.82,1004.29,Buffy,Actually. You did...
1004.36,1005.69,Buffy,but... bye!
1005.76,1007.16,Joyce,Bye. Honey. Drive careful.
1007.23,1008.7,Buffy,Uhhuh!
1011.27,1013.67,Joyce,Do you think she noticed anything?
1015.2,1016.86,Giles,No way.
1026.28,1028.21,Willow,Willow:
1026.28,1028.21,Willow,Tell me again how it happened.
1028.28,1031.45,Buffy,Told my mom I wanted to be treated
1028.28,1031.45,Buffy,more like a grownup...
1031.52,1032.99,Buffy,and voilà... driviness.
1039.69,1041.69,Buffy,Also. I think she
1039.69,1041.69,Buffy,wanted me otherwhere.
1041.76,1043.73,Buffy,Considering my mom and Giles
1041.76,1043.73,Buffy,are planning my future...
1043.8,1045.79,Buffy,I think it's easier
1043.8,1045.79,Buffy,for them to live my life
1045.87,1047.46,Willow,if I'm not actually there.
1047.54,1051.37,Willow,Do you know that you have
1047.54,1051.37,Willow,the parking brake on?
1051.44,1052.41,Buffy,Uhhuh.
1052.47,1053.91,Buffy,
1055.74,1058.21,Willow,Are... Are you sure
1055.74,1058.21,Willow,about The Bronze?
1058.28,1060.47,Willow,I mean. The S.A.T. s
1058.28,1060.47,Willow,are tomorrow.
1060.55,1062.74,Buffy,I can study at The Bronze.
1062.82,1065.29,Buffy,A little dancing.
1062.82,1065.29,Buffy,a little crossmultiplying.
1065.35,1067.08,Buffy,You know what we need?
1067.16,1068.62,Buffy,
1068.69,1071.59,Willow,Eyes on the road!
1068.69,1071.59,Willow,Eyes on the road!
1073.13,1074.56,Buffy,
1078.33,1079.89,Joyce,You got good albums.
1079.97,1081.76,Giles,Yeah. They're OK.
1081.84,1083.33,Lyrics,And the colors of the sea
1083.4,1086.1,Joyce,Do you like Seals and Croft?
1086.17,1089.34,Lyrics,And you touch
1086.17,1089.34,Lyrics,the distant beaches
1089.41,1091.4,Joyce,Yeah. Me. Neither.
1093.28,1094.58,Joyce,Thanks.
1096.42,1099.35,Joyce,So how come they call you Ripper?
1099.42,1101.35,Giles,Wouldn't you like to know.
1101.42,1104.76,Giles,Hmm. Wait a minute.
1101.42,1104.76,Giles,Listen to this bit.
1104.83,1107.76,Giles,
1107.83,1109.35,Giles,It rocks.
1109.43,1110.86,Joyce,It's good.
1110.93,1113.46,Giles,I got to get a band together.
1114.54,1116.97,Joyce,Hey. Ripper.
1114.54,1116.97,Joyce,you want to watch TV?
1117.04,1119.44,Joyce,I know how to order payperview.
1119.51,1123.24,Giles,No. Let's go out and have some fun...
1119.51,1123.24,Giles,tear things up a bit.
1123.31,1125.51,Joyce,OK. We could go to The Bronze.
1125.58,1127.64,Giles,Not bloody likely.
1125.58,1127.64,Giles,That place is dead.
1127.72,1129.27,Giles,
1151.64,1153.07,Devon,Hey. They're digging us. Man.
1155.14,1158.74,Lyrics,The strangest things
1155.14,1158.74,Lyrics,always know
1160.75,1165.36,Lyrics,Saves me every time
1167.59,1169.36,Lyrics,Darkened things
1170.66,1173.33,Lyrics,Have overgrown
1173.4,1175.83,Buffy,Let's do the time warp again.
1175.9,1178.3,Willow,Maybe there's a reunion in town
1178.37,1181.34,Willow,or a BillyJoel tour or something.
1181.41,1183.34,Buffy,Ms. Barton?
1183.41,1185.24,Ms. Barton,Buffy? Whoa!
1185.31,1187.28,Willow,Are you OK. Ms. Barton?
1187.35,1190.32,Ms. Barton,I'm cool. Willow.
1187.35,1190.32,Ms. Barton,Willow... that's a tree.
1190.38,1191.98,Ms. Barton,Huh. You're a tree.
1192.05,1193.04,Ms. Barton,Yeah. Uh...
1193.12,1196.61,Ms. Barton,are there any nachos
1193.12,1196.61,Ms. Barton,in here. Little tree?
1196.69,1199.32,Buffy,Are you sure you don't need
1196.69,1199.32,Buffy,some fresh air. Ms. Barton?
1199.39,1202.16,Willow,
1199.39,1202.16,Willow,OK.
1202.23,1204.16,Willow,OK. This is not normal.
1204.23,1206.66,Willow,But maybe that goes without saying.
1206.73,1208.26,Snyder,Hey. Gang!
1208.33,1210.8,Snyder,This place is fun city. Huh?
1210.87,1212.6,Buffy,Principal Snyder?
1212.67,1216.57,Snyder,Call me Snyder.
1212.67,1216.57,Snyder,Just a last name. Like... Barbarino.
1216.64,1219.2,Snyder,Ooh! I am so stoked!
1219.28,1221.34,Snyder,Ohh.
1221.41,1224.85,Snyder,Hey. Did you see Ms. Barton?
1221.41,1224.85,Snyder,I think she's wasted.
1224.92,1228.32,Snyder,I'm gonna have to put that
1224.92,1228.32,Snyder,in her next performance review
1228.39,1230.25,Snyder,cause... I'm the principal!
1230.32,1233.45,Willow,I don't like this.
1230.32,1233.45,Willow,They could have heart attacks.
1233.53,1235.86,Buffy,Well... maybe there's a doctor here.
1235.93,1238.59,Buffy,Whoo! Yeah!
1238.66,1242.19,Willow,I think that is my doctor.
1242.27,1245.36,Willow,He... He's usually less... topless.
1245.44,1248.74,Snyder,I got a commendation for being
1245.44,1248.74,Snyder,principal... from the mayor.
1248.81,1250.67,Snyder,Shook my hand twice.
1250.74,1252.23,Buffy,That's nice.
1252.31,1254.64,Buffy,
1254.71,1258.28,Snyder,Whoa! There are some
1254.71,1258.28,Snyder,foxy ladies here tonight!
1259.72,1260.98,Willow,What's happening?
1261.05,1262.49,Buffy,I don't know...
1262.56,1265.22,Buffy,but it's happening to
1262.56,1265.22,Buffy,a whole lot of grownups.
1265.29,1267.05,Willow,They're acting like a bunch...
1267.13,1269.72,Buffy,They're acting like a bunch of us:
1269.8,1271.59,Willow,I don't act like this.
1272.67,1274.13,Trick,Mr. Trick:
1272.67,1274.13,Trick,Demand's high.
1274.2,1275.83,Ethan,I thought it might be.
1275.9,1277.46,Trick,That's the reason
1275.9,1277.46,Trick,I love this country.
1277.54,1279.3,Trick,You make a good product...
1279.37,1281.17,Trick,and the people will come to you.
1281.24,1283.37,Trick,Of course. A lot of them
1281.24,1283.37,Trick,are gonna die...
1283.44,1285.6,Trick,but that's the other reason
1283.44,1285.6,Trick,I love this country.
1285.68,1286.74,Trick,Hey!
1286.81,1288.37,Trick,Don't sample the product.
1288.45,1289.88,Man,But I didn't.
1289.95,1290.94,Man,Unh!
1294.32,1297.26,Ethan,OK. Uh. How did you know he was...
1297.32,1299.5,Ethan,I don't. But now I know
1299.5,1301.12,Trick,no one else will.
1301.19,1303.66,Trick,We're getting close.
1301.19,1303.66,Trick,Keep it flowing.
1303.73,1305.56,Trick,It's almost feeding time.
1312.14,1314.4,Buffy,Something's definitely
1312.14,1314.4,Buffy,changing them.
1314.47,1315.87,Willow,A spell?
1315.94,1317.38,Oz,They're teenagers.
1317.44,1320.34,Oz,It's a sobering mirror
1317.44,1320.34,Oz,to look into. Huh?
1322.78,1325.05,Snyder,You've got great hair.
1326.35,1328.79,Snyder,
1331.09,1333.06,Old men,Louie Louie
1333.13,1334.92,Old men,Oh. Baby
1334.99,1336.86,Old men,We gotta go
1336.93,1338.83,Old men,Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
1338.9,1340.83,Old men,Louie Louie
1340.9,1342.66,Old men,Oh. Baby
1342.74,1344.67,Old men,We gotta go
1344.74,1346.8,Willow,It just gets more upsetting.
1346.87,1348.57,Old men,Louie Louie
1348.64,1350.34,Old men,Oh. Baby
1350.41,1352.04,Old men,We gotta go
1352.11,1355.17,Buffy,No vampire
1352.11,1355.17,Buffy,has ever been that scary.
1355.25,1356.61,Old men,Louie Louie
1356.68,1357.81,Old men,Oh. Baby
1357.88,1358.94,Patron,Fight!
1359.02,1360.58,Patron,Fight!
1360.65,1361.95,Buffy,Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
1362.02,1363.92,Buffy,We've got to figure out
1362.02,1363.92,Buffy,what's going on.
1363.99,1366.62,Buffy,This has hellmouth
1363.99,1366.62,Buffy,fingerprints all over it.
1368.96,1370.59,Snyder,Hey. Where are we going?
1371.86,1374.09,Snyder,Wait up. You guys!
1374.17,1377.6,Snyder,Hey! You guys aren't
1374.17,1377.6,Snyder,trying to ditch me. Are you?
1377.67,1380.61,Oz,Oz: We should find Giles.
1377.67,1380.61,Oz,He'll know what's going on. Right?
1380.67,1383.67,Buffy,Sure. Except for all we know.
1380.67,1383.67,Buffy,he's sweet 16 again.
1383.74,1386.58,Willow,He's with your mom at his place.
1386.65,1388.11,Snyder,I said wait up!
1388.18,1389.44,Oz,Oz: Snyder...
1389.52,1391.98,Buffy,No time. He's coming with us.
1392.05,1393.68,Buffy,
1393.75,1397.52,Snyder,Snyder: Whoa. Summers!
1393.75,1397.52,Snyder,You drive like a spaz.
1397.59,1399.08,Snyder,
1414.77,1416.8,Snyder,
1434.06,1436.22,Willow,It'll be OK
1434.06,1436.22,Willow,when we get to Giles'.
1436.3,1438.66,Oz,I mean. Even if he's 16.
1436.3,1438.66,Oz,he's still Giles. Right?
1438.73,1440.56,Oz,He's probably
1438.73,1440.56,Oz,a pretty together guy.
1440.63,1442.36,Willow,Yeah. WWell...
1443.8,1444.74,Oz,What?
1444.8,1447.24,Buffy,Giles at 16?
1444.8,1447.24,Buffy,Less "together guy"...
1447.31,1451.71,Buffy,more "bad magic. Hates the world.
1447.31,1451.71,Buffy,ticking time bomb guy."
1451.78,1455.27,Oz,Then I guess your mom's
1451.78,1455.27,Oz,in a lot of trouble.
1456.48,1458.64,Joyce,Must be exciting
1456.48,1458.64,Joyce,being from England.
1458.72,1459.91,Giles,Not particularly.
1459.99,1461.11,Joyce,
1461.19,1462.45,Giles,You cold?
1462.52,1464.65,Joyce,Nahuh.
1462.52,1464.65,Joyce,I feel... special...
1464.72,1467.09,Joyce,like I'm just waking up. Kinda.
1467.16,1468.49,Giles,Oh. Yeah?
1468.56,1471.16,Joyce,Yeah. Like getting married
1468.56,1471.16,Joyce,and having a kid and everything
1471.23,1472.66,Joyce,was just a dream...
1472.73,1475.03,Joyce,and now things are back
1472.73,1475.03,Joyce,like they're supposed to be.
1475.1,1476.03,Giles,Yeah?

2520.08,2522.92,Snyder,Snyder: You look like 4 young people
2520.08,2522.92,Snyder,with too much time on your hands.

2524.42,2526.62,Cordelia,Busy like a bee. Actually.

2528.19,2532.06,Snyder,Good. It seems we had
2528.19,2532.06,Snyder,some vandalism Friday

2553.68,2554.98,Snyder,Buffy: It was just
2554.98,2556.58,Buffy,too much to deal with.
2556.65,2559.49,Buffy,It was like nothing
2556.65,2559.49,Buffy,made sense anymore.
2559.56,2562.99,Buffy,The things that I thought
2559.56,2562.99,Buffy,I understood were gone.
2563.06,2565.39,Buffy,I just felt... so alone.
2565.46,2568.4,Giles,Was that the math or the verbal?
2568.46,2570.33,Buffy,Mostly the math.
2570.4,2574.73,Giles,Well. If you scored low.
2570.4,2574.73,Giles,then you can always take them again.
2574.8,2575.83,Buffy,More S.A.T. s?
2575.91,2577.84,Buffy,Is there really a point?
2577.91,2581.14,Buffy,I could die before
2577.91,2581.14,Buffy,I even apply to college.
2581.21,2584.27,Giles,Then you very possibly might not.
2584.35,2586.91,Buffy,Well. Let's just keep hope alive.
