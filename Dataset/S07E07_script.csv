990.44,992.88,ANDREW,how hard it is to act this cool?
992.92,997.36,WARREN,"Calm down, you're doing great."
992.92,997.36,WARREN,All specs are within parameters.
997.4,1000.56,ANDREW,You keep leaving me.
997.4,1000.56,ANDREW,I hate it when you leave me.
1000.6,1003.04,ANDREW,One time you died and I ended up a Mexican.
1003.08,1007.52,WARREN,"We've been over this. Now, that death thing"
1003.08,1007.52,WARREN,was all part of the master plan.
1007.56,1009.68,WARREN,Come on.
1009.72,1012.48,WARREN,If you strike me down..."
1012.52,1017.48,ANDREW,I shall become more powerful than
1012.52,1017.48,ANDREW,you could possibly imagine." Of course.
1017.52,1020.08,ANDREW,"You think maybe Willow could kill me, too?"
1020.08,1021.12,WARREN,"Hey, don't worry."
1021.16,1027.4,WARREN,If Short Round pulls off his end
1021.16,1027.4,WARREN,"of the bargain, we'll both become gods."
1027.44,1030.56,ANDREW,That boy is our last hope."
1030.6,1034.12,WARREN,No... there is another."
1034.16,1035.87,ANDREW,Really? Who's our last hope?
1035.87,1037.64,WARREN,"No, I was just going with it."
1037.68,1040.44,WARREN,"It was a thing. No, he's our last hope."
1040.48,1044.92,WILLOW,Tara? Is it you?
1044.96,1047.8,CASSIE,She's sorry she couldn't come herself.
1047.84,1051.88,WILLOW,Why didn't she? I don't understand.
1047.84,1051.88,WILLOW,"I mean, if you can manifest yourself..."
1051.92,1053.39,CASSIE,She just can't.
1053.39,1056.12,WILLOW,Why not? I don't understand.
1056.16,1058.88,CASSIE,Because of what you did.
1058.92,1059.62,WILLOW,What?
1059.62,1064.76,CASSIE,You killed people. You can't see her.
1064.8,1068.76,CASSIE,It's just how it is. I'm sorry.
1068.8,1071.96,WILLOW,But... but she's talking to you?
1074.02,1077.04,WILLOW,And... and she can hear me?
1077.08,1079.32,WILLOW,Tara?
1079.36,1082.72,WILLOW,"Tara, I miss you."
1082.76,1085.8,WILLOW,I miss you so much.
1085.84,1090.44,WILLOW,Can she hear me?
1090.48,1095.88,WILLOW,What's happening? Did she say anything?
1095.92,1099.56,WILLOW,What? Did she go away?
1099.6,1101.63,CASSIE,She's crying.
1101.63,1104.44,WILLOW,"No. No, don't cry."
1104.48,1109.02,WILLOW,"Don't cry, sweetie. Talk to me."
1107.04,1111.4,CASSIE,"She misses you, too."
1107.04,1111.4,CASSIE,She wishes she could touch you.
1111.44,1115.28,WILLOW,"Me too. Oh, me too."
1115.32,1120.44,WILLOW,"Oh, God, Tara. It hurts so much."
1120.48,1125.76,WILLOW,Every day it's like this giant hole.
1125.8,1128.28,WILLOW,And it's not getting better.
1128.32,1132.08,CASSIE,It will. It can.
1132.12,1134.68,WILLOW,How? You're gone.
1134.72,1136.92,CASSIE,But you're not.
1136.96,1142.16,CASSIE,"You're strong, like an Amazon, remember?"
1142.2,1151.16,WILLOW,I do. I remember.
1166.02,1168.32,HOLDEN,"i></i> So, you meet someone,"
1166.02,1168.32,HOLDEN,you form a bond...
1168.36,1170.4,BUFFY,But it never lasts.
1170.44,1173.68,HOLDEN,"Do you mean all relationships, or just yours?"
1173.72,1179.8,BUFFY,My parents weren't exactly the paragon of
1173.72,1179.8,BUFFY,staytogetheryness. Maybe that's part of it.
1179.84,1183.32,BUFFY,I think there are people out there
1179.84,1183.32,BUFFY,who'd make it. I just...
1183.36,1188.76,BUFFY,"target the impossible ones,"
1183.36,1188.76,BUFFY,with deadly accuracy.
1188.8,1191.6,HOLDEN,You think you do that on purpose?
1191.64,1194.16,HOLDEN,Maybe you're trying to protect yourself?
1194.2,1196.36,BUFFY,Protecting myself?
1196.4,1201.28,BUFFY,"From heartbreak, misery,"
1196.4,1201.28,BUFFY,sexual violence and possible death?
1201.32,1202.4,BUFFY,Not so much.
1202.4,1203.84,HOLDEN,From committing.
1203.88,1207.56,BUFFY,I commit! I'm committed. I'm a committee.
1207.6,1211.92,HOLDEN,"So it's them. You're reaching out,"
1207.6,1211.92,HOLDEN,they're just not coming through.
1211.96,1216.12,BUFFY,It's different. I think you're confusing me
1211.96,1216.12,BUFFY,because you're evil.
1216.16,1220.68,HOLDEN,I just think you're in some pain here.
1216.16,1220.68,HOLDEN,"Which I do kind of enjoy, cos I'm evil now."
1220.72,1222.76,HOLDEN,But you should ease up on yourself.
1222.8,1226.4,HOLDEN,It's not exactly like you have
1222.8,1226.4,HOLDEN,the patent on bad relationships.
1226.44,1228.64,BUFFY,Wouldn't it be cool if I did?
1228.68,1232.56,HOLDEN,"And what, are you supposed to be"
1228.68,1232.56,HOLDEN,settling down already? At 21?
1232.6,1235.44,HOLDEN,"You know, my girlfriend at college,"
1232.6,1235.44,HOLDEN,she's so sweet.
1235.48,1240.52,HOLDEN,But that doesn't mean I'm gonna go vampify
1235.48,1240.52,HOLDEN,her just so we can be together forever.
1240.56,1241.8,BUFFY,Sire."
1241.8,1242.84,HOLDEN,What?
1242.88,1247.6,BUFFY,The word. When you turn a human
1242.88,1247.6,BUFFY,"into a vampire, it's you ""sire"" them."
1247.64,1248.34,HOLDEN,Cool.
1248.34,1250.72,BUFFY,"It's a noun, too."
1250.76,1254.72,HOLDEN,"Oh, I have so much to learn."
1250.76,1254.72,HOLDEN,"Come on, isn't this insane?"
1254.76,1259.84,HOLDEN,"I mean, I was afraid to talk to you in high"
1254.76,1259.84,HOLDEN,"school. And now we're, like, mortal enemies."
1259.88,1262.2,HOLDEN,Wouldn't it be cool if we became nemeses?
1262.24,1265.08,BUFFY,Is that how you say the word?
1265.12,1267.92,HOLDEN,"We're gonna have to fight to the death,"
1265.12,1267.92,HOLDEN,aren't we?
1267.96,1271.02,BUFFY,It's the timehonoured custom.
1271.02,1271.44,HOLDEN,Wow.
1271.48,1274.12,HOLDEN,"Reality just shows up sometimes,"
1271.48,1274.12,HOLDEN,doesn't it?
1274.16,1277.76,HOLDEN,"But I've got the bloodlust pumping,"
1274.16,1277.76,HOLDEN,and I kinda get it.
1277.8,1280.2,HOLDEN,I'm looking for a fight.
1277.8,1280.2,HOLDEN,Nothing personal.
1280.24,1282.36,BUFFY,"Oh, no. I mean, you've been great."
1282.36,1283.6,HOLDEN,And fun catching up.
1283.64,1286.88,HOLDEN,I haven't kept in contact with
1283.64,1286.88,HOLDEN,many friends from high school.
1286.92,1290.16,HOLDEN,Guess I'll be looking them up pretty soon.
1290.2,1292.96,BUFFY,Yeah.
1295.02,1298.16,HOLDEN,"Hey, I don't mean to be Count Buttinsky here,"
1295.02,1298.16,HOLDEN,but you just don't seem as thrilled.
1298.2,1300.69,HOLDEN,Is it because we're gonna fight?
1300.69,1302.48,BUFFY,It's cos I'm gonna win.
1302.52,1304.48,BUFFY,i></i>
1304.52,1308.04,HOLDEN,Hello?! Two years of tae kwon do
1304.52,1308.04,HOLDEN,and vampire strength.
1308.08,1310.44,HOLDEN,Somebody's counting their chickens.
1310.48,1313.36,BUFFY,You're not leaving this graveyard.
1310.48,1313.36,BUFFY,Can't let ya.
1313.4,1315.84,HOLDEN,Do the words "superiority complex"
1313.4,1315.84,HOLDEN,mean anything?
1315.88,1317.96,BUFFY,You think I'm gonna let you kill people?
1320.02,1320.3,HOLDEN,I get the battle against evil.
1320.3,1320.48,BUFFY,It's not the issue.
1320.52,1322.69,BUFFY,There is no issue. Don't issue me!
1322.69,1323.96,HOLDEN,Just answer me this.
1326.02,1326.6,HOLDEN,Whose fault was your parents' divorce?
1326.64,1329.76,BUFFY,"OK, this is beyond evil."
1326.64,1329.76,BUFFY,This is insane troll logic.
1329.8,1332.51,BUFFY,What do my parents have to do with...?
1332.51,1334.72,HOLDEN,I'm just curious. Your opinion.
1334.76,1337.68,BUFFY,They both had a lot of...
1337.68,1340.6,HOLDEN,Off the top of your head.
1340.64,1342.97,BUFFY,My dad.
1342.97,1344.96,HOLDEN,Uhhuh?
1347.02,1346.8,BUFFY,He cheated.
1346.84,1352.02,BUFFY,I... I think he cheated.
1350.04,1354.48,HOLDEN,"So... of all of these relationships of yours,"
1354.52,1361.02,HOLDEN,that you knew subconsciously
1354.52,1361.02,HOLDEN,"were totally doomed,"
1359.04,1361.08,HOLDEN,whose fault is that?
1361.12,1363.64,BUFFY,It's incredibly different.
1363.68,1368.56,HOLDEN,I was just wondering.
1363.68,1368.56,HOLDEN,"Is it possible, even a little bit,"
1368.6,1371.76,HOLDEN,that the reason you have trouble
1368.6,1371.76,HOLDEN,connecting to guys
1371.8,1375.84,HOLDEN,is because you think
1371.8,1375.84,HOLDEN,maybe they're not worth it?
1375.88,1378.04,HOLDEN,Maybe you think you're better than them.
1378.08,1380.76,BUFFY,"Say, there's that bloodlust I was looking for."
1380.76,1381.64,HOLDEN,Struck a nerve.
1381.68,1386.2,BUFFY,"I'll strike a nerve cluster, you don't get off"
1381.68,1386.2,BUFFY,this! I don't remember you being so annoying.
1386.24,1387.64,HOLDEN,You don't remember me!
1387.64,1387.96,BUFFY,I do.
1390.02,1390.48,HOLDEN,"Yeah, like, after 30 minutes of reminding."
1390.52,1394.52,HOLDEN,I don't take it personally  you were
1390.52,1394.52,HOLDEN,in your own little world in school.
1394.56,1399.02,HOLDEN,All "chosen". All "destiny".
1397.04,1400.96,HOLDEN,Who could live with that for seven years
1397.04,1400.96,HOLDEN,and not feel superior?
1403.02,1406.28,BUFFY,"I'm not. My God, if anything..."
1406.32,1408.32,HOLDEN,What?
1408.32,1411.92,BUFFY,I just...
1411.96,1414.72,HOLDEN,"If you knew what I've done,"
1414.76,1418.48,HOLDEN,what I've let myself become.
1418.52,1422.6,BUFFY,My best friends don't even...
1422.64,1426.64,BUFFY,"You'd laugh, you heard"
1422.64,1426.64,BUFFY,some of the things I've done to them.
1426.68,1432.8,HOLDEN,"Buffy... I'm here to kill you, not to judge you."
1432.84,1437.92,BUFFY,"The last guy I was with, it got really..."
1437.96,1440.88,BUFFY,I behaved like a monster.
1440.92,1445.12,BUFFY,Treated him like...
1445.16,1448.4,BUFFY,"And at the same time, I..."
1448.44,1452.04,BUFFY,I let him completely take me over.
1452.08,1457.72,BUFFY,Do things to me that...
1457.76,1460.12,BUFFY,i></i> I'm sorry.
1460.16,1461.38,BUFFY,I didn't mean to get
1461.38,1463.4,HOLDEN,all trueconfessions on you there.
1463.44,1467.88,HOLDEN,I don't know what's wrong with me.
1467.92,1474.8,HOLDEN,There's nothing wrong with you.
1474.84,1483.8,HOLDEN,Everyone's got issues.
1488.72,1490.6,BUFFY,You son of a bitch.
1490.6,1491.2,HOLDEN,What?!
1491.24,1496.52,BUFFY,I'm gonna kill you
1491.24,1496.52,BUFFY,just a little bit more than usual.
1496.56,1498.12,HOLDEN,"Aw, come on!"
1498.16,1500.48,HOLDEN,"I mean, we had a moment."
1498.16,1500.48,HOLDEN,You opened up.
1500.52,1503.08,HOLDEN,It was really sweet.
1500.52,1503.08,HOLDEN,It made me want to bite you.
1503.12,1509.44,HOLDEN,I'm sorry if I overstepped my bounds.
1503.12,1509.44,HOLDEN,I'm new to this mortalenemy stuff.
1509.48,1518.44,HOLDEN,"Pretty fast learner, though, right?"

1542.2,1545.52,DAWN,I... I see you.
1545.56,1550.08,DAWN,"I'm coming towards you, OK?"
1550.12,1553.72,DAWN,She's trying to talk to me.
1553.76,1560.08,DAWN,Get off her and let her talk to me!
1560.12,1566.44,DAWN,The axe!

1579.4,1584.04,DAWN,She's my mother. I'm staying.
1584.08,1588.6,JONATHAN,Seeing the high school again...
1584.08,1588.6,JONATHAN,part of me wishes I could go back.
1588.64,1592.04,ANDREW,Everything's shifting around.
1588.64,1592.04,ANDREW,I feel like we're in <i>Hellraiser.</i>
1592.08,1594.31,ANDREW,I hate Pinhead.
1594.31,1596.68,JONATHAN,Let me see that.
1596.72,1599.52,JONATHAN,Did we circle all the way around?
1599.56,1600.86,JONATHAN,We should start over.
1600.86,1601.6,ANDREW,There it is.
1601.64,1604.04,ANDREW,What?
1604.08,1607.72,JONATHAN,Are you sure?
1607.76,1615.32,ANDREW,Yeah.
1615.36,1620.24,JONATHAN,"You know, I think you may be right."
1620.28,1629.24,JONATHAN,"If this lines up, what we're looking for"
1620.28,1629.24,JONATHAN,should be right under there.
1633.48,1635.64,BUFFY,See? You're dead.
1635.68,1639.44,BUFFY,That enough of a moment for ya?
1639.48,1643.92,HOLDEN,OK. But are you killing me cos I'm evil
1639.48,1643.92,HOLDEN,or because you opened up?
1643.96,1652.92,BUFFY,Agh!
1655.08,1657.68,BUFFY,What is wrong with you?
1657.72,1660.56,HOLDEN,"Nothing. I got no worries, I'm dead."
1660.6,1664.56,HOLDEN,The biggest thing on my mind is whether
1660.6,1664.56,HOLDEN,Tricia Waldman came to my funeral.
1664.6,1667.32,HOLDEN,Do you remember her? Ohh  biteable.
1667.36,1669.88,BUFFY,"See, this is what I hate about you vampires."
1669.92,1673.88,BUFFY,Sex and death and love and pain 
1669.92,1673.88,BUFFY,it's all the same damn thing to you.
1673.92,1678.24,HOLDEN,It's kind of a guy thing.
1673.92,1678.24,HOLDEN,"We talk about nailing a girl, there's all this..."
1678.28,1682.48,BUFFY,"No, it is not the same."
1678.28,1682.48,BUFFY,"With vampires, it is completely..."
1682.52,1684.64,BUFFY,"Believe me, I know."
1684.68,1686.84,HOLDEN,Oh my God!
1686.88,1688.96,BUFFY,"Oh your God, what?"
1691.02,1694.04,HOLDEN,"Well, not my God, because I defy him"
1691.02,1694.04,HOLDEN,and all of his works. Does he exist?
1694.08,1697.2,HOLDEN,"Is there word on that, by the way?"
1697.2,1698.48,BUFFY,Nothing solid.
1698.52,1701.36,HOLDEN,I keep getting off topic
1698.52,1701.36,HOLDEN,cos my mind is racing here.
1701.4,1704.36,HOLDEN,All right. I'll make a deal with you.
1704.4,1706.44,HOLDEN,"We fight, to the death  great."
1706.48,1708.52,HOLDEN,That last fight was exhilarating.
1708.56,1711.12,HOLDEN,I had a move coming up to block that stake.
1711.16,1713.44,HOLDEN,But you have to answer one question.
1713.48,1718.2,HOLDEN,"If I'm right, I get to ask anything "
1713.48,1718.2,HOLDEN,"no secrets, no defensiveness."
1718.24,1724.02,HOLDEN,Anything I wanna know.
1722.04,1723.96,BUFFY,What's your question?
1726.02,1732.96,HOLDEN,Your last relationship.
1726.02,1732.96,HOLDEN,Was it with a vampire?
1736.16,1738.88,WILLOW,I don't know where to start.
1738.92,1743.12,WILLOW,After Warren shot you...
1738.92,1743.12,WILLOW,"You know all about that, what happened?"
1743.16,1746.84,WILLOW,It was horrible. I was horrible.
1746.88,1749.96,WILLOW,"I lost myself, the regular me."
1752.02,1752.16,CASSIE,"Well, you were grieving."
1752.2,1755.72,WILLOW,A lot of people grieve.
1752.2,1755.72,WILLOW,They don't make with the flaying.
1755.76,1757.75,WILLOW,I hurt so many people.
1757.75,1759.28,CASSIE,It was the power.
1759.32,1762.44,WILLOW,But I <i>am</i> the power. It's in me.
1762.48,1765.16,WILLOW,Did I mention
1762.48,1765.16,WILLOW,the random destruction of property?
1765.2,1767.63,WILLOW,The Magic Box is not so much a box now.
1767.63,1769.68,CASSIE,The power is bigger than you are.
1769.72,1770.63,WILLOW,"I know, but..."
1770.63,1772.96,CASSIE,Things are more clear where Tara is.
1775.02,1775.28,CASSIE,Where we are.
1775.32,1781.02,CASSIE,"We can see your path, and you have to stop."
1779.04,1782.28,CASSIE,"You can't use magic again, not ever."
1782.32,1784.52,WILLOW,"Black magic, of course."
1784.56,1788.8,WILLOW,But Giles says it isn't as simple
1784.56,1788.8,WILLOW,"as quitting it all, cold turkey."
1788.84,1793.08,CASSIE,It's too dangerous. You can't
1788.84,1793.08,CASSIE,take the chance that you'll lose control.
1793.12,1798.02,WILLOW,I don't want to. I can't.
1796.04,1798.69,WILLOW,I never wanna cause that kind of pain.
1798.69,1800.08,CASSIE,Of course you don't.
1800.12,1802.68,WILLOW,"So, I won't."
1802.72,1806.04,WILLOW,I'm gonna be OK.
1806.08,1808.32,CASSIE,She says...
1808.36,1810.16,WILLOW,What?
1810.2,1819.16,CASSIE,You're not gonna be OK.
1810.2,1819.16,CASSIE,You're gonna kill everybody.
1829.04,1833.31,JONATHAN,We almost got this thing uncovered.
1833.31,1833.8,ANDREW,Yep.
1833.84,1838.84,JONATHAN,I hope Buffy'll know how to destroy it.
1833.84,1838.84,JONATHAN,That's it!
1838.88,1843.6,JONATHAN,That was my locker combination.
1838.88,1843.6,JONATHAN,It's been bugging me all night.
1843.64,1846.4,ANDREW,I spent years
1843.64,1846.4,ANDREW,trying to forget about high school.
1846.44,1849.21,ANDREW,Why are you trying so hard to remember it?
1849.21,1851.12,JONATHAN,I guess I miss it. Don't you?
1851.16,1854.44,ANDREW,"Yeah, I really miss it"
1851.16,1854.44,ANDREW,I'm serious. I really miss it.
1854.48,1857.88,JONATHAN,Time goes by and everything drops away.
1857.92,1861.96,JONATHAN,"All the cruelty, all the pain,"
1857.92,1861.96,JONATHAN,all the humiliation.
1864.02,1864.4,JONATHAN,It all washes away.
1864.44,1867.48,JONATHAN,I miss my friends. I miss my enemies.
1867.52,1872.16,JONATHAN,I miss the people I talked to every day.
1867.52,1872.16,JONATHAN,I miss the people who never knew I existed.
1872.2,1875.64,JONATHAN,I miss 'em all.
1875.68,1877.92,ANDREW,"I wanna talk to them, you know?"
1877.96,1883.28,JONATHAN,I wanna find out how they're doing.
1877.96,1883.28,JONATHAN,I wanna know what's going on in their lives.
1883.32,1889.04,ANDREW,You know what? They don't wanna talk to
1883.32,1889.04,ANDREW,you  all those people you just mentioned.
1889.08,1894.76,ANDREW,Not one of them is sitting around going
1889.08,1894.76,ANDREW,I wonder what Jonathan's up to right now."
1894.8,1898.92,ANDREW,Not one of them cares about you.
1898.96,1902.92,JONATHAN,"Well, I still care about them."
1902.96,1911.92,JONATHAN,That's why I'm here.
1911.96,1915.4,JONATHAN,i> </i>
1911.96,1915.4,JONATHAN,i></i> I know you're there.
1915.44,1917.48,DAWN,I will cast you out.
1917.52,1919.68,DAWN,My mother needs to talk to me.
1919.72,1926.76,DAWN,i></i>
1926.8,1932.32,DAWN,I cast you from this place.
1926.8,1932.32,DAWN,It is your poison and your bane.
1932.36,1934.36,DAWN,i></i>
1934.4,1940.09,DAWN,It is the skin that is cut from your flesh!
1940.09,1941.02,BUFFY,i> </i>
1939.04,1947.8,BUFFY,Aargh!
1947.84,1951.72,BUFFY,"And the joke is, he loved me."
1951.76,1958.28,BUFFY,"I mean, in his own sick, soulless way"
1951.76,1958.28,BUFFY,he really did care for me.
1958.32,1961.56,BUFFY,But I didn't wanna be loved.
1961.6,1966.02,HOLDEN,Didn't you?
1964.04,1967.2,BUFFY,I have all this power.
1967.24,1973.02,BUFFY,I didn't ask for it.
1967.24,1973.02,BUFFY,I don't deserve it.
1971.04,1976.52,BUFFY,It's like... I wanted to be punished.
1976.56,1982.88,BUFFY,I wanted to hurt like I thought I deserved.
1982.92,1985.32,BUFFY,I sorta think...
1985.36,1989.72,BUFFY,"You know, this is complicated."
1985.36,1989.72,BUFFY,If you'd rather just fight...
1989.76,1992.08,HOLDEN,Tell me.
1992.12,1995.96,BUFFY,I feel like I'm worse than anyone.
1998.02,1999.56,BUFFY,"Honestly, I'm beneath them."
1999.6,2001.8,BUFFY,"My friends, my boyfriends "
2001.84,2007.4,BUFFY,I... feel like I'm not worthy of their love.
2007.44,2009.52,HOLDEN,"Cos even though they love me,"
2009.56,2017.16,BUFFY,it doesn't mean anything
2009.56,2017.16,BUFFY,because their opinions don't matter.
2017.2,2019.44,BUFFY,They don't know.
2019.48,2023.04,BUFFY,They haven't been through
2019.48,2023.04,BUFFY,what I've been through.
2023.08,2025.44,BUFFY,They're not the Slayer.
2025.48,2028.96,BUFFY,I am.
2031.02,2032.56,BUFFY,Sometimes I feel...
2032.6,2037.88,BUFFY,This is awful.
2037.92,2042.6,BUFFY,I feel like I'm better than them.
2042.64,2046.6,BUFFY,Superior.
2046.64,2049.32,BUFFY,Until you can't win.
2049.36,2051.44,BUFFY,And I thought I was diabolical.
2051.48,2054.24,BUFFY,Or at least I plan to be.
2054.28,2059.8,BUFFY,You do have a superiority complex. And
2054.28,2059.8,BUFFY,you've got an inferiority complex about it.
2059.84,2064.02,BUFFY,Kudos.
2062.04,2064.08,BUFFY,It doesn't make any sense.
2064.12,2069.16,HOLDEN,Oh... it makes every kind of sense.
2069.2,2072.6,HOLDEN,And it all adds up to you feeling alone.
2072.64,2075.8,HOLDEN,"But, Buffy, everybody feels alone."
2075.84,2081.36,HOLDEN,Everybody is. Until you die.
2081.4,2083.72,HOLDEN,Speaking of...
2083.76,2087.6,HOLDEN,you ready for our little death match?
2087.64,2090.48,BUFFY,I suppose.
2090.52,2093.6,BUFFY,Uh... thanks for listening.
2093.64,2097.76,HOLDEN,"Oh, you know, there's some things"
2093.64,2097.76,HOLDEN,you can only tell a stranger.
2097.8,2101.4,BUFFY,You're not a stranger.
2101.44,2103.67,BUFFY,That stuff with Spike is pretty...
2103.67,2104.2,HOLDEN,Hold it.
2104.24,2106.19,BUFFY,What?
2106.19,2113.2,HOLDEN,Did you say Spike?
2121.52,2124.48,HOLDEN,I cast you out with every prayer
2124.52,2129.96,HOLDEN,from every god that walks the Earth
2124.52,2129.96,HOLDEN,or crawls beneath.
2132.02,2134.68,HOLDEN,I cast you out
2132.02,2134.68,HOLDEN,with the strength of those who love me.
2134.72,2139.08,HOLDEN,I cast you out
2134.72,2139.08,HOLDEN,with the strength I have inside me!
2139.12,2141.6,HOLDEN,I cast you out into the void!

2176.44,2178.52,DAWN,Mom?
2178.56,2179.56,WILLOW,I'm gonna what?
2179.56,2182.28,CASSIE,That's why I came. We needed to warn you.
2182.32,2184.48,WILLOW,You saw my path?
2184.52,2187.48,WILLOW,What do you know?
2184.52,2187.48,WILLOW,What did you see?
2187.52,2190,CASSIE,You don't wanna know what we saw.
2190,2190.6,WILLOW,"Oh, God!"
2190.64,2193.8,CASSIE,"But if you stop  completely, no more magic..."
2193.84,2196.32,WILLOW,"Right. Right, stop."
2196.36,2198.16,WILLOW,What about Giles?
2198.2,2203.04,WILLOW,He made it seem like it was just as dangerous
2198.2,2203.04,WILLOW,for me to quit completely.
2203.08,2206.36,CASSIE,You can't. If you do
2203.08,2206.36,CASSIE,so much as another spell...
2206.4,2209.24,WILLOW,I tried to stop. I tried.
2209.28,2210.69,WILLOW,What if I can't do this?
2210.69,2211.92,CASSIE,Don't think that way.
2211.96,2216.16,WILLOW,How can I not?! You're telling me
2211.96,2216.16,WILLOW,I'm gonna murder all my friends.
2216.2,2222.32,WILLOW,I'm not strong.
2216.2,2222.32,WILLOW,I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me.
2222.36,2225.24,CASSIE,There is one thing.
2225.28,2227.61,CASSIE,One thing you could do to stop it.
2227.61,2228.64,WILLOW,What? Anything.
2228.68,2233.2,CASSIE,Then you could see her.
2228.68,2233.2,CASSIE,You wouldn't have to talk through me.
2233.24,2233.55,WILLOW,Tara?
2233.55,2235.44,CASSIE,"That's what you want, isn't it?"
2235.48,2236.36,WILLOW,Of course.
2236.36,2238.04,CASSIE,So go. Be with her.
2238.08,2242.32,CASSIE,"Everybody will be safe,"
2238.08,2242.32,CASSIE,and you'll be together again.
2242.36,2244.76,CASSIE,It's not that bad.
2244.8,2247.16,CASSIE,Really.
2247.2,2256.16,CASSIE,It's just like going to sleep.
2256.68,2257.96,WILLOW,Who are you?
2260.02,2260.4,BUFFY,What do you mean?
2260.02,2260.4,BUFFY,How do you know Spike?
2260.44,2261.8,BUFFY,"What do you mean, how?"
2261.8,2263.16,HOLDEN,He was the guy that...
2263.2,2265.08,HOLDEN,"Oh, what's the word?"
2265.08,2265.64,BUFFY,Sired.
2265.68,2274.64,HOLDEN,"Yeah, he was the guy that sired me."
2276.36,2280.2,JOYCE,"Things are coming, Dawn."
2276.36,2280.2,JOYCE,"Listen, things are on their way."
2280.24,2283.12,JOYCE,I love you and I love Buffy.
2283.16,2288.02,JOYCE,But she won't be there for you.
2286.04,2288.08,DAWN,What?
2288.12,2289.35,DAWN,Why are you...
2289.35,2292.68,JOYCE,"When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you."
2292.72,2299.32,JOYCE,She'll be against you.
2299.36,2300.36,DAWN,No!
2300.4,2302.32,DAWN,"No, don't go!"
2302.36,2311.32,DAWN,"Please, don't go!"
2321.44,2324.36,CASSIE,"The suicide thing was too far, huh?"
2324.4,2326.84,CASSIE,Hm. You seemed so ripe.
2326.84,2328.96,WILLOW,Tell me who you are.
2331.02,2334.64,CASSIE,I stand by my opinion. The world'd be a better
2331.02,2334.64,CASSIE,place if you took a razor blade to your wrist.
2334.68,2336.28,WILLOW,Stop.
2336.32,2338.88,CASSIE,I can see it now.
2338.92,2345.36,CASSIE,"Candlelight, the Indigo Girls playing, picture"
2338.92,2345.36,CASSIE,of your dead girlfriend on your bloody lap.
