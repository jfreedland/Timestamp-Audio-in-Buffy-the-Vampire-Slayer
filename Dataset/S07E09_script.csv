11.13,13.69,ANDREW,Do you have any idea
11.13,13.69,ANDREW,how hard it's been to act this cool?
13.77,16.37,WARREN,That death thing was all part
13.77,16.37,WARREN,of the master plan.

37.09,37.77,DAWN,What?
37.85,41.81,WILLOW,"lt's the Big Bad, Dawn."
37.85,41.81,WILLOW,The one we knew was coming.
41.89,42.8,BUFFY,What the hell happened?
42.89,47.76,WILLOW,This big evil that's been promising to devour
42.89,47.76,WILLOW,"us  well, l think it's started chomping."
47.85,48.6,BUFFY,"Oh, God."
48.6,51.13,WILLOW,"Buffy, this thing knows us."
51.21,53.97,WILLOW,lt made us think
51.21,53.97,WILLOW,that we were talking to people we knew.
54.05,57.2,WILLOW,"l'm just a guy with his ear to the ground,"
54.05,57.2,WILLOW,but even l can feel it.

66.73,70.28,WILLOW,That's gotta do stuff.
70.37,74.45,BUFFY,"l think there was something there,"

86.05,91.73,SPIKE,l can feel every one of 'em.
93.37,96.37,BUFFY,There's something playing with us.
96.45,98.79,SPIKE,Why is it doing this to me?
98.79,99.92,BUFFY,l don't know.
100.33,100.93,SPIKE,Help me.
100.93,101.97,BUFFY,l'll help you.
102.05,104.36,BUFFY,This thing has been closer to Spike
102.05,104.36,BUFFY,than any of us.
104.45,106.78,WILLOW,And if you wanna understand it....
106.78,109.32,BUFFY,l'm gonna have to get close to Spike.
109.89,112.49,GILES,"Robson, are you here?"
113.89,115.12,GILES,Robson!

124.53,127.61,GILES,lt's all right. l understand. l'll take care...
129.13,132.25,DAWN,So the basement was filled with bodies?
132.25,133.13,WILLOW,Apparently.
134.69,139.61,DAWN,And Spike could've sired countless others
134.69,139.61,DAWN,and buried them around town.
140.41,143.96,DAWN,"And we're waiting for him to do what,"
140.41,143.96,DAWN,exactly? Do something crazy?
144.05,145.88,WILLOW,lt's not that simple.
145.97,150.97,ANYA,Shouldn't we stab him in the chest? lsn't that
145.97,150.97,ANYA,what we do when these things happen?
151.05,153.18,WILLOW,"Look, Buffy knows what she's doing."
153.18,155.73,ANYA,"Xander, you know what we're talking about."
155.81,158.45,ANYA,You've always been part

158.53,160.97,XANDER,l've got a house to put back together.
161.05,164.41,ANYA,Fine. You guys keep your heads
161.05,164.41,ANYA,"buried in the sand,"

181.61,181.98,ANDREW,Good.
181.98,184.37,WARREN,Excellent. We've got work to do.
184.45,188.33,ANDREW,Do l have to do work right now? Can't l
184.45,188.33,ANDREW,just walk around for a while in my coat?
188.41,193.73,WARREN,Don't go soft on me now. We're right in
188.41,193.73,WARREN,"the trench, and the exhaust port's in sight."
193.81,198.41,ANDREW,l thought that was it. l did what you told me.
193.81,198.41,ANDREW,lt's not my fault it didn't work.
198.49,201.09,ANDREW,Why do l have to do all the wet work?
201.09,201.37,WARREN,Hey!
201.45,205.97,WARREN,You know the rules.
201.45,205.97,WARREN,l can't take corporeal form. Here. Feel.
210.17,210.66,ANDREW,Cool.
210.66,212.93,WARREN,"Pretty bitchin', right?"
213.25,214.57,WARREN,l'm like ObiWan.
214.57,216.05,ANDREW,Or Patrick Swayze.
217.49,220.17,WARREN,"Believe me,"
217.49,220.17,WARREN,l would do this stuff if l could.
220.25,224.02,WARREN,l can't.
222.09,227.02,WARREN,l need you. You're my iron fist.
225.57,228.29,ANDREW,l just don't think l can kill anybody else.
228.37,230.14,JONATHAN,Will you stop worrying about that?
230.14,232.33,ANDREW,l didn't want to kill you. Warren made me.
232.41,236.65,JONATHAN,"Hey, l'm glad he did. This is the best thing"
232.41,236.65,JONATHAN,that's ever happened to me.
236.73,239.85,ANDREW,lt didn't hurt too much?
236.73,239.85,ANDREW,l'm not very good at stabbing.
239.93,241.69,JONATHAN,"You know, it wasn't that bad."
241.77,246.45,JONATHAN,"lt was like a sharp pain, then a burning,"
241.77,246.45,JONATHAN,then a general queasiness.
246.53,251.05,JONATHAN,"lt was like getting ulcers in high school, only"
246.53,251.05,JONATHAN,at the end l became one with light and hope.
251.13,253.17,ANDREW,l can't do it. l can't do it any more.
253.25,256.45,JONATHAN,"Hey, this isn't your fault, OK?"
256.53,259.25,JONATHAN,lt's my fault the ritual didn't work.
256.53,259.25,JONATHAN,l screwed up.
259.33,262.69,JONATHAN,l'm little. l don't have
259.33,262.69,JONATHAN,as much blood as other people.
262.77,266.13,JONATHAN,And l probably should've
262.77,266.13,JONATHAN,told someone l was anaemic.
266.21,271.02,JONATHAN,Don't worry. We're gonna fix it.
269.09,271.69,JONATHAN,You gotta trust us.
269.09,271.69,JONATHAN,We know what we're doing.
271.77,274.12,ANDREW,l can't kill anybody else.
274.12,277.64,JONATHAN,"OK, calm down. We can work around that."
283.89,289.21,BUFFY,We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
283.89,289.21,BUFFY,We just can't take any chances.
289.29,291.12,SPIKE,Don't.
292.01,297.02,SPIKE,Make it tighter. The knots will give.
295.89,298.69,SPIKE,"lf l get free, someone's gonna die."
355.13,358.36,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"Now, guys, look,"
355.13,358.36,PRINCIPAL WOOD,we can settle this one of two ways.
358.45,361.25,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"You can repaint the walls, or..."
361.33,366.41,PRINCIPAL WOOD,l can suspend you and report this
361.33,366.41,PRINCIPAL WOOD,little incident on your permanent record.
366.49,368.93,PUNK #1,Fine. Do that.
369.81,373.36,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"OK, l was bluffing."
369.81,373.36,PRINCIPAL WOOD,l hadn't really thought that one through.
373.45,377.37,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"Listen, this whole"
373.45,377.37,PRINCIPAL WOOD,permanentrecord thing is a myth.
377.45,379.92,PRINCIPAL WOOD,Colleges never ask for
377.45,379.92,PRINCIPAL WOOD,anything past SAT scores.
380.01,385.37,PRINCIPAL WOOD,lt's not like employers are gonna call to check
380.01,385.37,PRINCIPAL WOOD,how many days you missed in high school.
385.45,388.84,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"So, listen, l could suspend you,"
388.93,392.53,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"but that would mean calling your parents,"
388.93,392.53,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"alerting your teachers,"
392.61,396.57,PRINCIPAL WOOD,filling out paperwork and quite possibly
392.61,396.57,PRINCIPAL WOOD,having to talk to the school board.
396.65,400.25,PRINCIPAL WOOD,All of which sounds
396.65,400.25,PRINCIPAL WOOD,positively exhausting to me.
400.97,402.77,PRINCIPAL WOOD,No.
402.85,406.56,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"No, l think it would be much easier"
402.85,406.56,PRINCIPAL WOOD,if l just called the police.
406.65,409.61,PRINCIPAL WOOD,Let them deal with it.
409.69,412.49,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"Oh, and, in case you were wondering,"
412.57,416.49,PRINCIPAL WOOD,this is the part where l'm not bluffing.
416.57,418.58,PUNK #2,We'll repaint it.

434.41,435.77,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"Oh, no."
435.85,439.64,DAWN,Yeah. Last night she was vomiting.
435.85,439.64,DAWN,"This morning she was vomiting more,"
439.73,444.2,DAWN,"and then, just when we thought"
439.73,444.2,DAWN,"she was done, she started vomiting again."
444.29,446.49,PRINCIPAL WOOD,"Yeah, we got that stomach flu going around."

450.89,452.37,PRINCIPAL WOOD,Thank you.
452.45,454.81,PRINCIPAL WOOD,That's... very helpful.
454.89,457.28,DAWN,Sure. No problem.
457.37,459.2,DAWN,"Hey, guys. How's it going?"
459.2,460.05,PUNK #2,Pretty good.
460.13,466.02,PRINCIPAL WOOD,Tell your sister not to worry about it.
460.13,466.02,PRINCIPAL WOOD,We'll soldier on without her here.
464.09,467.09,PRINCIPAL WOOD,Just... tell her to concentrate
464.09,467.09,PRINCIPAL WOOD,on getting better.
467.17,471.72,DAWN,"Yeah, she'll be fine. She just needs"
467.17,471.72,DAWN,to get some stuff out of her system.

566.65,567.85,BUFFY,No.
567.93,570.53,BUFFY,We should probably try

779.69,783.89,WILLOW,"Or ""witch"", as is more accurate."
779.69,783.89,WILLOW,l am not to be trifled with...
783.97,784.51,ANDREW,But l...
784.51,786.69,WILLOW,l'm talking. Don't interrupt me.
786.77,788.76,WILLOW,lnsignificant man.
789.93,792.65,WILLOW,l am Willow. l am death.
792.73,798.05,WILLOW,"lf you dare defy me, l will call down my fury,"
792.73,798.05,WILLOW,"exact fresh vengeance,"
798.13,800.97,WILLOW,and make your worst fears come true.
802.45,804.13,WILLOW,OK?
807.09,808.65,WILLOW,Look who l found.
808.65,810.77,XANDER,"Oh, this can't be good."
810.85,813.73,WILLOW,Guess who was buying
810.85,813.73,WILLOW,mass amounts of blood.
813.81,815.94,ANDREW,Your hair's not even black any more.
815.94,817.77,XANDER,What're you doing back in town?
817.85,820.78,ANDREW,"You'll get nothin' out of me, carpenter."
820.78,822.32,XANDER,We'll see about that.
823.69,826.87,ANDREW,Careful with my coat. lt's expensive.
826.87,827.73,ANYA,ls it new?
827.81,830.09,ANYA,Hey. Ow!
830.17,833.88,XANDER,"Now, we can do this"
830.17,833.88,XANDER,"the hard way, if you want."
834.77,838.65,XANDER,"But believe me when l tell you,"
834.77,838.65,XANDER,this will go much easier
838.73,843.01,XANDER,if you just tell us what... you... know.
843.01,843.33,ANDREW,Ow!
843.41,846.56,ANDREW,You're barkin' up the wrong asparagus.
843.41,846.56,ANDREW,l don't know anything.
846.65,850.33,XANDER,Here's the thing. l don't believe you.
850.41,855.02,ANDREW,l haven't done anything wrong.
853.09,855.29,XANDER,Then you won't mind
853.09,855.29,XANDER,if we ask a few questions.
855.37,859.02,ANDREW,"Yeah, OK."
857.09,860.17,XANDER,Why were you buying blood
857.09,860.17,XANDER,at the butcher shop?
860.25,862.29,ANDREW,l fell in love with a vampire in Mexico.
862.37,867.32,ANDREW,Now we're trying to make a go of it on
862.37,867.32,ANDREW,"the straight and narrow, here in Sunnydale."
867.41,870.93,ANYA,"You think this is a game, junior?"
867.41,870.93,ANYA,People are dying.
871.01,873.12,ANYA,Friends' lives are in danger.
873.12,873.85,XANDER,"Hey, Anya."
873.93,877.77,XANDER,Now you wanna waste my time
873.93,877.77,XANDER,with deceptions? Not on my watch!
877.85,879.68,XANDER,"Hey, Anya!"
879.77,882.57,XANDER,Can l talk to you outside for a second?
898.61,901.92,ANYA,Did you see that?
898.61,901.92,ANYA,l actually made him cry.
902.01,905.32,XANDER,You were perfect. l worried l overdid it
902.01,905.32,XANDER,with the "hard way" thing.
905.41,908.21,ANYA,"No, you were great!"
905.41,908.21,ANYA,"l wasn't sure if l should slap him,"
908.29,909.79,ANYA,"but then he made me want to,"
909.79,910.76,XANDER,so l thought "OK."
910.85,912.29,XANDER,He'll be singing in no time.
912.29,913.21,ANYA,What do we do now?
913.29,919.02,XANDER,"We let him stew in his own juices for a bit,"
913.29,919.02,XANDER,then we give him the hard brace.
917.09,919.89,ANYA,Right. What's the status with your guy?
920.85,924.64,BUFFY,He's not talking yet.
920.85,924.64,BUFFY,We'll get there. How's your guy?
924.73,927.09,ANYA,The weasel wants to sing.
924.73,927.09,ANYA,He just needs a tune.
927.17,930.09,XANDER,He's primed.
927.17,930.09,XANDER,l'll be pumping him in no time.
931.85,936.02,XANDER,He'll give us information soon.
941.89,943.49,BUFFY,Better?
945.53,947.6,BUFFY,Good.
948.01,950.4,SPIKE,l don't remember anything.
951.73,954.47,BUFFY,You were having a pretty bad withdrawal.
954.47,955.36,SPIKE,"No, not that."
956.17,959.8,SPIKE,l don't remember... what l did.
960.49,961.17,BUFFY,Nothing?
961.17,963.53,SPIKE,Some flashes here and there.
964.57,970.52,SPIKE,lt's like l'm watching someone else...
964.57,970.52,SPIKE,"do it, kill people."
971.77,976.45,SPIKE,l've been losing time for a while now.
971.77,976.45,SPIKE,Waking up in strange places.
979.33,984.02,BUFFY,When did your chip stop working?
982.09,985.32,SPIKE,"l wasn't aware that it had, you know."
982.09,985.32,SPIKE,Not till now.
986.13,990.17,BUFFY,And the losing time?
986.13,990.17,BUFFY,How long has that been going on?
990.25,995.17,SPIKE,"Oh, things have been wonky for me"
990.25,995.17,SPIKE,ever since l got back. Ever since...
995.25,997.32,BUFFY,You got your soul.
997.41,1001.96,SPIKE,l figured that's what it was like.
997.41,1001.96,SPIKE,Been so long since l had one.
1002.05,1005.84,BUFFY,How did you do it?
1002.05,1005.84,BUFFY,How'd you get your soul back?
1007.97,1010.81,SPIKE,Saw a man about a girl.
1013.53,1016.13,SPIKE,l went to seek a legend out.
1017.93,1022.64,SPIKE,"Travelled to the other side of the world,"
1017.93,1022.64,SPIKE,made a deal with a demon.
1022.73,1023.91,BUFFY,Just like that?
1023.91,1027.12,SPIKE,"No, notjust like that. There was a price."
1027.21,1029.33,SPIKE,There were trials.
1029.41,1031.37,SPIKE,Torture.
1031.45,1035.77,SPIKE,Pain and suffering... of sorts.
1035.85,1036.41,BUFFY,Of sorts?
1036.41,1038.53,SPIKE,"Well, it's all relative, isn't it?"
1038.61,1040.68,BUFFY,Meaning?
1040.77,1046.09,SPIKE,l have come to redefine the words "pain
1040.77,1046.09,SPIKE,and suffering" since l fell in love with you.
1048.93,1051.53,BUFFY,How can you say that?
1052.13,1058.08,SPIKE,l just slaughtered half of Sunnydale. l'm not
1052.13,1058.08,SPIKE,really worried about being polite any more.
1058.17,1060.69,BUFFY,So that's what this is about.
1060.77,1063.27,BUFFY,"You're feeling sorry for yourself, Spike?"
1063.27,1065.16,SPIKE,l'm feeling honest with myself.
1065.25,1067.37,SPIKE,You used me.
1067.45,1068.89,BUFFY,Yes.
1069.37,1072.17,SPIKE,"You told me that, of course."
1072.25,1074.48,SPIKE,l never understood it though.
1074.57,1076.88,SPIKE,Not until now.
1077.49,1081.12,SPIKE,"You hated yourself,"
1077.49,1081.12,SPIKE,and you took it out on me.
1083.01,1085.37,BUFFY,You figured that outjust now?
1087.21,1090.6,SPIKE,A soul's not all about moonbeams
1087.21,1090.6,SPIKE,"and penny whistles, love."
1090.69,1093.29,BUFFY,lt's about selfloathing.
1093.37,1096.76,BUFFY,l get it. l had to travel
1093.37,1096.76,BUFFY,"around the world, but..."
1098.65,1101.17,BUFFY,l understand you now.
1101.25,1105.37,SPIKE,l understand the violence inside.
1101.25,1105.37,SPIKE,Violence?
1105.45,1109.16,BUFFY,William the Bloody
1105.45,1109.16,BUFFY,now has insight into violence?
1109.25,1111.24,SPIKE,Not the same.
1112.13,1118.97,SPIKE,"As bad as l was, as evil and as wretched"
1112.13,1118.97,SPIKE,"as l was, l never truly hated myself back then."
1119.05,1121.69,SPIKE,Not like l do now.
1133.01,1135.2,XANDER,How's your face?
1135.2,1135.61,ANDREW,OK.
1137.25,1140.64,ANDREW,Sorry about that.
1137.25,1140.64,ANDREW,She shouldn't have hit you.
1143.77,1145.37,ANDREW,OK.
1146.81,1148.8,XANDER,Thirsty? Go on.
1152.69,1155.16,ANDREW,That chick's psycho.
1155.25,1157.77,XANDER,You don't know the half of it.
1157.85,1160.24,XANDER,"She's a vengeance demon, you know."
1160.33,1162.32,XANDER,She's bad news.
1163.17,1166.37,ANDREW,This one time
1163.17,1166.37,ANDREW,l saw her having sex with Spike.
1167.85,1169.77,XANDER,She's killed more men than smallpox.
1169.77,1171.16,ANDREW,Does it still kill people?
1171.25,1174.8,XANDER,She's killed a lot of men.
1171.25,1174.8,XANDER,She tortures them.
1174.89,1177.77,XANDER,Anyone who incurs her wrath.
1177.85,1180.32,XANDER,One time she...
1180.41,1181.29,XANDER,Never mind.
1181.29,1181.69,ANDREW,What?
1181.77,1183.25,XANDER,lt's not important.
1183.25,1184.49,ANDREW,What did she do?
1184.57,1187.37,XANDER,"Well, there was this one guy."
1187.45,1192.08,XANDER,There was this one guy.
1187.45,1192.08,XANDER,"He hurt her real bad, so she paid him back."
1192.17,1195.69,XANDER,"She killed him, but she did it real slow."
1197.05,1201.68,XANDER,"See, first she stopped his heart,"
1197.05,1201.68,XANDER,"and then she replaced it with darkness,"
1201.77,1203.84,XANDER,then made him live his life like that.
1203.93,1207.81,XANDER,But he still had to go do his job
1203.93,1207.81,XANDER,and see his friends
1207.89,1210.33,XANDER,and wake up in the morning
1207.89,1210.33,XANDER,"and go to bed at night,"
1210.41,1213.72,XANDER,but he had to do it all... empty.
1214.69,1217.92,XANDER,Without anything to look forward to. Ever.
1218.01,1218.86,ANDREW,Sounds bad.
1218.86,1221.89,XANDER,"Well, then she tore out his intestines,"
1221.97,1224.14,XANDER,rubbed it in his face and took pictures.
1224.14,1224.36,ANDREW,God.
1224.45,1226.97,XANDER,But she's downstairs.
1224.45,1226.97,XANDER,Don't worry about her.
1227.05,1227.92,ANDREW,What if...
1227.92,1229.49,XANDER,"See, the thing is,"
1229.57,1231.77,XANDER,we've all been a little on edge lately.
1231.85,1236.32,XANDER,Bad things have been happening. The girls
1231.85,1236.32,XANDER,are all looking for someone to blame.
1236.41,1237.55,ANDREW,l didn't do anything.
1237.55,1239.29,ANYA,i></i> You lying son of a bitch!
1239.37,1241.73,ANYA,You're gonna tell us
1239.37,1241.73,ANYA,"what we need to know, now!"
1241.81,1243.02,XANDER,"Anya, no!"
1243.02,1244.09,ANDREW,Stop it!
1244.17,1247.29,ANYA,"Get off me, Harris!"
1249.65,1251.08,ANYA,"Come here, you pipsqueak!"
1251.08,1253.25,ANDREW,"Xander, get her off me! l'll tell you!"
1253.33,1256.41,ANDREW,l'll tell you what you need to know!
1257.69,1259.68,BUFFY,Excuse me.
1266.05,1267.65,SPIKE-2,Well.
1270.21,1275.02,SPIKE-2,We've got ourselves a problem.
1274.33,1276.69,ANDREW (O.S.),i></i> Somebody help. Ow!
1276.77,1278.84,BUFFY,Everything OK?
1278.93,1280.57,ANYA,Fine.
1281.41,1282.48,BUFFY,OK.
1285.45,1290.32,SPIKE (O.S.),"i></i> What'd l do, get it halfdone?"
1285.45,1290.32,SPIKE (O.S.),Never send a boy to do a man's job.
1291.77,1293.92,SPIKE (O.S.),"i>è</i> Oh, don't deceive me"
1294.01,1296.16,SPIKE (O.S.),"i>è</i> Oh, never leave me"
1304.65,1307.21,BUFFY,Who were you talking to?
1304.65,1307.21,BUFFY,What's that?
1307.29,1309.65,BUFFY,l heard you.
1307.29,1309.65,BUFFY,Who were you talking to?
1309.73,1313.04,SPIKE,Nobody. l was just
1309.73,1313.04,SPIKE,keeping myself company.
1314.37,1316.07,BUFFY,Are you OK?
1316.07,1316.84,SPIKE,Fine.
1317.73,1319.53,SPIKE,How are you?
1319.61,1324.08,ANYA,"You could talk, or l could keep hitting you."
1319.61,1324.08,ANYA,"Believe me, l'd love to keep hitting you."
1324.81,1325.47,BUFFY,Spike?
1325.47,1328.09,SPIKE,"l'm fine, Buffy. Really."
1328.17,1332.69,SPIKE,"l'm just... feeling a bit peckish,"
1328.17,1332.69,SPIKE,l suppose.
1332.77,1334.76,SPIKE,Do you mind?
1354.85,1358.56,ANDREW,We needed more blood
1354.85,1358.56,ANDREW,to activate the Seal of Dan...
1361.53,1363.49,39 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY,Argh! Argh!
1390.53,1392.76,BUFFY,He didn't seem to want
1390.53,1392.76,BUFFY,anything to do with me.
1392.85,1395.24,BUFFY,He just pushed me aside
1392.85,1395.24,BUFFY,and charged at the wall.
1395.33,1396.74,WILLOW,Are you hurt?
1396.74,1397.93,BUFFY,Not really.
1398.73,1400.64,DAWN,How's whatshisname?
1400.73,1403.73,XANDER,He's got a chunk taken out of his neck
1400.73,1403.73,XANDER,but he'll be all right.
1403.81,1407.93,XANDER,Had to tie him up again but mainly to
1403.81,1407.93,XANDER,keep him from scratching at his bandages.
1408.01,1411.53,XANDER,What the hell happened up there?
1408.01,1411.53,XANDER,l don't know.
1411.61,1414.65,BUFFY,"Spike and l were having a conversation,"
1411.61,1414.65,BUFFY,and he was fine.
1414.73,1418.36,BUFFY,"l mean, you know, fine as Spike can be."
1414.73,1418.36,BUFFY,"Then l went to check on you guys,"
1418.45,1422.49,BUFFY,"and when l got back, it was..."
1418.45,1422.49,BUFFY,like he was a completely different person.
1422.57,1425.49,WILLOW,Different like
1422.57,1425.49,WILLOW,WilliamtheBloodytype different?
1425.57,1430.04,BUFFY,He was talking to someone. l heard through
1425.57,1430.04,BUFFY,the door. He was having this conversation.
1430.13,1432,BUFFY,And then he started singing.
1432,1433.81,ANYA,Maybe it's another musical.
1435.29,1437.03,ANYA,A much crappier musical.
1437.03,1439.49,BUFFY,He mentioned a song in the cellar.
1439.57,1442.49,BUFFY,He changed there too.
1439.57,1442.49,BUFFY,lnstantly became another person.
1442.57,1444.21,XANDER,Trigger.
1444.29,1445.46,ANYA,The horse?
1445.46,1447.33,XANDER,"No, in his head."
1447.41,1452.02,XANDER,lt's a trigger.
1447.41,1452.02,XANDER,lt's a brainwashing term.
1450.09,1452.73,XANDER,lt's how the military makes sleeper agents.
1452.81,1459.08,XANDER,They brainwash operatives and condition
1452.81,1459.08,XANDER,"them with a specific trigger, like a song,"
1459.17,1462.32,XANDER,that makes 'em drastically change
1459.17,1462.32,XANDER,at a moment's notice.
1462.41,1464.97,WILLOW,ls this left over from your days in the army?
1465.05,1469.6,WILLOW,"No, this is left over from every army movie"
1465.05,1469.6,WILLOW,l've ever seen. But it makes sense.
1469.69,1472.69,XANDER,We've had ghosts
1469.69,1472.69,XANDER,"or something haunting us, right?"
1472.77,1476.85,XANDER,"Well, what if Spike's ghosts have figured out"
1472.77,1476.85,XANDER,a way to  not only haunt him 
1476.93,1479.32,WILLOW,what if they figured out how to control him?
1479.41,1482.72,BUFFY,Spike's been seeing things
1479.41,1482.72,BUFFY,since l found him in the basement.
1482.81,1488.92,WILLOW,"So he gets his soul back, he starts seeing"
1482.81,1488.92,WILLOW,"spooky things, and he goes extraextracrazy."
1489.01,1492.8,BUFFY,This trigger. How do we...
1489.01,1492.8,BUFFY,holster or... safety or...
1492.89,1495.81,BUFFY,l don't know guns.
1492.89,1495.81,BUFFY,How do we make it stop?
1495.89,1498.04,XANDER,"Usually, the operative completes his task"
1498.13,1501.6,XANDER,and either blows his head off
1498.13,1501.6,XANDER,or steals a submarine.
1502.65,1506.69,XANDER,"l need information. lf Spike's a bomb,"
1502.65,1506.69,XANDER,l need to know how to defuse him.
1506.77,1508.67,XANDER,l wanna know what did this to him.
1508.67,1510.85,BUFFY,"Spirits, ghosts, demons  check the lot."
1510.93,1514.4,BUFFY,Look for anything that could haunt
1510.93,1514.4,BUFFY,or possibly control like this.
1514.49,1516.53,42 INT. BASEMENT AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT,l need to know what we're dealing with.
1644.49,1649.02,SPIKE,Did l hurt anybody?
1647.09,1649.53,BUFFY,You took a good bite out of Andrew.
1650.49,1652.09,SPIKE,Who?
1652.17,1654.37,BUFFY,Tucker's brother.
1654.45,1656.52,SPIKE,Oh.
1656.61,1659.45,BUFFY,He'll be OK.
1659.53,1661.65,SPIKE,l don't remember.
1662.89,1664.88,BUFFY,lt's OK.
1666.77,1668.84,SPIKE,"Buffy, l don't know why."
1669.57,1671.56,BUFFY,We think we do.
1671.65,1673.48,BUFFY,Something's playing you.
1673.57,1677.93,BUFFY,Some ghost or demon
1673.57,1677.93,BUFFY,has figured out how to control you.
1678.45,1681.53,BUFFY,Got the gang researching it right now.
1681.61,1685.4,BUFFY,Xander has this theory
1681.61,1685.4,BUFFY,that you're being triggered.
1686.29,1688.41,SPIKE,Kill mm.
1689.45,1689.91,BUFFY,What?
1689.91,1692.41,SPIKE,"Buffy, you have to kill me."
1693.61,1697.21,BUFFY,You don't understand.
1693.61,1697.21,BUFFY,"When l left the room, l heard you talking to..."
1697.29,1700.57,SPIKE,Do you have any idea what l'm capable of?
1704.13,1706.85,BUFFY,l was in the cellar with you.
1704.13,1706.85,BUFFY,l saw what you did.
1706.93,1711.45,SPIKE,l'm not talking about the cellar.
1706.93,1711.45,SPIKE,The people in the cellar got off easy.
1711.53,1714.73,BUFFY,l'm talking about me.
1714.81,1718.12,SPIKE,"Buffy, you've never met the real me."
1719.85,1723.08,BUFFY,l'm well aware of what you're capable of.
1723.08,1725.05,SPIKE,No. You got off easy too.
1730.69,1736.17,SPIKE,Do you know how much blood you can drink
1730.69,1736.17,SPIKE,from a girl before she'll die? l do.
1736.25,1739.37,SPIKE,"You see, the trick is to drinkjust enough,"
1739.45,1743.29,SPIKE,to know how to damage them just enough
1743.37,1746.41,SPIKE,so that they'll still cry when you...
1748.97,1752.05,BUFFY,Cos it's not worth it if they don't cry.
1752.69,1755.81,BUFFY,lt's not your fault.
1752.69,1755.81,BUFFY,You're not the one doing this.
1755.89,1758.97,SPIKE,l already did it. lt's already done.
1760.89,1763.93,SPIKE,You wanna know
1760.89,1763.93,SPIKE,what l've done to girls Dawn's age?
1767.41,1769.48,SPIKE,"This is me, Buffy."
1769.57,1772.33,BUFFY,You've got to kill me before l get out.
1773.89,1777.28,BUFFY,We can keep you locked up.
1773.89,1777.28,BUFFY,Keep you here and we'll figure it out.
1777.37,1781.41,SPIKE,Have you ever really asked yourself
1777.37,1781.41,SPIKE,why you can't do it? Off me?
1781.49,1785.73,SPIKE,"After everything l've done to you,"
1781.49,1785.73,SPIKE,to people around you.
1785.81,1788.65,SPIKE,lt's not love. We both know that.
1788.73,1792.2,BUFFY,You fought by my side.
1788.73,1792.2,BUFFY,You've saved lives. You've helped...
1792.29,1794.28,SPIKE,Don't do that.
1795.25,1798.93,BUFFY,Don't rationalise this into some noble act.
1800.05,1803.05,BUFFY,Because we both know the truth of it.
1807.01,1809.61,SPIKE,You like men who hurt you.
1809.69,1811.52,BUFFY,No.
1813.05,1815.81,BUFFY,You need the pain we cause you.
1815.89,1819.44,BUFFY,You need the hate.
1815.89,1819.44,BUFFY,"You need it to do yourjob, to be the Slayer."
1819.53,1821.33,BUFFY,No.
1823.09,1825.08,BUFFY,l don't hate like that.
1826.29,1829.17,BUFFY,Not you... or myself.
1830.89,1833.49,BUFFY,Not any more.
1833.57,1838.36,BUFFY,You think you have insight now
1833.57,1838.36,BUFFY,because your soul's drenched in blood?
1838.45,1841.29,BUFFY,You don't know me.
1841.37,1843.52,BUFFY,You don't even know you.
1843.61,1848.89,BUFFY,Was that you who killed those people in the
1843.61,1848.89,BUFFY,cellar? Was it you who waited for those girls?
1848.97,1851.77,SPIKE,There's no one else.
1848.97,1851.77,SPIKE,That's not true.
1853.17,1855.05,BUFFY,Listen to me.
1855.13,1858.73,BUFFY,You're not alive because of hate or pain.
1860.49,1865.61,BUFFY,You're alive because l saw you change.
1860.49,1865.61,BUFFY,Because l saw your penance.
1865.89,1867.88,SPIKE,Windowdressing.
1867.97,1870.81,BUFFY,"Be easier, wouldn't it, if it were an act."
1870.89,1872.88,BUFFY,But it's not.
1874.81,1879.13,BUFFY,You faced the monster inside of you
1874.81,1879.13,BUFFY,and you fought back.
1879.21,1881.65,BUFFY,You risked everything to be a better man.
1881.65,1882.13,SPIKE,Buffy...
1882.21,1883.97,BUFFY,And you can be.
1885.13,1886.61,BUFFY,You are.
1887.29,1890.6,,"You may not see it, but l do."
1891.73,1893.72,,l do.
1895.45,1898.09,,"l believe in you, Spike."
2047.05,2048.26,SPIKE,i></i> Buffy!
2048.26,2048.73,BUFFY,Dawn?
2048.81,2052.69,XANDER,She's OK. ls this it?
2048.81,2052.69,XANDER,l thought there was more of 'em.
2052.77,2054.13,BUFFY,Spike.
2071.25,2074.21,XANDER,i></i> They were so fast.
2074.29,2075.49,XANDER,And organised.
2075.57,2078.57,BUFFY,They were after Spike all along.
2078.65,2081.45,XANDER,And we were just in the way.
2086.65,2089.49,XANDER,l know these guys.
2089.57,2092.17,BUFFY,l've fought them before.
2093.17,2095.37,BUFFY,We aren't being haunted.
2095.45,2099.61,BUFFY,This isn't some demon.
2095.45,2099.61,BUFFY,lt's all the same thing.
2099.69,2105.4,BUFFY,"Spike's ghosts, the people"
2099.69,2105.4,BUFFY,"that you guys saw, ""from beneath us..."""
2106.61,2109.84,BUFFY,lt's all the same thing.
