4.03,6.62,,Cordelia:
4.03,6.62,,I think we should get a limo.
6.7,7.15,,A limo?
7.15,8.56,Xander,A big. Expensive limo?
8.63,9.86,Willow,That sounds like fun.
9.93,11.63,Willow,And it is our last
9.93,11.63,Willow,homecoming dance.
11.7,13.57,Willow,so maybe we should make
11.7,13.57,Willow,a big deal of it.
13.64,16.13,Xander,You want to talk fun?
13.64,16.13,Xander,Public bus.
16.21,18.73,Xander,You meet the funnest people.
16.21,18.73,Xander,Back me up here. Oz.
18.81,21.51,Oz,If it's a dollar issue.
18.81,21.51,Oz,we could all take my van.
21.58,25.48,Cordelia,Van? The homecoming queen
21.58,25.48,Cordelia,doesn't go to the dance in a van.
25.55,26.68,Cordelia,Use your head.
26.75,28.72,Xander,Technically. You haven't
26.75,28.72,Xander,been elected yet...
28.79,30.81,Xander,although you certainly
28.79,30.81,Xander,and without a doubt will be.
30.89,32.32,Xander,Who else likes a limo?
32.39,33.82,Willow,A private limo!
33.89,35.79,Willow,It is pretty... cuddlesome.
35.86,38.83,Willow,And if we all split the cost...
39.96,41.16,Buffy,Um... maybe.
41.23,43.26,Buffy,You know.
41.23,43.26,Buffy,if I go and all.
43.33,46.2,Willow,Why wouldn't you go?
43.33,46.2,Willow,You already have your tickets.
46.27,49.21,Willow,Unless you don't
46.27,49.21,Willow,have a daay or two...
49.27,50.71,Willow,to think about it.
50.78,52.97,Willow,We should all think about it.
53.04,57.45,Cordelia,What's going on here? Did Scott not
53.04,57.45,Cordelia,ask her to the homecoming dance yet?
57.52,60.78,Buffy,Thanks. Cordelia.
57.52,60.78,Buffy,Humiliation's really good for my color.
60.85,63.22,Scott,Oh. Um... well. No.
60.85,63.22,Scott,I just...
63.29,66.69,Scott,assumed that you would think
63.29,66.69,Scott,it was corny or something.
66.76,70.25,Scott,but I'm in... I mean.
66.76,70.25,Scott,if you are. If you want to.
70.33,73.63,Buffy,Uh. Sure... I do.
70.33,73.63,Buffy,You know. If you want to.
73.7,76.03,Scott,Scott:
73.7,76.03,Scott,I do if you want to.
76.1,78.4,Oz,The judges will accept that
76.1,78.4,Oz,as a yes.
78.47,81.56,Scott,Do you want me to get you
78.47,81.56,Scott,another drink?
81.64,83.44,Buffy,Um... no. Actually.
83.51,85.44,Buffy,Uh... I'm a little tired.
85.51,88.31,Buffy,I think I'm gonna call it a night.
88.38,90.75,Buffy,But I'm excited
88.38,90.75,Buffy,about the dance.
90.82,91.94,Scott,Me too.
97.32,99.19,Scott,
106.83,108.26,Scott,

119.74,121.21,Buffy,It's just me.
122.68,123.94,Buffy,Here.
136.69,138.29,Buffy,How are you feeling?
140.2,141.79,Angel,It hurts...
143.47,144.76,Angel,less.
146.24,147.53,Buffy,Good.
158.22,162.81,Buffy,I haven't told Giles
158.22,162.81,Buffy,and the others...
162.89,164.82,Buffy,that you're back.
164.89,166.25,Angel,Giles...
168.06,169.99,Buffy,And I'm not going to.
171.73,176.17,Buffy,They wouldn't understand
171.73,176.17,Buffy,that you're... better.
176.23,179.57,Buffy,And I'm gonna keep helping you
176.23,179.57,Buffy,get better.
181.24,183.76,Buffy,It's just that everything's
181.24,183.76,Buffy,different now.
185.18,187.11,Buffy,I'm a senior.
187.18,189.87,Buffy,I'm really working harder
187.18,189.87,Buffy,in school.
189.95,192.38,Buffy,I'm even thinking about college.
195.02,197.61,Buffy,And I'm involved with someone.
213.7,215.64,Buffy,His name is Scott.
217.04,219.53,Buffy,He's a nice. Solid guy.
221.71,224.55,Buffy,He makes me happy...
224.62,227.24,Buffy,and that's what I need...
227.32,229.29,and that's what I need,someone I can count on.
231.36,234.15,Scott,I don't think we should
231.36,234.15,Scott,see each other anymore.
235.99,237.43,Buffy,You don't?
240.16,243.03,Buffy,When did this happen?
240.16,243.03,Buffy,Where was I?
243.1,244.59,Scott,Buffy. It's just...
244.67,248.9,Scott,before we were going out.
244.67,248.9,Scott,youyou seemed so...
248.97,251.07,Scott,full of life.
248.97,251.07,Scott,like a force of nature.
251.14,254.58,Scott,Now you just seem distracted
251.14,254.58,Scott,all the time. And...
254.65,256.61,Buffy,I'm getting better.
254.65,256.61,Buffy,Honest.
256.68,258.61,Buffy,In fact. From here on.
258.68,261.41,Buffy,you are gonna see
258.68,261.41,Buffy,a drastic distraction reduction.
263.85,266.41,Buffy,Drastic distraction reduction."
266.49,268.92,Buffy,Try saying that 10 times fast.
268.99,270.98,Scott,I'm really sorry.
339.03,340.62,Boss,Is that her?
342.7,345.5,Trick,In the nubile flesh.
342.7,345.5,Trick,my friend.
350.02,349.44,Trick,That's the target.
407.68,410.27,Secretary,Woman:
407.68,410.27,Secretary,The mayor will see you now.
415.96,418.32,Allan,I'm sorry to bother you. Sir.
418.39,419.82,Mayor Wilkins,I'm not bothered. Allan.
420.93,422.26,Mayor Wilkins,Well. I'm not sure
422.26,423.73,Allan,how serious this is.
423.8,426.66,Allan,but they were spotted
423.8,426.66,Allan,in town three days ago.
426.73,428.17,Allan,I've just been informed.
428.23,431.23,Mayor Wilkins,Frederick and
428.23,431.23,Mayor Wilkins,Hans Gruenshtahler...
431.3,433.74,Mayor Wilkins,wanted in Germany
431.3,433.74,Mayor Wilkins,for capital murder.
433.81,436.24,Mayor Wilkins,terrorism. The bombing
433.81,436.24,Mayor Wilkins,of flight 1402...
436.31,439.21,Mayor Wilkins,I should have brought it
436.31,439.21,Mayor Wilkins,to your attention sooner.
439.28,442.41,Allan,but I'dI'd wanted to confirm...
443.95,446.58,Mayor Wilkins,Would you show me
443.95,446.58,Mayor Wilkins,your hands. Please?
446.65,447.71,Allan,Sir?
448.86,450.29,Mayor Wilkins,Your hands.
457.76,460.49,Mayor Wilkins,I think they could be cleaner.
460.57,463.66,Allan,Of course. Sir.
460.57,463.66,Allan,I mean. I washed them. But...
465.47,468.03,Mayor Wilkins,After every meal
465.47,468.03,Mayor Wilkins,and under your fingernails.
468.11,474.02,Mayor Wilkins,Dirt gets trapped there
468.11,474.02,Mayor Wilkins,and germs and mayonnaise.
472.08,473.74,Mayor Wilkins,My dear mother said.
473.81,477.44,Mayor Wilkins,Cleanliness is next to godliness."
473.81,477.44,Mayor Wilkins,and I believed her.
477.52,479.64,Mayor Wilkins,She never caught a cold.
479.72,481.5,Allan,I'd like these two to be
481.5,483.21,Mayor Wilkins,put under surveillance.
483.29,487.23,Mayor Wilkins,and I'd like to know if any other
483.29,487.23,Mayor Wilkins,colorful characters have come to town.
487.29,489.32,Allan,I'll take care of it.
489.4,491.33,Mayor Wilkins,You have all my faith.
513.35,515.72,Willow,You have to help me pick an outfit.
515.79,518.69,Willow,I want to wear something that
515.79,518.69,Willow,makes Oz go. "Oh."
518.76,519.57,Xander,No problem.
519.57,521.25,,I got the tux goin' on.
521.33,523.69,,I'm gonna look hot
521.33,523.69,,if it even remotely fits.
523.76,525.13,,Whatcha doin'?
525.2,529.23,Cordelia,Checking out the... I laughingly
525.2,529.23,Cordelia,use the phrase... competition.
529.3,532.07,Cordelia,Holly Charleston...
529.3,532.07,Cordelia,nice girl. Brain dead.
532.14,533.4,Cordelia,doesn't have a prayer.
533.47,535.41,Cordelia,Michelle Blake...
533.47,535.41,Cordelia,open to all mankind.
535.48,539.04,Cordelia,especially those with
535.48,539.04,Cordelia,a letterman's jacket and a car.
539.11,541.14,Cordelia,She could give me a run.
541.21,543.58,Willow,Where's Buffy? She's gonna
541.21,543.58,Willow,miss the yearbook pictures.
543.65,546.92,Xander,Buffy and Faith are in the library
543.65,546.92,Xander,getting all sweaty.
546.99,548.32,Cordelia,They're training.
548.39,549.69,Xander,I stand by my phrase.
549.76,551.95,Oz,I don't think she was here
549.76,551.95,Oz,the day they announced them.
552.03,553.49,Oz,Did anybody tell her?
553.56,554.89,Cordelia,I'll tell her now.
554.96,556.86,Cordelia,I have to go to the nurse's office
554.96,556.86,Cordelia,for an ice pack anyway.
556.93,557.86,Xander,Did you hurt yourself?
557.93,558.95,Cordelia,No. Silly.
559.03,561.33,Cordelia,It shrinks the pores.
561.4,562.83,Xander,
566.44,570.64,Faith,Man! Guys should break up
566.44,570.64,Faith,with you more often.
570.71,571.9,Buffy,Gee. Thank you.
571.98,574.28,Faith,I mean it. You really
571.98,574.28,Faith,got some quality rage going.
574.35,575.97,Faith,Really gives you an edge.
576.05,577.68,Buffy,Edgegirl.
577.75,578.96,Buffy,Just what I always
578.96,579.84,Faith,wanted to be.
579.92,581.61,Faith,Well. Screw him. All right?
581.69,584.92,Faith,You move on. And... you party heavily.
581.69,584.92,Faith,and you'll be fine.
584.99,586.72,Faith,You're still going
584.99,586.72,Faith,to that dance. Right?
586.79,587.99,Buffy,Maybe.
588.06,590.89,Faith,You got the tix already.
588.06,590.89,Faith,Why don't we go together?
590.96,592.79,Buffy,I don't know about that.
592.87,595.1,Faith,Come on. We'll find a couple studs.
592.87,595.1,Faith,we'll use them and...
595.17,596.29,Buffy,discard them.
596.37,597.53,Buffy,That's always fun.
597.6,599.4,Buffy,OK. I'm in.
599.47,601.91,Buffy,Not the studusing part.
599.47,601.91,Buffy,though.
601.97,603.87,Buffy,Or... probably not.
607.48,609.91,Cordelia,Uh. Bobby. Mashad.
609.98,612.75,Cordelia,You don't phone.
609.98,612.75,Cordelia,you don't write.
612.82,614.31,Cordelia,Where's the love?
622.43,623.92,Buffy,Miss Moran? Hi.
624,626.93,Buffy,I'm so glad that
624,626.93,Buffy,I ran into you.
627,628.72,Buffy,I had this little incident
628.72,629.52,Ms. Moran,last year...
629.6,631.57,Buffy,of getting kicked out of school.
631.64,633.23,Buffy,and I'm back now. Though.
633.31,635.27,Buffy,I've done all of my makeup tests.
635.34,638.5,Buffy,but I still need one written
635.34,638.5,Buffy,recommendation from a teacher...
638.58,641.81,Buffy,I think the word that Principal Snyder
638.58,641.81,Buffy,used was "glowing..."
641.88,645.21,Buffy,to put in my file so I can prove
641.88,645.21,Buffy,that I belong here.
645.28,647.95,Ms. Moran,And you are...
648.02,649.42,Buffy,Buffy.
649.49,651.82,Buffy,BBuffy Summers.
649.49,651.82,Buffy,Third row.
651.89,653.79,Buffy,I sat by the window.
653.86,655.79,Buffy,Your class...
653.86,655.79,Buffy,Contemporary American Heroes...
655.86,658.06,Ms. Moran,from Amelia Earhart
655.86,658.06,Ms. Moran,to Maya Angelou.
658.13,660.6,Buffy,The class that changed my life.
660.67,663.03,Ms. Moran,Were you absent a lot. Um...
663.1,664.33,Buffy,Buffy.
668.47,672.57,Cordelia,Cordelia: Hi. I hope you'll
668.47,672.57,Cordelia,consider me for homecoming queen.
674.98,676.41,Buffy,I can't believe it.
676.48,680.42,Buffy,My favorite teacher. And she
676.48,680.42,Buffy,didn't even remember who I was.
680.49,682.35,Buffy,I'm like a nonperson.
682.42,685.39,Buffy,Am I invisible?
682.42,685.39,Buffy,Can you see me?
685.46,687.43,Oz,Big as life.
687.49,690.72,Buffy,At Hemery. I was prom princess.
687.49,690.72,Buffy,I was fiesta queen.
690.8,693.23,Buffy,I was on the cheerleading squad.
693.3,696.2,Buffy,The yearbook was. Like.
693.3,696.2,Buffy,a story of me.
696.27,699.03,Buffy,Now it's senior year. And I'm going
696.27,699.03,Buffy,to be one crappy picture...
699.11,701.44,Xander,on 1/8 of one crappy page.
701.51,703.94,Xander,Uh. No. Actually. You're not.
706.02,705.64,Buffy,What do you mean?
705.71,708.44,Xander,Well. You missed the picturetaking.
708.51,709.95,Buffy,When? Why?
710.02,710.25,Buffy,Oz:
710.25,711.92,Oz,We did them yesterday.
711.98,713.85,Willow,Willow:
711.98,713.85,Willow,Didn't Cordelia tell you?
715.82,717.29,Cordelia,Thanks for your support.
717.36,719.88,Cordelia,Buffy. You look so cute
717.36,719.88,Cordelia,in that outfit.
719.96,721.72,Buffy,I'm not voting for you.
721.79,723.21,Cordelia,Then make it snappy.
723.35,725.81,Buffy,How come you didn't tell me they
723.35,725.81,Buffy,were doing the yearbook pictures?
725.88,728.91,Cordelia,Didn't I? Oh. I guess I forgot.
725.88,728.91,Cordelia,What's the big?
728.99,731.75,Buffy,It's just... you could've thought
728.99,731.75,Buffy,about somebody else...
731.82,733.59,Buffy,for 30 seconds. That's all.
733.66,735.99,Cordelia,Hey. I am under
733.66,735.99,Cordelia,a lot of pressure here.
736.06,738.62,Buffy,Oh. Yeah. Campaigning.
736.06,738.62,Buffy,Rough gig.
738.7,740.22,Cordelia,What would you know about it?
740.3,742.49,Cordelia,Just because you were guacamole queen
740.3,742.49,Cordelia,when you were three...
742.57,744.8,Buffy,doesn't mean you understand
742.57,744.8,Buffy,how this works.
744.87,748.27,Buffy,Obviously. It involves handing out
744.87,748.27,Buffy,entirely lame flyers.
748.34,750.83,Cordelia,No. It involves being part
748.34,750.83,Cordelia,of this school...
750.91,752.34,Cordelia,and having actual friends.
753.68,756.44,Cordelia,Now. If it was about monsters.
753.68,756.44,Cordelia,blood. And innards.
756.51,758.45,Cordelia,then you'd be a shooin.
758.52,762.08,Cordelia,I'd like to see you
758.52,762.08,Cordelia,try to win the crown.
762.15,763.52,Buffy,You would?
763.59,764.75,Buffy,
765.86,767.98,Buffy,Then you will.
768.06,770.03,Cordelia,What does that mean?
770.09,772.56,Buffy,I'm gonna show you
770.09,772.56,Buffy,how it's done.
772.63,774.74,Buffy,I'm gonna run for homecoming queen.
774.74,776,Cordelia,and I'm going to win.
776.07,778.36,Cordelia,This is starting to be sad.
778.44,781.89,Buffy,Sorry. Cordy. But you have no idea
778.44,781.89,Buffy,who you're messing with.
781.97,783.63,Cordelia,What? The slayer?
783.71,786.14,Buffy,I'm not talking about the slayer.
786.21,787.68,Buffy,I'm talking about Buffy.
787.74,791.24,Buffy,You've awakened
787.74,791.24,Buffy,the prom queen within.
791.31,793.75,Buffy,and that crown
791.31,793.75,Buffy,is going to be mine.
794.82,796.91,Trick,Man:
794.82,796.91,Trick,Competition.
797.02,800.75,Trick,Competition is a beautiful thing.
800.82,803.26,Trick,It makes us strive.
803.33,806.06,Trick,It... makes us accomplish.
806.13,808.12,Trick,Occasionally. It makes us kill.
808.2,811.13,Trick,We all have the desire to win.
811.2,812.63,Trick,whether we're human...
813.97,815.56,Trick,vampire...
817.34,819.77,Trick,and whatever the hell
817.34,819.77,Trick,you are. My brother.
819.84,821.78,Trick,You got them spinylooking
819.84,821.78,Trick,head things.
821.85,823.78,Trick,I ain't never seen them before.
823.85,826.82,Kulak,I am Kulak of the Miquot clan.
828.02,829.45,Trick,Isn't that nice.
829.52,833.25,Trick,Point is. You're all here
829.52,833.25,Trick,for the same reason.
833.32,836.35,Lyle,It sure ain't no
833.32,836.35,Lyle,philosophy class now. Is it?
836.43,838.52,Trick,Mr. Gorch.
836.43,838.52,Trick,my account statement says...
838.6,840.89,Trick,that your deposit
838.6,840.89,Trick,has not yet been made.
840.96,842.4,Lyle,Me and Candy...
842.47,844.8,Lyle,we blown our whole
842.47,844.8,Lyle,honeymoon stash...
844.87,846.73,Lyle,on this little game here.
848.87,850.24,Trick,They're dirty.
850.31,851.67,Lyle,They're nonconsecutive.
854.18,857.54,Trick,The games will begin
854.18,857.54,Trick,in a few days' time.
857.61,860.55,Trick,The first target... Buffy...
857.61,860.55,Trick,you've all seen.
860.62,863.75,Trick,The second... Faith...
860.62,863.75,Trick,is a little more elusive.
863.82,868.02,Trick,But they will both be together
863.82,868.02,Trick,and ready for the killing.
868.09,872.15,Trick,and that is
868.09,872.15,Trick,a moneyback guarantee.
872.23,874.99,Trick,Ladies. Gentlemen.
875.07,877.69,Trick,spinyheaded looking creatures...
877.77,882.73,Trick,welcome to SlayerFest '98.
890.55,893.14,Willow,What do you think of this?
894.95,896.65,Xander,Nice.
896.72,899.12,Willow,It's my first big dance.
896.72,899.12,Willow,you know?
899.19,901.62,Willow,Where there's a boy and a band...
901.69,902.77,Lyrics,and not just me
902.77,904.13,Willow,alone in my room...
904.19,906.56,Willow,pretending that there's
904.19,906.56,Willow,a boy and a band.
906.63,908.43,Willow,I just want it to be...
908.43,909.06,Xander,Special.
909.13,912.07,Xander,That's why I spared no expense
909.13,912.07,Xander,on the tux.
912.14,915.5,Willow,The tux? I thought you borrowed it
912.14,915.5,Willow,from your cousin Rigby.
915.57,917.54,Xander,Expense to my pride. Wil.
917.61,920.84,Xander,They're our only relations
917.61,920.84,Xander,with money. And they shun us...
920.91,922.34,Xander,as they should.
925.05,927.61,Willow,What do you think about this?
929.22,930.55,Xander,Nice.
937.23,938.66,Xander,What?
938.73,941.16,Willow,I was just...
941.23,943.43,Willow,Remember the eighthgrade cotillion?
943.5,945.4,Willow,You had that clipon.
945.47,948.3,Xander,I was pretty stylin'
945.47,948.3,Xander,with the clipon.
948.37,951.1,Willow,And now here we are.
948.37,951.1,Willow,and it's homecoming.
951.17,952.94,Xander,We should face it. Wil.
955.02,955.91,Xander,You and I are gonna be
955.02,955.91,Xander,in neighboring rest homes...
955.98,958.61,Xander,while I come over so
955.98,958.61,Xander,you can adjust my...
958.68,960.11,Xander,my. Uh...
960.18,963.45,Xander,Well. I can't think of anything
960.18,963.45,Xander,that's not really gross.
966.19,970.13,Xander,So. Uh... you and Oz.
970.19,972.13,Xander,How do I put this?
972.2,975.82,Xander,Are we on first. Second.
972.2,975.82,Xander,or. Uh...
975.9,977.33,Xander,Ye gods?"
977.4,980.39,Willow,That's none of your business.
977.4,980.39,Willow,Alexander Harris.
980.47,982.46,Xander,Ohh... rounding second.
982.54,984.27,Willow,You don't know that.
984.34,986.6,Willow,What about you and Cordelia?
986.68,990.08,Xander,Oh. A gentleman never talks
986.68,990.08,Xander,about his conquests.
990.15,993.34,Willow,Oh. Yeah? Well. Since when
990.15,993.34,Willow,did you become a...
996.35,997.94,Willow,gentleman?
998.99,1001.89,Willow,I... I know. "Nice."
1003.23,1005.32,Xander,I was gonna go with "gorgeous."
1006.73,1008.59,Willow,Really?
1008.67,1010.43,Willow,You too.
1010.5,1012.47,Willow,In... In a guy way.
1014.14,1016.4,Xander,Oz is very lucky.
1017.91,1021.57,Willow,So is Cordelia...
1017.91,1021.57,Willow,in a girl way.
1023.21,1025.48,Willow,I don't know if I can dance in this.
1025.55,1027.68,Willow,I don't know if I can dace:
1027.75,1029.68,Xander,Come on.
1027.75,1029.68,Xander,Piece of cake.
1029.75,1031.01,Xander,Here.
1032.69,1034.66,Xander,Well. That seems to...
1038.7,1043.26,Willow,Yeah. This shouldn't
1038.7,1043.26,Willow,be a problem.
1043.33,1044.93,Xander,No.
1046.54,1048.06,Xander,No problem.
1064.22,1065.59,Xander,That didn't just happen!
1065.66,1068.49,Willow,No! I mean. It did.
1065.66,1068.49,Willow,but it didn't.
1068.56,1071.69,Xander,Because I respect you... and Oz...
1068.56,1071.69,Xander,and I would never...
1071.76,1075.49,Willow,I would never. Either.
1071.76,1075.49,Willow,It must be the clothes. It's a fluke.
1075.57,1078.4,Xander,It's a clothes fluke. That's what it is.
1075.57,1078.4,Xander,There'll be no more fluking.
1078.47,1079.53,Willow,Not ever.
1080.67,1082.6,Xander,We got to get out
1080.67,1082.6,Xander,of these clothes.
1082.67,1083.87,Willow,Right now.
1083.94,1085.07,Xander,Oh. I didn't mean...
1085.14,1085.71,Xander,I didn't...
1085.71,1086.27,Willow,Me. Either!
1086.41,1086.76,Willow,Buffy:
1086.76,1088.24,Buffy,A campaign is like a war.
1088.31,1090.24,Buffy,It's won or lost
1088.31,1090.24,Buffy,in the trenches.
1090.37,1091.27,Buffy,Holly. Michelle.
1091.34,1093.07,Buffy,and our real competition. Cordelia.
1093.14,1094.91,Buffy,all have big head starts.
1094.98,1096.38,Buffy,Speaking of big heads.
1096.45,1099.64,Buffy,if I had a watermelon
1096.45,1099.64,Buffy,as big as Cordelia's. I'd be rich.
1101.15,1103.18,Buffy,Waits for laugh...
1104.99,1107.48,Buffy,OK. You're right.
1104.99,1107.48,Buffy,Making fun of the competition...
1107.56,1109.22,Buffy,only makes me seem petty.
1109.29,1111.49,Buffy,Now. This is just like
1109.29,1111.49,Buffy,any other popularity contest.
1111.56,1113.86,Buffy,I've done this before.
1111.56,1113.86,Buffy,The only difference being...
1113.93,1116.09,Buffy,this time.
1113.93,1116.09,Buffy,I'm not actually popular.
1116.17,1118.1,Buffy,Although. I'm not
1116.17,1118.1,Buffy,exactly unpopular.
1118.17,1121.66,Buffy,A lot of people came to
1118.17,1121.66,Buffy,my welcome home party.
1121.74,1123.23,Willow,But they were killed
1121.74,1123.23,Willow,by zombies.
1123.31,1124.24,Buffy,Good point.
1124.31,1125.67,Buffy,OK. Here's the plan.
1125.74,1130.02,Buffy,Willow. I need you
1125.74,1130.02,Buffy,to make a database.
1128.08,1129.38,Buffy,See who's for us.
1129.45,1132.68,Buffy,who's on the fence. And where
1129.45,1132.68,Buffy,our real crisis areas are.
1132.75,1135.22,Buffy,Oz. You take the fringe...
1132.75,1135.22,Buffy,musicians.
1135.29,1137.12,Buffy,those not normally
1135.29,1137.12,Buffy,inclined to vote.
1137.19,1139.38,Buffy,Xander. What...
1139.46,1142.09,Buffy,Uh. Cordelia.
1139.46,1142.09,Buffy,OK. Iook.
1142.16,1143.72,Buffy,I know this is
1142.16,1143.72,Buffy,a little awkward.
1143.79,1146.35,Cordelia,but I don't see any reason
1143.79,1146.35,Cordelia,why we all can't get along...
1146.43,1148.36,Buffy,during this campaign time.
1148.43,1150.09,Buffy,I mean. We're...
1150.17,1151.57,Cordelia,almost friends.
1151.64,1154.04,Cordelia,and we are all
1151.64,1154.04,Cordelia,riding together in the limo.
1154.11,1157.67,Cordelia,Yeah. Great.
1154.11,1157.67,Cordelia,Willow. How's that database coming?
1157.74,1161.27,Willow,Uh. It's... just about done.
1161.35,1162.64,Cordelia,Xander?
1162.71,1165.2,Xander,I got your new flyers.
1165.28,1166.68,Cordelia,Let's get cracking.
1170.15,1172.38,Xander,She's my girlfriend.
1174.16,1178.03,Willow,It's just that... she needs it
1174.16,1178.03,Willow,so much more than you do.
1179.5,1183.46,Oz,As Willow goes.
1179.5,1183.46,Oz,so goes my nation.
1183.53,1185.23,Cordelia,Thanks for what you said. Buffy.
1185.3,1187.36,Cordelia,I think we're getting
1185.3,1187.36,Cordelia,along great. Don't you?
1201.19,1205.12,Giles,Seems like a lot of fuss
1201.19,1205.12,Giles,for one little title.
1205.19,1209.13,Buffy,Well. You know. It's no fun
1205.19,1209.13,Buffy,if you don't try your best.
1209.19,1212.69,Giles,As long as fun
1209.19,1212.69,Giles,is still in the mix.
1212.76,1213.89,Buffy,Sure.
1213.97,1216.76,Buffy,It's not like anyone takes it
1213.97,1216.76,Buffy,that seriously.
1227.85,1231.98,Lyrics,Well. I don't
1227.85,1231.98,Lyrics,wanna be president
1232.05,1235.92,Lyrics,Superman or Clark Kent
1235.99,1240.55,Lyrics,I don't wanna walk 'round
1235.99,1240.55,Lyrics,in their shoes
1243.06,1247.39,Lyrics,Cause I don't know
1243.06,1247.39,Lyrics,whose side I'm on
1247.47,1251.23,Lyrics,I don't know
1247.47,1251.23,Lyrics,my right from wrong
1251.3,1255.74,Lyrics,I don't know
1251.3,1255.74,Lyrics,where I'm going to
1258.81,1261.47,Lyrics,I don't know
1261.55,1263.21,Lyrics,About you
1263.28,1264.58,Lyrics,
1265.82,1269.31,Lyrics,I'll be the rain
1269.39,1272.52,Lyrics,Falling on
1269.39,1272.52,Lyrics,your fire escape
1272.59,1273.77,Buffy,Sorry.
1273.77,1274.75,Scott,Here.
1274.83,1277.69,Lyrics,I may not be the man
1274.83,1277.69,Lyrics,you want me to
1277.76,1279.92,Scott,I heard you were doing this.
1280,1282.9,Buffy,Uh... yeah. It's just something
1280,1282.9,Buffy,to pass the time.
1282.97,1284.43,Buffy,It's silly. Really.
1284.5,1285.94,Scott,I don't think so.
1288.02,1289.34,Scott,And for what it's worth.
1288.02,1289.34,Scott,you have my vote.
1289.41,1291.67,Buffy,I don't want you to feel...
1291.74,1292.83,Buffy,Thank you.
1292.91,1297.14,Lyrics,I don't wanna make you mad
1297.21,1301.28,Lyrics,I don't wanna meet your dad
1301.35,1305.25,Lyrics,I don't wanna be
1301.35,1305.25,Lyrics,your dreamcometrue
1305.32,1306.76,Lyrics,
1308.13,1312.39,Lyrics,Cause I don't know
1308.13,1312.39,Lyrics,just what I've found
1312.46,1316.16,Lyrics,I don't know my sky
1312.46,1316.16,Lyrics,from ground
1316.23,1320.67,Lyrics,I don't know
1316.23,1320.67,Lyrics,where I'm going to
1323.67,1326.51,Lyrics,I don't know
1326.58,1328.67,Lyrics,About you
1338.69,1339.71,Buffy,Hey.
1339.79,1342.19,Willow,Hi. How are you?
1339.79,1342.19,Willow,You good? You look good.
1342.26,1344.63,Willow,Anything new?
1342.26,1344.63,Willow,Hey. Did I mention you look good?
1344.7,1347.13,Buffy,Willow. It's OK that
1344.7,1347.13,Buffy,you're helping Cordelia.
1347.2,1350.6,Buffy,We're best friends.
1347.2,1350.6,Buffy,I'm not gonna hold it against you.
1350.67,1354.83,Willow,No. I'm not a friend.
1350.67,1354.83,Willow,I'm a rabid dog who should be shot.
1354.91,1358.81,Willow,But there are forces at work here...
1354.91,1358.81,Willow,dark. Incomprehensible forces.
1358.88,1361.04,Buffy,And I'm sure
1358.88,1361.04,Buffy,they're more important...
1361.11,1363.17,Buffy,than all we've been
1361.11,1363.17,Buffy,through together.
1363.25,1366.77,Buffy,or... the number of times
1363.25,1366.77,Buffy,that I've saved your life.
1366.85,1368.28,Willow,What do you want?
1368.35,1371.41,Buffy,Fifteen minutes alone on your computer
1368.35,1371.41,Buffy,with Cordelia's database.
1371.49,1372.79,Buffy,OK.
1372.86,1374.09,Buffy,Good. Ooh!
1374.16,1376.15,Buffy,I spoke to the limo people.
1374.16,1376.15,Buffy,and we're all set.
1376.23,1380.56,Buffy,They'll pick up Faith. Then me.
1376.23,1380.56,Buffy,then swing by and get you guys.
1380.63,1385.33,Buffy,Now. What's your database
1380.63,1385.33,Buffy,tell you about my weaknesses?
1388.44,1389.87,Buffy,You know. Jonathan.
1389.94,1393.88,Buffy,I've always felt a special bond
1389.94,1393.88,Buffy,between you and me.
1393.94,1396.38,Jonathon,Cordelia gave me six bucks.
1396.45,1399.35,Jonathon,That buys a whole lot
1396.45,1399.35,Jonathon,of cupcakes.
1399.42,1400.85,Cordelia,Are you kidding?
1400.92,1404.25,Cordelia,I've been doing the Vulcan
1400.92,1404.25,Cordelia,death grip since I was four.
1404.32,1406.55,Buffy,So you really are
1404.32,1406.55,Buffy,giving out money. Huh?
1406.62,1408.56,Cordelia,Is that any more tacky...
1408.63,1411.99,Cordelia,than your faux "I'm shy but deep"
1408.63,1411.99,Cordelia,campaign posters?
1412.06,1413.39,Buffy,Yes.
1413.46,1416.66,Cordelia,This whole trying to be like me
1413.46,1416.66,Cordelia,really isn't funny anymore.
1416.73,1420.86,Buffy,I was never trying to be like you.
1416.73,1420.86,Buffy,and when was it funny?
1420.94,1423.91,Cordelia,I don't see why your pathetic need to
1420.94,1423.91,Cordelia,recapture your glory days...
1423.97,1426.03,Cordelia,gives you the right
1423.97,1426.03,Cordelia,to splinter my vote.
1426.11,1429.2,Buffy,How can you think it's OK to talk
1426.11,1429.2,Buffy,to people like this?
1429.28,1430.65,Buffy,Do you have parents?
1430.71,1433.08,Cordelia,Yeah. Two of them...
1430.71,1433.08,Cordelia,unlike some people.
1433.15,1437.21,Buffy,Your brain isn't even connected
1433.15,1437.21,Buffy,to your mouth. Is it?
1437.29,1440.92,Cordelia,Why don't you do us both a favor
1437.29,1440.92,Cordelia,and stay out of my way?
1440.99,1443.89,Buffy,Don't... ever... do that again.
1443.96,1445.55,Cordelia,You're sick. You know that?
1445.63,1447.69,Xander,Let's not say something
1445.63,1447.69,Xander,we'll regret later.
1447.77,1448.87,Cordelia,You crazy freak!
1448.87,1449.7,Buffy,Vapid whore.
1449.77,1450.7,Xander,Like that.
1450.77,1451.47,Xander,Cordelia:
1451.47,1453.1,Cordelia,What did you call me?
1453.17,1457.13,Cordelia,This is just the worst thing
1453.17,1457.13,Cordelia,that's ever happened.
1457.21,1458.61,Cordelia,Ever!
1458.68,1460.11,Cordelia,I know. I know.
1460.18,1461.41,Willow,It's just...
1461.48,1463.91,Xander,when I look at you now.
1463.98,1466.11,Xander,it's like I'm seeing you
1463.98,1466.11,Xander,for the first time.
1466.18,1468.88,Willow,I'm talking about
1466.18,1468.88,Willow,Buffy and Cordelia.
1468.95,1470.61,Xander,Me too.
1470.69,1473.85,Willow,What are we gonna do?
1470.69,1473.85,Willow,We have to do something.
1473.92,1475.62,Willow,This is all our fault.
1475.69,1478.13,Willow,How do you get from chick fight
1475.69,1478.13,Willow,to our fault?
1478.2,1480.89,Willow,Because we felt so guilty
1478.2,1480.89,Willow,about the fluke.
1480.97,1482.43,Willow,we overcompensated
1480.97,1482.43,Willow,helping Cordelia.
1482.5,1485.7,Willow,and we spun the whole
1482.5,1485.7,Willow,group dynamic out of orbit.
1485.77,1489.03,Willow,and we're just a big meteor shower
1485.77,1489.03,Willow,heading for Earth...
1489.11,1490.4,Willow,OK. Calm down.
1490.47,1493.34,Willow,Let's just put our heads together
1490.47,1493.34,Willow,and think of something.
1493.41,1496.71,Willow,OK. One of us here
1493.41,1496.71,Willow,is pretty darn smart.
1496.78,1498.71,Willow,and I am...
1498.78,1500.22,Willow,just in hell.
1500.28,1503.15,Willow,I mean. I thought being
1500.28,1503.15,Willow,a senior at last...
1503.22,1507.18,Willow,and having a girlfriend
1503.22,1507.18,Willow,at last would be a good thing.
1507.26,1509.95,Willow,Why wouldn't that be
1507.26,1509.95,Willow,a good thing?
1510.03,1512.09,Willow,What?
1512.16,1514.6,Willow,Sometimes when
1512.16,1514.6,Willow,you're falling to pieces.
1514.67,1517.86,Willow,your mouth...
1514.67,1517.86,Willow,it just does the sweetest thing.
1522.37,1524.27,Willow,What are we gonna do?
1524.34,1527.11,Xander,We just have to get
1524.34,1527.11,Xander,the two of them communicating.
1527.18,1529.51,Willow,I'm talking about us.
1548.83,1549.95,Willow,
1550.03,1551.93,Buffy,What's going on here?
1552,1553.73,Buffy,Where's Faith?
1558.5,1559.9,Buffy,Dear Cordelia and Buffy.
1559.97,1562.2,Buffy,We won't be riding
1559.97,1562.2,Buffy,to the dance with you.
1562.27,1564.43,Buffy,We want you to work out
1562.27,1564.43,Buffy,your problems...
1564.51,1566.14,Buffy,because our friendships
1564.51,1566.14,Buffy,are more important...
1566.21,1567.87,Buffy,than who wins homecoming queen.
1567.95,1569.14,Buffy,Your friends.
1569.21,1572.65,Buffy,P.S. The limo was not cheap.
1569.21,1572.65,Buffy,Work it out."
1576.02,1577.42,Buffy,Well...
1580.02,1581.96,Buffy,They bought us corsages?
1582.03,1583.65,Cordelia,I took the orchid.
1585.03,1587,Buffy,OK.
1601.55,1604.17,Cordelia,Cordelia:
1601.55,1604.17,Cordelia,I don't see what the big deal is.
1604.25,1606.74,Buffy,I'm not making a big deal.
1606.82,1609.91,Buffy,You wanted the orchid.
1606.82,1609.91,Buffy,you got the orchid.
1609.99,1612.75,Cordelia,It goes with my complexion better.
1612.82,1615.31,Buffy,It does have that sallow tint.
1617.83,1619.8,Buffy,Finally we're here.
1619.86,1621.33,Buffy,
1632.02,1632.24,Cordelia,What is this?
1632.31,1636.37,Cordelia,OK. Guys. We've had enough
1632.31,1636.37,Cordelia,of your stupid little games!
1636.45,1639.28,Buffy,What's massively wrong
1636.45,1639.28,Buffy,with this picture?
1646.52,1647.96,Trick,Hello. Ladies.
1648.03,1650.26,Trick,Welcome to SlayerFest '98.
1650.33,1652.85,Trick,What is a SlayerFest. You ask?
1652.93,1654.69,Trick,Well. As in most of life.
1654.77,1657.26,Trick,there's the hunters
1654.77,1657.26,Trick,and the hunted.
1657.33,1660.27,Trick,Can you guess where you two fall?
1660.34,1664.1,Trick,From the beginning of this tape.
1660.34,1664.1,Trick,you have exactly 30 seconds...
1664.18,1666.91,Trick,no. That's 17 now...
1666.98,1670.11,Trick,to run for your lives.

1671.32,1672.78,Trick,Buffy...
1672.85,1674.78,Trick,have a nice death.
1678.56,1682.08,Cordelia,Hello!
1678.56,1682.08,Cordelia,How stupid are you people?
1682.16,1685.36,Cordelia,She's a slayer.
1682.16,1685.36,Cordelia,I'm a homecoming queen.
1685.43,1686.62,Cordelia,
1686.7,1687.63,Cordelia,
1697.91,1701.04,Lyrics,She flies
1697.91,1701.04,Lyrics,from a blinding light
1701.11,1705.24,Lyrics,And spirals to my heart
1705.32,1706.78,Faith,I try to find...
1706.85,1709.75,Faith,What are you two so mopey about?
1709.82,1711.88,Xander,We're not mopey.
1709.82,1711.88,Xander,We're groovin'.
1711.96,1713.82,Xander,On Oz's band.
1713.89,1715.88,Xander,He's a great guy. Oz.
1715.96,1718.86,Willow,He wrote this song for me.
1721.87,1723.89,Faith,Sleazebag!
1727.37,1730.07,Giles,We have to find Buffy.
1727.37,1730.07,Giles,Something terrible's happened.
1730.14,1732.77,Giles,Just kidding.
1730.14,1732.77,Giles,Thought I'd give you a scare.
1733.88,1735.81,Giles,Are those finger sandwiches?
1744.89,1746.32,Cordelia,I have an idea.
1746.39,1748.15,Cordelia,We talk to these people.
1748.23,1751.82,Cordelia,we explain that I'm not a slayer
1748.23,1751.82,Cordelia,and they let me go.
1751.9,1753.09,Cordelia,Look out!
1754.97,1755.99,Buffy,Get down!
1764.41,1765.93,Buffy,That's gotta smart.
1768.02,1769.5,Buffy,Now. I can let you out of that.
1768.02,1769.5,Buffy,or I can put a bullet in your head.
1769.58,1773.48,Buffy,How many are there in this little game.
1769.58,1773.48,Buffy,and what are they packing?
1773.55,1775.68,Jungle Bob,There's me.
1775.75,1779.25,Jungle Bob,two Germans with AR15s
1775.75,1779.25,Jungle Bob,and grenade launcher...
1779.32,1781.55,Jungle Bob,yellowskinned demon
1779.32,1781.55,Jungle Bob,with long knives...
1781.63,1784.12,Jungle Bob,vampire couple
1781.63,1784.12,Jungle Bob,from Texas named Gorch.
1784.2,1785.56,Buffy,That everybody?
1785.63,1786.82,Jungle Bob,Everybody who's out here.
1786.9,1788.09,Jungle Bob,Germans are wired.
1788.17,1790.07,Jungle Bob,Their boss is tracking
1788.17,1790.07,Jungle Bob,them on computer.
1790.13,1791.76,Jungle Bob,Now get me out of this!
1791.84,1796.4,Cordelia,Could I ask an eensy favor? Could you
1791.84,1796.4,Cordelia,just tell your friends that I'm not...
1802.88,1804.71,Faith,Scott?
1802.88,1804.71,Faith,There you are. Honey.
1804.78,1806.11,Faith,Hey. Good news.
1806.18,1808.17,Faith,The doctor says that the itching
1806.18,1808.17,Faith,and the swelling...
1808.25,1810.24,Faith,and the burning should clear up.
1810.32,1812.29,Faith,but we got to keep
1810.32,1812.29,Faith,using the ointment.
1812.36,1813.79,Faith,Hi.
1815.43,1816.86,Scott,Uh...
1822.4,1825.13,Giles,I suspect the finger food contains...
1825.2,1827.1,Giles,actual fingers.
1827.17,1830.83,Giles,I think I'll retreat to the library
1827.17,1830.83,Giles,until the coronation.
1830.91,1833.47,Giles,I want to be here when Buffy...
1833.54,1836.14,Giles,Well. However the thing
1833.54,1836.14,Giles,turns out for her.
1836.21,1839.58,Giles,And that was a very fine thing
1836.21,1839.58,Giles,you two did.
1839.65,1840.96,Giles,putting Buffy and
1840.96,1842.35,Lyrics,Cordelia together.
1846.69,1849.28,Willow,We did one fine thing.
1849.36,1851.85,Xander,Yeah. They've been gone
1849.36,1851.85,Xander,for a while.
1851.93,1854.36,Xander,They must really be
1851.93,1854.36,Xander,getting into it.
1859.3,1862.2,Buffy,We should be safe
1859.3,1862.2,Buffy,in here for a while.
1862.27,1864.71,Buffy,You need to find a weapon.
1864.78,1868.47,Cordelia,Safe? I'm not safe.
1864.78,1868.47,Cordelia,I'm gonna die.
1873.88,1876.82,Buffy,Yeah. You are
1873.88,1876.82,Buffy,if you just stand there.
1876.89,1879.82,Cordelia,I'm never gonna be crowned
1876.89,1879.82,Cordelia,homecoming queen.
1879.89,1882.36,Cordelia,I'm never gonna graduate
1879.89,1882.36,Cordelia,from high school.
1882.43,1885.19,Cordelia,I'm never gonna know
1882.43,1885.19,Cordelia,if it's real between me and Xander.
1885.26,1888.23,Cordelia,or if it's just...
1885.26,1888.23,Cordelia,some temporary insanity...
1888.3,1892.24,Cordelia,that made me think...
1888.3,1892.24,Cordelia,I loved him.
1892.3,1896.61,Cordelia,And now I'm never gonna
1892.3,1896.61,Cordelia,get the chance to tell him.
1896.75,1898.51,Buffy,Yes. You are.
1898.58,1900.11,Buffy,We are gonna get out of here.
1900.18,1901.78,Buffy,and we are gonna head back
1900.18,1901.78,Buffy,to the library.
1901.85,1903.44,Buffy,where Giles and the rest
1901.85,1903.44,Buffy,of the weapons live.
1903.52,1905.12,Buffy,Then I'm gonna take out the rest
1905.12,1905.92,Cordelia,of these guys...
1905.99,1908.29,Cordelia,just in time for you
1905.99,1908.29,Cordelia,to congratulate me...
1908.36,1910.66,Cordelia,on my sweeping victory
1908.36,1910.66,Cordelia,as homecoming queen.
1910.73,1913.25,Cordelia,I know what you're up to.
1913.33,1916.66,Cordelia,You think if you get me mad enough.
1913.33,1916.66,Cordelia,I won't be so scared.
1916.73,1918.22,Cordelia,And. Hey...
1918.3,1919.73,Cordelia,it's working!
1919.8,1921.79,Cordelia,Where's a damn weapon?
1925.24,1927.68,Buffy,You really love Xander?
1927.74,1930.18,Cordelia,Well. He kind of
1927.74,1930.18,Cordelia,grows on you. Like...
1930.25,1931.68,Cordelia,a Chia Pet.
1933.52,1934.95,Buffy,That's it?
1935.02,1937.45,Cordelia,Just this and a telephone.
1937.52,1938.95,Cordelia,A telephone.
1939.02,1941.58,Buffy,And you didn't think
1939.02,1941.58,Buffy,that'd be helpful?
1941.66,1944.68,Cordelia,No. This is better for...
1944.76,1946.19,Cordelia,Oh.
1948.77,1952.53,Boss,You're about to see why Daniel Boone
1948.77,1952.53,Boss,and that idiot demon...
1952.6,1954.57,Boss,are creatures of the past...
1954.64,1957.16,Boss,and why I am the future.
1957.24,1959.14,Boss,I'm picking up a signal.
1960.21,1961.8,Boss,They've got a phone!
1961.88,1965.81,Buffy,If you get this message. Giles.
1961.88,1965.81,Buffy,get help and get out here...
1965.88,1967.35,Buffy,Hello?
1967.42,1969.04,Cordelia,What happened?
1969.12,1970.71,Buffy,It went dead.
1975.66,1978.39,Kulak,Want me to cut that leg off?
1978.46,1979.86,Jungle Bob,No. Thanks.
1984.6,1985.09,Jungle Bob,Old Man:
1985.09,1987.43,Boss,Continue proceeding south 90 meters...
1987.5,1989.2,Boss,to vector three.
1998.65,2001.17,Buffy,Buffy. On Answering Machine:
1998.65,2001.17,Buffy,Giles. It's me... and Cordelia.
2001.25,2004.78,Buffy,We're in a cabin in Miller's Woods.
2001.25,2004.78,Buffy,and we're in big trouble.
2007.09,2009.42,Cordelia,Why is it every time
2007.09,2009.42,Cordelia,I go somewhere with you.
2009.49,2011.69,Cordelia,it always ends
2009.49,2011.69,Cordelia,in violence and terror?
2011.76,2013.7,Buffy,Welcome to my life.
2013.76,2016.26,Cordelia,I don't want to be in your life.
2016.26,2018.13,Buffy,I want to be in my life.
2018.2,2019.63,Buffy,Well. There's the door.
2019.7,2023.87,Buffy,Please feel free to walk out
2019.7,2023.87,Buffy,at any time and live your life.
2023.94,2026.34,Cordelia,All I wanted was
2023.94,2026.34,Cordelia,to be homecoming queen.
2026.41,2029.81,Buffy,And that's all I wanted.
2026.41,2029.81,Buffy,too. Cordelia.
2031.21,2033.88,Buffy,I spent a year's allowance
2031.21,2033.88,Buffy,on this dress.
2033.95,2036.65,Cordelia,I don't even get why
2033.95,2036.65,Cordelia,you care about homecoming...
2036.72,2038.69,Cordelia,when you're doing stuff like this.
2040.72,2043.19,Buffy,Because this is all I do.
2043.26,2045.75,Buffy,This is what my life is.
2051.23,2053.5,Buffy,You couldn't understand.
2055.74,2059.57,Buffy,I just thought...
2055.74,2059.57,Buffy,homecoming queen.
2059.64,2063.27,Buffy,I could pick up
2059.64,2063.27,Buffy,a yearbook someday and say.
2063.35,2064.78,Buffy,I was there."
2064.85,2066.61,Buffy,I went to high school.
2066.68,2068.12,Buffy,I had friends.
2068.18,2069.62,Buffy,And for one moment.
2069.69,2072.62,Buffy,I got to live in the world.
2072.69,2075.52,Buffy,And there'd be proof...
2077.53,2079.5,Buffy,proof... that I was chosen...
2079.56,2081.5,Buffy,for something other than this.
2085.7,2087.14,Buffy,Besides...
2087.2,2089.47,Buffy,I look cute in a tiara.
2090.54,2091.87,Cordelia,Do you hear...
2091.94,2093.14,Cordelia,Aah!
2094.21,2095.68,Cordelia,
2104.15,2105.88,Buffy,Cor. The gun!
2105.96,2107.15,Buffy,Ooh!
2116.73,2118.33,Buffy,Cordelia. The spatula.
2121.04,2122.9,Boss,Prepare to launch.
2122.97,2124.56,Boss,
2128.55,2131.64,Boss,Old Man:
2128.55,2131.64,Boss,Target's in range. Ready your weapon.
2131.71,2135.24,Boss,Y" access 53 degrees west
2131.71,2135.24,Boss,by eight degrees south.
2135.32,2136.62,Cordelia,Buffy!
2138.69,2139.62,Cordelia,
2142.93,2143.95,Boss,Launch!
2153.24,2154.33,Boss,Aah!
2163.85,2165.28,Boss,
2166.62,2169.35,Buffy,We got to get back
2166.62,2169.35,Buffy,to the library.
2183.73,2184.67,Lyle,Easy. Darlin'.
2184.73,2186.67,Lyle,These things go through you...
2186.74,2188.73,Lyle,faster than Grandpa Pete's chili.
2188.81,2190.57,Candy,I want to do Buffy...
2190.64,2193.73,Candy,My weddin' present for what happened
2190.64,2193.73,Candy,to your poor brother.
2193.81,2194.54,Lyle,Tector.
2194.54,2196.4,Candy,When's she comin'?
2196.48,2197.95,Lyle,He's her watcher.
2198.01,2199.95,Boss,She'll show... just as soon...
2200.02,2205.02,Boss,as she gets rid of some
2200.02,2205.02,Boss,of our competition.
2208.59,2211.15,Boss,They're heading west.
2208.59,2211.15,Boss,back into town.
2211.23,2212.79,Trick,They got away?
2212.86,2214.33,Boss,Temporarily.
2214.4,2218.66,Trick,Well. Give it up for the slayers.
2214.4,2218.66,Trick,They got character.
2220.44,2221.96,Trick,
2223.74,2225.71,Trick,I'll take care of it.
2230.32,2233.31,Trick,Evening. Gentlemen.
2230.32,2233.31,Trick,How may I help you?
2233.39,2236.82,Trick,Excuse me.
2233.39,2236.82,Trick,anybody got a warrant here?
2238.19,2240.28,Buffy,Jungle Bob and spikehead
2238.19,2240.28,Buffy,are down and out.
2240.36,2242.95,Buffy,We've lost the Germans twice.
2240.36,2242.95,Buffy,but they seem to keep finding us.
2243.03,2245.69,Buffy,If we take them out and the Gorches.
2243.03,2245.69,Buffy,we can still make homecoming.
2245.76,2248.36,Cordelia,Those animals! Hunting us down
2245.76,2248.36,Cordelia,like poor defenseless...
2248.43,2250.03,Cordelia,well. Animals.
2252.2,2254.2,Buffy,We just need to find Giles...
2252.2,2254.2,Buffy,Ooh!
2262.91,2263.85,Cordelia,Buffy!
2265.42,2266.58,Cordelia,Unh!
2271.72,2273.02,Lyle,Candy!
2276.26,2277.69,Lyle,Oh. Candy.
2277.76,2280.32,Lyle,I'm gonna kill
2277.76,2280.32,Lyle,both of you slayers for this!
2280.4,2280.97,Lyle,Hear me?
2280.97,2283.09,Cordelia,I hear you. You redneck moron.
2283.17,2284.86,Cordelia,You got a dress
2283.17,2284.86,Cordelia,that goes with that hat?
2284.94,2286.03,Lyle,I'm gonna...
2286.1,2288.16,Cordelia,Rip out my innards.
2286.1,2288.16,Cordelia,play with my eyeballs.
2288.24,2290.27,Cordelia,boil my brain
2288.24,2290.27,Cordelia,and eat it for brunch?
2290.34,2292.28,Cordelia,Listen up. Needlebrain.
2292.34,2293.78,Cordelia,Buffy and I have taken out
2292.34,2293.78,Cordelia,four of your cronies.
2293.85,2295.37,Cordelia,not to mention your girlfriend.
2295.45,2296.09,Lyle,Wife!
2296.09,2297.24,Cordelia,Whatever.
2297.32,2299.84,Cordelia,The point is.
2297.32,2299.84,Cordelia,I haven't even broken a sweat.
2299.92,2302.35,Cordelia,See. In the end.
2299.92,2302.35,Cordelia,Buffy's just the runnerup.
2302.42,2303.85,Cordelia,I'm the queen.
2303.92,2307.72,Cordelia,You get me mad.
2303.92,2307.72,Cordelia,what do you think I'm gonna do to you?
2312.7,2314.29,Lyle,Later.
2323.61,2326.98,Buffy,That should teach him
2323.61,2326.98,Buffy,to mistake you for a slayer.
2327.05,2329.21,Giles,I must admit I do feel
2327.05,2329.21,Giles,partly responsible.
2329.28,2331.41,Giles,I did give your friends
2329.28,2331.41,Giles,tacit approval...
2331.48,2333.58,Giles,to make the switch
2331.48,2333.58,Giles,in the limousine.
2333.65,2336.09,Buffy,Aw. It's OK.
2333.65,2336.09,Buffy,It gave Cor and I a chance...
2336.15,2338.05,Buffy,to spend some quality death time.
2338.12,2340.75,Cordelia,And we got these free corsages.
2340.83,2342.66,Giles,That's nice...
2342.73,2345.42,Giles,although I don't recall
2342.73,2345.42,Giles,them mentioning corsages.
2345.5,2348.36,Buffy,Jungle Bob said
2345.5,2348.36,Buffy,that the Germans...
2348.43,2351.33,Buffy,were hooked into
2348.43,2351.33,Buffy,a computer system.
2354.24,2356.54,Buffy,And they're hooked into us.
2356.61,2357.7,Buffy,
2362.01,2364.17,Cordelia,Oh. God.
2362.01,2364.17,Cordelia,get rid of these things!
2364.25,2366.18,Buffy,I need some wet toilet paper.
2366.25,2367.72,Cordelia,Yeah. That'll help.
2372.52,2374.25,Boss,Old Man:
2372.52,2374.25,Boss,Transmitting coordinates now.
2376.63,2378.06,Boss,They're 50 feet away.
2390.61,2393.41,Boss,Old Man:
2390.61,2393.41,Boss,Axis six degrees by 43.
2394.55,2396.38,Boss,I have them both in range.
2401.15,2404.68,Boss,I have the targets together
2401.15,2404.68,Boss,at 20 feet north and stationary.
2404.76,2406.45,Boss,Final position is locked.
2406.52,2408.29,Boss,Fire when ready.
2413.33,2416.1,Boss,Both targets seven degrees by 35.
2420.14,2424.02,Boss,Adjust right ten degrees.
2422.07,2423.87,Boss,Fire! Fire!
2439.76,2441.09,Boss,I won.
2441.16,2442.46,Boss,
2442.53,2443.82,Boss,
2455.27,2457.21,Mayor Wilkins,Hello!
2455.27,2457.21,Mayor Wilkins,Nice to meet you.
2457.28,2462.02,Trick,Hi. It's a pleasure.
2457.28,2462.02,Trick,Where am I?
2460.08,2462.51,Mayor Wilkins,In my office.
2460.08,2462.51,Mayor Wilkins,I'm Richard Wilkins.
2462.58,2464.51,Mayor Wilkins,I'm the mayor of Sunnydale.
2464.58,2466.21,Mayor Wilkins,and you're... Mr. Trick.
2466.28,2467.88,Mayor Wilkins,Please. Sit down.
2470.22,2472.88,Mayor Wilkins,That's an exciting suit.
2472.96,2475.89,Trick,Well. Clothes make the man.
2475.96,2478.29,Mayor Wilkins,Well. As I understand it.
2478.36,2480.73,Mayor Wilkins,you're not a man... exactly.
2480.8,2484.53,Mayor Wilkins,Mr. Trick. I've been the mayor
2480.8,2484.53,Mayor Wilkins,for quite some time.
2484.6,2486.73,Mayor Wilkins,I like things to run smoothly.
2486.81,2488.98,Mayor Wilkins,This is a very important year
2488.98,2489.5,Trick,for me.
2489.57,2490.7,Trick,Election year.
2490.78,2492.47,Mayor Wilkins,Something like that.
2492.54,2493.57,Mayor Wilkins,If this is the point
2493.57,2494.6,Trick,where you tell me...
2494.68,2496.74,Trick,that I don't fit in here
2494.68,2496.74,Trick,in your quiet little neighborhood.
2496.82,2498.84,Trick,you can just skip it
2496.82,2498.84,Trick,cause. See.
2498.92,2501.08,Trick,that all got old long
2498.92,2501.08,Trick,before I became a vampire.
2501.15,2503.05,Trick,Do you know what I'm saying?
2503.12,2504.65,Mayor Wilkins,Do you have children?
2505.76,2508.82,Mayor Wilkins,Children are the heart
2505.76,2508.82,Mayor Wilkins,of a community.
2508.89,2511.86,Mayor Wilkins,They need to be looked after...
2508.89,2511.86,Mayor Wilkins,controlled.
2511.93,2515.89,Mayor Wilkins,The more rebellious element
2511.93,2515.89,Mayor Wilkins,needs to be dealt with.
2515.97,2517.94,Mayor Wilkins,The children are our future.
2520.02,2519.9,Mayor Wilkins,We need them.
2519.97,2521.87,Trick,I need them.
2521.94,2525.54,Trick,If this rebellious element
2521.94,2525.54,Trick,means who I think it does.
2525.61,2529.21,Trick,then that problem may be
2525.61,2529.21,Trick,taken care of this very night.
2529.28,2530.71,Mayor Wilkins,So I've heard.
2530.78,2533.58,Mayor Wilkins,That's a very enterprising idea
2530.78,2533.58,Mayor Wilkins,you have... SlayerFest.
2533.65,2536.42,Mayor Wilkins,I love that name. By the way.
2536.49,2540.86,Mayor Wilkins,You see. That's the kind
2536.49,2540.86,Mayor Wilkins,of initiative I need on my team.
2540.93,2543.02,Trick,What if I don't want to be
2540.93,2543.02,Trick,a part of the team?
2543.09,2546.03,Mayor Wilkins,Oh. No. That won't be an issue.
2548.03,2551.47,Mayor Wilkins,See. You and I are gonna
2548.03,2551.47,Mayor Wilkins,get along very well.

2581.47,2583.4,Buffy,mess with Cordelia.
