2.21,4.54,GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
4.54,5.84,MONK,We had to hide the Key.
5.93,9.4,MONK,Made it human and sent it to you.
9.49,11.33,BUFFY VOICEOVER,Dawn? Did you know your sister took
11.33,13.17,GLORY,my Key? And she won't give it back.
13.25,15,GLORY,I bet you know where she put it.
15,15.93,BUFFY,She doesn't know.
16.01,18.97,BUFFY,"OK, let's see who you are."
19.61,23.24,ORLANDO,"The Knights of Byzantium, an ancient order."
19.61,23.24,ORLANDO,And now your enemy.
23.33,26.8,ORLANDO,"So long as you protect the Key,"
23.33,26.8,ORLANDO,the brotherhood will never stop
26.89,29.17,ORLANDO,until we destroy it and you.
29.25,31.89,SPIKE,Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
31.97,33.86,RILEY VOICEOVER,Because you are.
33.86,34.69,SPIKE,Well...
34.77,35.76,SPIKE,yeah.
35.85,38.14,BUFFY,Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
38.14,39.29,QUINTON TRAVERS,Glory isn't a demon.
39.37,40.45,BUFFY,What is she?
40.45,41.52,TRAVERS,She's a god.
43.37,47.65,BUFFY,Mom wants to make with the merry tomorrow
43.37,47.65,BUFFY,"night, but with everything that's going on..."
47.73,52.57,WILLOW,This is exactly what you need:
47.73,52.57,WILLOW,"a 20thbirthday party with presents,"
52.65,55.85,WILLOW,"and funny hats,"
52.65,55.85,WILLOW,and those candles that don't blow out.
55.93,57.33,WILLOW,Those used to scare me.
57.33,57.76,TARA,Me too.
57.85,58.95,XANDER,I don't think this is
58.95,60.77,BUFFY,the best time for the party pinata.
60.85,63.13,BUFFY,We need to stay focused to stop Glory.
63.21,67.17,XANDER,"We're goin' up against a god,"
63.21,67.17,XANDER,an actual mightierthanthou god.
67.25,68.87,WILLOW,"Well, the bigger they are..."
68.87,71.13,ANYA,The faster they stomp you into nothing.
72.65,76.33,BUFFY,She's right. I've thrown everything I've got
72.65,76.33,BUFFY,at her. She just shrugs it off.
76.41,78.75,WILLOW,Then find something heavier to throw.
78.75,80.77,GILES,That might pose some difficulty.
80.85,84.73,GILES,From what the Council's discovered
80.85,84.73,GILES,"from the Book of Tarnis and other sources,"
84.81,86.96,GILES,Glory and two fellow Hell gods
87.05,90.84,GILES,ruled over one of the more seriously
87.05,90.84,GILES,unpleasant demon dimensions.
90.93,92.32,TARA,There's more than one?
92.32,94.53,ANYA,There are thousands. All different.
94.61,97.45,GILES,"All pushing at our reality,"
94.61,97.45,GILES,trying to find a way in.
97.53,100.25,BUFFY,I guess Glory found one.
97.53,100.25,BUFFY,"The question is, why?"
100.33,106.33,GILES,There's nothing to indicate that here. Just
100.33,106.33,GILES,vague references to chaos and destruction.
106.41,108.54,GILES,"OK, so we know where Glory's from."
108.54,110.17,BUFFY,What do we know about her?
110.25,113.56,BUFFY,"She's tough,"
110.25,113.56,BUFFY,"but no bolts of lightning, no blasts of fire."
113.65,115.66,BUFFY,Shouldn't a god be able to do that?
115.66,116.41,GILES,"Usually, yes."
116.49,120.28,GILES,But being in human form must
116.49,120.28,GILES,be severely limiting her powers.
120.37,124.65,GILES,"No, all we have to worry about right now"
120.37,124.65,GILES,"is she's immortal, invulnerable and insane."
124.73,129.09,XANDER,A crazy Hell god?
124.73,129.09,XANDER,And the fun just keeps on leavin'.
129.17,131.86,XANDER,"From what I can gather, her living in this"
131.86,134.81,GILES,world is seriously affecting her mental state.
135.01,139.13,GILES,She's only been able to keep her mind
135.01,139.13,GILES,intact by extracting energy from us.
139.21,141.49,TARA,"Well, from the human brain."
141.57,143.53,TARA,She's a brainsucker?
143.61,149.21,GILES,She "absorbs the energies that bind
143.61,149.21,GILES,the human mind into a cohesive whole."
149.29,151.36,GILES,"Once drained, all that's left is..."
151.36,152.13,BUFFY,Crazy people.
152.21,159.02,GILES,Which is why there's been an increase in the
152.21,159.02,GILES,ranks of the mentally unstable in Sunnydale.
157.09,159.45,TARA,At least vampires just kill you.
159.53,161.52,BUFFY,We have to find a way to stop her.
161.61,164.73,WILLOW,"Well, Tara and I can work"
161.61,164.73,WILLOW,on some tactical spells.
164.81,169.36,ANYA,I can do some research. I know way more
164.81,169.36,ANYA,about demon dimensions than Giles does.
170.49,171.93,ANYA,"Well, I do."
172.01,176.85,XANDER,"This is great longtermplanny stuff, but what"
172.01,176.85,XANDER,about this Key thingy Glory's lookin' for?
176.93,179.93,TARA,Yeah. Shouldn't we try
176.93,179.93,TARA,to find it before she does?
180.01,182.13,BUFFY,I don't think we should worry about that.
182.21,186.25,WILLOW,They've got a point. Whatever Glory's
182.21,186.25,WILLOW,"planning on opening with the Key,"
186.33,189.33,WILLOW,I'm guessing it won't be filled
186.33,189.33,WILLOW,with candy and flowers.
189.65,194.57,XANDER,So where should we look? Do we know
189.65,194.57,XANDER,where it used to be kept? Who saw it last?
194.65,196.72,BUFFY,We did. Giles and me.
197.17,198.93,BUFFY,We know where it is.
199.17,199.82,XANDER,You what?
199.82,202.21,WILLOW,"You know, and you didn't tell us?"
203.25,207.02,GILES,There were reasons.
205.09,208.72,BUFFY,"Look, if Glory knew that"
205.09,208.72,BUFFY,you guys knew where it was...
208.81,211.09,BUFFY,I didn't wanna put you in that kind of danger.
211.17,214.29,XANDER,As opposed to the other kind
211.17,214.29,XANDER,we're always in?
214.37,216.18,WILLOW,You should've said something.
216.18,217.05,BUFFY,"Will, there..."
221.69,223.68,BUFFY,You're right.
226.01,227.04,BUFFY,It's time.
227.04,228.37,GILES,Are you sure?
229.73,232.41,BUFFY,They'll be risking their lives.
229.73,232.41,BUFFY,They deserve to know.
232.49,235.09,XANDER,Know what?
237.57,241.25,BUFFY,There's something that you
237.57,241.25,BUFFY,need to know... about Dawn.
242.25,246.09,ORLANDO,The link must be severed.
242.25,246.09,ORLANDO,Such is the will of God.
246.17,251.2,ORLANDO,The Key is the link. The link must be severed.
246.17,251.2,ORLANDO,Such is the will of God.
251.29,255.61,ORLANDO,The Key is the link. The link must be severed.
251.29,255.61,ORLANDO,Such is the will of God.
255.69,258.61,JINX,You really think He is going to help you?
258.69,262.16,JINX,I fear your faith is gravely misplaced.
266.02,270.07,JINX,Advertise your product or brand here
266.02,270.07,JINX,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
291.05,293.36,ORLANDO,Shall we test your faith now?
298.33,301.05,GLORY,Never send a minion to do a god's work.
316.85,318.84,GLORY,"Hey, nice sword."
320.13,321.73,GLORY,Bet it hurts.
385.41,387.11,DAWN,You guys doin' a spell?
387.11,387.85,WILLOW,"Dawn, hey."
387.93,390.61,WILLOW,"Yeah, we're doing"
387.93,390.61,WILLOW,an earlywarning incantation.
390.69,394.29,WILLOW,If anything Hellgodishly powerful
390.69,394.29,WILLOW,"comes within 100ft of the shop,"
394.37,398.37,WILLOW,then screechy siren things
394.37,398.37,WILLOW,"will, you know, screech."
398.45,401.84,TARA,This should give us a headsup
398.45,401.84,TARA,so we can hide the... Key.
402.45,404.76,WILLOW,We already put one up around your house.
404.93,406.92,DAWN,Cool. Can I help?
407.57,412.77,WILLOW,I don't think Buffy would like the black arts
407.57,412.77,WILLOW,bumpin' auras with the littlest Summers.
414.45,416.89,DAWN,Yeah. Whatever.
418.17,420.29,TARA,How can she not be real?
420.37,423.84,WILLOW,She's real. She's just kinda... new.
428.85,431.13,DAWN,Hey. We on the case?
431.21,436.02,XANDER,"Yeah. Right on top, perched, ready for action."
434.77,437.73,XANDER,How's my sweet fancy Dawn doin'?
437.81,441.02,DAWN,Fine.
439.09,441.97,DAWN,What's up with you?
439.09,441.97,DAWN,Did you get into the sugar again?
442.45,444.73,ANYA,You make a very pretty little girl.
446.13,448.43,XANDER,"Anya, you wanna help me with that thing?"
448.43,450.33,ANYA,Xander needs help with his thing!
454.85,458.48,GILES,I'm not sure our regular workout
454.85,458.48,GILES,is challenging you any more.
458.57,460.52,GILES,Perhaps we should make it harder.
460.52,462.53,BUFFY,You always think harder is better.
462.61,466.89,BUFFY,Maybe next time I patrol I should carry a load
462.61,466.89,BUFFY,of bricks and use a stake made of butter.
466.97,471.76,GILES,Very amusing. I'm sure Dawn feels
466.97,471.76,GILES,that way about her schoolwork sometimes.
471.85,474.21,BUFFY,That true? How was school today?
474.29,478.29,DAWN,The usual: big square building
474.29,478.29,DAWN,filled with boredom and despair.
478.37,483.37,BUFFY,Just how I remember it.
478.37,483.37,BUFFY,"So, what's the homework sitch?"
483.45,487.53,DAWN,We imagine what we'll be like in ten years
483.45,487.53,DAWN,and write a letter to our future self.
487.61,490.21,DAWN,The teacher's so out of ideas. Wanna help?
490.29,493.33,BUFFY,Maybe later.
490.29,493.33,BUFFY,I have some stuff I have to do first.
493.41,496.02,DAWN,About the weird girl that came to the house?
496.02,497.45,BUFFY,"Glory. And no, it's not."
498.13,501.68,DAWN,Like you'd tell me anyway.
498.13,501.68,DAWN,Dawn's too young and too delicate.
501.77,504.24,BUFFY,"Right. A young, delicate pain in my butt."
504.33,509.69,DAWN,I think you're freakin' out cos you have to
504.33,509.69,DAWN,"fight someone prettier. That's the case, right?"
511.53,516.21,BUFFY,Glory is evil and powerful.
511.53,516.21,BUFFY,And in no way prettier than me.
516.29,520.68,DAWN,I think you're getting soft in your advanced
516.29,520.68,DAWN,age. She didn't look that tough to me.
521.01,523.57,Cut to,OK. One more time.
523.65,526.69,GLORY,"Just between me and you,"
526.77,530.08,GLORY,our itsybitsy little secret.
532.61,535.76,GLORY,Where is the Key?
535.85,539.08,ORLANDO,"Even if I knew, I'd die"
535.85,539.08,ORLANDO,a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.
539.17,542.09,GLORY,"Well, you won't need a thousand, sweetie."
542.17,545.21,GLORY,I'll make the first one last. Long time.
548.61,551.08,GLORY,What is it with you religious types?
555.09,559.02,GLORY,"It's intimacy, isn't it?"
558.37,561.13,GLORY,You're just scared of letting someone in!
563.05,564.61,GLORY,It's OK.
564.69,567.33,GLORY,I know how difficult the first time can be.
568.89,573.02,GLORY,You don't have to be afraid.
571.09,573.73,GLORY,Just relax.
573.81,576.28,GLORY,You may not have the info I want...
578.09,583.02,GLORY,but you still got somethin' I need.
591.17,591.91,BUFFY VOICEOVER,Prezzies!
591.91,594.05,WILLOW,See? Just what you needed.
594.13,597.13,BUFFY,"You are very, very wise."
594.13,597.13,BUFFY,"Now gimme, gimme, gimme."
598.89,601.53,ANYA,This is extremely suspenseful.
601.61,603.57,ANYA,I want the presents.
604.97,606.96,BUFFY,"It's beautiful. Thank you, guys."
607.05,609.69,TARA,We thought you'd get
607.05,609.69,TARA,crossbows and killy stuff.
609.77,612.05,WILLOW,"So we figured, less killy, more frilly."
615.05,618.97,ANYA,It's just so lovely!
615.05,618.97,ANYA,"Oh, I wish it was mine!"
621.49,623.88,ANYA,Like you weren't all thinking the same thing.
623.97,627.12,GILES,I'm fairly certain I wasn't.
623.97,627.12,GILES,I've got one just like it.
627.21,629.17,DAWN,Here. Open mine.
629.89,632.93,BUFFY,"It's not gonna explode, is it?"
634.89,637.93,DAWN,It's when we visited Dad
634.89,637.93,DAWN,that summer in San Diego.
639.17,643.8,DAWN,I put the shells on it myself.
639.17,643.8,DAWN,We picked them off the beach.
645.65,647.37,BUFFY,I remember.
652.97,655.61,DAWN,"Well, jeez, don't get all movieoftheweek."
656.21,659.21,DAWN,I was just too cheap
656.21,659.21,DAWN,to buy you a real present.
660.77,662.76,BUFFY,Thank you.
669.85,676.02,JOYCE,It still seems there's a lot you don't know
669.85,676.02,JOYCE,"about this. I mean, is she dangerous?"
674.09,675.05,BUFFY,No.
675.13,679.13,GILES,I assume you're talking about her existence
675.13,679.13,GILES,rather than her intentions?
679.21,680.57,JOYCE,Exactly.
680.65,684.81,BUFFY,Dawn? What are you doing in there?
680.65,684.81,BUFFY,Party getting slow?
686.05,688.17,DAWN,We need plates. It's cake time.
699.21,701.97,DAWN,Why does everybody act
699.21,701.97,DAWN,all weird when I'm around?
702.05,704.25,XANDER,Me? Me not weird.
705.49,708.37,DAWN,I'm not an idiot.
705.49,708.37,DAWN,I know you're talking about me.
708.45,710.43,XANDER,"No. No, we really weren't."
710.43,712.41,ANYA,We were talking about sex.
712.49,714.96,DAWN,"They were talking about me, like everybody."
715.05,717.33,XANDER,"Again, not so much. In fact, none."
717.41,721.73,ANYA,We were talking about sex. You know us 
717.41,721.73,ANYA,sometimes we like to pretend stuff.
721.81,722.25,XANDER,Anya...
722.25,724.81,ANYA,"Like, there's a fireman, or a shepherd..."
724.89,727.93,BUFFY,You know what? Let's not have
724.89,727.93,BUFFY,this exchange of images now.
728.17,731.56,DAWN,"Oh, right. Of course."
728.17,731.56,DAWN,Can't let Dawn hear anything.
732.21,737.53,DAWN,"Fine. I'm just gonna go to bed. That way,"
732.21,737.53,DAWN,I won't accidentally get exposed to... words.
743.45,744.65,WILLOW,Cake?
779.37,780.92,DAWN,Jeez! Lurk much?
780.92,782.57,SPIKE,I wasn't lurkin'.
782.65,785.33,SPIKE,I was standin' about.
782.65,785.33,SPIKE,It's a whole different vibe.
785.81,787.8,DAWN,What is...
789.89,792.81,DAWN,Are you giving Buffy a birthday present?
792.89,796.49,DAWN,"Oh, my God. Weird."
792.89,796.49,DAWN,And chocolates? Lame.
796.57,801.57,DAWN,"And the box is all bent. And, well, you know"
796.57,801.57,DAWN,she'd never touch anything from you anyway.
802.45,805.29,SPIKE,Shouldn't you be tucked away
802.45,805.29,SPIKE,in your beddybye?
805.37,808.73,SPIKE,All warm and safe
805.37,808.73,SPIKE,where nothing can eat you?
809.69,812.61,DAWN,Is that supposed to scare me?
812.69,814.5,SPIKE,Little tremble wouldn't hurt.
814.5,815.69,DAWN,"Sorry, it's just..."
816.57,819.17,DAWN,"Come on, I'm badder than you."
819.25,820.48,SPIKE,Are not!
820.48,821.56,DAWN,Am too.
821.65,825.09,DAWN,You're in the bushes hugging
821.65,825.09,DAWN,"a bent box of chocolates, and I'm..."
825.17,828.93,SPIKE,What? Sneaking out to braid hair
825.17,828.93,SPIKE,and watch Teletubbies with your mates?
829.01,830.49,DAWN,No.
831.61,834.53,DAWN,I'm breaking into the magic shop.
834.61,836.68,DAWN,To steal things.
837.01,841.02,SPIKE,"Magic shop, eh?"
841.85,845.05,SPIKE,All number of beasties
841.85,845.05,SPIKE,between here and there.
845.13,848.33,SPIKE,Bet they'd really go for
845.13,848.33,SPIKE,a Little Red Riding Hood like you.
848.41,853.02,SPIKE,That wouldn't sit too well with big sister.
853.13,855.65,DAWN,I can take care of myself.
860.33,862.28,DAWN,You wanna come steal some stuff?
862.28,863.25,SPIKE,"Yeah, all right."
869.37,871.47,DAWN,Do you know how to do that or not?
871.47,872.33,SPIKE,Give us a sec.
872.41,875.49,SPIKE,I usually just burst through doors.
876.25,878.72,SPIKE,That's right! Who's bad now?
880.93,883.29,SPIKE,"Girl with a mission, eh? What's the caper?"
883.37,887.92,SPIKE,Jewels? Ancient artefacts? Orjust
883.37,887.92,SPIKE,plain hard cash liberated from the till?
888.01,889.49,DAWN,A book.
889.57,892.09,SPIKE,All this for a book?
892.17,897.2,DAWN,"I don't want the book, just what's inside."
892.17,897.2,DAWN,I think it was Giles's notes.
898.25,902.29,DAWN,"He was standing here,"
898.25,902.29,DAWN,and when I turned around it was gone.
910.53,914.49,SPIKE,Where did he learn to write
910.53,914.49,SPIKE,so bloody small? From a fruit fly?
914.57,917.96,DAWN,Wait. Here's something.
914.57,917.96,DAWN,"Tarnis, 12th century."""
918.05,920.97,DAWN,One of the founders
918.05,920.97,DAWN,of the Monks of the Order of Dagon."
921.05,924.52,DAWN,Their sole purpose appears
921.05,924.52,DAWN,to have been as protectors of the Key."
924.61,926.92,SPIKE,Brownrobe types always protect something.
927.01,932.02,SPIKE,It's the only way
927.01,932.02,SPIKE,they can justify giving up girls.
931.73,933.53,SPIKE,Troll hammer.
936.81,938.8,SPIKE,Didn't go with my stuff anyway.
938.89,943.05,DAWN,The Key is not directly described in
938.89,943.05,DAWN,"any literature, but all research indicates"
943.13,948.05,DAWN,an energy matrix vibrating at a dimensional
943.13,948.05,DAWN,frequency beyond human perception."
948.13,952.25,DAWN,Only those outside reality
948.13,952.25,DAWN,can see the Key's true nature."
952.33,954.89,DAWN,Outside reality." What's that mean?
955.49,958.29,SPIKE,"Secondsight blokes, mostly."
958.37,961.37,SPIKE,Or even just your runofthemill lunatics.
961.89,964.85,CRAZY SECURITY GUARD,You don't belong here.
965.13,967.08,CRAZY SECURITY GUARD,There! There's no one in there.
967.08,968.33,CRAZY GUY,I know what you are.
968.41,971.05,SPIKE,What else does it say about this Key?
971.13,974.73,SPIKE,Is it made out of gold?
971.13,974.73,SPIKE,"Maybe we can hock it, split the take."
976.41,979.88,DAWN,The Key is also susceptible
976.41,979.88,DAWN,"to necromanced animal detection,"
979.97,983.44,DAWN,particularly those of canine
979.97,983.44,DAWN,or serpent construct."
992.57,997.65,SPIKE,The monks possessed the ability
992.57,997.65,SPIKE,"to transform energy, bend reality."""
998.69,1000.13,SPIKE,"Blah, blah, blah."
1000.81,1004.44,SPIKE,"Good Lord, Giles writes"
1000.81,1004.44,SPIKE,"as dull as he talks, doesn't he?"
1004.53,1006.33,SPIKE,"They started work,"
1006.41,1012.05,SPIKE,but the Council has suggested
1006.41,1012.05,SPIKE,to us that they were interrupted."
1012.45,1016.24,SPIKE,Presumably by... Glory."
1016.33,1019.69,SPIKE,They obviously did manage
1016.33,1019.69,SPIKE,to accomplish the taste..."
1019.77,1022.05,SPIKE,accomplish the task."
1022.13,1027.08,SPIKE,They had to be certain the Slayer
1022.13,1027.08,SPIKE,"would protect it with her life,"
1027.17,1031.61,SPIKE,so they sent the Key to her in human form."
1033.85,1036.32,SPIKE,In the form of a sister."
1042.29,1044.44,SPIKE,"I guess that's you, niblet."
1052.21,1053.86,WILLOW,"Not even a card, huh?"
1053.86,1056.21,BUFFY,I wasn't really expecting one.
1056.49,1060.65,BUFFY,No contact with civilians.
1056.49,1060.65,BUFFY,There's probably a code name for it.
1060.73,1064.36,BUFFY,"You know, like ""radio silence""."
1060.73,1064.36,BUFFY,It's "greetingcard silence".
1065.53,1065.93,WILLOW,Sorry.
1065.93,1068.65,BUFFY,Maybe it's time to start a new tradition:
1068.73,1072.33,BUFFY,birthdays without boyfriends.
1068.73,1072.33,BUFFY,It could be just as much fun.
1072.41,1074.66,WILLOW,"Preachin' to the choir here, baby."
1074.66,1076.25,TARA,Yeah. Some of my best...
1077.29,1079.2,TARA,"Oh, my God."
1083.81,1085.64,DAWN,Is this blood?
1085.73,1086.82,BUFFY,Dawn!
1086.82,1088.77,JOYCE,"Oh, baby."
1090.49,1091.94,BUFFY,What did you do?
1091.94,1094.12,DAWN,"This is blood, isn't it?"
1094.21,1097.17,DAWN,It can't be me. I'm not a key.
1098.37,1099.36,DAWN,I'm not a thing.
1099.36,1101.84,JOYCE,"Oh, sweetie, no. What is this all about?"
1101.93,1103.84,DAWN,What am I?
1103.93,1109.02,DAWN,Am I real? Am I anything?
1112.41,1114.71,WILLOW,If you need anything...
1114.71,1115.41,BUFFY,Thanks.
1121.85,1124.37,GILES,Perhaps I should stay.
1121.85,1124.37,GILES,"You know, just in case."
1124.45,1128.61,BUFFY,This is a family thing.
1124.45,1128.61,BUFFY,We should deal with this.
1128.69,1130.21,GILES,OK.
1143.01,1145.45,DAWN,Why didn't you tell me?
1146.93,1149.29,BUFFY,We were going to. I just...
1153.37,1157.69,JOYCE,We thought it would be better
1153.37,1157.69,JOYCE,if we waited until you were older.
1157.77,1159.05,DAWN,How old am I now?
1159.05,1161.85,JOYCE,"You're 14, sweetheart. You know that."
1161.93,1165.16,DAWN,"No. The monks, when did..."
1166.21,1168.2,DAWN,When did...
1170.21,1172.2,BUFFY,Six months ago.
1175.01,1177.81,DAWN,"I've only been alive for six months, huh?"
1177.89,1181.28,JOYCE,You've been alive a lot longer than that to us.
1181.37,1184.17,DAWN,You don't know that.
1181.37,1184.17,DAWN,You don't know anything.
1184.73,1188.41,DAWN,"I'm just a key, right?"
1184.73,1188.41,DAWN,Everything about me is made up.
1188.49,1190.17,BUFFY,Dawn...
1191.73,1193.85,BUFFY,Mom and I know what we feel.
1194.33,1197.69,BUFFY,I know I care about you.
1194.33,1197.69,BUFFY,I know that I worry about you.
1197.77,1202.56,DAWN,You worry about me because you have to.
1197.77,1202.56,DAWN,"I'm yourjob. Protect the Key, right?"
1202.85,1205.32,BUFFY,I worry because my sister is cutting herself!
1205.41,1209.85,DAWN,Yeah? How do you know? Maybe this is just
1205.41,1209.85,DAWN,another fake memory from my fake family.
1210.13,1211.73,JOYCE,Sweetheart.
1211.81,1213.33,DAWN,Get out.
1213.33,1214.28,BUFFY,Dawn.
1214.37,1216.76,DAWN,"Get out, get out, get out!"
1224.73,1226.13,BUFFY,"We need answers, Giles."
1226.45,1229.05,BUFFY,We need to find out
1226.45,1229.05,BUFFY,everything we can about the Key.
1229.13,1231.18,BUFFY,"What's it for, who created it..."
1231.18,1233.81,XANDER,And why Glory has a girlgod jones for it.
1233.89,1236.89,BUFFY,This isn't about her. It's about Dawn.
1236.97,1242.09,BUFFY,She deserves to know where she came from.
1236.97,1242.09,BUFFY,"She needs to know, or it will eat away at her."
1242.17,1246.29,GILES,How did she find these?
1242.17,1246.29,GILES,How did she get in here in the...
1247.17,1249.81,ANYA,Who's been using
1247.17,1249.81,ANYA,the Urn of Ishtar as an ashtray?
1254.33,1258.41,SPIKE,"Morning, sunshine. If you've come round"
1254.33,1258.41,SPIKE,"for eggs and sausage, I'm fresh out."
1259.37,1261.76,SPIKE,"Hey, careful! These are wet."
1263.25,1267.09,BUFFY,How could you let her find out like that?
1263.25,1267.09,BUFFY,From books and papers?
1267.17,1269.64,BUFFY,You hate me that much?
1269.73,1274.33,SPIKE,I was just along for the ride. Not like
1269.73,1274.33,SPIKE,I knew she was mystical glowy Key thing.
1274.41,1277.41,SPIKE,Nobody keeps me in
1274.41,1277.41,SPIKE,"the bloody loop, do they?"
1278.53,1280.65,BUFFY,You could have stopped her.
1280.65,1282.53,SPIKE,"Oh, yeah, here it comes."
1282.61,1285.84,SPIKE,"Something goes wrong in your life,"
1282.61,1285.84,SPIKE,blame Spike.
1285.93,1287.81,SPIKE,"News flash, blondie."
1290.45,1294.97,SPIKE,"If kid sis wants to grab a midnight stroll,"
1290.45,1294.97,SPIKE,she'll find a way sooner or later.
1295.05,1299.17,SPIKE,I just thought she'd be safer
1295.05,1299.17,SPIKE,with Big Bad lookin' over her shoulder.
1303.13,1305.12,BUFFY,She shouldn't have found out like that.
1305.21,1308.36,SPIKE,You didn't think you could
1305.21,1308.36,SPIKE,keep the truth from her for ever?
1308.45,1310.73,SPIKE,"Maybe if you had been more honest with her,"
1310.81,1315.93,SPIKE,you wouldn't be trying to make yourself
1310.81,1315.93,SPIKE,feel better with a round of Kick The Spike.
1326.01,1327.57,JOYCE,Honey?
1327.65,1330.12,JOYCE,You're gonna be late for school.
1331.45,1335.81,DAWN,I'm not going.
1331.45,1335.81,DAWN,Blobs of energy don't need an education.
1338.45,1341.92,JOYCE,You want me to make some soup?
1338.45,1341.92,JOYCE,I think there's some chicken and stars.
1342.01,1344.08,DAWN,I'm not sick!
1344.17,1345.57,DAWN,I'm not anything.
1345.57,1347.29,JOYCE,"Honey, calm down, OK?"
1347.37,1349.84,DAWN,Don't tell me what to do.
1351.21,1353.93,DAWN,You're not my mother.
1360.13,1364.13,DAWN,I changed my mind. I'd rather be at school.
1375.61,1379.32,BEN,"All right, fellas."
1375.61,1379.32,BEN,"Today we've got blues, greens and..."
1379.41,1382.17,BEN,"Oh, hey, chartreuse. It's a party."
1382.25,1384.24,ORLANDO,It won't stick.
1385.25,1388.69,ORLANDO,The birds have been pecking too hard.
1388.77,1390.01,BEN,Byzantium.
1390.01,1392.61,JINX,"Yes, they've arrived."
1392.69,1395.25,JINX,"Unfortunate, but not completely unexpected."
1395.33,1395.86,BEN,How many?
1395.86,1398.05,JINX,Their numbers are few for the moment.
1398.13,1401.68,JINX,But they'll grow.
1398.13,1401.68,JINX,The Knights of Byzantium are like ants:
1401.77,1405.77,JINX,"first you see one, then two..."
1401.77,1405.77,JINX,then the picnic's ruined.
1406.77,1408.78,BEN,"No matter how many we kill,"
1408.78,1411.53,JINX,they'll keep coming. Wave after wave.
1411.61,1413.84,JINX,It's time to set old animosities aside.
1413.93,1418.29,JINX,Your fate is directly linked
1413.93,1418.29,JINX,to Her MagnificentlyScented Glorificus.
1418.37,1422.16,JINX,She's been extremely forgiving of
1418.37,1422.16,JINX,"your considerable foibles up until now,"
1422.25,1425.48,JINX,"but if you persist in your defiance,"
1422.25,1425.48,JINX,she'll be forced to...
1425.57,1428.49,BEN,To what? What is she going to do?
1428.57,1433.33,BEN,Send a sixpack of minions to bore me
1428.57,1433.33,BEN,to death? Glory can't lay a finger on me.
1433.41,1436.09,BEN,"You know it, I know it, she knows it."
1436.17,1440.41,BEN,"So save the threats, or I'll finish"
1436.17,1440.41,BEN,the job I started on your head.
1466.17,1469.29,JOYCE,We can'tjust let her sit up there all alone.
1469.37,1473.37,BUFFY,She needs time.
1469.37,1473.37,BUFFY,We can't force her to be all right with this.
1474.37,1481.02,JOYCE,That's your answer? Just leave her alone
1474.37,1481.02,JOYCE,and hope that everything works itself out?
1479.09,1482.29,BUFFY,"No. But if I were her,"
1479.09,1482.29,BUFFY,I'd want a little bit of time right now.
1482.37,1487.08,BUFFY,I wouldn't want my mother and
1482.37,1487.08,BUFFY,my sister coming at me from all sides.
1487.17,1490.48,JOYCE,Her school called today. She was suspended.
1490.89,1495.6,JOYCE,"She yelled at a teacher. The things she said,"
1490.89,1495.6,JOYCE,Buffy. She's never used language like that.
1495.69,1499.45,BUFFY,She probably feels like she can
1495.69,1499.45,BUFFY,say or do anything right now.
1499.53,1506.02,BUFFY,She's not real. We're not her family.
1499.53,1506.02,BUFFY,We don't even know what she is.
1548.73,1551.45,JOYCE,How can you talk as if she's a thing?
1551.45,1552.04,BUFFY,I'm not!
1552.13,1554.85,BUFFY,I'm just saying
1552.13,1554.85,BUFFY,that's probably how she feels.
1554.93,1557.24,JOYCE,Then we have to show her that it isn't true.
1557.33,1560.21,JOYCE,She needs to know
1557.33,1560.21,JOYCE,she's still a part of this family.
1560.29,1562.12,BUFFY,It's not that simple!
1562.21,1566.05,BUFFY,We're not gonna be able to fix this
1562.21,1566.05,BUFFY,with a hug and a kiss and a bowl of soup.
1566.13,1569.89,BUFFY,Dawn needs to know where she came from.
1566.13,1569.89,BUFFY,She needs real answers.
1572.09,1576.09,JOYCE,"What she needs is her sister,"
1572.09,1576.09,JOYCE,"Buffy, not the Slayer."
1576.17,1581.04,BUFFY,The Slayer is the only thing standing between
1576.17,1581.04,BUFFY,Dawn and this god from the bitch dimension
1581.13,1584.33,BUFFY,that wants to shove her in a lock
1581.13,1584.33,BUFFY,and give her a good twirl!
1584.41,1586.4,BUFFY,"Mom, I need to be out there..."
1587.37,1589.73,BUFFY,"Oh, my God. Glory. It's Willow's spell."
1589.81,1591.45,JOYCE,Wait. It's not Glory.
1594.45,1595.97,BUFFY,Damn it.
1596.05,1597.73,BUFFY,Dawn!
1597.81,1598.13,JOYCE,Buffy.
1598.13,1600.2,BUFFY,No! She could've burned the house down!
1600.29,1602.52,JOYCE,"Buffy, she's gone."
1609.49,1612.33,BUFFY,She tore up her room.
1609.49,1612.33,BUFFY,She burned all of her diaries.
1612.41,1614.21,XANDER,The Dawnmeister Chronicles?
1614.29,1616.89,WILLOW,She's been keeping those since...
1616.97,1618.37,WILLOW,I mean...
1618.45,1621.68,BUFFY,"Since she was seven. I remember too, Will."
1622.69,1627.02,BUFFY,We have to find her. Fast.
1625.09,1629.64,BUFFY,Before Glory or the Knights
1625.09,1629.64,BUFFY,of Hack and Slash figure out what...
1629.73,1631.88,BUFFY,who she really is.
1631.97,1636.49,BUFFY,Mom will stay at home in case she shows up.
1631.97,1636.49,BUFFY,I figure we split up and sweep the city.
1636.57,1638.93,BUFFY,"Anya, stay here in case she shows up."
1639.01,1642.16,BUFFY,"Xander, Giles, take the centre of town."
1639.01,1642.16,BUFFY,"Willow, Tara, west side."
1642.25,1644.53,BUFFY,"Spike, you and I'll get the east side."
1644.61,1646.81,BUFFY,Just find her. Please.
1660.17,1662.37,YOUNG DAWN,Bet you can't push me all the way around!
1662.37,1663.17,YOUNG BUFFY,"Oh, yes, I can!"
1663.25,1665.24,YOUNG DAWN,"No, you can't!"
1676.29,1678.68,Cut to,There are so many things I remember.
1678.77,1681.85,Cut to,Seeing Dawn. Hangin' with her.
1681.93,1685.72,XANDER,Listening to Buffy complain about her.
1681.93,1685.72,XANDER,Mostly that last one.
1686.37,1688.54,XANDER,How could all that never really happen?
1688.54,1690.21,GILES,"It takes some getting used to,"
1690.29,1695.77,GILES,the idea of a bright 14yearold actually
1690.29,1695.77,GILES,being living energy thousands of years old.
1697.01,1700.4,XANDER,I'm guessing some kind
1697.01,1700.4,XANDER,of superpowerful in her raw form.
1700.49,1703.09,GILES,"People have killed, died for it,"
1703.17,1705.64,GILES,summoned armies to control the Key.
1706.53,1710.85,XANDER,"You know,"
1706.53,1710.85,XANDER,she kinda has a crush on me.
1710.93,1712.92,GILES,Your point being?
1713.81,1715.93,GILES,"Oh, nothing, no."
1716.01,1721.77,XANDER,"Just sayin'. Powerful being,"
1716.01,1721.77,XANDER,bigenergy gal digging the Xanman.
1722.69,1725.16,XANDER,"Some guys are just cooler, you know?"
1729.69,1731.84,BUFFY,Dawn!
1731.93,1732.35,BUFFY,Dawn!
1732.35,1733.84,SPIKE,That should do it.
1733.93,1734.52,BUFFY,Shut up.
1734.52,1737.37,SPIKE,She scampered off to get away from you.
1737.45,1742.45,SPIKE,"She hears you bellowing, she'll pack it in"
1737.45,1742.45,SPIKE,the opposite direction. Can't say I blame her.
1744.21,1746.68,BUFFY,You were right.
1746.77,1749.61,BUFFY,This is my fault. I should've told her.
1754.25,1756.06,BUFFY,She probably would've skipped off
1756.06,1758.04,SPIKE,"anyway, even if she never found out."
1758.13,1762.84,SPIKE,She's notjust a blob of energy.
1758.13,1762.84,SPIKE,She's also a 14yearold hormone bomb.
1762.93,1767.25,SPIKE,Which one's screwing her up more
1762.93,1767.25,SPIKE,"right now, spin the bloody wheel."
1768.09,1773.17,SPIKE,"You'll find her, just in the nick of time."
1768.09,1773.17,SPIKE,That's what you hero types do.
1775.61,1777.37,SPIKE,You'll find her.
1780.37,1782.41,BUFFY,And then what?
1818.25,1821.37,PATIENT 1,It's here. It's here. It's here.
1821.45,1823.13,PATIENT 2,Can't stop.
1823.21,1825.65,PATIENT 1,It's here. It's here.
1825.73,1827.17,PATIENT 1,It's here. It's here.
1827.25,1830.21,PATIENT 2,Make it stop. The skin's too tight.
1832.57,1835.37,PATIENT 1,Can't hear it. What's the frequency?
1835.45,1837.81,PATIENT 1,Empty. All spilled out.
1839.09,1841.45,DAWN,Please.
1841.53,1844.25,DAWN,"You see me, right?"
1844.69,1846.23,DAWN,Look at me.
1846.23,1847.77,PATIENT 2,Can't stop!
1849.77,1852.57,DAWN,"You know what I am, don't you?"
1852.65,1854.21,DAWN,You all know.
1854.29,1857.38,PATIENT 1,"Can't hear it, can't hear it, can't hear it..."
1857.38,1857.92,DAWN,Tell me!
1858.01,1860.1,PATIENT 1,"Can't hear it, can't hear it, can't..."
1860.1,1860.65,DAWN,What am I?
1860.73,1862.56,ORLANDO,The Key.
1865.09,1867.24,ORLANDO,I found it. Thank you.
1867.89,1870.53,ORLANDO,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank...
1870.61,1873.89,DAWN,You know what the Key is?
1873.97,1878.68,DAWN,Where did I come from?
1873.97,1878.68,DAWN,Who made me? What am I?
1878.77,1880.73,ORLANDO,Thank you. Thank you.
1880.81,1881.44,DAWN,Please!
1881.44,1884.57,ORLANDO,Destroyer! Cracked earth and bones.
1884.65,1887.17,ORLANDO,The sun bleeding into the sky!
1887.25,1891.33,ORLANDO,The Key is the link. The link must be severed.
1887.25,1891.33,ORLANDO,Such is the will of God.
1891.41,1894.64,ORLANDO,Such is the will of God.
1891.41,1894.64,ORLANDO,Such is the will of God.
1901.97,1909.02,BEN,"Two cups of chocolate goodness, courtesy of"
1901.97,1909.02,BEN,whoever I swiped it from out of the cupboard.
1907.09,1910.32,BEN,Couldn't find marshmallows.
1907.09,1910.32,BEN,I'll try to steal some for next time.
1910.41,1912.17,DAWN,Don't like 'em anyway.
1912.17,1914.41,BEN,What? Is that even possible?
1914.49,1922.02,DAWN,"Too squishy. When I was five, Buffy"
1914.49,1922.02,DAWN,told me they were monkey brains and I...
1920.81,1924.36,BEN,"Dawn, was your mom brought back in?"
1920.81,1924.36,BEN,Is that why you're here?
1924.45,1927.81,DAWN,No. My mom's just fine.
1929.33,1932.12,BEN,Is there anybody I can call? Your sister?
1932.12,1933.61,DAWN,I don't have a sister.
1934.69,1937.73,BEN,You two have a fight?
1934.69,1937.73,BEN,"It's OK, I know how that goes."
1937.81,1941.69,BEN,"I got a sister, too."
1937.81,1941.69,BEN,"They can be a real pain sometimes, huh?"
1941.77,1945.77,BEN,"I tell you, there have been a lot"
1941.77,1945.77,BEN,of nights I wish she didn't exist either.
1946.73,1950.12,DAWN,It's not Buffy. It's me.
1950.21,1952.44,DAWN,I'm the one that doesn't exist.
1954.29,1957.6,BEN,"I know it feels that way sometimes,"
1954.29,1957.6,BEN,but when you're older...
1957.69,1959.6,DAWN,No. You don't understand.
1959.69,1962.09,DAWN,"It's not real, none of this. They made it."
1962.09,1962.49,BEN,Dawn...
1962.57,1967.81,DAWN,I'm nothing! I'm just a thing the monks made
1962.57,1967.81,DAWN,so Glory couldn't find me. I'm not real.
1969.05,1969.93,BEN,You're the Key?
1969.93,1971.69,DAWN,How do you know about the Key?
1971.77,1976.05,BEN,Go! Before she finds you. Don't ask me how
1971.77,1976.05,BEN,"she knows, cos she always knows. Just go."
1976.13,1976.73,DAWN,Calm down.
1976.73,1978.81,BEN,"You don't understand, you're a kid."
1978.89,1981.77,BEN,"You stay, she'll find you."
1978.89,1981.77,BEN,"She finds you, she'll hurt you."
1981.85,1983.1,DAWN,What's wrong with you?
1983.1,1985.48,BEN,You're what she's been searching for. Run.
1985.73,1988.2,BEN,You don't know. You...
1988.29,1991.13,BEN,"Oh, no. Oh, God, no. She's coming."
1991.21,1994.36,BEN,I can feel it. You've gotta get out. No...
1994.45,1996.52,BEN,"Oh, no, she's here!"
1996.93,1998.92,BEN,She's here!
2002.53,2005.09,GLORY,"Hey, don't I know you?"
2011.53,2013.17,GLORY,Cotton!
2013.25,2016.93,GLORY,Could a fabric be
2013.25,2016.93,GLORY,more annoyingly pedestrian?
2017.01,2019.89,GLORY,"Now, this is what I'm talkin' about."
2021.65,2024.09,GLORY,Makes your skin sing.
2024.17,2026.69,DAWN,You're... You're Ben.
2026.77,2029.65,GLORY,It's an eensy more complicated than that.
2030.77,2033.81,GLORY,"Family always is, isn't it?"
2033.89,2037.77,GLORY,You'd never make it. I'd rip out
2033.89,2037.77,GLORY,your spine before you got half a step.
2037.85,2042.29,GLORY,And those little legs? They wouldn't
2037.85,2042.29,GLORY,be much good without one of those.
2042.85,2044.84,GLORY,"Would they, Dawnie?"
2045.17,2047.85,GLORY,"Now, what I'm trying to noodle,"
2047.93,2052.17,GLORY,is what in the world was the Slayer's
2047.93,2052.17,GLORY,little sis doin' here with Gentle Ben?
2053.97,2055.95,DAWN,You don't remember?
2055.95,2057.41,GLORY,Remember what?
2057.49,2059.96,GLORY,"You were talking to him, not me."
2061.09,2063.73,GLORY,"Oh, he wasn't being naughty, was he?"
2064.29,2067.21,GUARD,"Excuse me, ma'am."
2064.29,2067.21,GUARD,This area's for hospital personnel.
2070.41,2073.05,GLORY,Rude. I was talking.
2075.05,2078.41,GLORY,What do you say
2075.05,2078.41,GLORY,we find a nice place off the beaten
2078.49,2084.02,GLORY,where you and I can have
2078.49,2084.02,GLORY,a long uninterrupted chat?
2084.81,2086.1,WILLOW,"We looked, but no Dawn."
2086.1,2087.45,BUFFY,What about the carousel?
2087.53,2089.1,TARA,"Checked there, too."
2089.1,2089.76,BUFFY,Nothing?
2089.85,2091.68,XANDER,"Sorry, Buff."
2091.77,2094.49,BUFFY,Anything could have happened to her.
2094.57,2099.02,BUFFY,Notjust Glory.
2097.85,2100.41,BUFFY,I better check the hospital.
2101.29,2106.13,GLORY,"OK. Small talk over. I'm in a bit of a crunch,"
2101.29,2106.13,GLORY,so let's cut right to the ooeygooey centre.
2106.21,2110.13,GLORY,"Your sister, the Slayer, has my Key."
2106.21,2110.13,GLORY,"It's mine, I want it."
2111.01,2113.24,GLORY,Do you know where she squirrelled it away?
2113.33,2117.04,GLORY,There's ice cream and puppy dogs
2113.33,2117.04,GLORY,in it for you if you start singin'.
2117.13,2121.21,DAWN,I'm not sure. What does it look like?
2123.77,2127.37,GLORY,"Well, the last time I caught a peep..."
2128.41,2132.04,GLORY,it was a bright green swirly shimmer.
2133.65,2136.12,GLORY,Really brought out the blue in my eyes.
2137.17,2141.72,GLORY,"But then those monks pulled an abracadabra,"
2137.17,2141.72,GLORY,so it could be anything. See my predicament?
2143.57,2145.37,DAWN,Maybe.
2146.57,2148.56,GLORY,Yes?
2149.81,2154.13,DAWN,"Well, maybe if you told me more about it..."
2155.25,2157.89,DAWN,I'd know if I've seen it.
2165.61,2166.73,GLORY,OK.
2168.37,2169.84,BUFFY,She wasn't brought in.
2169.84,2171.84,XANDER,"Which is a happy thing, right?"
2171.93,2173.11,BUFFY,"I don't know, I..."
2173.11,2174.29,DOCTOR,in the break room.
2174.37,2178.05,DOCTOR,You guys gotta see him.
2174.37,2178.05,DOCTOR,His head's almost twisted clean off.
2179.65,2180.64,BUFFY,Glory.
2180.73,2183.25,DAWN,So this Key thing...
2184.41,2186.53,DAWN,it's been around for a long time?
2186.61,2190.77,GLORY,"Well, not as long as me,"
2186.61,2190.77,GLORY,"but yeah, just this side of for ever."
2194.09,2195.33,DAWN,Is it evil?
2195.33,2196.24,GLORY,Totally.
2199.37,2202.89,GLORY,"Well, no, not really."
2199.37,2202.89,GLORY,I guess it depends on your point of view.
2205.21,2208.52,DAWN,What's it for? I mean...
2208.61,2212.05,DAWN,"if it's a key, there's gotta be a lock, right?"
2212.13,2215.21,GLORY,Yes. We have a winner.
2216.93,2219.05,DAWN,So what does it open?
2223.65,2226.12,GLORY,I smell a fox in my hen house.
2227.25,2231.37,GLORY,"Is that why you were playing with Uncle Ben,"
2227.25,2231.37,GLORY,to get a peek at Glory's unmentionables?
2231.53,2232.68,DAWN,No. I...
2233.13,2235.97,GLORY,I kinda wanna hear me talking right now.
2236.05,2238.25,GLORY,Me talking.
2238.33,2240.64,GLORY,You know what I'm starting to think?
2241.29,2245.05,GLORY,I'm thinking that maybe you...
2247.65,2250.69,GLORY,don't have any idea where my Key is.
2250.77,2255.45,GLORY,"Very irritating, irrational. You know"
2250.77,2255.45,GLORY,"what I mean, tiny snapdragon? Like..."
2256.53,2259.21,GLORY,Like bugs under my skin.
2259.29,2262.76,GLORY,And say... I'm feeling a little...
2263.45,2265.76,DAWN,What's wrong with you?
2267.37,2271.97,GLORY,"Hey, this doesn't have to be"
2267.37,2271.97,GLORY,a complete waste of my precious time.
2272.05,2274.69,GLORY,I've been meaning
2272.05,2274.69,GLORY,to send the Slayer a message.
2276.01,2280.85,GLORY,And I could use a little pickmeup.
2276.01,2280.85,GLORY,"Two birds, one stone, and..."
2281.41,2282.4,GLORY,boom!
2283.93,2285.73,GLORY,You have yummy dead birds.
2287.45,2289.36,BUFFY,Get away from my sister.
2289.45,2291.77,GLORY,"Hey, we were just talking about you!"
2291.77,2293.84,BUFFY,"Conversation's over, hell bitch."
2306.29,2309.25,SPIKE,I thought you said this skank was tough.
2321.29,2322.03,SPIKE,"If he wakes up,"
2322.03,2323.97,GLORY,tell your boyfriend to watch his mouth.
2324.05,2326.12,BUFFY,He is not my boyfriend.
2331.53,2334.33,GLORY,"Hey, those are really nice shoes."
2336.17,2337.57,BUFFY,"Giles, now!"
2339.45,2341.49,GLORY,"Oh, please. Like that's gonna..."
2344.29,2346.17,GLORY,Watch the hair.
2349.09,2351.69,GLORY,Time to start the dying.
2349.09,2351.69,GLORY,Start with the whelp.
2352.93,2354.25,BUFFY,Dawn!
2355.77,2356.23,DAWN,Buffy!
2356.23,2356.92,BUFFY,Get back!
2357.01,2359.97,GLORY,Nice catch. Is that the best
2357.01,2359.97,GLORY,you crapgnats can muster?
2360.05,2363.05,GLORY,"Cos I gotta tell you, so not impressed."
2364.97,2367.41,GLORY,"Look what you did to my dress, you little..."
2367.49,2368.85,WILLOW,Discede!
2371.29,2372.81,TARA,Willow!
2375.25,2377.05,BUFFY,Dawn.
2379.29,2380.97,BUFFY,What did you do to her?
2380.97,2382.44,WILLOW,Teleportation spell.
2382.53,2384.15,WILLOW,Still working out the kinks.
2384.15,2385.37,BUFFY,Where'd you send her?
2385.45,2387.81,WILLOW,Don't know. That's one of the kinks.
2392.77,2394.6,GLORY,"Oh, sh..."
2397.65,2401.53,GILES,That was an incredibly dangerous
2397.65,2401.53,GILES,spell for an adept at your level.
2401.61,2404.69,WILLOW,Yep. Won't be trying that one again soon.
2405.69,2408.33,BUFFY,Are you OK? Did she hurt you?
2409.01,2410.97,DAWN,Why do you care?
2411.05,2414.05,BUFFY,Because I love you. You're my sister.
2415.33,2417.89,DAWN,"No, I'm not."
2417.97,2419.93,BUFFY,"Yes, you are."
2421.05,2423.36,BUFFY,"Look, it's blood."
2423.45,2425.44,BUFFY,It's Summers blood.
2431.61,2433.65,BUFFY,It's just like mine.
2435.25,2439.25,BUFFY,"It doesn't matter where you came from,"
2435.25,2439.25,BUFFY,or how you got here.
2440.09,2442.48,BUFFY,You are my sister.
2444.57,2447.88,BUFFY,There's no way you could
2444.57,2447.88,BUFFY,annoy me so much if you weren't.
2456.29,2458.36,DAWN,I was so scared.
2460.09,2462.08,BUFFY,Me too.
2465.57,2467.72,BUFFY,Come on.
2470.93,2472.49,DAWN,Wait.
2472.57,2476.04,DAWN,Ben. He was here.
2472.57,2476.04,DAWN,He was trying to help me. He...
2479.01,2483.02,DAWN,I...
2481.09,2483.97,DAWN,I think he might have left before Glory came.
2485.05,2487.04,DAWN,I can't remember.
2487.77,2491.4,BUFFY,It's OK. Don't worry about it.
2487.77,2491.4,BUFFY,"Next time we see him, we'll thank him."
2492.61,2495.61,BUFFY,"I have to get you back home, though."
2492.61,2495.61,BUFFY,Mom's freaking out.
2498.37,2500.93,DAWN,Is she mad about the whole fire thing?
2501.01,2505.64,BUFFY,I think you sorta have a "Get Out of Jail Free"
2501.01,2505.64,BUFFY,card on account of big love and trauma.
2506.01,2507.24,DAWN,Really?
2507.33,2510.21,DAWN,OK. Good.
2513.89,2516.78,DAWN,You think she'd raise my allowance?
2516.78,2517.93,BUFFY,Don't push it.
