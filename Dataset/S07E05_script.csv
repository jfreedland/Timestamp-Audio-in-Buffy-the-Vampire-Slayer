2.11,3.83,GILES (V.O.) ,i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>
3.83,6.27,TROLL,You seem determined
3.83,6.27,TROLL,"to put an end to all my fun,"
6.27,8.67,TROLL,just like you always did when we were dating.
8.67,9.84,BUFFY,You dated a troll?
9.84,11.72,ANYA,"Well, he wasn't a troll then!"
11.75,13.23,ANYA,"He was just a big, dumb guy."
13.23,14.25,WILLOW,Where is everyone?
14.25,15.55,ANYA,At the new high school.
15.55,18.95,ANYA,Buffy's got some job there.
15.55,18.95,ANYA,Spike's insane in the basement.
19.19,19.77,BUFFY,Willow?
19.77,20.94,WILLOW,There you are!
21.51,23.63,BUFFY,But we're really glad you're back.
23.63,27.03,XANDER,Did you turn this nice lady's ex
23.63,27.03,XANDER,into a giant worm monster?
27.03,28.53,ANYA,i></i> Yes.
29.75,32.65,WILLOW,I got the impression
29.75,32.65,WILLOW,that you enjoyed inflicting.
32.83,35.11,ANYA,"Causing pain sounds really cool, but..."
35.11,38.06,ANYA,turns out it's really upsetting.
35.11,38.06,ANYA,Didn't use to be.
38.19,41.51,HALFREK,It's the talk of the Order.
38.19,41.51,HALFREK,They're calling you Miss Soft Serve.
41.51,42.19,ANYA,Excuse me?
42.19,44.11,HALFREK,No deaths. No eviscerations.
44.19,47.09,HALFREK,You're not goading women
44.19,47.09,HALFREK,into anything inventive.
47.15,50.2,ANYA,It was a glitch.
47.15,50.2,ANYA,I am so back in the vengeance fold.
54.35,57.67,DAWN,My advice is: do exactly
54.35,57.67,DAWN,what everyone else does all the time.
57.67,58.52,WILLOW,Got it.
58.75,62.55,DAWN,"Do what everyone else does,"
58.75,62.55,DAWN,"wear what they wear, say what they say."
62.59,63.24,WILLOW,OK.
63.99,66.35,WILLOW,People may say things you don't understand.
66.35,69.75,WILLOW,Don't be afraid to keep your mouth shut
66.35,69.75,WILLOW,and pretend you do.
70.03,72.23,WILLOW,"Dawn, I've been to college before."
72.23,75.33,DAWN,People may say
72.23,75.33,DAWN,My protein window closes in an hour."
75.55,77.35,DAWN,Just nod and smile. Mmhm.
78.87,80.95,DAWN,It has something to do with fitness.
80.95,82.73,BUFFY,i></i> Have you talked to her?
82.73,84.63,XANDER,Not since the Gnarl demon night.
84.63,88.03,XANDER,And that wasn't exactly
84.63,88.03,XANDER,the "How have you been?" kind of talking.
88.03,91.75,XANDER,More of the "Pierce its eye
88.03,91.75,XANDER,with something sharp" kind of talking.
91.75,93.61,XANDER,I'm thinking I should call her.
93.61,95.9,BUFFY,I don't want you to get your hopes up.
95.91,97.71,XANDER,"Hopes? Oh, no, no, no, no."
98.39,100.89,XANDER,There are no hopes. Anya and I are done.
101.11,102.29,XANDER,I love being single.
102.29,103.99,BUFFY,"I'm a strong, successful male"
103.99,108.03,BUFFY,who's giddy at the thought of all the women
103.99,108.03,BUFFY,I will be dating in the near future.
108.03,110.38,BUFFY,"Strong, successful males say ""giddy""?"
111.63,113.99,XANDER,"I just worry about her, that's all."
113.99,114.33,WILLOW,Anya?
115.39,117.04,XANDER,"Yeah, she seems so sad."
117.27,119.95,DAWN,She should try acting
117.27,119.95,DAWN,like everybody else more.
119.95,122.83,WILLOW,Apparently it's what all the kids
119.95,122.83,WILLOW,are doing nowadays.
122.83,126.95,BUFFY,"Not sure I get the sad vibe, but there is"
122.83,126.95,BUFFY,a vengeance vibe worth worrying about.
126.95,129.6,XANDER,"Oh, that? No, no. I don't worry about that."
130.07,133.72,XANDER,She was hurt and she just turned back
130.07,133.72,XANDER,to what she knew when I...
134.35,136.75,XANDER,You know. But that's not her any more.
138.07,139.57,BUFFY,I hope you're right.
140.15,143.87,XANDER,She turned that worm guy back
140.15,143.87,XANDER,"before any real damage happened, right?"
143.87,147.42,XANDER,lt'll just take some time.
143.87,147.42,XANDER,I really think she's coming around.

183.55,184.9,ANYA,What have I done?
406.95,409.9,OLAF,i> I don't trust what I see any more.</i>
410.35,412.85,SPIKE,"I don't know how to explain it, exactly."
413.83,415.78,SPIKE,Like I've been seeing things.
419.59,421.74,SPIKE,"Dru used to see things, you know?"
423.15,426.4,SPIKE,She'd always be staring at the sky
423.15,426.4,SPIKE,watching cherubs burn
426.43,428.83,SPIKE,or the heavens bleed or some nonsense.
430.19,434.19,SPIKE,I used to stare at her and think
430.19,434.19,SPIKE,she'd gone completely sack of hammers.
436.11,438.66,SPIKE,But she'd see the sky when we were inside
439.71,441.56,SPIKE,and it'd make her so happy.
441.59,443.84,SPIKE,"She'd see showers, she'd see stars."
446.75,448.57,SPIKE,Now I see <i>her.</i>
448.57,449.7,BUFFY,i></i> Spike.
449.95,451.47,SPIKE,"I'm in trouble, Buffy."
451.47,452.5,BUFFY,I can help you.
459.19,461.24,SPIKE,I could never ask. Not after...
464.55,466.7,BUFFY,It's different. You're different.
468.47,469.87,SPIKE,I could never ask.
471.35,472.6,BUFFY,"Spike, it's me."
473.23,476.13,BUFFY,"It's you and it's me,"
473.23,476.13,BUFFY,and we'll get through this.
478.75,479.55,SPIKE,Never.
483.23,484.88,BUFFY,We'll get through this.
495.71,496.51,BUFFY,Spike.
497.79,499.74,BUFFY,This basement is killing you.
500.39,503.64,BUFFY,This is the Hellmouth.
500.39,503.64,BUFFY,There is something bad down here.
503.99,505.69,BUFFY,Possibly everything bad.
506.07,507.32,BUFFY,i></i>
510.23,512.13,SPIKE,Can't hear you. Can't hear you.
512.13,514.03,BUFFY,You have a soul? Fine. Show me.
515.03,517.28,SPIKE,"Scream Montresor all you like, pet."
518.03,520.33,BUFFY,Get up and get out of this basement.
524.51,526.66,SPIKE,I don't have anywhere else to go.
530.43,534.83,WILLOW,I've not been gone for that long. I've
530.43,534.83,WILLOW,already done all the reading I missed...
534.87,537.75,PROFESSOR,"Willow, it's OK."
534.87,537.75,PROFESSOR,We'll get you caught up in no time.
537.75,538.28,WILLOW,Really?
538.28,539.8,PROFESSOR,What am I gonna say?
539.83,542.59,PROFESSOR,"No, I don't want my best student"
539.83,542.59,PROFESSOR,back in my class"?
542.59,546.09,PROFESSOR,I noticed a dropoff in your grades
542.59,546.09,PROFESSOR,at midterms last year...
546.11,546.52,WILLOW,Yeah...
546.52,548.71,PROFESSOR,But then voilÃ¡. You turned it around.
548.71,551.15,PROFESSOR,"Aced all your finals, like, boom. Magic."
551.15,552.61,WILLOW,"Yeah, similar to, but..."
553.11,555.39,PROFESSOR,Come see me during office hours tomorrow
555.39,558.87,PROFESSOR,and we'll see what we need to do
555.39,558.87,PROFESSOR,"to get you caught up, all right?"
558.87,560.47,WILLOW,"OK. Thanks, Professor."
562.95,563.7,WILLOW,Anya!
564.63,565.38,WILLOW,Anya!
566.91,569.21,ANYA,"Willow, hi! What are you doing here?"
569.99,572.54,ANYA,"Oh, I'm starting back up at school again!"
573.35,576.15,ANYA,"Yeah, I can't believe"
573.35,576.15,ANYA,how great everyone's been.
576.15,579.15,ANYA,"I was worried, but I already"
576.15,579.15,ANYA,have books and homework
579.15,583.8,ANYA,and they'll give me periodic surprise quizzes
579.15,583.8,ANYA,just to make up for the ones I missed.
585.83,587.93,ANYA,"What... What are you doing here,"
589.11,592.61,WILLOW,walking out of the fraternity house
589.11,592.61,WILLOW,in the middle of the day?
593.43,594.18,ANYA,Um...
595.91,598.51,ANYA,I have a new boyfriend now. He lives here.
598.59,599.42,WILLOW,That's great!
599.42,601.89,ANYA,"Yeah, we just had lots and lots of sex."
602.79,603.44,WILLOW,OK.
604.75,607.6,WILLOW,This is so great.
604.75,607.6,WILLOW,I am so happy to see you've...
609.79,610.37,WILLOW,moved on.
610.37,612.87,ANYA,"Yes, we're tremendously happy together."
612.87,616.42,ANYA,"Now, if you'll excuse me,"
612.87,616.42,ANYA,I'm late for something... important.
617.35,618.75,WILLOW,OK. See you later.
630.55,631.35,WILLOW,Hello?
633.31,634.46,WILLOW,Is anybody...
659.43,662.58,YOUNG WOMAN,i></i> I take it back. I take it back.
667.43,669.48,YOUNG WOMAN,I take it back. I take it back.
670.75,672.8,YOUNG WOMAN,I take it back. I take it back.
673.75,675.8,YOUNG WOMAN,I take it back. I take it back.

679.67,680.92,YOUNG WOMAN,I take it back.
681.91,683.96,YOUNG WOMAN,I take it back. I take it back.
685.27,687.67,YOUNG WOMAN,I take it back.
685.27,687.67,YOUNG WOMAN,It's OK. You're OK.
688.83,689.78,YOUNG WOMAN,I take it back.
689.78,692.13,WILLOW,What do you take back? What happened?
692.83,694.27,WILLOW,It was gonna be a party.
694.27,695.83,YOUNG WOMAN,Everyone's gonna be there.
697.07,700.07,YOUNG WOMAN,Everyone's bringing a date.
697.07,700.07,YOUNG WOMAN,I'll have a great time.
701.83,703.28,YOUNG WOMAN,But it was just me.
704.11,705.06,YOUNG WOMAN,And them.
707.67,710.02,YOUNG WOMAN,He broke up with me in front of them.
711.63,713.78,YOUNG WOMAN,It was a game. It was all a game.
715.91,717.51,WILLOW,It's OK. You're OK now.
717.51,718.41,YOUNG WOMAN,They laughed.
719.51,722.31,YOUNG WOMAN,And they laughed and I cried.
719.51,722.31,YOUNG WOMAN,And they laughed.
724.67,726.47,YOUNG WOMAN,And I yelled "Just once...
728.51,732.61,YOUNG WOMAN,I wish you could all feel what it's like
728.51,732.61,YOUNG WOMAN,to have your hearts ripped out!"
732.91,734.41,YOUNG WOMAN,"Just once, I wish."""
737.95,739.3,WILLOW,And then it came.
741.51,743.16,WILLOW,"OK. Come on, what came?"
744.23,745.36,WILLOW,What did this?
745.36,746.08,YOUNG WOMAN,A spider.
749.19,750.49,WILLOW,Where did it go?
753.51,754.79,YOUNG WOMAN,What do you mean?
754.79,755.61,WILLOW,The spider.
756.55,757.85,WILLOW,Where is it now?
768.71,769.61,WILLOW,Protect!
773.47,776.07,WILLOW,"For God's sake,"
773.47,776.07,WILLOW,shut your whimpering mouth!
789.75,790.75,WILLOW,I'm sorry.

838.95,839.87,D'HOFFRYN,Impressive.

842.71,845.36,D'HOFFRYN,"What is that,"
842.71,845.36,D'HOFFRYN,a Woodlow Transmogrific spell?
846.35,848.65,ANYA,Thornton's Hope.
846.35,848.65,ANYA,Thornton's Hope?
849.51,851.91,D'HOFFRYN,But how did you get the troll element?
852.55,854.15,ANYA,Eelsbane.
852.55,854.15,ANYA,Eelsbane.
855.95,856.95,D'HOFFRYN,Brilliant!
858.19,859.22,D'HOFFRYN,What'd he do?
859.22,860.09,ANYA,Bar matron.
862.43,864.06,ANYA,A loadbearing bar matron.
864.06,865.63,D'HOFFRYN,Is there any other kind?
869.71,872.96,D'HOFFRYN,I'm sorry. How rude of me.
869.71,872.96,D'HOFFRYN,Allow me to introduce myself.
873.55,875.1,D'HOFFRYN,My name is D'Hoffryn.
875.83,876.65,ANYA,I am Aud.
876.65,877.38,D'HOFFRYN,Are you?
879.91,882.41,D'HOFFRYN,I'm afraid you don't see your true self.
883.19,884.49,D'HOFFRYN,You are Anyanka.
885.83,889.18,D'HOFFRYN,I'm a patron of a family of sorts.
885.83,889.18,D'HOFFRYN,We're vengeance demons.
889.35,891.22,D'HOFFRYN,I'm sure you've heard of us.
891.22,892.15,ANYA,"No, I'm sorry."
892.39,893.81,D'HOFFRYN,"Well, that's quite..."
893.81,895.09,ANYA,"No, don't feel bad."
896.19,900.19,ANYA,I don't talk to people much.
896.19,900.19,ANYA,"I talk to them, but they don't talk to me."
900.91,903.35,ANYA,Except to say "Your questions are irksome"
903.35,907.8,ANYA,and "Take your furs and literal interpretations
903.35,907.8,ANYA,to the other side of the river."
913.15,917.9,D'HOFFRYN,I sense that your talents are not appreciated
913.15,917.9,D'HOFFRYN,"here, Anyanka. We'd like you to join us."
917.95,920.63,ANYA,Why do you keep calling me that?
917.95,920.63,ANYA,My name is Aud.
920.63,922.93,D'HOFFRYN,"Perhaps, but Anyanka is who you are."
925.35,927.05,ANYA,What would I have to do?
927.63,930.73,D'HOFFRYN,What you do best.
927.63,930.73,D'HOFFRYN,Help wronged women punish evil men.
936.39,937.05,ANYA,Vengeance.
937.05,939.24,D'HOFFRYN,But only to those who deserve it.
939.47,940.7,ANYA,They all deserve it.

975.11,977.59,BUFFY,that physics class you wanted?
977.59,979.69,HALFREK,"This is just wonderful, Anyanka!"
980.35,983.3,HALFREK,There's even talk of having
980.35,983.3,HALFREK,some sort of ceremony.
983.43,988.33,HALFREK,I can't tell you how many times today I've
983.43,988.33,HALFREK,heard "Anyanka is back to her old self again!"
988.91,991.01,HALFREK,"Honey, what is it? What's wrong?"
992.67,994.32,ANYA,It's nothing. I just...
996.75,999.6,ANYA,"There was just so much screaming,"
996.75,999.6,ANYA,so much blood.
1000.31,1003.19,ANYA,I'd forgotten the damage
1000.31,1003.19,ANYA,a Crimslaw demon could do.
1003.19,1007.89,HALFREK,"Oh, tell me about it. They can be feisty"
1003.19,1007.89,HALFREK,little guys  and impossible to housetrain.
1007.95,1010.15,HALFREK,"Once they start nesting, forget..."
1010.55,1012.9,HALFREK,"Are you OK? Oh, did something happen?"
1014.43,1018.58,ANYA,I guess I'm just a little rusty.
1014.43,1018.58,ANYA,I didn't think it would hit me like this.
1020.03,1022.43,HALFREK,"Oh, sweetie. This is perfectly normal."
1024.31,1027.51,HALFREK,It's a reflex.
1024.31,1027.51,HALFREK,"You'll get over it in no time, trust me."
1027.91,1030.71,ANYA,"Oh, Hallie! I can't tell you how good it is..."
1032.11,1033.84,ANYA,Thank goodness you're here.
1033.84,1035.31,HALFREK,"Oh, sweetie. Of course."
1035.55,1040.03,ANYA,"Lately, with everything that's been going on,"

1051.15,1052.1,HALFREK,"Well, OK."
1053.11,1055.26,HALFREK,"If you need anything, you holler."
1059.43,1061.33,WILLOW,"Anya, you have to stop this."
1064.75,1067.3,ANYA,Do you know what they did to her? Do you?
1069.31,1071.86,ANYA,It was a game. They were humiliating her.
1072.51,1075.51,WILLOW,"Anya, listen to me."
1072.51,1075.51,WILLOW,You're in trouble. You know it.

1083.59,1086.89,ANYA,How quickly they forget!
1087.27,1089.62,WILLOW,I haven't forgotten one second of it.
1091.95,1093.05,ANYA,What do you want?
1093.05,1094.15,WILLOW,I wanna help you.
1094.15,1096.05,ANYA,They got what they deserved.
1096.05,1096.8,WILLOW,"No, they..."
1097.31,1100.06,ANYA,I'm a vengeance demon.
1097.31,1100.06,ANYA,Do you understand that?
1100.59,1101.04,WILLOW,No.
1101.04,1101.64,ANYA,Try!
1105.35,1107.25,ANYA,They got what they deserved.
1108.51,1110.87,BUFFY,Thanks. I didn't wanna trouble Willow.
1110.87,1113.83,BUFFY,"Figure she's got enough to do,"
1110.87,1113.83,BUFFY,first day back and all.
1113.83,1116.27,XANDER,Are you kidding? We're doing vent work.
1116.27,1119.35,XANDER,Anything's better
1116.27,1119.35,XANDER,than breathing Freon for eight hours.
1119.35,1120.99,XANDER,She say what this thing is?
1120.99,1122.87,BUFFY,A sort of spider demony thingy.
1122.87,1126.42,BUFFY,She had to go quickly.
1122.87,1126.42,BUFFY,I think she had to sign up for classes.
1126.51,1130.75,XANDER,Little can distract the Willow
1126.51,1130.75,XANDER,when she's on the hunt for the mighty syllabi.
1130.75,1135.05,BUFFY,I don't know. I think she's a little more
1130.75,1135.05,BUFFY,nervous than she was letting... on.
1136.87,1139.12,XANDER,How big did she say this thing was?
1139.71,1143.41,BUFFY,She didn't. But I can't imagine
1139.71,1143.41,BUFFY,she'd send us out if it wasn't...
1144.19,1147.15,BUFFY,The heart's completely ripped out.
1144.19,1147.15,BUFFY,This is our guy.
1147.15,1148.95,XANDER,Or a copycat spider demon.
1150.27,1153.02,XANDER,"So, what's this black stuff?"
1150.27,1153.02,XANDER,I don't know.
1155.11,1155.83,XANDER,"Oh, sticky!"
1155.83,1158.06,BUFFY,Willow said it was a spider demon.
1158.39,1159.77,BUFFY,Maybe it's its webbing.
1159.77,1161.87,XANDER,"This isn't springy, highflying fun."
1161.87,1162.82,XANDER,i> </i>
1162.82,1163.77,BUFFY,Xander.
1168.55,1169.42,XANDER,Is that it?
1169.42,1170.45,BUFFY,I can't tell.
1171.67,1174.24,BUFFY,But something's definitely moving up there.
1174.24,1175.97,XANDER,Maybe we can somehow lure it.
1176.31,1177.16,BUFFY,Xander!
1187.19,1187.84,BUFFY,No!
1191.75,1192.6,BUFFY,You OK?
1195.67,1197.22,XANDER,"Buffy, where'd it go?"
1199.35,1201.37,XANDER,I think we need more swords.
1201.37,1201.8,BUFFY,Uhhuh.
1201.83,1205.83,XANDER,"We go home, pick up more swords,"
1201.83,1205.83,XANDER,"and a spiderydemon protection amulet,"
1206.23,1207.73,XANDER,"we come back, and..."
1212.51,1213.26,XANDER,Or...
1214.75,1217.23,XANDER,I'm more concerned with where it came from.
1217.23,1219.22,XANDER,"If there are more running around,"
1219.22,1220.18,BUFFY,we need to know.
1220.19,1222.79,BUFFY,"We should hit the research, find out if..."
1223.43,1225.23,WILLOW,I know where it came from.
1227.15,1228.1,BUFFY,How many?
1229.03,1229.8,WILLOW,"Ten, twelve."
1229.8,1232.18,XANDER,When were you planning on telling us?
1233.27,1234.65,WILLOW,I'm telling you now.
1234.65,1235.82,XANDER,Great. Thank you.
1238.47,1241.07,XANDER,"Willow, it's Anya. How could you let us..."
1241.55,1243.6,XANDER,How could you not have told us?
1244.71,1247.15,XANDER,Xander...
1244.71,1247.15,XANDER,How could you not have told me?
1247.15,1248.45,BUFFY,Xander. It's OK.
1250.23,1252.33,BUFFY,She didn't tell us for a reason.
1253.91,1257.11,BUFFY,She didn't tell us
1253.91,1257.11,BUFFY,because she knows what I have to do.
1259.95,1261.45,BUFFY,I have to kill Anya.
1267.95,1269.55,HALFREK,i></i>
1273.87,1275.67,HALFREK,I swear I'm in awe of you.
1276.83,1277.54,ANYA,"Oh, stop."
1277.54,1278.73,HALFREK,"Oh, I will not."
1280.23,1283.93,ANYA,I grant wishes. It's all inside the girl.
1280.23,1283.93,ANYA,I just... bring it out.
1284.67,1288.67,HALFREK,Yes. I'm sure this is what she had in mind.
1284.67,1288.67,HALFREK,i></i>
1288.75,1292.15,ANYA,"Well, I don't know about her mind,"
1288.75,1292.15,ANYA,but it was in her heart.
1292.35,1296.03,ANYA,"Besides, Russia was ready to explode."
1292.35,1296.03,ANYA,We just gave it a little push.
1296.03,1300.03,HALFREK,What should we do now? I hear
1296.03,1300.03,HALFREK,they're going to raze the Winter Mansion.
1300.55,1305.2,ANYA,We could head down to Madame Dubasov's.
1300.55,1305.2,ANYA,No better spot for vengeance than a brothel.
1305.23,1307.63,HALFREK,"It's always work, work, work with you."
1308.79,1310.87,ANYA,What else is there?
1308.79,1310.87,ANYA,i> </i>
1310.87,1312.01,ANYA,What else is there?
1312.01,1313.82,HALFREK,"Why, the whole world, for one."
1314.03,1316.98,HALFREK,"Darling, take a look around."
1314.03,1316.98,HALFREK,There's a lot to see.
1317.03,1321.28,HALFREK,There's a revolution going on outside
1317.03,1321.28,HALFREK,that you are somewhat responsible for.
1321.51,1323.96,HALFREK,Aren't you the teeniest bit interested?
1324.19,1328.07,ANYA,What is there to be interested in?
1324.19,1328.07,ANYA,The worker will overthrow absolutism
1328.07,1331.43,ANYA,and lead the proletariat
1328.07,1331.43,ANYA,"to a victorious communist revolution,"
1331.43,1335.53,ANYA,resulting in socioeconomic paradise
1331.43,1335.53,ANYA,"on earth. It's common sense, really."
1335.91,1338.21,ANYA,I have better things to worry about.
1338.23,1340.53,HALFREK,But there's a whole world out there.
1340.75,1343.43,ANYA,Yes. Filled with wronged women
1340.75,1343.43,ANYA,who need my help.
1343.43,1345.1,HALFREK,You're talking about work.
1345.1,1346.58,ANYA,I'm talking about life.
1346.67,1350.12,ANYA,"Vengeance is what I do, Halfrek."
1346.67,1350.12,ANYA,I don't need anything else.
1352.19,1353.84,ANYA,Vengeance is what I am.
1355.67,1358.63,BUFFY,"She's not the Anya you knew, Xander."
1355.67,1358.63,BUFFY,She's a demon.
1358.63,1360.74,XANDER,That doesn't mean you have to kill her.
1360.74,1362.63,BUFFY,Don't act like this is easy for me.
1362.63,1363.83,BUFFY,You know it's not.
1363.83,1365.43,XANDER,There are other options.
1366.07,1367.62,BUFFY,I've considered them.
1367.95,1369.2,XANDER,When? Just now?
1370.03,1373.83,XANDER,Took you all of ten seconds to decide
1370.03,1373.83,XANDER,to kill one of your best friends?
1373.83,1377.53,BUFFY,The thought that it might come to this
1373.83,1377.53,BUFFY,has occurred to me before.
1377.83,1379.63,BUFFY,"It's occurred to you, too."
1379.91,1382.36,XANDER,But we can change what she did. Fix it.
1383.51,1386.51,XANDER,These are mystical deaths.
1383.51,1386.51,XANDER,There has to be something.
1386.51,1390.91,WILLOW,I don't have anywhere near that power.
1386.51,1390.91,WILLOW,I didn't have that kind of power when...
1391.95,1394.75,WILLOW,And I don't think I trust the power I do have.
1394.87,1395.77,BUFFY,It's OK.
1397.43,1401.48,BUFFY,"Xander, I know this is hard for you to hear,"
1397.43,1401.48,BUFFY,but it's what I have to do.
1402.95,1405.8,XANDER,Hard for me to hear?
1402.95,1405.8,XANDER,"Buffy, you wanna kill Anya!"
1406.31,1407.52,BUFFY,I don't want to.
1407.52,1408.36,XANDER,Then don't!
1408.55,1413.4,XANDER,This isn't new ground. When our friends go
1408.55,1413.4,XANDER,"crazy and start killing people, we help them."
1413.51,1414.92,WILLOW,Sitting right here.
1414.92,1415.66,XANDER,I'm sorry.
1415.91,1416.91,XANDER,But it's true.
1416.91,1417.99,BUFFY,It's different.
1417.99,1420.99,XANDER,Because you don't care about her
1417.99,1420.99,XANDER,the same way I do.
1421.79,1423.53,XANDER,"Buffy, I still love her."
1423.53,1424.04,BUFFY,I know.
1426.11,1429.36,BUFFY,And that's why you can't see this
1426.11,1429.36,BUFFY,for what it really is.
1429.75,1432.05,BUFFY,Willow was different. She's a human.
1432.91,1433.94,BUFFY,Anya's a demon.
1433.94,1435.46,XANDER,And you're the Slayer.
1437.71,1439.96,XANDER,I see now how it's all very simple.
1440.75,1442.2,BUFFY,It is never simple.
1442.83,1444.23,XANDER,"No, of course not."
1445.71,1446.66,XANDER,"You know,"
1447.15,1454.02,XANDER,if there's a massmurdering demon that
1447.15,1454.02,XANDER,"you're, oh, say, boning, then it's all grey area."
1452.23,1454.45,BUFFY,Spike was harmless. He was helping.
1454.45,1455.53,XANDER,He had no choice.
1455.75,1458.7,BUFFY,And Anya did!
1455.75,1458.7,BUFFY,She chose to become a demon  twice.
1460.23,1462.86,XANDER,You have no idea what she's going through.
1462.86,1463.68,BUFFY,I don't care!
1463.83,1467.33,XANDER,"No, of course not."
1463.83,1467.33,XANDER,You think we haven't all seen this before?
1467.39,1469.47,XANDER,The part where you cut us all out.
1469.47,1473.17,XANDER,Just step away from everything human
1469.47,1473.17,XANDER,and act like you're the law.
1473.19,1474.93,XANDER,If you knew what I felt...
1474.93,1475.94,BUFFY,I killed Angel.
1479.59,1481.39,BUFFY,Do you even remember that?
1482.55,1485.6,BUFFY,I would have given up
1482.55,1485.6,BUFFY,everything I had to be with...
1487.59,1491.09,BUFFY,I loved him more than
1487.59,1491.09,BUFFY,I will ever love anything in this life.
1492.11,1495.21,BUFFY,And I put a sword through his heart
1492.11,1495.21,BUFFY,because I had to.
1496.15,1500.02,WILLOW,And that all worked out OK.
1498.83,1501.48,BUFFY,Do you remember cheering me on?
1498.83,1501.48,BUFFY,Both of you.
1503.35,1506.4,BUFFY,Remember giving me Willow's message:
1503.35,1506.4,BUFFY,Kick his ass"?
1506.63,1507.75,WILLOW,I never said that!
1507.75,1508.87,XANDER,This is different.
1508.87,1511.77,BUFFY,It is always different! It's always complicated.
1513.19,1517.74,BUFFY,And at some point someone has to draw
1513.19,1517.74,BUFFY,"the line, and that is always going to be me."
1518.95,1523.75,BUFFY,"You get down on me for cutting myself off,"
1518.95,1523.75,BUFFY,but in the end the Slayer is always cut off.
1525.83,1528.98,BUFFY,There's no mystical guidebook.
1525.83,1528.98,BUFFY,No allknowing council.
1529.79,1531.49,BUFFY,Human rules don't apply.
1533.35,1534.65,XANDER,There's only me.
1535.71,1536.86,XANDER,I am the law.
1540.35,1542.16,XANDER,There has to be another way.
1542.16,1543.45,BUFFY,Then please find it.
1569.15,1570.6,WILLOW,I can't. I'm sorry.

1627.71,1628.77,WILLOW,"Hello, D'Hoffryn."
1628.77,1631.21,D'HOFFRYN,I figured I'd be hearing from you soon.
1631.47,1634.12,D'HOFFRYN,The flaying of Warren Meers?
1631.47,1634.12,D'HOFFRYN,Truly inspired.
1635.35,1639.3,D'HOFFRYN,That was watercooler vengeance.
1635.35,1639.3,D'HOFFRYN,Lloyd has a sketch of it on his wall.

1646.79,1649.04,D'HOFFRYN,I didn't feel a bit of the old you?

1672.83,1674.03,ANYA,What do you want?
1674.03,1675.23,XANDER,I wanna help you.

1691.19,1695.49,XANDER,You don't understand. This isn't
1691.19,1695.49,XANDER,an intervention. Buffy's coming to kill you.
1697.59,1698.72,ANYA,She's coming to try.
1698.72,1701.15,XANDER,Did everyone have their crazy flakes today?
1701.15,1704.87,XANDER,You're friends. How could you talk like this?
1704.87,1708.02,ANYA,I have a job to do. And so does Buffy.
1706.99,1709.74,ANYA,"Xander, you've always seen"
1706.99,1709.74,ANYA,what you wanted to.
1710.67,1713.77,ANYA,"But she knew, sooner or later,"
1710.67,1713.77,ANYA,it would come to this.

1911.27,1913.27,XANDER,i># Maybe if you're lucky

1998.59,1999.34,XANDER,Anya!
2014.91,2017.81,ANYA,Forgotten how much
2014.91,2017.81,ANYA,swords through the chest hurt.
2018.43,2019.28,ANYA,Aarghh!
2027.27,2029.42,ANYA,"You know better than that, Buffy."
2030.63,2033.23,ANYA,It takes a lot more to kill a vengeance demon.
2033.23,2035.18,BUFFY,"Oh, I'm just getting started."
2055.19,2057.24,ANYA,"Stop trying to save me, Xander!"
2063.59,2067.44,D'HOFFRYN,"Please, don't mind me. Continue"
2063.59,2067.44,D'HOFFRYN,with whatever it was you were doing.
2072.15,2073.5,D'HOFFRYN,Oh! Breathtaking.
2075.43,2079.08,D'HOFFRYN,It's like somebody slaughtered
2075.43,2079.08,D'HOFFRYN,an Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue.
2079.27,2082.02,D'HOFFRYN,"Easy, now."
2079.27,2082.02,D'HOFFRYN,I'd be gone before you could swing.
2084.95,2086.9,D'HOFFRYN,Isn't that just like a slayer?
2087.51,2091.11,D'HOFFRYN,Solving all her problems
2087.51,2091.11,D'HOFFRYN,by sticking things with sharp objects.
2093.67,2097.02,D'HOFFRYN,I talked to your friend Miss Rosenberg.
2093.67,2097.02,D'HOFFRYN,She's a firebrand.
2097.99,2099.67,D'HOFFRYN,I have high hopes for her.
2099.67,2101.09,XANDER,Stay away from Willow.
2101.35,2103.2,D'HOFFRYN,"Oh, he's gallant, isn't he?"
2103.43,2105.58,D'HOFFRYN,I understand what you saw in him.
2106.43,2110.88,D'HOFFRYN,Miss Rosenberg thinks Anyanka would be
2106.43,2110.88,D'HOFFRYN,better suited outside the vengeance fold.
2111.51,2114.61,D'HOFFRYN,I think we already know
2111.51,2114.61,D'HOFFRYN,what Lady "HacksAway" wants.
2114.67,2117.77,D'HOFFRYN,"And the young man,"
2114.67,2117.77,D'HOFFRYN,he sees with the eyeballs of love.
2118.59,2123.24,D'HOFFRYN,But I'm not sure if anyone's bothered
2118.59,2123.24,D'HOFFRYN,to find out what Anyanka herself really wants.
2123.75,2124.83,XANDER,Her name is Anya.
2124.83,2127.05,D'HOFFRYN,"Actually, funny historical sidebar:"
2127.51,2129.19,D'HOFFRYN,her original name was...
2129.19,2131.16,ANYA,i></i> I wanna take it back.
2131.87,2133.62,D'HOFFRYN,I'm sorry. What was that?
2135.59,2137.14,ANYA,I wanna take it back.
2139.67,2141.37,ANYA,I wanna undo what I did.
2143.07,2145.07,D'HOFFRYN,Hmm. You want to take it back.
2147.35,2150.8,D'HOFFRYN,Must be 12 bodies in there.
2147.35,2150.8,D'HOFFRYN,Such a thing... not easily done.
2153.51,2154.96,D'HOFFRYN,But not impossible.
2155.75,2159.07,D'HOFFRYN,"You're a big girl, Anyanka."
2155.75,2159.07,D'HOFFRYN,You understand how this works.
2159.07,2161.32,D'HOFFRYN,The proverbial scales must balance.
2161.55,2165.8,D'HOFFRYN,"In order to restore the lives of the victims,"
2161.55,2165.8,D'HOFFRYN,the Fates require a sacrifice.
2166.71,2169.16,D'HOFFRYN,The life and soul of a vengeance demon.
2172.71,2173.39,ANYA,Do it.
2173.39,2173.96,XANDER,Wait!
2174.19,2176.64,ANYA,"Stay out of this, Xander."
2174.19,2176.64,ANYA,"OK, right."
2177.83,2180.68,XANDER,That seems smart 
2177.83,2180.68,XANDER,he just said you have to die!
2181.63,2184.38,XANDER,Perhaps there's some sort of alternate price?
2185.15,2186.95,ANYA,"Xander, you can't help me."
2190.95,2193.4,ANYA,I'm not even sure there's a me to help.
2197.35,2199.35,ANYA,I understand the price. Do it.
2201.15,2203.2,D'HOFFRYN,You're sure? This is your wish?
2205.83,2207.13,ANYA,This is my wish.
2209.55,2210.85,ANYA,Undo what I did.
2213.19,2214.19,D'HOFFRYN,Very well.
2215.03,2215.68,XANDER,No!
2221.47,2222.22,HALFREK,Anya.
2225.39,2226.74,ANYA,Hallie?
2225.39,2226.74,ANYA,Aargh!
2236.59,2240.95,D'HOFFRYN,Who did you think you were dealing with?
2236.59,2240.95,D'HOFFRYN,Did you think it'd be that easy to get away?
2240.95,2242.1,ANYA,Why?
2240.95,2242.1,ANYA,Why?!
2242.75,2244.24,D'HOFFRYN,Because you wished it!
2244.24,2245.45,ANYA,But she was yours.
2245.83,2247.78,D'HOFFRYN,The way <i>you</i> were mine?
2248.07,2250.37,D'HOFFRYN,"Haven't I taught you anything, Anya?"
2250.47,2253.47,D'HOFFRYN,Never go for the kill
2250.47,2253.47,D'HOFFRYN,when you can go for the pain.
2253.91,2257.16,D'HOFFRYN,"Hold him back, Slayer."
2253.91,2257.16,D'HOFFRYN,Wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.
2258.59,2262.24,D'HOFFRYN,I've got plenty of girls.
2258.59,2262.24,D'HOFFRYN,There will always be vengeance demons.
2262.63,2264.63,D'HOFFRYN,"But now you, Anya, you're out."
2265.99,2268.39,D'HOFFRYN,Congratulations. Your wish is granted.
2268.95,2270.65,ANYA,You should've killed me.
2272.19,2274.29,D'HOFFRYN,"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that."
2275.19,2277.14,D'HOFFRYN,"From beneath you, it devours."
2278.15,2280.45,D'HOFFRYN,Be patient. All good things in time.
2299.95,2301.8,BUFFY,Go. I'll check on the boys.
2310.27,2311.32,XANDER,"Anya, wait."
2312.87,2314.82,ANYA,"Xander, please, just go away."
2316.79,2319.44,XANDER,Whatever's between us... it doesn't matter.
2321.43,2323.48,XANDER,You shouldn't be alone in this.
2325.19,2326.39,ANYA,"Yes, I should."
2329.11,2330.41,ANYA,My whole life...
2332.15,2334.6,ANYA,I've just clung to whatever came along.
2336.35,2339.35,XANDER,"Well, speaking as a clingee..."
2336.35,2339.35,XANDER,I kinda didn't mind.
2344.03,2345.68,ANYA,Thanks. For everything.
2364.87,2365.72,ANYA,Xander?
2370.79,2372.59,ANYA,What if I'm really nobody?
2375.31,2376.61,XANDER,Don't be a dope.
2378.63,2379.68,ANYA,I'm a dope.
2382.75,2383.75,XANDER,Sometimes.
2386.35,2387.6,,That's a start.
