201.02,201.05,Angel,Hey.
201.05,202.01,Angel,Is everything OK?
202.01,203.82,Buffy,That's what I was gonna ask you.
203.86,206.21,Buffy,"You're OK, right?"
206.52,209.49,Angel,Sure... I'm fine.
209.65,212.07,Angel,What's up?
215.28,219.03,Buffy,I had this... dream
215.28,219.03,Buffy,that Drusilla was alive.
219.66,221.79,Angel,What happened?
222.16,225.23,Buffy,She killed you. Right in front of me.
225.23,227.61,Angel,It was just a dream. It wasn't real.
227.64,229.52,Buffy,But it felt so real.
229.52,230.46,Angel,It wasn't.
230.92,233.25,Angel,I'm right here.
234.68,237.02,Buffy,"Angel, thisthis happened before."
237.02,238.71,Buffy,The dreams I had about the Master.
238.71,239.46,Angel,They came true.
239.5,242.93,Angel,"Still, not every dream you have"
239.5,242.93,Angel,comes true.
242.96,245.59,Angel,"I mean, what else"
242.96,245.59,Angel,did you dream last night?
245.59,247.8,Angel,Can you remember?
248.48,251.89,Buffy,I dreamt... I dreamt that Giles and I
251.92,254.95,Buffy,opened an officesupply
251.92,254.95,Buffy,warehouse in Vegas.
254.99,256.54,Angel,You see my point?
256.58,258.1,Angel,"Yeah, I do, but..."
258.1,260.3,Buffy,what if Drusilla is alive?
260.33,262.07,Buffy,We never saw her body.
262.07,262.86,Angel,She's not.
264.08,267.37,Angel,"But even if she was, we'd deal."
267.4,269.78,Buffy,But what if she's...
276.6,279.14,Angel,What if what?
279.73,285.3,Buffy,I'm sorry. Were we talking?
303.51,305.8,Buffy,"I'm sorry. I, um..."
305.84,308.36,Buffy,II have to go to school.
308.36,309.1,Angel,I know.
314.77,316.61,Buffy,"God, you feel..."
316.65,318.48,Angel,You have to go to school.
319.78,321.99,Buffy,All right. I know.
322.28,324.36,Buffy,This is me. I'm going.
341.68,345.7,Angel,You still haven't told me
341.68,345.7,Angel,what you wanted for your birthday.
346.06,349.19,Buffy,Surprise me.
349.19,349.97,Angel,OK.
352.02,352.79,Angel,I will.
360.45,363.39,Buffy,This is nice.
363.42,365.82,Buffy,I like seeing you
363.42,365.82,Buffy,first thing in the morning.
365.82,368.24,Angel,It's bedtime for me.
368.27,371.77,Buffy,"Well, then, I like"
368.27,371.77,Buffy,seeing you at bedtime. Um...
371.81,375.03,Angel,Um... YYou know what I mean.
375.47,377.38,Angel,I think so.
377.41,380.15,Angel,What do you mean?
380.47,382.96,Buffy,I like seeing you.
383.6,387.39,Buffy,And the part at the end of the night
383.6,387.39,Buffy,where we say goodbye?
387.98,390.95,Buffy,It's getting harder.
391.11,395.77,Angel,Yeah... It is.
397.99,401.66,Willow,I like you at bedtime"?
397.99,401.66,Willow,You actually said that?
401.69,402.85,Buffy,I know. I know.
402.85,405.41,Willow,"Man, that's like... I don't know."
405.45,407.04,Willow,That's moxie or somethin'.
407.04,409.42,Buffy,Totally unplanned. It just... came out.
409.46,414.14,Willow,And he was into it?
409.46,414.14,Willow,"He wants to see you at bedtime, too?"
414.26,417.91,Buffy,"Yeah, II think he does."
414.26,417.91,Buffy,"I mean, he's cool about it."
417.95,420.27,Willow,"Well, of course he is."
417.95,420.27,Willow,Cause he's cool.
420.3,423.02,Willow,"I mean, he would never, you know..."
423.06,423.64,Buffy,Push.
423.64,426.54,Willow,Right. He's not the type.
426.57,428.43,Buffy,"Willow, what am I gonna do?"
428.43,429.87,Willow,What do you wanna do?
431.16,436.51,Buffy,"I don't know. I... I mean,"
431.16,436.51,Buffy,want" isn't always the right thing to do.
436.54,438.91,Buffy,To act on want can be wrong.
438.94,439.54,Willow,True.
439.54,442.89,Buffy,But... to not act on want...
443.05,445.48,Buffy,What if I never feel this way again?
445.48,448.68,Willow,Carpe diem! You told me that once.
448.71,450.36,Buffy,Fish of the day"?
450.36,451.42,Willow,Not "carp"!
451.42,453.95,Willow,Carpe  it means "seize the day".
453.98,455.96,Buffy,Right.
457.44,459.6,Buffy,I... I think we're going to.
459.6,461.56,Buffy,Seize it.
461.6,465.68,Buffy,"Once you get to a certain point,"
461.6,465.68,Buffy,then seizing is sort of inevitable.
465.72,467.4,Willow,Wow.
467.4,469.51,Buffy,Yeah.
469.54,471.62,Willow,Wow.
473.08,474.64,Willow,Wow!
475.21,477.35,Willow,Wow.
477.35,480.02,Buffy,Yeah.
478.34,480.2,Willow,"Hey, speaking of ""wow"" potential,"
480.2,481.44,Buffy,there's Oz over there.
481.44,483.52,Buffy,What are we thinking?
481.44,483.52,Buffy,Any sparkage?
483.56,486.83,Willow,"He's nice... Hey, I like his hands."
486.86,490.53,Buffy,Mm. A fixation on insignificant detail
486.86,490.53,Buffy,is a definite crush sign.
490.85,494.35,Willow,"Well, I don't know, though."
490.85,494.35,Willow,"I mean, he is a senior."
494.61,496.61,Buffy,You think he's too old
494.61,496.61,Buffy,cause he's a senior?
496.61,498.85,Buffy,Please! My boyfriend
496.61,498.85,Buffy,had a bicentennial.
498.99,502.64,Willow,That's true. Uh... I guess... I just...
502.68,504.88,Buffy,You can't spend the rest of your life
502.68,504.88,Buffy,waiting for Xander
504.91,508.33,Buffy,to wake up and smell the hottie.
504.91,508.33,Buffy,Make a move. Do the talking thing.
508.37,512.55,Willow,What if the talking thing becomes
508.37,512.55,Willow,the awkward silence thing?
512.75,516.1,Buffy,"Well, you won't know until you try."
527.15,530.14,Willow,Hey.
527.15,530.14,Willow,Hey!
530.9,534.49,Willow,"Do you guys, uh... have a gig tonight?"
534.49,536.1,Oz,Oh. No. Practice.
536.14,538.69,Oz,"See, our band's kinda movin' towards"
536.14,538.69,Oz,this new sound where...
538.69,541.28,Oz,"we suck, so... practice."
541.31,543.61,Willow,I think you guys sound good.
543.61,544.19,Oz,Thanks.
544.67,547.64,Willow,I bet you have a lot of groupies.
547.8,552.46,Oz,It happens... I'm livin'
547.8,552.46,Oz,groupiefree nowadays. I'm clean.
552.96,554.73,Willow,Oh.
555.93,559.2,Oz,I'm gonna ask you
555.93,559.2,Oz,to go out with me tomorrow night.
559.24,563.11,Oz,"And I'm kinda nervous about it, actually."
559.24,563.11,Oz,It's interesting.
563.44,567.33,Willow,"Oh. Well, if it helps at all,"
563.44,567.33,Willow,I'm gonna say yes.
567.36,570.36,Oz,"Yeah, it helps."
567.36,570.36,Oz,ItIt creates a comfort zone.
571.57,573.33,Oz,Do you wanna go out with me
571.57,573.33,Oz,tomorrow night?
573.33,575.6,Willow,Oh! I can't!
575.95,578.75,Oz,"Well, see, I like"
575.95,578.75,Oz,that you're unpredictable.
579.08,582.87,Willow,"Oh, it's just it's Buffy's birthday,"
579.08,582.87,Willow,and we're throwing her a surprise party.
582.9,583.74,Oz,That's OK.
583.74,586.61,Willow,But you could come. If you wanted.
586.65,588.5,Oz,"Well, I don't wanna crash."
588.5,589.5,Willow,"No, it's fine."
590.35,593.67,Willow,You could be... my date.
595.35,597.89,Oz,All right. I'm in.
603.49,606.03,Willow,I said "date"!
607.66,610.23,Xander,"So, Buffy's party."
611.41,613.23,Xander,"Mañana,"
613.29,615.46,Cordelia,"Well, just because she's"
613.29,615.46,Cordelia,"Miss SaveTheWorld and everything,"
615.46,618.33,Cordelia,you have to make a big deal?
615.46,618.33,Cordelia,I have to cook! And everything!
618.36,619.4,Xander,You're cooking?
619.4,620.93,Cordelia,I'm chipsanddips girl.
620.96,623.78,Xander,Huh! Horrors!
620.96,623.78,Xander,All that opening and stirring.
623.79,624.77,Cordelia,And shopping and carrying!
624.77,626.08,Xander,"Well, then you should have a person"
626.12,627.68,Xander,who does such things for you.
627.72,630.94,Cordelia,"Well, that's what I've been saying"
627.72,630.94,Cordelia,"to my father, but does he listen?"
631.44,633.73,Xander,Um... So... Uh...
633.94,636.98,Xander,"You're going, and..."
633.94,636.98,Xander,and... and I'm going.
639.02,641.4,Xander,Should... we maybe... go?
641.4,641.78,Cordelia,Why?
641.81,644.74,Xander,"I don't know. This... thing with us,"
641.81,644.74,Xander,"despite our better judgement,"
644.74,647.08,Xander,keeps happening. Maybe we should
644.74,647.08,Xander,just admit we're dating.
647.11,650.65,Cordelia,Groping in a broom closet isn't dating.
647.11,650.65,Cordelia,You don't call it a date
650.68,651.82,Cordelia,until the guy spends money.
651.82,653.3,Xander,"Fine. I'll spend, then we'll grope."
653.34,655.61,Xander,Whatever. I just think
653.34,655.61,Xander,it's some kind of whacked
655.61,657.44,Xander,that we feel we have to
655.61,657.44,Xander,hide it from all our friends.
657.48,660.29,Cordelia,"Well, of course you wanna tell everybody."
657.48,660.29,Cordelia,You have nothing to be ashamed of.
660.33,662.68,Cordelia,"I, on the other hand,"
660.33,662.68,Cordelia,have everything to be ashamed of.
662.68,664.92,Xander,You know what? Enough said.
662.68,664.92,Xander,Forget it.
664.95,667.1,Xander,Must have been my
664.95,667.1,Xander,multiplepersonality guy talking.
667.14,670.84,Xander,"I call him ""Idiot Jed"","
667.14,670.84,Xander,glutton for punishment.
673.99,677.2,Giles,"Oh, good morning."
673.99,677.2,Giles,Is everything in order for the party?
677.24,680.55,Xander,"Absolutely. You ready to get down,"
677.24,680.55,Xander,you funky party weasel?
680.58,683.85,Giles,Here comes Buffy. Now remember:
680.58,683.85,Giles,discretion is the better part of valor.
684,687.71,Xander,You could've just said "Sh". God!
684,687.71,Xander,Are all you Brits such drama queens?
687.75,691.39,Xander,Buffy! I feel a prebirthday
687.75,691.39,Xander,spankin' comin' on.
691.51,693.7,Jenny,I'd curb that impulse
691.51,693.7,Jenny,"if I were you, Xander."
693.7,695.72,Xander,Check. Cancel spanking.
695.89,698.99,Giles,"You all right, Buffy? You seem fatigued."
698.99,699.92,Buffy,Rough night.
700.27,704.1,Buffy,"I had a dream that Drusilla was alive,"
700.27,704.1,Buffy,and she killed Angel.
704.14,705.86,Buffy,It just really freaked me out.
705.9,708.4,Giles,"You fear it was more of a, a, a portent?"
708.4,709.52,Buffy,"See, I don't know."
709.56,711.58,Buffy,I don't wanna start
709.56,711.58,Buffy,a big freakout over nothing.
711.58,714.49,Giles,"Still, best to be uh... on the alert."
714.53,719.13,Xander,"If Drusilla is alive, then it could be"
714.53,719.13,Xander,a fairly cataclysmic state of affairs.
719.17,722.75,Xander,"Again, so many words. Couldn't you"
719.17,722.75,Xander,just say "we'd be in trouble"?
723.42,725.43,Giles,"Go to class, Xander."
725.43,725.93,Xander,Gone.
727.17,731.38,Xander,Notice the economy of phrasing.
727.17,731.38,Xander,Gone". It's simple. Direct.
732.18,733.68,Buffy,"Maybe I should get gone, too."
733.68,735.02,Giles,"Don't worry unduly, Buffy."
735.02,736.9,Giles,I'm sure it's nothing.
736.94,739.73,Buffy,I know. I should
736.94,739.73,Buffy,"keep my slayer cool, but..."
739.77,743.09,Buffy,"It's Angel, which"
739.77,743.09,Buffy,automatically equals maxiwig.
748.37,750.2,Dalton,I have your package.
750.24,754.74,Spike,"Just put it on the table,"
750.24,754.74,Spike,near the other gifts.
758.38,761.22,Spike,"Are you dead set on this, pet?"
761.25,764.62,Spike,Wouldn't you rather
761.25,764.62,Spike,have your party in Vienna?
764.63,767.53,Drusilla,But the invitations are sent.
767.76,769.29,Drusilla,Yeah... But it's just
769.29,771.33,Spike,I've had it with this place.
771.37,773.42,Spike,Nothing ever comes off
771.37,773.42,Spike,like it's supposed to.
773.45,776.64,Drusilla,My gatherings are always perfect.
777.15,779.44,Drusilla,Remember Spain?
780.28,783.52,Drusilla,Hey? The bulls?
784.03,786.76,Spike,"I remember, sweet."
788.41,792.79,Spike,But Sunnydale's cursed for us.
788.41,792.79,Spike,Angel and the Slayer see to that.
792.83,797.18,Drusilla,Shh! I've got good games for everyone.
800.93,803.9,Drusilla,You'll see.
808.44,811.31,Drusilla,These flowers... are wrong.
811.56,814.86,Drusilla,They're all... wrong.
815.32,817.61,Spike,I can't abide them!
819.07,822.68,Spike,Let's try something different
819.07,822.68,Spike,"with the flowers, then."
827.83,830.64,Drusilla,Can I open one?
832.21,834.05,Drusilla,Can I?
835.97,838.97,Drusilla,Can I?
839.1,841.71,Spike,"Just a peek, love."
842.85,845.27,Spike,They're for the party.
852.11,854.12,Spike,"Do you like it, baby?"
854.15,857.24,Drusilla,It reeks of death.
859.12,864.48,Drusilla,This will be the best party ever.
864.51,866.76,Spike,Why's that?
866.8,869.21,Drusilla,Because...
870.38,873.77,Drusilla,it will be the last.
879.77,883.31,Joyce,Mall trip for your birthday
879.77,883.31,Joyce,on Saturday. Don't forget.
883.52,886.99,Buffy,Space on a Momsponsored
883.52,886.99,Buffy,shopping opportunity? Not likely.
887.28,890.17,Joyce,"So, does 17 feel any different than 16?"
890.17,892.46,Buffy,It's funny you should ask that.
892.5,896.08,Buffy,"You know, I woke up feeling more"
892.5,896.08,Buffy,"responsible, mature and levelheaded."
896.11,898.9,Joyce,Really? It's uncanny.
899.17,901.67,Buffy,I now possess the qualities
899.17,901.67,Buffy,one looks for in a...
901.67,903.27,Buffy,licensed driver.
903.27,904.07,Joyce,Buffy...
904.11,906.47,Buffy,You said we'd talk about it again
904.11,906.47,Buffy,when I was 17.
906.68,909.79,Joyce,"Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?"
934.88,937.3,Enyos,Jenny Calendar."
939.88,941.41,Jenny,You startled me.
941.41,942.75,Enyos,You look well.
944.26,946.6,Buffy,"Yes, I'm fine."
949.27,952.41,,I know I haven't written as much lately.
949.27,952.41,,I've been busy.
952.44,955.19,,I cannot imagine what is so important
955.53,959.41,,to make you ignore
955.53,959.41,,the responsibility to your people.
959.45,961.5,Jenny,"Well, I've been working. And..."
961.5,964.09,Enyos,The elder woman has been reading signs.
964.12,966.1,Enyos,Something is different.
966.1,967.83,Jenny,Nothing has changed.
967.87,969.76,Jenny,The curse still holds.
969.76,972.42,Enyos,The elder woman is never wrong.
972.42,977.17,Enyos,She says his pain is lessening.
972.42,977.17,Enyos,She can feel it.
978.68,979.85,Jenny,There is...
979.85,981.33,Enyos,There is what?
981.37,982.83,Jenny,A girl.
982.83,984.09,Enyos,What?!
984.09,985.87,Enyos,How could you let this happen?
985.87,986.7,Jenny,"I promise you,"
986.73,989.18,Jenny,Angel still suffers!
989.32,993.15,Jenny,And he makes amends for his evil.
989.32,993.15,Jenny,He even saved my life.
993.19,995.27,Enyos,So you just forget
995.31,999.92,Enyos,that he destroyed
995.31,999.92,Enyos,the most beloved daughter of your tribe?
999.95,1004.62,Enyos,"That he killed every man,"
999.95,1004.62,Enyos,woman and child that touched her life?
1005.59,1010.99,Enyos,Vengeance demands that
1005.59,1010.99,Enyos,"his pain be eternal, as ours is!"
1011.22,1016.32,Enyos,If this... this girl gives him one minute
1011.22,1016.32,Enyos,"of happiness, it is one minute too much!"
1016.85,1018.13,Jenny,I'm sorry. I thought...
1018.13,1019.13,Enyos,You thought what?!
1019.16,1022.48,Enyos,You thought you are Jenny Calendar now?
1022.52,1027.91,Enyos,"You are still Janna,"
1022.52,1027.91,Enyos,of the Kalderash people!
1028.11,1030.07,Enyos,A gypsy.
1030.07,1033.98,Jenny,I know... Uncle.
1035.62,1037.66,Jenny,I know.
1038.12,1040.66,Enyos,Then prove it.
1041.25,1043.76,Enyos,Your time for watching is past.
1043.79,1046.99,Enyos,"The girl and him, it ends now!"
1047.51,1051.16,Enyos,Do what you must to take her from him.
1052.52,1055.72,Jenny,I will see to it.
1055.75,1057.76,Buffy,And then my mom broke the plate.
1058.15,1059.41,Buffy,It was just like my dream.
1059.41,1060.67,Giles,"Every gesture, every word."
1060.67,1062.53,Buffy,It was so creepy.
1062.56,1066.1,Giles,"Yes, well, I'd imagine"
1062.56,1066.1,Giles,it would be fairly unnerving.
1066.28,1068.12,Xander,Hey! It's the woman of the hour.
1068.16,1071.16,Willow,"It's happy birthday, Buffy!"
1071.91,1073.75,Willow,"Not happy birthday, Buffy?"
1073.79,1075.94,Giles,"Iit's just that, um, part of the nightmare"
1075.97,1078.8,Giles,that Buffy had the other night
1075.97,1078.8,Giles,actually transpired.
1078.83,1081.26,Buffy,Which means Drusilla might still be alive.
1081.5,1084.18,Buffy,"Giles, in my dream, I couldn't stop her."
1081.5,1084.18,Buffy,She blindsided me.
1084.18,1085.91,Buffy,Angel was gone before
1084.18,1085.91,Buffy,I knew what happened.
1085.94,1089.32,Giles,"Even if she is alive,"
1085.94,1089.32,Giles,we can still protect Angel.
1089.32,1091.45,Giles,"Dreams aren't prophecies, Buffy."
1091.48,1095.29,Giles,"You dreamt that the Master had risen,"
1091.48,1095.29,Giles,but you stopped it from happening.
1095.69,1098.22,Xander,You ground his bones to make your bread.
1098.22,1100.69,Buffy,That's true. Except for the bread part.
1100.7,1103.2,Buffy,"OK, so, fine. We're one step ahead,"
1100.7,1103.2,Buffy,but I wanna stay that way.
1103.24,1108.42,Giles,"Absolutely. Let me read up on Drusilla,"
1103.24,1108.42,Giles,see if she has any particular patterns.
1108.83,1112.41,Giles,Why don't you meet me here at seven?
1108.83,1112.41,Giles,We'll map out a strategy.
1112.59,1114.34,Buffy,What am I supposed to do until then?
1114.34,1115.89,Giles,Go to classes. Do your homework.
1115.89,1118.15,Giles,Have supper?
1118.54,1121.29,Buffy,Right... Be that Buffy.
1123.85,1126.82,Xander,"Well, that's not a perky birthday puppy."
1126.98,1131.51,Willow,So much for our surprise party.
1126.98,1131.51,Willow,I bought little hats and everything.
1131.55,1135.96,Willow,"Oh, well. I guess I'll tell Cordelia."
1136.37,1139.79,Giles,"No, you won't."
1136.37,1139.79,Giles,We're having a party tonight.
1139.82,1143.02,Xander,"Looks like Mr Caution Man,"
1139.82,1143.02,Xander,but the sound he makes is funny.
1143.06,1145.04,Giles,Buffy's surprise party
1143.06,1145.04,Giles,will go ahead as we planned.
1145.04,1147.2,Giles,Except I won't be wearing a little hat.
1147.24,1148.59,Willow,But Buffy and Angel...
1148.59,1149.93,Giles,May well be in danger.
1149.97,1153.06,Giles,"As they have been before,"
1149.97,1153.06,Giles,and I imagine will be again.
1153.09,1155.29,Giles,One thing I've learned
1153.09,1155.29,Giles,in my tenure here on the Hellmouth
1155.32,1157.15,Giles,is that there is no good time to relax.
1157.18,1160.34,Giles,"But Buffy's turning 17 just this once,"
1157.18,1160.34,Giles,and she deserves a party.
1160.37,1162.45,Xander,You're a great man of our time.
1162.48,1167.33,Willow,"And anyway, Angel's coming, so she'll"
1162.48,1167.33,Willow,be able to protect him and have cake.
1167.35,1169.24,Giles,Precisely.
1175.63,1175.99,Jenny,Buffy.
1175.99,1178.12,Buffy,"Oh, my God! I didn't see you there."
1178.33,1182.91,Jenny,Sorry. Um... Giles wanted me to tell you
1178.33,1182.91,Jenny,that there's been a change of plans.
1182.95,1185.62,Jenny,"Uh, he wants to meet you"
1182.95,1185.62,Jenny,someplace near his house.
1185.64,1188.41,Buffy,I guess he had to run home
1185.64,1188.41,Buffy,to get a book or something.
1188.45,1191.95,Buffy,Cause heaven knows there aren't
1188.45,1191.95,Buffy,enough books in the library.
1192.1,1194.04,Jenny,Uh... He's very thorough.
1194.04,1195.91,Buffy,"Oh, which is not to bag."
1195.94,1199.51,Buffy,It's kind of manly in an obsessive
1195.94,1199.51,Buffy,"compulsive kind of way, don't you think?"
1199.54,1203.36,Jenny,"Mmhm. Um... You know, my car's here."
1199.54,1203.36,Jenny,Why don't I drive you?
1203.4,1205.2,Buffy,OK.
1210.24,1211.87,Buffy,Are we going to the Bronze?
1211.87,1212.65,Jenny,I'm not sure.
1212.68,1216.67,Jenny,Giles gave me an address.
1212.68,1216.67,Jenny,I'm just following his directions.
1216.71,1219.39,Buffy,This looks funky. Stop for a sec.
1220.26,1222.32,Jenny,"No, Buffy. Maybe you shouldn't."
1222.32,1224.71,Buffy,"Sorry. Sacred duty, yaddayaddayadda."
1228.39,1231.12,Jenny,What is this?
1236.52,1239.6,Buffy,"Every time I see you,"
1236.52,1239.6,Buffy,you're stealing something.
1239.65,1242.57,Buffy,You really should speak with someone
1239.65,1242.57,Buffy,about this klepto issue.
1267.71,1268.94,Angel,Where is she?
1268.94,1271.86,Willow,Shh! I think I hear her coming.
1301.6,1303.44,Cordelia,Surprise!
1306.61,1308.57,Oz,That pretty much sums it up.
1311.61,1312.75,Angel,"Buffy, are you OK?"
1312.75,1313.95,Giles,"Yes, what happened?"
1314.12,1317.51,Buffy,Uh... There were these vamps outs...
1314.12,1317.51,Buffy,What's going on?
1319.12,1321.25,Giles,Oh. Erm...
1321.63,1323.75,Giles,Surprise party.
1324.13,1328.02,Cordelia,Happy birthday.
1327.88,1330.26,Buffy,You guys did all this for me?
1333.02,1333.37,Buffy,That is so sweet.
1333.37,1333.84,Angel,Are you sure you're OK?
1333.88,1335.68,Buffy,"Yes, I'm fine."
1335.72,1337.61,Willow,Are you OK?
1338.52,1343.06,Oz,"Yeah... Hey, did everybody"
1338.52,1343.06,Oz,see that guy just turn to dust?
1343.53,1345.53,Willow,"Uh... Well, uh... sort of."
1345.56,1350.03,Xander,Yep. Vampires are real.
1345.56,1350.03,Xander,A lot of 'em live in Sunnydale.
1350.41,1352.24,Xander,Willow will fill you in.
1352.29,1354.96,Willow,I know it's hard to accept at first.
1354.96,1357.04,Oz,"Actually, it explains a lot."
1358.2,1361.55,Jenny,"Hey, somebody give me a hand here?"
1363.51,1365.53,Jenny,Those creeps left this behind.
1365.53,1366.27,Buffy,What is it?
1366.34,1370.36,Giles,I've no idea. CCan it be opened?
1370.39,1372.89,Buffy,Yeah. There's a secure release right here.
1401.05,1403.04,Xander,"Well, clearly the Hellmouth's answer to"
1403.04,1404,Xander,What do you get the slayer
1404,1404.74,Giles,who has everything?"
1404.78,1407.33,Giles,"Good heavens. Buffy, are you all right?"
1407.33,1409.36,Buffy,"Man, that thing had major grip."
1409.41,1410.81,Willow,Wwhat was that?
1410.81,1412.86,Oz,It looked like an arm.
1413.57,1416.2,Angel,It can't be. She wouldn't.
1416.23,1419.72,Xander,"What, a vamp's version of snakes in a can,"
1416.23,1419.72,Xander,or do you care to share?
1419.76,1420.43,Buffy,Angel?
1420.43,1424.21,Angel,"It's a legend, way before my time."
1426.08,1430.57,Angel,Of a demon brought forth
1426.08,1430.57,Angel,to rid the Earth of the plague of humanity.
1431.09,1434.88,Angel,"To separate the righteous from the wicked,"
1434.92,1437.49,Angel,and to burn the righteous down.
1439.85,1444.48,Giles,They called him the Judge.
1439.85,1444.48,Giles,The Judge? This is he?
1445.48,1446.7,Angel,Not all of him.
1446.7,1449.37,Buffy,I'm still needing backstory here.
1449.86,1453.88,Buffy,"Erm... He... He couldn't be killed, yes?"
1454.87,1458.3,Giles,Erm... An army was sent against him.
1458.33,1461.67,Buffy,Most of them died. But finally
1461.67,1464.88,Giles,"they were able to dismember him,"
1461.67,1464.88,Giles,but... not kill him.
1464.91,1469.14,Angel,"The pieces were scattered,"
1464.91,1469.14,Angel,buried in every corner of the Earth.
1469.26,1471.56,Jenny,So all these parts
1469.26,1471.56,Jenny,are being brought here?
1471.56,1473.14,Buffy,By Drusilla.
1473.17,1474.92,Buffy,The vamps outside were Spike's men.
1474.92,1476.57,Angel,She's just crazy enough to do it.
1476.6,1478.93,Willow,Do what? Reassemble the Judge?
1478.93,1480.72,Angel,Bring forth Armageddon.
1482.4,1484.59,Cordelia,Is anybody else gonna have cake?
1484.59,1486.78,Giles,We need to get this out of town.
1486.81,1487.68,Jenny,Angel.
1487.68,1488.41,Buffy,What?
1488.66,1491.2,Jenny,You have to do it. You're the only one
1488.66,1491.2,Jenny,that can protect this thing.
1491.28,1492.85,Buffy,What about me?
1491.28,1492.85,Buffy,What?
1492.85,1494.62,Jenny,You're just gonna skip town
1492.85,1494.62,Jenny,for a few months?
1494.65,1494.97,Buffy,Months?
1494.97,1496.3,Angel,She's right. I gotta get this
1496.33,1498.02,Angel,to the remotest region possible.
1498.02,1499.19,Buffy,But that's not months.
1499.23,1501.8,Angel,I can catch a cargo ship to Asia
1499.23,1501.8,Angel,and maybe a truck to Nepal...
1501.83,1504.73,Buffy,"You know, those newfangled flying machines"
1501.83,1504.73,Buffy,really are much safer than they used to be.
1504.76,1508.77,Angel,I can't fly. There's no sure way
1504.76,1508.77,Angel,to guard against the daylight.
1509.93,1513.37,Angel,I don't like this any more
1509.93,1513.37,Angel,"than you do, Buffy."
1513.41,1515.55,Angel,But there's no other choice.
1516.81,1518.69,Buffy,When?
1519.02,1521.16,Angel,Tonight.
1521.19,1523.81,Angel,As soon as possible.
1524.32,1526.97,Buffy,But it's my birthday.
1529.33,1531.98,Jenny,I'll drive you to the docks.
1536.84,1538.76,Drusilla,You lost it.
1538.84,1541.47,Drusilla,You lost my present.
1541.84,1544.31,Dalton,I know. I'm sorry.
1544.35,1549.36,Spike,"It's a bad turn, man."
1544.35,1549.36,Spike,She can't have her fun without the box.
1549.39,1553.19,Dalton,The Slayer. She came out of nowhere.
1549.39,1553.19,Dalton,I didn't even see her. She...
1563.12,1565.07,Drusilla,Make a wish.
1565.07,1565.88,Dalton,What?
1567.5,1569.67,Drusilla,I'm going to blow out the candles.
1572.02,1572.84,Spike,You might give him a chance
1572.02,1572.84,Spike,to find your lost treasure.
1573.13,1576.99,Spike,"He is a wanker, but he's"
1573.13,1576.99,Spike,the only one we've got with half a brain.
1577.02,1581.26,Spike,"If he fails, you can eat his eyes"
1577.02,1581.26,Spike,out of the sockets for all I care.
1581.3,1584.32,Dalton,I'll get it. Please.
1585.65,1587.61,Dalton,I swear.
1596.18,1598.12,Drusilla,OK.
1599.84,1602.32,Drusilla,"Hurry back, then."
1636.87,1640.02,Angel,I should go the rest of the way alone.
1641.25,1643.09,Buffy,OK.
1643.13,1646.07,Angel,But I'll be back. I will.
1646.26,1649.85,Buffy,When? Six months? A year?
1650.64,1652.88,Buffy,"You don't know how long it's gonna take,"
1652.88,1654.11,Angel,or... if we'll even...
1654.39,1656.41,Angel,Hey...
1656.45,1658.67,Angel,If we'll even what?
1660.65,1664.63,Buffy,"Well, if you haven't noticed,"
1660.65,1664.63,Buffy,someone pretty much always wants us dead.
1664.67,1667.88,Angel,Don't say that. We'll be fine.
1668.79,1670.95,Buffy,We don't know that.
1671.29,1673.2,Buffy,"We can't know, Buffy."
1673.2,1676.19,Angel,Nobody can. That's just the deal.
1681.93,1685.05,Angel,I have somethin' for you.
1681.93,1685.05,Angel,For your birthday.
1685.09,1689.04,Angel,I... was gonna give it
1685.09,1689.04,Angel,"to you earlier, but..."
1692.56,1694.9,Buffy,It's beautiful.
1695.07,1700.55,Angel,"My people... Before I was changed,"
1695.07,1700.55,Angel,they exchanged this as a sign of devotion.
1701.95,1704.29,Angel,It's a Claddagh ring.
1705.7,1710.18,Angel,"The hands represent friendship,"
1705.7,1710.18,Angel,the crown represents loyalty.
1711.56,1714.26,Angel,And the heart...
1714.3,1716.3,Angel,"Well, you know."
1718.84,1722.05,Angel,Wear it with the heart
1718.84,1722.05,Angel,pointing towards you.
1722.08,1725.1,Angel,It means you belong to somebody.
1728.23,1730.68,Angel,Like this.
1740.54,1743,Angel,Put it on.
1755.14,1757.81,Buffy,I don't wanna do this.
1757.81,1759.02,Angel,Me either.
1759.05,1761.94,Buffy,So don't go.
1782.67,1785.34,Angel,Buffy?
1786.22,1787.82,Angel,I...
1811.88,1813.91,Buffy,Angel! The box!
1822.62,1824.69,Buffy,You...
1836.38,1838.42,Angel,Buffy!
1844.62,1846.16,Giles,They should be back by now.
1846.39,1850.15,Willow,Maybe Buffy needed a few minutes
1846.39,1850.15,Willow,to pull herself together.
1850.18,1853.23,Willow,Poor Buffy. On her birthday and everything.
1853.27,1856.98,Xander,"It's sad, granted. But let's look"
1853.27,1856.98,Xander,at the upside for a moment.
1857.02,1859.75,Xander,"I mean, what kind of a future"
1857.02,1859.75,Xander,would she've really had with him?
1859.79,1862.76,Xander,She's got two jobs 
1859.79,1862.76,Xander,"Denny's waitress by day, Slayer by night."
1862.8,1865.36,Xander,And Angel's always in front of the TV
1862.8,1865.36,Xander,with a big blood belly.
1865.36,1868.38,Xander,He's dreamin' of the glory days
1865.36,1868.38,Xander,when Buffy still thought
1868.41,1871.12,Xander,this whole creatureofthenight routine
1868.41,1871.12,Xander,was a big turnon.
1871.16,1873.13,Willow,You've thought way too much about this.
1873.14,1875.3,Xander,"No, no. That's just the beginning."
1873.14,1875.3,Xander,Have I told you the part
1875.33,1878.83,Xander,where I fly into town in my private jet
1875.33,1878.83,Xander,and take Buffy out for prime rib?
1878.84,1879.91,Willow,Xander...
1879.91,1881.58,Xander,And she cries?
1882.52,1884.54,Giles,What happened?
1884.66,1887.03,Buffy,Dru's guys ambushed us.
1884.66,1887.03,Buffy,They got the box.
1888.14,1888.78,Giles,Where's Jenny?
1888.78,1890.38,Buffy,"Uh, she took Angel to get clothing."
1890.41,1891.53,Buffy,II had some here.
1891.53,1893.7,Xander,And we needed clothes because...?
1893.73,1896.38,Buffy,We got wet.
1896.46,1897.71,Buffy,"Giles, what do we know?"
1897.71,1899.17,Giles,"The more I study the Judge,"
1899.2,1904.9,Giles,the less I like him. His touch can
1899.2,1904.9,Giles,literally burn the humanity out of you.
1904.93,1908.89,Giles,A true creature of evil can survive
1904.93,1908.89,Giles,the process. No human ever has.
1908.92,1912.6,Xander,What's the problem? We send Cordy
1908.92,1912.6,Xander,"to fight this guy, and we go for pizza."
1913.03,1915.77,Buffy,Can this guy be stopped? Without an army?
1916.16,1921.27,Giles,Erm... "No weapon forged can kill him."
1916.16,1921.27,Giles,Not very encouraging.
1921.3,1923.67,Giles,If we could only stop them
1921.3,1923.67,Giles,from assembling him.
1923.7,1926.5,Buffy,"We need to find his weak spots, and we need"
1923.7,1926.5,Buffy,to figure out where they'd be keeping him.
1926.53,1927.89,Giles,This could take time.
1927.89,1929.45,Willow,Better do a round robin.
1929.48,1930.67,Willow,"Xander, you go first."
1930.67,1931.23,Buffy,Good call.
1931.23,1932.06,Giles,Round robin?
1932.06,1933.8,Willow,It's when everybody calls
1933.84,1937.29,Willow,everybody else's mom and tells them
1933.84,1937.29,Willow,they're staying at everyone's house.
1937.34,1939.8,Buffy,Thus freeing us up for world saveage.
1939.8,1942.17,Willow,And allnight keggers.
1942.44,1945.31,Willow,"What, only Xander gets"
1942.44,1945.31,Willow,to make dumb jokes?
1945.34,1949.31,Xander,"Mom, hi... Xander... Yeah, uh..."
1949.31,1952.27,Xander,Willow and I are gonna be studying
1949.31,1952.27,Xander,"all night long, so I'm not gonna be..."
1957.36,1959.86,Xander,I think I read this already.
1959.9,1962.69,Willow,I can't get over
1959.9,1962.69,Willow,how cool Oz was about all this.
1962.73,1964.5,Xander,"Gee, I'm over it."
1964.57,1968.12,Willow,You're just jealous 'cause
1964.57,1968.12,Willow,you didn't have a date for the party.
1968.32,1970.72,Xander,"No, I sure didn't."
1972.08,1974.45,Giles,Angel? Any luck?
1983.97,1985.8,Giles,It seems Buffy needed some rest.
1985.84,1989.42,Angel,Yeah. She hasn't been sleeping well.
1985.84,1989.42,Angel,Tossing and turning.
1990.95,1994.35,Angel,She told me! 'Cause of her dreams?
2037.78,2039.7,Drusilla,"Now, now!"
2040.28,2045.02,Drusilla,"Hands off my presents,"
2043.51,2045.03,Buffy,No!
2045.07,2045.87,Buffy,Angel!
2045.87,2047.87,Angel,"Buffy, it's OK."
2047.91,2050.11,Angel,I'm here. I'm right here.
2055.8,2058.22,Drusilla,More music!

2136.52,2137.2,Judge,You...
2137.2,2139.11,Spike,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
2139.65,2141.74,Spike,"What's that, mate?"
2141.74,2145.12,Judge,You two stink... of humanity.
2145.28,2148.41,Judge,You share affection and... jealousy.
2148.45,2151.28,Spike,Yeah! What of it?
2152.79,2157.4,Spike,Do I have to remind you that
2152.79,2157.4,Spike,we're the ones who brought you here?
2157.8,2160.66,Drusilla,Would you like a party favour?
2164.05,2168.74,Judge,This one is full of feeling.
2164.05,2168.74,Judge,He reads. Bring him to me!
2169.06,2172.74,Spike,What's with the bringing?
2169.06,2172.74,Spike,I thought you could just... zap people.
2172.77,2178.2,Judge,My full strength will return in time.
2172.77,2178.2,Judge,"Until then, I need contact."
2178.24,2182.02,Dalton,No! No! No!
2187.21,2190.08,Dalton,No! No!
2196.59,2199.42,Drusilla,Do it again! Do it again!
2204.88,2205.95,Giles,"Buffy, what's happening?"
2205.95,2206.93,Angel,She had another dream.
2206.93,2208.84,Buffy,I think I know
2206.93,2208.84,Buffy,where Spike and Drusilla are.
2208.88,2211.65,Giles,That's very good.
2208.88,2211.65,Giles,"However, you... you do need a plan."
2211.65,2214.03,Giles,"II know you're concerned, Buffy,"
2211.65,2214.03,Giles,but you can't just go off halfcocked.
2214.07,2217.22,Buffy,I have a plan. Angel and I
2214.07,2217.22,Buffy,"go to the factory and do recon,"
2217.25,2219.2,Buffy,figure out how far they've gotten
2217.25,2219.2,Buffy,assembling the Judge.
2219.24,2221.7,Buffy,"You, guys, check any places"
2219.24,2221.7,Buffy,the boxes could be coming into town 
2221.7,2224.08,Buffy,"shipping yards, airports, anything."
2224.12,2226.64,Buffy,We need to stop them
2224.12,2226.64,Buffy,from getting all the boxes in one place.
2227.25,2230.51,Giles,"Yes... Yes, well,"
2227.25,2230.51,Giles,actually that's quite a good plan.
2230.55,2234.65,Buffy,"This thing is nasty and it's real, Giles."
2230.55,2234.65,Buffy,We can't wait for it to come get us.
2234.76,2236.6,Giles,Right.
2264.86,2267.43,Buffy,I saw this. The party.
2277.48,2281.31,Spike,What? What is it?
2288.12,2290.16,Angel,We gotta get outta here.
2292.4,2295.92,Spike,"Well, well. Look what we have here."
2296.88,2298.09,Spike,Crashers.
2298.09,2300.49,Buffy,I'm sure our invitations
2298.09,2300.49,Buffy,just got lost in the mail.
2300.63,2307.02,Drusilla,It's delicious.
2300.63,2307.02,Drusilla,I only dreamed you'd come.
2307.02,2307.42,Angel,Leave her alone!
2307.42,2307.9,Spike,"Yeah, that'll work."
2308,2310.84,Spike,Now say "pretty please".
2311.27,2312.04,Judge,The girl?
2312.04,2313.68,Drusilla,"Chilling, isn't it?"
2313.71,2316.14,Drusilla,She's so full of good intention.
2316.17,2318.55,Drusilla,Take me. Take me instead of her.
2318.55,2318.77,Buffy,No!
2318.8,2322.52,Spike,"Uh, you're not clear on the concept, pal."
2318.8,2322.52,Spike,There is no "instead".
2323.16,2324.94,Spike,Just first and second.
2324.94,2326.55,Drusilla,"And if you go first,"
2326.58,2329.44,Drusilla,you don't get to watch the Slayer die.
2340.68,2342.51,Angel,Don't touch him!
2352.99,2354.65,Buffy,This way!
2361.85,2363.36,Drusilla,Go!
2396.2,2398.8,Angel,Come on. We need to get inside.
2413.72,2417.69,Angel,You're shaking like a leaf.
2417.69,2419.02,Buffy,I'm cold.
2417.05,2419.42,Angel,Let me get you somethin'.
2425.61,2429.68,Angel,Put these on.
2425.61,2429.68,Angel,Get under the covers just to warm up.
2440.63,2442.94,Angel,Sorry.
2447.57,2449.26,Angel,What?
2449.3,2450.81,Buffy,"Oh, um..."
2450.81,2453.8,Buffy,It's OK.
2450.81,2453.8,Buffy,I just have a cut or something.
2454.04,2455.96,Angel,Can I...
2456.9,2459.42,Angel,Let me see.
2460.65,2462.49,Buffy,OK.
2480.05,2483.82,Angel,It's already closed. You're fine.
2498.1,2501.43,Buffy,You almost went away today.
2501.46,2504.12,Angel,We both did.
2505.08,2507.73,,Angel...
2508.21,2511.93,,I feel like I lost you.
2517.6,2520.28,,"You're right, though."
2521.35,2524.52,,We can't be sure of anything...
2521.35,2524.52,,Shhh.
2529.49,2531.32,,I...
2542,2544.34,,You what?
2547.43,2549.84,,I love you.
2550.13,2552.72,,"I try not to, but I can't stop."
2552.75,2555.12,,Me... Me too.
2555.77,2558.47,,I can't either.
2572.66,2574.79,,"Buffy, maybe we shouldn't..."
2572.66,2574.79,,Don't.
2576.02,2578.71,,Just kiss me.
