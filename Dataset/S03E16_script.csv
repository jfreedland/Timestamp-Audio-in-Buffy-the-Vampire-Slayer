3.66,5.89,D'Hoffryn,Do not ask again.
7.87,10.13,D'Hoffryn,Your powers were a gift
7.87,10.13,D'Hoffryn,of the lower beings.
10.2,12.26,D'Hoffryn,You have proved
10.2,12.26,D'Hoffryn,unworthy of them.
12.34,13.46,Anya,I was robbed of them.
13.54,15.66,D'Hoffryn,By your carelessness.
15.74,17.26,D'Hoffryn,"For 1,000 years"
17.34,19.47,Anya,I wielded the powers
17.34,19.47,Anya,of the wish.
19.54,20.6,D'Hoffryn,I brought ruin
20.68,22.51,Anya,to the heads of
20.68,22.51,Anya,unfaithful men.
22.58,24.95,Anya,I brought forth
22.58,24.95,Anya,destruction and chaos
25.02,26.81,Anya,for the pleasure
25.02,26.81,Anya,of the lower beings.
26.88,28.11,Anya,I was feared
26.88,28.11,Anya,and worshipped
28.19,29.68,Anya,across the mortal globe.
29.75,33.19,Anya,And now I'm stuck
29.75,33.19,Anya,at Sunnydale High.
33.26,35.19,D'Hoffryn,Mortal.
35.26,37.73,D'Hoffryn,Child.
37.8,39.56,D'Hoffryn,And I'm flunking math.
39.63,41.5,D'Hoffryn,This is no concern of ours.
41.57,44.36,D'Hoffryn,You will live out
41.57,44.36,D'Hoffryn,your mortal life and die.
44.44,45.66,Anya,Give me another chance.
45.74,47.03,Anya,You can fold
45.74,47.03,Anya,the fabric of time.
47.1,48.23,Anya,Send me back
47.1,48.23,Anya,to that place
48.31,49.7,Anya,and I'll change it.
49.77,51.87,Anya,I won't fail again.
51.94,53.77,D'Hoffryn,Your time is passed.
53.84,57.14,Anya,Do you have any idea
53.84,57.14,Anya,how boring 12th graders are?
57.21,59.68,Anya,I'm getting
57.21,59.68,Anya,my power center back.
59.75,60.84,Anya,And if you
59.75,60.84,Anya,"won't help me,"
60.92,61.89,Anya,then by
60.92,61.89,Anya,"the pestilent gods,"
61.95,63.32,Anya,I will find someone
61.95,63.32,Anya,who will.
71.36,74.16,Buffy,The Watcher Council shrink
71.36,74.16,Buffy,is heavy into tests.
74.23,75.76,Buffy,He's got tests
74.23,75.76,Buffy,for everything.
75.83,77.23,Buffy,"T.A.T. s, Rorschach,"
77.3,79.96,Buffy,associative logic.
80.04,81.66,Buffy,He even has that test
80.04,81.66,Buffy,to see if you're crazy
81.74,83.07,Buffy,that asks if you
81.74,83.07,Buffy,ever hear voices
83.14,84.44,Buffy,or you ever wanted
83.14,84.44,Buffy,to be a florist.
84.51,86.53,Willow,"Ooh, I used to want..."
84.51,86.53,Willow,Wait.
86.61,88.58,Willow,"Florist means crazy, right?"
88.65,90.44,Willow,I never wanted to do that.
90.51,92.21,Buffy,Neat.
92.28,94.3,Willow,Thanks. It's all about
94.3,95.95,Buffy,emotional control.
96.02,98.58,,"Plus, obviously, magic."
98.66,100.42,,"Hey, you want to go"
98.66,100.42,,to the espresso pump
100.49,102.58,,and get sugared up on mochas?
102.66,104.36,,I'm gonna pass.
102.66,104.36,,Hit the pool and do some laps.
104.43,106.59,,How come the sudden
104.43,106.59,,calisthenics?
106.66,109.5,,Aren't you sort of
106.66,109.5,,"naturally buff, Buff?"
109.57,111.19,,
109.57,111.19,,Buff Buff.
111.27,113.57,,"Well, they've got us running around"
111.27,113.57,,"on the physical side, too."
113.64,115.3,,A lot of reflex
113.64,115.3,,evaluation
115.37,116.43,,"and precision training,"
115.37,116.43,,you know.
116.51,118.5,,"I just... Well,"
116.51,118.5,,I want to do...
118.58,120.2,Willow,Better than Faith?
121.78,123.18,Buffy,So very shallow.
123.25,126.88,Willow,Competition is
123.25,126.88,Willow,natural and healthy.
126.95,129.08,Willow,"Plus, you'll definitely ace her"
126.95,129.08,Willow,on the psych tests.
129.15,131.28,Willow,Just don't mark
129.15,131.28,Willow,the box that says
131.36,133.32,Willow,I sometimes like to kill people."
133.39,136.33,Buffy,I know Faith's not
133.39,136.33,Buffy,gonna be on the cover
136.39,137.69,Buffy,"of Sanity Fair,"
137.76,139.82,Buffy,but she had it rough.
139.9,141.32,Willow,"Different circumstances,"
141.32,142.33,Buffy,that could be me.
142.4,143.46,Willow,No way.
143.53,146.37,Willow,Some people just don't
143.53,146.37,Willow,have that in them.
146.44,148.23,Willow,"Look, I'm sorry."
148.31,150.3,Willow,I know how you hate
148.31,150.3,Willow,talking about Faith.
150.37,152.14,Willow,"No, it's OK."
152.21,153.3,Buffy,"No, really,"
152.21,153.3,Buffy,we should just...
153.38,155.71,Willow,No. It doesn't bother me.
153.38,155.71,Willow,I mean it.
155.78,160.02,Buffy,"Uh, Will?"
159.15,160.08,Willow,Oh.
166.69,167.85,Buffy,Emotional control?
167.93,169.92,Willow,I'm working on it.

228.44,230.17,Snyder,"As far as I'm concerned,"
230.24,233.18,Snyder,this is a marriage
230.24,233.18,Snyder,made in heaven.
233.25,234.91,Willow,"Willow Rosenberg,"
234.98,237.34,Willow,despite her unsavory
237.34,238.88,Snyder,"associations,"
238.95,241.58,Snyder,represents the pinnacle
238.95,241.58,Snyder,of academic achievement
241.65,242.88,Willow,at Sunnydale High.
242.96,244.59,Willow,Percy West represents
244.59,246.45,Snyder,a devastating fast break
246.53,248.88,Snyder,and 50% from behind
248.88,250.86,Willow,the 3point line.
250.93,253.87,Willow,I'm not sure I understand
250.93,253.87,Willow,the marriage part.
253.93,255.33,Snyder,"You've got the brains,"
255.4,257.37,Snyder,he's got the fast break.
257.44,258.93,Willow,It's a perfect match.
261.02,262,Willow,Match?
262.08,264.2,Willow,You want us to breed?
264.28,266.04,Snyder,I want you to tutor him.
266.11,269.57,Snyder,Percy is flunking
266.11,269.57,Snyder,history.
269.65,272.28,Snyder,Nothing seems to be able
269.65,272.28,Snyder,to motivate him.
272.35,273.68,Percy,"Hey, I'm challenged."
273.75,276.15,Snyder,"You're lazy, selfinvolved,"
273.75,276.15,Snyder,and spoiled.
276.22,277.15,Snyder,That's quite
276.22,277.15,Snyder,the challenge.
277.22,280.02,Snyder,But we need
277.22,280.02,Snyder,"a winning year,"
280.09,281.69,Snyder,especially after last year's debacle
281.69,282.53,Willow,with the swim team.
282.6,283.3,Willow,Can't have our
283.3,284.29,Snyder,point guard benched.
284.36,285.78,Snyder,"So, you're gonna take on"
285.78,287.09,Willow,a little teaching job.
287.17,287.89,Willow,I know how you
287.89,288.66,Snyder,enjoy teaching.
288.74,291.26,Willow,"Well, I have a lot"
288.74,291.26,Willow,of work of my own.
291.34,292.67,Snyder,You've got a letter
291.34,292.67,Snyder,of acceptance
292.74,294.3,Snyder,from every university
292.74,294.3,Snyder,with a stamp.
294.37,297.21,Willow,"Yes, but I still have"
294.37,297.21,Willow,classes and I don't...
297.28,298.21,Snyder,Rosenberg...
298.28,299.75,Snyder,it's time to give
298.28,299.75,Snyder,something back
299.81,302.41,Snyder,to the community.
302.48,305.78,Snyder,I know you want to help
302.48,305.78,Snyder,your school out here.
305.85,309.02,Snyder,Ask me how I know.
307.09,308.14,Willow,How do you...
308.22,311.49,Snyder,I just know.
311.56,314.86,Buffy,So he threatened you?
311.56,314.86,Buffy,With what?
314.93,317.83,Willow,"Well, it wasn't exactly"
314.93,317.83,Willow,anything he said.
317.9,319.49,Willow,It was all in his eyes.
319.57,321.4,Willow,"I mean, there was some"
319.57,321.4,Willow,"nostril work as well,"
321.47,322.99,Willow,but mostly eyes.
323.07,325.2,Buffy,Snyder needs me
323.07,325.2,Buffy,to kick his ass.
325.27,327.07,Willow,"Oh, no, Buffy,"
325.27,327.07,Willow,don't get in trouble.
327.14,328.3,Willow,I'll be OK.
328.37,331.34,Willow,I just hate the way
328.37,331.34,Willow,he bullies people.
331.41,334.14,Willow,He just assumes
331.41,334.14,Willow,everyone's time is his.
334.21,335.7,Giles,"Willow, get on"
334.21,335.7,Giles,the computer.
335.78,337.08,Giles,I want you to
335.78,337.08,Giles,take another pass
337.15,338.34,Giles,at accessing
337.15,338.34,Giles,the mayor's files.
338.42,340.22,Willow,OK.
340.29,342.12,Faith,"Well, that"
340.29,342.12,Faith,was a blast.
342.19,343.38,Giles,How did it go?
343.46,344.48,Faith,Princess Margaret here
344.56,346.89,Faith,had a little trouble
344.56,346.89,Faith,keeping up.
347.96,349.36,Giles,How did it go?
349.43,349.43,Giles,
349.43,352.06,Wesley,"Faith, uh..."
352.13,354.07,Wesley,did quite well on
352.13,354.07,Wesley,the obstacle field.
354.13,355.73,Wesley,Still a little
354.13,355.73,Wesley,"sloppy, though."
355.8,359.47,Giles,Do you feel up to taking
355.8,359.47,Giles,"Buffy out, or shall I?"
359.54,361.44,Wesley,"Oh, no, no, no,"
359.54,361.44,Wesley,I'll be fine.
361.51,363.81,Wesley,Just give me
361.51,363.81,Wesley,a minute.
363.88,365.37,Wesley,And some
363.88,365.37,Wesley,"defibrillators,"
365.45,366.74,Wesley,if it's not
365.45,366.74,Wesley,too much trouble.
366.81,368.08,Faith,You're gonna
366.81,368.08,Faith,"love it, B."
368.15,370.55,Faith,"It's just like fun,"
368.15,370.55,Faith,only boring.
370.62,372.38,Giles,"Faith, this evaluation"
372.45,373.78,Giles,is a necessary part
372.45,373.78,Giles,of the Council.
373.85,375.68,Faith,I know.
373.85,375.68,Faith,I'm on board here.
375.76,376.88,Faith,Just shooting
375.76,376.88,Faith,my mouth off.
376.96,379.55,Buffy,I better change.
381.96,383.43,Faith,Good luck.
390.57,393.27,Faith,What you doing?
393.34,396.4,Willow,I'm trying to access
393.34,396.4,Willow,the mayor's personal files.
396.48,398.17,Faith,Can you do that?
398.24,401.15,Willow,"Well, he's got some"
398.24,401.15,Willow,tricky barriers set up.
401.21,402.84,Faith,Can you get past 'em?
402.92,405.48,Willow,"Eventually,"
402.92,405.48,Willow,I'll get through.
408.99,410.58,Mayor Wilkins,That's very interesting.
410.66,412.32,Faith,"Yeah, I thought so, too."
412.39,414.26,Faith,Are you serious
412.39,414.26,Faith,about this place?
414.33,416.06,Mayor Wilkins,Of course I am.
414.33,416.06,Mayor Wilkins,No slayer of mine
416.13,417.79,Mayor Wilkins,is gonna live in
416.13,417.79,Mayor Wilkins,a fleabag hotel.
417.86,420.46,Mayor Wilkins,That place has a very
417.86,420.46,Mayor Wilkins,unsavory reputation.
420.53,423.09,Mayor Wilkins,There are immoral liaisons
420.53,423.09,Mayor Wilkins,going on there.
423.17,424.73,Faith,"Yeah, plus"
423.17,424.73,Faith,all the screwing.
424.8,426.33,Faith,This place is the kick.
426.41,427.46,Mayor Wilkins,"We'll keep your old place,"
427.54,428.8,Mayor Wilkins,in case you need to see
427.54,428.8,Mayor Wilkins,"your friends there,"
428.88,430.17,Mayor Wilkins,but from now on...
430.24,432.07,Mayor Wilkins,"Oh, hey."
430.24,432.07,Mayor Wilkins,"Hey, hey, shoes. Shoes."
434.35,435.51,Faith,"Thanks, sugar daddy."
435.58,438.02,Mayor Wilkins,"Now, Faith, I don't find"
435.58,438.02,Mayor Wilkins,that sort of thing amusing.
438.08,439.52,Mayor Wilkins,I'm a family man.
440.82,442.48,Mayor Wilkins,"Now, let's kill"
440.82,442.48,Mayor Wilkins,your little friend.
444.56,446.72,Mayor Wilkins,Don't worry. I wouldn't
444.56,446.72,Mayor Wilkins,ask you to do it.
446.79,448.85,Mayor Wilkins,Not this early in
446.79,448.85,Mayor Wilkins,the relationship.
448.93,451.29,Mayor Wilkins,"Besides, I think"
448.93,451.29,Mayor Wilkins,a vampire attack
451.36,453.66,Mayor Wilkins,would be less suspicious
453.66,454.33,Faith,anyway.
454.4,455.46,Faith,"In the meantime,"
454.4,455.46,Faith,let's take a look
455.54,456.66,Faith,at the rest of
455.54,456.66,Faith,"the apartment, huh?"
456.74,458.64,Faith,"If I'm not mistaken,"
456.74,458.64,Faith,some lucky girl
458.7,460.64,Faith,has herself
458.7,460.64,Faith,a Play Station.
460.71,461.64,Faith,No way.
461.71,463.64,Mayor Wilkins,Yes way.
466.45,467.74,Oz,Hey.
467.81,471.02,Willow,Oz. Hi.
469.08,470.21,Oz,There's something
469.08,470.21,Oz,about you
470.28,472.58,Oz,that's causing me
470.28,472.58,Oz,to hug you.
472.65,475.52,Oz,It's like I have
472.65,475.52,Oz,no will of my own.
475.59,477.95,Willow,Where were you yesterday?
478.02,480.46,Oz,"We got back late,"
478.02,480.46,Oz,sort of very.
480.53,482.36,Willow,We? Who? Where?
482.43,485.3,Oz,The band. We had a gig
482.43,485.3,Oz,in Monterey Sunday night.
485.36,487.39,Willow,"Oh, you did?"
487.47,489.09,Willow,How come I didn't know?
489.17,490.66,Oz,I thought you did.
490.74,493.67,Willow,Maybe I would
490.74,493.67,Willow,have liked to go.
493.74,496.04,Oz,Didn't figure you
493.74,496.04,Oz,for missing school.
496.11,497.41,Willow,You think I'm boring.
497.48,500.5,Oz,I'd call that a radical
497.48,500.5,Oz,interpretation of the text.
502.62,504.45,Oz,We're playing tonight
502.62,504.45,Oz,at The Bronze.
504.52,507.78,Willow,I can't. I have
504.52,507.78,Willow,too much homework.
507.85,509.38,Oz,If you get done early...
514.79,516.85,Willow,Percy. Hey.
516.93,519.4,Willow,"Listen, I thought we could"
516.93,519.4,Willow,get together today at lunch
519.47,522.13,Willow,and go over
519.47,522.13,Willow,your Roosevelt paper.
522.2,524,Willow,"You know, what books"
522.2,524,Willow,you'll need and stuff.
524.07,525.37,Percy,What are you
524.07,525.37,Percy,talking about?
525.44,527.63,Willow,Me tutoring you.
525.44,527.63,Willow,Your history paper?
527.71,532.02,Percy,"Oh, yeah. Snyder said"
527.71,532.02,Percy,you were gonna do it.
530.08,532.27,Willow,He never said that.
532.35,534.31,Percy,What meeting
532.35,534.31,Percy,were you at?
534.38,536.25,Willow,"Look, I'll get"
534.38,536.25,Willow,the books you need.
536.32,537.41,Willow,Just meet me at lunch
536.32,537.41,Willow,and we'll...
537.48,538.88,Percy,"No, no, no. I don't"
537.48,538.88,Percy,have any time at lunch.
538.95,540.15,Percy,I gotta hang out.
540.22,541.15,Willow,Well...
541.22,543.59,Percy,"What, you got something"
541.22,543.59,Percy,better to do?
543.66,545.72,Percy,Just type it up
543.66,545.72,Percy,and put my name on it.
545.79,548.45,Percy,"Oh, and don't type too good."
545.79,548.45,Percy,Dead giveaway.
561.67,563.47,Willow,I'm eating this now.
563.54,566.34,Willow,"It's not lunchtime,"
563.54,566.34,Willow,I don't even care.
566.41,567.1,Buffy,Hey.
567.1,568.31,Xander,"Willow,"
568.38,569.51,Xander,did you remember
568.38,569.51,Xander,to tape
569.58,570.67,Xander,Biography last Friday?
570.75,574.02,Willow,Uhhuh.
572.08,574.99,Buffy,"See, I told you."
572.08,574.99,Buffy,Old Reliable.
575.05,576.78,Willow,"Oh, thanks."
576.86,577.82,Buffy,What?
577.89,579.79,Willow,Old Reliable?
577.89,579.79,Willow,"Yeah, great."
579.86,583.3,Willow,There's a sexy
579.86,583.3,Willow,nickname.
583.36,585.16,Buffy,"Well, I didn't"
583.36,585.16,Buffy,mean it as...
585.23,588.06,Willow,"No, it's fine."
585.23,588.06,Willow,I'm Old Reliable.
588.13,589.33,Xander,"She just means,"
588.13,589.33,Xander,"you know,"
589.4,591.37,Xander,the geyser. You're
589.4,591.37,Xander,like a geyser of fun
591.44,593.67,Xander,that goes off at
591.44,593.67,Xander,regular intervals.
593.74,595.47,Willow,That's Old Faithful.
595.54,597.3,Xander,Isn't that the dog
595.54,597.3,Xander,that the guy had to shoot...
597.38,598.64,Willow,That's Old Yeller.
598.71,600.77,Buffy,"Xander, I beg you"
598.71,600.77,Buffy,not to help me.
600.85,603.11,Buffy,"Will, I didn't mean it"
600.85,603.11,Buffy,as a bad thing.
603.18,604.77,Buffy,I think it's good
603.18,604.77,Buffy,to be reliable.
604.85,609.02,Willow,"Well, maybe"
604.85,609.02,Willow,I don't want to be
607.09,609.02,Willow,reliable all the time.
609.09,612.55,Willow,Maybe I'm not just
609.09,612.55,Willow,some doormat person.
612.63,614.02,Willow,Homework gal.
614.09,616.86,Xander,I'm thinking
614.09,616.86,Xander,nerve strike.
619.03,620.73,Willow,Maybe I'll
619.03,620.73,Willow,change my look.
620.8,622.93,Willow,Or cut class.
620.8,622.93,Willow,You don't know.
624.2,625.9,Willow,And I'm eating
624.2,625.9,Willow,this banana.
625.97,627.94,Buffy,Lunchtime be damned.
629.74,630.61,Buffy,"Will, wait."
630.68,631.61,Buffy,I'm really sorry.
631.68,634.31,Willow,"Buff, I'm storming off."
634.38,637.61,Willow,It doesn't really work
634.38,637.61,Willow,if you come with me.
637.68,639.31,Buffy,Oh.
650.46,652.69,Anya,"Uh, Willow?"
652.77,655.1,Willow,"Uh, hi."
655.17,657.66,Anya,Anya. I'm sort of
655.17,657.66,Anya,new here.
657.74,659.14,Anya,"Um, I know Cordelia."
659.21,661.3,Willow,"Oh, fun."
661.37,663.74,Anya,"Yeah. Um, listen,"
663.81,665.78,Anya,I have this little
663.81,665.78,Anya,"project I'm working on,"
665.85,667.51,Anya,and I heard you were
665.85,667.51,Anya,the person to ask...
667.58,671.24,Willow,"Yeah, that's me."
667.58,671.24,Willow,Reliable dog geyser person.
671.32,672.75,Willow,What do you need?
672.82,674.01,Anya,"Oh, it's nothing big."
674.09,676.21,Anya,Just a little spell
674.09,676.21,Anya,I'm working on.
676.29,677.62,Willow,A spell?
677.69,680.52,Anya,Oh. I like the black arts.
680.59,683.19,Anya,I just need a secondary
680.59,683.19,Anya,to create a temporal fold.
683.26,684.99,Anya,I heard you were
683.26,684.99,Anya,"a pretty powerful wicca, so..."
685.06,687.26,Willow,"You heard right, mister."
687.33,690.67,Willow,I'm always ready to work
687.33,690.67,Willow,some dark mojo.
690.74,693.47,Willow,"So, tell me,"
690.74,693.47,Willow,is it dangerous?
693.54,695.8,Anya,"Oh, no."
695.88,699.21,Willow,"Well, could we"
695.88,699.21,Willow,pretend it is?
700.31,701.94,Anya,The necklace was
700.31,701.94,Anya,a family heirloom
702.02,704.14,Anya,passed down for generations.
704.22,706.81,Anya,Then it was stolen
704.22,706.81,Anya,from my mom's apartment.
706.89,708.65,Willow,How does the spell work?
708.72,711.02,Anya,"Uh, well..."
711.09,713.99,Anya,"we both call on Eryishon,"
711.09,713.99,Anya,the endless one...
714.06,716.46,Anya,offer up the standard
714.06,716.46,Anya,"supplication,"
716.53,719.97,Anya,then there's a teensy
716.53,719.97,Anya,temporal fold... we hope.
720.03,723.03,Anya,"Um, then I pour"
720.03,723.03,Anya,the sacred sand
723.1,724.54,Anya,on the representation
723.1,724.54,Anya,"of the necklace,"
724.6,728.02,Anya,and Eryishon brings it forth
726.07,730.02,Anya,from the time and place
726.07,730.02,Anya,it was lost.
728.07,729.54,Willow,Cool.
729.61,730.87,Anya,Are we ready?
730.94,732.74,Willow,I think so.
734.91,736.94,Anya,Eryishon. K'shala.
734.91,736.94,Anya,Mehuhn.
737.02,740.11,Willow,Diprecht. Dohtehenlo
737.02,740.11,Willow,nuEryishon.
742.19,743.95,Anya,The child to the mother.
744.02,745.55,Willow,The river to the sea.
745.63,747.32,Anya,"Eryishon, hear my prayer."
783.43,786.26,Willow,That was... What was that?
786.33,788.2,Anya,"Oh, it's not here."
789.94,790.87,Anya,It's not here.
790.94,793.57,Willow,"OK, that's"
790.94,793.57,Willow,a little blacker
793.64,794.87,Willow,than I like my arts.
794.94,796.84,Anya,"Oh, don't be such a wimp."
796.91,799.88,Willow,That wasn't just
796.91,799.88,Willow,"some temporal fold,"
799.95,801.78,Willow,that was some weird
799.95,801.78,Willow,hell place.
801.85,804.72,Willow,I don't think you're
801.85,804.72,Willow,telling me everything.
804.78,808.08,Anya,"I swear, I am just trying"
804.78,808.08,Anya,to find my necklace.
808.15,811.18,Willow,"Well, did you try looking"
808.15,811.18,Willow,inside the sofa in hell?
811.26,814.28,Anya,"Look, we'll just"
811.26,814.28,Anya,"try it again, and..."
814.36,817.16,Willow,No. I think
814.36,817.16,Willow,emphatically not.
817.23,818.96,Anya,I can't do it by myself.
819.03,820.29,Willow,That's a relief.
820.37,821.46,Willow,I'm out of here.
821.53,823.56,Anya,Fine. Go.
823.64,824.86,Anya,Idiot child.
826.74,829.11,Willow,I believe these
826.74,829.11,Willow,chicken feet are mine.
829.18,830.8,Willow,Look...
830.88,833.31,Willow,"magic is dangerous,"
830.88,833.31,Willow,Anya.
833.38,835.97,Willow,It's not to be
833.38,835.97,Willow,toyed with.
836.05,837.35,Willow,"Now, if you'll"
836.05,837.35,Willow,"excuse me,"
837.42,839.18,Willow,I have someone else's
837.42,839.18,Willow,homework to do.
843.92,845.79,Anya,Nothing!
854.4,856.73,Evil Willow,This is weird.
894.74,896.04,Old woman,"Excuse me, young lady..."

1057.98,1061.11,Buffy,You know what?
1057.98,1061.11,Buffy,I like the look.
1061.19,1063.88,Buffy,"It's, um, it's extreme,"
1063.96,1066.36,Buffy,"but it looks good,"
1063.96,1066.36,Buffy,you know.
1066.43,1068.33,Buffy,It's a leather thing.
1068.39,1073.3,Buffy,"And, uh... I said extreme"
1068.39,1073.3,Buffy,"already, right?"
1076.64,1079.07,Evil Willow,I don't like you.
1080.54,1082.4,Buffy,"Will, I'm sorry"
1080.54,1082.4,Buffy,about today.
1082.47,1084.64,Buffy,You know how my foot
1082.47,1084.64,Buffy,"likes to live in my mouth,"
1084.71,1086.34,Buffy,"but you know,"
1086.41,1088.61,Buffy,you really didn't have
1086.41,1088.61,Buffy,to prove anything.
1090.22,1091.94,Evil Willow,Leaving now.
1092.02,1094.85,Xander,"Will, gotta say,"

1113.51,1115.8,Alfonse,Willow Rosenberg.
1115.87,1118.87,Evil Willow,I'm not supposed to
1115.87,1118.87,Evil Willow,talk to strangers.
1118.94,1120.14,Alfonse,Then we won't talk.
1135.93,1137.86,Evil Willow,You made me cranky.
1137.93,1140.19,Alfonse,There's been a mistake here.
1140.27,1142.26,Alfonse,We were sent after a human.
1142.33,1144.46,Evil Willow,Really?
1144.54,1145.76,Evil Willow,Who do you work for?
1145.84,1147.33,Alfonse,I'm not telling you
1145.84,1147.33,Alfonse,a thing.
1150.81,1151.74,Alfonse,Aah!
1153.45,1155.28,Evil Willow,Who do you work for?
1155.35,1158.32,Alfonse,Wilkins. The mayor.
1162.29,1164.02,Alfonse,Aah!
1164.09,1168.42,Evil Willow,Who do you work for?

1172.53,1174.06,Alfonse,Get your friends.
1174.13,1176.16,Evil Willow,Bring them here.
1176.23,1178.23,Evil Willow,The world's no fun anymore.
1180.34,1183.03,Evil Willow,We're gonna make it
1180.34,1183.03,Evil Willow,the way it was.
1183.11,1185.47,,Starting with The Bronze.
1189.61,1190.72,Alfonse,"Oh, Buffy. I thought you"
1190.72,1191.78,Giles,were going out tonight.
1191.85,1193.11,Giles,I didn't expect...
1197.46,1198.62,Giles,What is it?
1202.53,1204.09,Xander,This isn't real.
1206.36,1208.56,Buffy,I can't feel
1206.36,1208.56,Buffy,anything.
1208.63,1212.3,Buffy,"Arms, legs,"
1208.63,1212.3,Buffy,anything.
1212.37,1217.1,Giles,She was truly the finest
1212.37,1217.1,Giles,of all of us.
1219.04,1222.48,Xander,Way better than me.
1222.55,1224.95,Giles,"Much, much better."
1225.02,1226.92,Xander,It's all my fault.
1226.99,1230.15,Xander,"No, it's me."
1230.22,1231.59,Xander,It's me.
1231.66,1233.89,Buffy,I'm the one that
1231.66,1233.89,Buffy,called her reliable.
1233.96,1235.55,Buffy,She must have gone out
1233.96,1235.55,Buffy,"and gotten attacked,"
1235.63,1236.82,Buffy,which she never
1235.63,1236.82,Buffy,would have done
1236.9,1239.46,Buffy,if I hadn't have
1236.9,1239.46,Buffy,called her reliable.
1239.53,1241.09,Buffy,And now my best
1239.53,1241.09,Buffy,friend is...
1241.17,1242.66,Willow,What's going on?
1244.34,1245.46,Willow,"Geez, who died?"
1247.27,1249.54,Willow,"Oh, God. Who died?"
1249.61,1251.08,Xander,Back!
1251.14,1252.61,Xander,"Get back, demon."
1258.62,1260.88,Buffy,"Willow,"
1258.62,1260.88,Buffy,you're alive.
1260.95,1262.58,Willow,Aren't I usually?
1264.26,1265.31,Buffy,Oh!
1269.63,1271.56,Willow,"I love you guys, too."
1271.63,1275.53,Willow,OK. Oxygen becoming
1271.63,1275.53,Willow,an issue.
1279.17,1283.02,Willow,"Giles, what's going on"
1279.17,1283.02,Willow,with these...
1281.07,1283.04,Willow,Oh.
1283.11,1285.58,Giles,Oh. Sorry.
1287.71,1290.98,Willow,It's really nice that
1287.71,1290.98,Willow,you guys missed me.
1291.05,1293.21,Willow,"Say, you all didn't"
1291.05,1293.21,Willow,happen to do
1293.29,1294.42,Willow,"a bunch of drugs,"
1294.42,1294.95,Xander,did you?
1295.02,1297.78,Xander,"Will, we saw you"
1295.02,1297.78,Xander,at The Bronze.
1297.86,1299.15,Willow,A vampire.
1299.22,1301.62,Willow,I'm not a vampire.
1301.69,1306.22,Buffy,"You are. I mean,"
1301.69,1306.22,Buffy,you were.
1306.3,1307.09,Buffy,"Giles, planning on"
1307.09,1307.53,Giles,jumping in
1307.6,1308.46,Giles,with an explanation
1308.46,1309.09,Buffy,any time soon?
1309.17,1311.03,Giles,"Well, uh... something..."
1311.1,1315.7,Giles,something very strange
1311.1,1315.7,Giles,is happening.
1315.77,1319.07,Xander,Can you believe the Watcher's Council
1315.77,1319.07,Xander,let this guy go?
1325.88,1327.88,Anya,What a day.
1327.95,1329.58,Anya,Give me a beer.
1329.65,1331.32,Bartender,I.D.
1333.53,1335.29,Bartender,I.D.
1335.36,1339.16,Bartender,"I'm 1,120 years old."
1335.36,1339.16,Bartender,Just give me a friggin' beer.
1340.27,1341.7,Bartender,I.D.
1341.77,1344.03,Anya,Give me a Coke.
1345.74,1348.07,Devon,"Man, we need"
1345.74,1348.07,Devon,a roadie.
1348.14,1349.37,Devon,Other bands
1348.14,1349.37,Devon,have roadies.
1349.44,1351.77,Oz,"Well, other bands"
1349.44,1351.77,Oz,know more than 3 chords.
1351.84,1356.02,Oz,Your professional bands
1351.84,1356.02,Oz,"can play up to 6,"
1354.08,1356.1,Oz,sometimes 7 completely
1354.08,1356.1,Oz,different chords.
1356.18,1358.98,Devon,"That's just, like,"
1356.18,1358.98,Devon,fruity jazz bands.
1359.05,1360.35,Angel,Oz.
1360.42,1361.91,Oz,"Hey, man."
1361.99,1363.05,Oz,You looking
1361.99,1363.05,Oz,for Buffy?
1363.12,1364.09,Angel,As always.
1364.16,1366.56,Oz,"Well, no sightings"
1364.16,1366.56,Oz,"as of yet,"
1366.63,1367.75,Oz,but I think she
1366.63,1367.75,Oz,said she'd show.
1378.14,1379.93,Oz,That doesn't look good.
1382.02,1381.37,Alfonse,"Everybody, shut up."
1384.18,1385.87,Alfonse,All right.
1385.94,1388.57,Alfonse,Nobody cause any trouble
1385.94,1388.57,Alfonse,or try to leave...
1390.08,1391.81,Alfonse,and nobody gets hurt.
1391.88,1393.28,Angel,Why don't
1391.88,1393.28,Angel,I believe him?
1393.35,1395.41,Oz,"Well, he lacks"
1393.35,1395.41,Oz,credibility.
1398.89,1400.82,Oz,Can you get
1398.89,1400.82,Oz,out of here?
1400.89,1402.15,Angel,Skylight in the roof.
1402.23,1404.53,Angel,I can make it.
1404.6,1406.09,Oz,I think we need
1404.6,1406.09,Oz,some backup.
1406.16,1406.72,Oz,I think
1406.72,1408,Angel,I'm needed here.
1408.07,1410.16,Oz,Could get
1408.07,1410.16,Oz,pointless.
1430.99,1435.39,Evil Willow,Look. Everyone's
1430.99,1435.39,Evil Willow,all afraid.
1435.46,1438.02,Evil Willow,It's just like
1435.46,1438.02,Evil Willow,old times.
1441.43,1442.99,Oz,Get Buffy.
1443.07,1444.66,Oz,Do it now.
1449.61,1452.47,Devon,"Dude, check out"
1449.61,1452.47,Devon,your girlfriend.
1461.79,1463.21,Evil Willow,What's your name?
1463.35,1465.34,Sandy,Sandy.
1472.35,1474.25,Evil Willow,You don't have
1472.35,1474.25,Evil Willow,to be afraid...
1474.32,1476.59,Evil Willow,just to please me.
1477.69,1480.46,Evil Willow,If you're all good
1477.69,1480.46,Evil Willow,"boys and girls,"
1480.53,1482.59,Evil Willow,we'll make you young
1482.67,1487.19,Evil Willow,and strong forever
1482.67,1487.19,Evil Willow,and ever.
1487.27,1489.29,Evil Willow,We'll have fun.
1493.71,1495.37,Evil Willow,If you're not...
1507.79,1511.09,Evil Willow,Questions? Comments?
1511.16,1513.36,Oz,Willow.
1513.43,1515.42,Oz,You don't want
1513.43,1515.42,Oz,to do this.
1515.5,1517.4,Evil Willow,I don't?
1517.47,1520.3,Evil Willow,But I'm so good at it.
1524.61,1525.97,Oz,Who did this to you?
1526.04,1528.13,Evil Willow,I know you.
1528.21,1530.11,Evil Willow,You're a white hat.
1530.18,1531.89,Evil Willow,How come you're talking
1531.89,1533.74,Anya,to me like we're friends?
1533.82,1536.68,Anya,Cause he thinks
1533.82,1536.68,Anya,you're someone else.
1536.75,1540.81,Anya,He thinks you're the Willow
1536.75,1540.81,Anya,that belongs in this reality.
1540.89,1542.82,Evil Willow,Another me?
1542.89,1544.29,Evil Willow,You know this isn't
1542.89,1544.29,Evil Willow,"your world, right?"
1544.36,1545.92,Evil Willow,"I mean, you know you"
1544.36,1545.92,Evil Willow,don't belong here.
1546,1549.45,Evil Willow,No. This is
1546,1549.45,Evil Willow,a dumb world.
1549.53,1553.3,Evil Willow,In my world there are
1549.53,1553.3,Evil Willow,"people in chains,"
1553.37,1555.86,Evil Willow,and we can ride them
1553.37,1555.86,Evil Willow,like ponies.
1555.94,1558.34,Anya,You want to get
1555.94,1558.34,Anya,back there.
1558.41,1560.34,Evil Willow,Yeah.
1560.41,1562.5,Anya,So do I.
1565.45,1566.94,Willow,This is creepy.
1567.02,1569.14,Willow,I don't like the thought
1567.02,1569.14,Willow,that there's a vampire
1569.22,1569.84,Willow,out there that
1569.84,1570.45,Xander,looks like me.
1570.52,1572.28,Xander,Not looks like... is.
1572.35,1574.88,Buffy,"It was exactly you,"
1572.35,1574.88,Buffy,"Will, every detail."
1574.96,1577.62,Buffy,Except for your not
1574.96,1577.62,Buffy,being a dominatrix...
1577.69,1579.22,Buffy,as far as we know.
1579.3,1581.02,Willow,"Oh, right."
1579.3,1581.02,Willow,Me and Oz
1581.1,1583.33,Xander,play Mistress of Pain
1581.1,1583.33,Xander,every night.
1584.43,1585.53,Xander,Did anyone else
1585.6,1587.19,Xander,just go to a scary
1585.6,1587.19,Xander,visual place?
1587.27,1588.96,Buffy,"Oh, yeah."
1592.04,1595.37,Angel,"Buffy, I..."
1595.44,1596.71,Angel,Something's happened
1595.44,1596.71,Angel,that...
1600.05,1601.28,Angel,Willow's dead.
1604.55,1605.49,Angel,"Hey, Willow."
1608.79,1609.78,Angel,Wait a second.
1610.93,1612.62,Xander,We're right there
1610.93,1612.62,Xander,"with you, buddy."
1612.7,1614.36,Buffy,"We saw her, too."
1612.7,1614.36,Buffy,At The Bronze.
1616.47,1618.3,Buffy,OK. She's there now
1618.37,1620.67,Angel,with a cadre of vampires
1618.37,1620.67,Angel,looking to party.
1620.74,1622.6,Buffy,We can figure out
1620.74,1622.6,Buffy,who she is
1622.67,1624.76,Buffy,after we stop
1622.67,1624.76,Buffy,the feeding frenzy.
1624.84,1626.46,Buffy,How many of them were there?
1626.46,1626.81,Angel,or 10.
1626.88,1627.9,Buffy,Should we
1626.88,1627.9,Buffy,call Faith?
1627.98,1629.14,Giles,"No, I don't want her"
1627.98,1629.14,Giles,in combat yet.
1629.21,1630.23,Giles,Not around civilians.
1630.23,1630.77,Xander,"Here, here."
1630.85,1634.02,Willow,Guys?
1633.22,1636.88,Willow,What are we gonna do with me?
1633.22,1636.88,Willow,The other me?
1640.39,1641.72,Buffy,"I don't know, Will."
1641.79,1643.95,Buffy,"I mean, we just have"
1641.79,1643.95,Buffy,to stop them.
1644.03,1645.08,Willow,I get that.
1645.16,1647.86,Willow,I just kind of
1645.16,1647.86,Willow,wanted to know...
1647.93,1651.53,Willow,Oh. Hey. Go.
1647.93,1651.53,Willow,I'll catch up.
1660.14,1663.2,Evil Willow,Alone at last.
1671.32,1673.69,Evil Willow,"Well, look at me."
1673.76,1674.98,Evil Willow,I'm all fuzzy.
1676.56,1678.62,Willow,What do I want with you?
1676.56,1678.62,Willow,Uh...
1678.69,1680.32,Evil Willow,Your little school friend
1678.69,1680.32,Evil Willow,Anya said
1680.4,1682.16,Evil Willow,that you're the one
1680.4,1682.16,Evil Willow,that brought me here.
1683.93,1687.03,Evil Willow,She said that you could
1683.93,1687.03,Evil Willow,get me back to my world.
1687.1,1688.43,Willow,Oh.
1688.5,1690.7,Willow,Oh. Oops.
1690.77,1693.8,Evil Willow,But I don't know...
1693.88,1696.87,Evil Willow,I kind of like the idea
1693.88,1696.87,Evil Willow,of the two of us.
1699.15,1702.12,Evil Willow,We could be
1699.15,1702.12,Evil Willow,quite a team
1702.18,1704.18,Evil Willow,if you came around
1702.18,1704.18,Evil Willow,to my way of thinking.
1704.25,1707.42,Willow,Would that mean
1704.25,1707.42,Willow,we have to snuggle?
1708.86,1710.98,Evil Willow,What do you say?
1714.9,1717.8,Evil Willow,Want to be bad?
1717.87,1720.06,Willow,This just can't get
1717.87,1720.06,Willow,more disturbing.
1720.14,1721.16,Willow,
1721.24,1723.14,Willow,Ack! No more.
1723.21,1725.33,Willow,You're really starting
1723.21,1725.33,Willow,to freak me out.
1734.12,1735.67,Evil Willow,"You don't want to play,"
1735.75,1737.45,Evil Willow,I guess I can't
1735.75,1737.45,Evil Willow,force you.
1740.49,1741.55,Evil Willow,"Oh, wait."
1743.06,1744.39,Evil Willow,I can.
1747.93,1749.42,Evil Willow,Bitch.
1756.14,1758.16,Giles,It's extraordinary.
1758.24,1760.14,Willow,It's horrible.
1760.21,1762.04,Willow,That's me as a vampire?
1762.11,1765.21,Willow,"I'm so evil,"
1762.11,1765.21,Willow,and skanky.
1765.28,1767.11,Buffy,And I think
1765.28,1767.11,Buffy,I'm kind of gay.
1767.18,1768.38,Buffy,"Willow,"
1767.18,1768.38,Buffy,"just remember,"
1768.45,1769.58,Buffy,a vampire's
1768.45,1769.58,Buffy,personality
1769.65,1772.09,Buffy,has nothing to do
1769.65,1772.09,Buffy,with the person it was.
1772.15,1773.78,Angel,"Well, actually..."
1774.96,1776.98,Angel,That's a good point.
1777.06,1778.49,Xander,"So, uh,"
1777.06,1778.49,Xander,what do we do now?
1778.56,1780.49,Giles,We still have to
1778.56,1780.49,Giles,get to The Bronze.
1780.56,1781.49,Angel,Even if they're supposed
1780.56,1781.49,Angel,to wait for her
1781.56,1782.66,Angel,they may start feeding.
1782.73,1784.7,Angel,Vampires are not
1782.73,1784.7,Angel,notoriously reliable.
1784.77,1786.03,Xander,"So we charge in,"
1786.1,1787.86,Xander,much in the style
1786.1,1787.86,Xander,of John Wayne?
1787.94,1790.03,Giles,High casualty risk.
1790.11,1792.04,Giles,I haven't any other
1790.11,1792.04,Giles,"plan, though."
1792.11,1794.87,Buffy,"Uh, I have a"
1792.11,1794.87,Buffy,really bad idea.
1802.08,1803.95,Angel,They're still in
1802.08,1803.95,Angel,a holding pattern.
1804.02,1805.04,Angel,That's good.
1805.12,1807.09,Angel,It means they must really
1805.12,1807.09,Angel,be afraid of you.
1807.16,1808.59,Willow,Who wouldn't be?
1810.93,1812.72,Buffy,Are you OK
1810.93,1812.72,Buffy,in that?
1812.8,1814.23,Willow,It's a little binding.
1814.3,1818.03,Willow,I guess vampires really
1814.3,1818.03,Willow,don't have to breathe.
1819.1,1820.76,Willow,"Gosh, look at those."
1820.84,1822.78,Willow,"Um, Willow,"
1822.78,1824.36,Giles,you go in
1824.44,1826.5,Giles,and defuse the situation
1824.44,1826.5,Giles,as best you can.
1826.58,1828.44,Giles,At least try and get
1826.58,1828.44,Giles,some of them to come out
1828.51,1830.03,Giles,and even up the odds
1828.51,1830.03,Giles,a bit.
1830.11,1832.05,Buffy,"First sign of trouble,"
1830.11,1832.05,Buffy,you give us a signal.
1832.11,1833.84,Buffy,We come in hard and fast.
1833.92,1835.18,Xander,What is the signal?
1835.25,1836.41,Willow,Me screaming.
1836.49,1838.82,Angel,"Giles, you and Xander"
1836.49,1838.82,Angel,wait by the back entrance.
1838.89,1839.82,Giles,Good.
1840.89,1842.38,Buffy,"Now, you're sure"
1840.89,1842.38,Buffy,you're up to this?
1842.46,1843.89,Willow,Don't worry.
1842.46,1843.89,Willow,I won't do anything
1843.96,1845.72,Willow,that could be interpreted
1843.96,1845.72,Willow,as brave.
1845.79,1847.35,Buffy,We'll be right outside.
1868.08,1869.52,Willow,Hi. I'm back.
1877.59,1879.53,Alfonse,Alphonse:
1877.59,1879.53,Alfonse,Did you find the girl?
1881.43,1882.8,Willow,Yep. I did.
1883.87,1885.3,Anya,Where is she?
1887.1,1888.57,Willow,I killed her.
1889.67,1894.07,Willow,"And sucked her blood,"
1889.67,1894.07,Willow,as we vampires do.
1900.97,1903.41,Willow,"You know, I think maybe"
1900.97,1903.41,Willow,I heard something out there.
1903.47,1904.91,Willow,Why don't you
1903.47,1904.91,Willow,go check?
1914.52,1916.54,Anya,How could you kill her?
1916.62,1919.32,Anya,She was our best shot
1916.62,1919.32,Anya,at getting your world back.
1919.39,1923.88,Willow,I don't like that
1919.39,1923.88,Willow,you dare question me.
1923.96,1928.36,Willow,Maybe I'll have my minions take you
1923.96,1928.36,Willow,out back and kill you horribly.
1929.7,1932.36,Anya,Vampires. Always thinking
1929.7,1932.36,Anya,with your teeth.
1932.44,1934.37,Willow,She bothered me.
1934.44,1936.93,Willow,She's so weak
1934.44,1936.93,Willow,and accommodating.
1938.44,1942.71,Willow,She's always letting people
1938.44,1942.71,Willow,"walk all over her,"
1942.78,1945.87,Willow,and then she gets cranky
1942.78,1945.87,Willow,with her friends for no reason.
1945.95,1948.38,Willow,I just couldn't
1945.95,1948.38,Willow,let her live.
1949.95,1952.39,Willow,"You know, he's been gone"
1949.95,1952.39,Willow,for a while.
1952.46,1954.39,Willow,Why don't you
1952.46,1954.39,Willow,go check on him?
1955.93,1959.89,Alfonse,"Well, boss, since"
1955.93,1959.89,Alfonse,"that plan is out,"
1959.96,1962.96,Alfonse,why don't we get
1959.96,1962.96,Alfonse,with the killing?
1980.42,1983.35,Evil Willow,"Oh, this is"
1980.42,1983.35,Evil Willow,like a nightmare.
1985.12,1987.39,Cordelia,Hello? Giles?
1989.63,1990.96,Cordelia,Wesley?
1991.03,1995.16,Cordelia,I just happened
1991.03,1995.16,Cordelia,to stop by...
1995.23,1996.53,Cordelia,for books.
1999.44,2001.87,Evil Willow,"Hey, you."
2001.94,2002.87,Evil Willow,Hey me?
2002.94,2004.13,Cordelia,Hey me what?
2004.21,2006.8,Cordelia,"I have a name, you know."
2006.88,2009.94,Evil Willow,"Uh, Cordelia."
2010.01,2011.71,Cordelia,What did you do?
2011.78,2013.98,Cordelia,Lock yourself
2011.78,2013.98,Cordelia,in the book cage?
2014.05,2015.38,Evil Willow,Yeah.
2016.95,2018.39,Evil Willow,Let me out...
2018.46,2021.72,Evil Willow,cause I'm so
2018.46,2021.72,Evil Willow,helpless.
2021.79,2023.89,Evil Willow,OK.
2023.96,2027.4,Evil Willow,I think Giles keeps a spare.
2027.46,2030.63,Evil Willow,How'd you manage to lock
2027.46,2030.63,Evil Willow,"yourself in, anyway?"
2030.7,2033.57,Evil Willow,"Uh, I was looking"
2030.7,2033.57,Evil Willow,at books.
2033.64,2035.76,Evil Willow,I like books...
2037.41,2039.07,Evil Willow,cause I'm shy.
2039.14,2040.2,Cordelia,"Yeah, right."
2040.28,2042.8,Cordelia,The famous shy girl act
2040.28,2042.8,Cordelia,all the boys fall for.
2042.88,2044.57,Evil Willow,Open the cage.
2051.15,2052.64,Cordelia,Wait.
2052.72,2056.02,Cordelia,It occurs to me that we've never
2052.72,2056.02,Cordelia,really had the opportunity to talk.
2056.09,2058.03,Cordelia,"You know, woman to woman..."
2058.1,2060.33,Cordelia,with you locked up.
2060.4,2062.26,Evil Willow,Don't want to talk.
2060.4,2062.26,Evil Willow,Hungry.
2064.1,2065.93,Cordelia,What could we talk about?
2064.1,2065.93,Cordelia,Oh!
2068.02,2070.2,Cordelia,Hey! How about the ethics
2068.02,2070.2,Cordelia,of boyfriend stealing?
2072.28,2074.87,Willow,I don't know if I feel
2072.28,2074.87,Willow,like killing anymore.
2074.95,2077.38,Willow,I'm so bored.
2083.45,2086.89,Willow,It would be like
2083.45,2086.89,Willow,shooting fish in a barrel.
2086.96,2088.89,Willow,Where's the fun?
2088.96,2093.45,Alfonse,"With all due respect, boss,"
2088.96,2093.45,Alfonse,the fun would be the eating.
2093.53,2097.33,Willow,Maybe we should let
2093.53,2097.33,Willow,"everyone go,"
2097.4,2099.73,Willow,give them a 30second
2097.4,2099.73,Willow,head start.
2099.8,2101.5,Anya,Wait a minute.
2101.57,2104.67,Willow,No! I like my plan.
2104.74,2106.47,Anya,"Oh, nice try."
2106.54,2108.34,Willow,"OK, let's get"
2106.54,2108.34,Willow,to the killing.
2108.41,2109.67,Anya,Why don't we start with her?
2109.75,2111.65,Anya,Why don't we start
2109.75,2111.65,Anya,with you?
2111.72,2115.08,Anya,"If she's a vampire, then I'm"
2111.72,2115.08,Anya,the Creature from the Black Lagoon.
2115.15,2117.09,Cordelia,"And, OK..."
2117.15,2119.68,Cordelia,it isn't even like I was
2117.15,2119.68,Cordelia,that attracted to Xander.
2119.76,2124.09,Cordelia,It was more just that we kept being
2119.76,2124.09,Cordelia,"put in these life or death situations,"
2124.16,2126.63,Cordelia,and that's always
2124.16,2126.63,Cordelia,all sexy and stuff.
2127.9,2130.56,Cordelia,"I mean, I more or less"
2127.9,2130.56,Cordelia,"knew he was a loser,"
2130.63,2136.2,Cordelia,but that doesn't make it OK
2130.63,2136.2,Cordelia,for you to come around and... What?
2140.02,2139.7,Cordelia,Do I have something
2140.02,2139.7,Cordelia,on my neck?
2139.78,2141.11,Evil Willow,Not yet.
2141.18,2143.61,Cordelia,Am I getting a zit?
2143.68,2147.38,Evil Willow,"Cordelia,"
2143.68,2147.38,Evil Willow,I'm very sorry.
2147.45,2149.78,Evil Willow,I realize I was wrong.
2149.85,2151.1,Evil Willow,I'll never steal
2151.1,2152.75,Cordelia,your boyfriend again.
2152.82,2155.12,Cordelia,Like you could.
2155.19,2157.29,Cordelia,I should just leave you
2155.19,2157.29,Cordelia,"in there,"
2157.36,2159.09,Cordelia,"but I'm a great humanitarian,"
2159.16,2164.1,Cordelia,and you will just have to think
2159.16,2164.1,Cordelia,of a way to pay me back sometime.
2167.1,2168.04,Evil Willow,OK.
2169.24,2170.67,Evil Willow,How about dinner?
2175.98,2179.78,Evil Willow,Aah! Aah! Aah!
2181.89,2183.85,Cordelia,I didn't mean all that
2181.89,2183.85,Cordelia,stuff I said before.
2183.92,2185.52,Cordelia,I want you to have Xander.
2185.52,2187.05,Evil Willow,My blessings on you both.
2187.12,2189.25,Evil Willow,I'm so over him.
2189.33,2192.12,Evil Willow,I need fresh blood.
2192.2,2193.29,Evil Willow,Aah!
2194.87,2195.8,Evil Willow,Aah!
2203.27,2204.57,Evil Willow,No more hiding.
2206.41,2208.38,Wesley,Back!
2206.41,2208.38,Wesley,Creature of the night.
2208.45,2210.38,Wesley,Leave this place!
2210.45,2212.38,Evil Willow,Don't wanna.
2217.72,2219.52,Evil Willow,Whatever.
2227.26,2228.99,Evil Willow,Yaahh!
2229.07,2230.83,Cordelia,I'm sorry.
2230.9,2234.53,Wesley,"No, no."
2230.9,2234.53,Wesley,A little on edge.
2234.6,2236.94,Wesley,"You know,"
2234.6,2236.94,Wesley,men in combat.
2239.02,2238.34,Wesley,Grr.
2238.41,2239.97,Cordelia,Are you all right?
2240.04,2241.91,Cordelia,You saved my life.
2241.98,2243.54,Cordelia,Thank you.
2243.61,2248.41,Wesley,"Oh, yes. Uh... yes."
2250.55,2252.49,Wesley,Was that?
2252.56,2253.49,Cordelia,Willow.
2253.56,2255.55,Cordelia,They got Willow.
2256.86,2259.39,Cordelia,"So, you doing anything"
2256.86,2259.39,Cordelia,tonight?
2259.46,2260.53,Anya,I'm just so tired of being around
2259.46,2260.53,Anya,human beings and all their baggage.
2260.53,2264.43,Anya,I'm just so tired of being around
2260.53,2264.43,Anya,human beings and all their baggage.
2264.5,2266.97,Anya,I don't care if I
2264.5,2266.97,Anya,ever get my powers back.
2267.04,2270.77,Anya,I think he should eat you.
2270.84,2276.37,Willow,This girl has a history of mental
2270.84,2276.37,Willow,problems dating back to early childhood.
2276.45,2278.38,Willow,I'm a bloodsucking fiend.
2278.45,2279.88,Alfonse,Look at my outfit.
2279.95,2283.41,Alfonse,A human. I should have
2279.95,2283.41,Alfonse,smelled it right away.
2283.49,2287.29,Willow,"A human? Oh, yeah?"
2283.49,2287.29,Willow,Could a human do this?
2287.36,2289.05,Anya,Aaaah!
2290.13,2291.34,Anya,Sure. Yeah.
2291.34,2291.89,Willow,Yeah.
2291.96,2293.32,Anya,Humans do that. Yeah.
2293.32,2294.22,Alfonse,"I think, yeah."
2307.08,2308.1,Alfonse,Uhh!
2308.18,2310.41,Willow,Ow! Ow! Ow!
2308.18,2310.41,Willow,"Happy, but ow!"
2321.52,2322.46,Oz,"Devon, come on!"
2329.7,2331.22,Willow,No more snuggles?
2392.16,2393.35,Willow,"Buffy, no!"
2401.8,2404.03,Willow,Nice reflexes.
2404.11,2405.87,Buffy,"Well, I work out."
2408.31,2410.4,Evil Willow,This world's no fun.
2412.01,2413.45,Willow,"You noticed that, too?"
2422.02,2426.96,Xander,"So, um, in your reality,"
2422.02,2426.96,Xander,"I'm like this bad ass vampire, huh?"
2427.03,2428.66,Xander,People afraid of me?
2430.67,2432.4,Xander,"Oh, yeah."
2432.47,2433.4,Xander,I'm bad.
2437.77,2440.94,Buffy,I'm not sure about releasing
2437.77,2440.94,Buffy,"this thing into the wild, Will."
2443.02,2442.53,Buffy,It is a demon.
2442.61,2445.6,Willow,I just can't kill her.
2445.68,2447.24,Buffy,No.
2447.32,2448.78,Buffy,"Me, neither."
2448.85,2451.79,Willow,"I mean,"
2448.85,2451.79,Willow,I know she's not me.
2451.85,2456.42,Willow,We have a big nothing
2451.85,2456.42,Willow,"in common, but still."
2456.49,2458.82,Buffy,There but for the grace
2456.49,2458.82,Buffy,of getting bit.
2458.89,2463.42,Willow,"We send her back to her world,"
2458.89,2463.42,Willow,then she stands a chance.
2463.5,2465.93,Willow,It's the way
2463.5,2465.93,Willow,it should be anyway.
2468.02,2468.37,Giles,"Uh, we're"
2468.02,2468.37,Giles,about ready here.
2474.54,2477.31,Giles,Don't you try any
2474.54,2477.31,Giles,"tricks now, dear."
2477.38,2478.81,Anya,I don't need tricks.
2478.88,2480.71,Anya,"When I get my powers back,"
2480.71,2482.82,Giles,you will all grovel before me.
2482.88,2483.85,Giles,Pfff!
2485.52,2490.15,Giles,"If you, uh, Willows"
2485.52,2490.15,Giles,"would like to, uh,"
2490.23,2491.85,Willow,complete the circle.
2494.03,2495.26,Willow,Good luck.
2496.73,2498.67,Willow,Try not to kill people.
2507.02,2506.74,Willow,Hands! Hands!
2536.02,2535.94,Buffy,You wanna go out
2536.02,2535.94,Buffy,tonight?
2538.02,2539.03,Willow,"Strangely, I feel"
2538.02,2539.03,Willow,like staying at home...
2539.11,2541.3,Willow,and doing my homework...
2541.38,2542.97,Willow,and flossing...
2543.05,2544.51,Willow,and dying a virgin.
2544.58,2547.84,Buffy,"You know,"
2544.58,2547.84,Buffy,you can O.D. on virtue.
2547.92,2551.88,Willow,"Between me and my evil self,"
2547.92,2551.88,Willow,I've double guilt coupons.
2551.95,2555.45,Willow,I see now where the path
2551.95,2555.45,Willow,of vice leads.
2555.52,2558.49,Willow,"I mean, she messed up"
2555.52,2558.49,Willow,everything she touched.
2558.56,2562.36,Willow,I don't ever
2558.56,2562.36,Willow,want to be like that.
2562.43,2563.69,Percy,"Hey. Oh, hi."
2563.77,2566.39,Willow,"Oh, hi, listen,"
2563.77,2566.39,Willow,I didn't have a chance...
2566.47,2570.4,Percy,"OK, so I did the outline"
2566.47,2570.4,Percy,for the paper on Roosevelt.
2570.47,2572.7,Percy,It turns out there were
2570.47,2572.7,Percy,"President Roosevelts,"
2572.77,2576.37,Percy,so I didn't know exactly
2572.77,2576.37,Percy,"which one to do, so I did both."
2576.45,2580.78,Percy,"I know they're kind of short,"
2576.45,2580.78,Percy,but I can flesh them out.
2580.85,2583.04,Percy,"Oh, and here's"
2580.85,2583.04,Percy,the bibliography.
2583.12,2585.88,Percy,"Um, and I can retype"
2583.12,2585.88,Percy,that if you want.
2585.95,2589.16,Percy,"You just let me know what I did wrong,"
2589.16,2590.76,Buffy,and I'll get on it.
2600.34,2601.77,Buffy,You wanna go out
2600.34,2601.77,Buffy,tonight?
2601.84,2605.48,Willow,sound good?
