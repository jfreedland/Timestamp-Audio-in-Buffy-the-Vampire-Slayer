2.03,4.96,,"All right, you can"
2.03,4.96,,open them up now.
7.5,9.86,Faith,Fab. What's the occasion?
9.93,13.17,Mayor,"Faith, as if I need a reason"
9.93,13.17,Mayor,to show you my affection...
13.24,16.73,Mayor,or appreciation for running
13.24,16.73,Mayor,a small errand at the airport.
16.81,18.17,Mayor,Airport?
18.24,22.02,Faith,What's next?
20.08,21.87,Faith,You gonna want me to help
20.08,21.87,Faith,a buddy of yours move a sofa?
21.95,23.97,Mayor,"This isn't a free ride,"
21.95,23.97,Mayor,young lady.
24.05,26.02,Mayor,"You know,"
24.05,26.02,Mayor,I'm beginning to think...
26.08,28.21,Mayor,that somebody's getting
26.08,28.21,Mayor,a little spoiled.
28.29,29.27,Mayor,Maybe I should
28.29,29.27,Mayor,take this back.
29.35,31.18,Faith,Sorry...
31.26,33.31,Faith,sir.
33.39,34.79,Mayor,That's my girl.
34.86,36.66,Mayor,Another cookie?
38.3,41.96,Mayor,Now... a package is
38.3,41.96,Mayor,arriving tomorrow night...
42.03,43.59,Mayor,from Central America.
43.67,45.13,Mayor,Something... and I can't
43.67,45.13,Mayor,stress this enough...
45.2,48.23,Mayor,something crucially important
45.2,48.23,Mayor,to my ascension.
48.31,49.33,Mayor,Without it...
49.41,52.34,Mayor,"well, what would"
49.41,52.34,Mayor,tollhouse cookies be...
52.41,53.34,Mayor,without the chocolate chips?
53.41,55.5,Mayor,A pretty darn
53.41,55.5,Mayor,big disappointment...
55.58,57.51,Mayor,I can tell you.
55.58,57.51,Mayor,Ha ha ha.
57.58,58.98,Mayor,Open your present.
62.02,66.07,Mayor,Advertise your product or brand here
62.02,66.07,Mayor,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
68.76,69.69,Mayor,There.
69.76,72.49,Mayor,That look on your face
69.76,72.49,Mayor,is my reward.
72.56,75.19,Faith,This is a thing
72.56,75.19,Faith,"of beauty, Boss."
75.27,76.49,Mayor,Cost a pretty penny.
77.57,81.87,Mayor,"So, you just"
77.57,81.87,Mayor,take good care of it.
81.94,83.13,Mayor,You be careful...
83.21,85.57,Mayor,not to put somebody's
83.21,85.57,Mayor,eye out with that thing.
85.64,88.58,Faith,Till I tell you to.
88.65,91.71,Faith,Got any particular
88.65,91.71,Faith,eyes in mind?
99.62,100.65,Buffy,"Sorry, honey."
100.72,102.39,Angel,That's OK.
114.57,117.27,Buffy,"Well, there's something"
114.57,117.27,Buffy,you don't see every day.
117.34,118.83,Buffy,"Unless, of course,"
117.34,118.83,Buffy,you're me.
118.91,120.54,Angel,That was bracing.
120.61,122.91,Angel,Wanna do another sweep?
122.98,125.14,Buffy,It's what I live for.
122.98,125.14,Buffy,Sad to say.
125.22,126.51,Angel,Too tired?
126.58,127.55,Buffy,No.
127.62,129.09,Buffy,It's just...
129.15,134.02,Buffy,do you get the feeling
129.15,134.02,Buffy,that we're kind of in a rut?
135.19,136.49,Angel,Rut?
136.56,138.59,Buffy,You never take me
136.56,138.59,Buffy,anyplace new.
139.66,142.22,Angel,What about that
139.66,142.22,Angel,firedemon nest...
142.3,145.03,Angel,in the cave by the beach?
145.1,150.02,Angel,Thought that was
145.1,150.02,Angel,a nice change of pace.
148.07,149.51,Buffy,So this is our future?
149.57,151.47,Buffy,"I mean, this is how we're"
149.57,151.47,Buffy,gonna spend our nights...
151.54,153.57,Buffy,when I'm 50 and you're...
153.64,155.77,Buffy,the same age you are now?
155.85,156.94,Buffy,
158.02,159.95,Angel,Let's just get you to 50.
160.02,161.54,Buffy,Liking that plan.
222.99,224.22,Joyce,Buffy?
224.29,226.82,Joyce,When were you
224.29,226.82,Joyce,going to tell me?
226.89,229.36,Buffy,"All right, busted."
229.43,230.9,Buffy,I didn't think
229.43,230.9,Buffy,you'd miss them.
230.96,235.02,Joyce,You were accepted to
230.96,235.02,Joyce,Northwestern University?
235.1,237.09,Joyce,"Honey,"
235.1,237.09,Joyce,I'm so proud of you.
237.17,239.3,Buffy,That's wonderful.
239.37,241.4,Buffy,"Right, it's wonderful."
241.47,242.35,Buffy,"Hmm. I mean,"
242.35,243.6,Joyce,it's not cheap...
243.68,245.27,Joyce,"but, uh, I know"
243.68,245.27,Joyce,we can make it work...
245.34,246.97,Joyce,if your father pitches in.
247.05,250.14,Joyce,Not that Northwestern
247.05,250.14,Joyce,is your only option.
250.22,252.18,Joyce,"It's a great school, though."
252.25,254.15,Joyce,I am so proud of you.
254.22,256.59,Buffy,You said that before.
256.66,258.09,Joyce,And will again soon.
258.16,259.45,Joyce,"Mom, you know that I can't..."
259.53,263.83,Joyce,I... I just can't decide
259.53,263.83,Joyce,on a school right now.
263.9,266.87,Joyce,"I mean, I want to sleep on it,"
263.9,266.87,Joyce,"you know, mull it over."
266.93,270.33,Joyce,"Raise them up my inner flagpole,"
266.93,270.33,Joyce,see which one I salute.
270.4,271.56,Joyce,"I know, sweetheart."
271.64,274.5,Joyce,I'm just so pleased
271.64,274.5,Joyce,you have so many choices.
274.57,276.2,Joyce,"Ooh, you know what?"
276.28,279.14,Joyce,Your aunt Arlene
276.28,279.14,Joyce,and her family...
279.21,280.51,Joyce,are in Illinois.
280.58,282.67,Joyce,I've got to call
280.58,282.67,Joyce,and tell them.
285.58,286.61,Joyce,"Oh, Buffy..."
286.69,287.17,Joyce,I know.
287.17,288.48,Buffy,You're proud of me.
288.55,290.78,Buffy,Don't forget to put my earrings
288.55,290.78,Buffy,back in my dresser...
290.86,292.82,Buffy,before you go out.
295.19,296.35,Buffy,Arlene?
296.43,298.33,Buffy,Hi. It's Joyce.
298.4,299.92,Buffy,How you doin'?
300,303.16,Joyce,You are never gonna believe
300,303.16,Joyce,where Buffy got accepted to school.
305.2,306.23,Guy #2,Here you go.
306.23,306.83,Guy #1,Thanks.
306.91,308.7,Snyder,"OK, what's in the bag?"
308.77,309.71,Guy #1,My lunch.
309.78,311.64,Snyder,Is that the new
309.78,311.64,Snyder,drug lingo?
311.71,313.2,Guy #1,No. It's my lunch.
319.85,321.84,Snyder,Sit up straight.
324.02,326.96,Willow,Sounds like your mom's
324.02,326.96,Willow,in a state of denial.
327.03,328.39,Buffy,More like a continent.
328.46,330.95,Buffy,She just has to realize
328.46,330.95,Buffy,that I can't go away.
331.03,334.23,Willow,"Well, maybe not now,"
331.03,334.23,Willow,"but soon, maybe."
334.3,338.46,Willow,"Or maybe I, too,"
334.3,338.46,Willow,hail from denial land.
338.54,339.97,Buffy,Faith's turn to the
338.54,339.97,Buffy,dark side of the force...
340.04,341.51,Buffy,pretty much put
340.04,341.51,Buffy,the proverbial kibosh...
341.57,343.04,Buffy,on any away plans
341.57,343.04,Buffy,for me.
343.11,344.03,Buffy,U.C. Sunnydale.
344.03,345.13,,At least I got in.
345.21,347.37,,But you... I can't believe
345.21,347.37,,you got into Oxford.
347.45,349.18,Willow,It's pretty exciting.
349.25,350.84,Oz,There's some
349.25,350.84,Oz,deep academia there.
350.92,352.18,Buffy,That's where
350.92,352.18,Buffy,they make Gileses!
352.25,355.71,Willow,I know. I could learn
352.25,355.71,Willow,and have scones.
355.79,357.35,Willow,Although I don't know
355.79,357.35,Willow,how I feel...
357.42,359.86,Willow,about going to school
357.42,359.86,Willow,in a foreign country.
359.93,362.26,Xander,Everything in life
359.93,362.26,Xander,is foreign territory.
362.33,365.92,Xander,Kerouac. He's my teacher.
366,368.23,Buffy,The open road... my school.
368.3,370.2,Buffy,Making the open Dumpster
368.3,370.2,Buffy,your cafeteria?
370.27,371.83,Xander,"Go ahead, mock me."
371.9,373.03,Oz,I think she just did.
373.11,375.3,Xander,"We bohemian,"
373.11,375.3,Xander,antiestablishment types...
375.37,376.43,Xander,have always been persecuted.
376.51,378.1,Oz,Sure. You're all so weird.
378.18,379.67,Willow,I think it's neat...
379.75,382.54,Willow,"you doing the backpack,"
379.75,382.54,Willow,"trail mix, happy wanderer thing."
382.62,385.68,Xander,I'm aware it scores kinda high
382.62,385.68,Xander,on the hokey meter.
385.75,386.78,Xander,But I think
385.75,386.78,Xander,it'll be good for me...
386.85,387.98,Xander,help me to find myself.
388.05,390.58,Cordelia,And help us to lose you.
388.05,390.58,Cordelia,Everyone's a winner.
390.66,394.62,Xander,"Well, look who just popped open"
390.66,394.62,Xander,a fresh can of venom.
394.69,396.89,Xander,"Hey, did you hear about Willow"
394.69,396.89,Xander,getting into Oxnard?
396.96,397.54,Willow,Oxford.
397.54,398.36,Xander,And M.I.T.
398.43,399.95,Xander,And Yale and
398.43,399.95,Xander,every other college...
400.03,400.96,Xander,on the face of the planet...
401.03,402.43,Xander,as in your face
401.03,402.43,Xander,I rub it.
402.5,404.99,Willow,Oxford. Whoopee.
405.07,408.51,Cordelia,years in tea bag central.
405.07,408.51,Cordelia,Sounds thrilling.
408.57,411.48,Cordelia,And M.I.T. is a Clearasil ad
408.57,411.48,Cordelia,with housing.
411.54,412.81,Cordelia,And Yale is
411.54,412.81,Cordelia,a dumping ground...
412.88,413.56,Cordelia,for those who didn't
413.56,414.14,Willow,get into Harvard.
414.21,415.48,Willow,I got into Harvard.
415.55,417.71,Xander,Any clue on what college
415.55,417.71,Xander,you might be attending...
417.78,419.94,Xander,so we can start calculating
417.78,419.94,Xander,minimum safe distance?
420.02,421.49,Cordelia,None of your business.
421.55,423.32,Cordelia,Certainly nowhere near
421.55,423.32,Cordelia,you losers.
423.39,425.79,Buffy,"You guys, don't forget to"
423.39,425.79,Buffy,breathe between insults.
425.86,428.22,Cordelia,"I'm sorry, Buffy."
425.86,428.22,Cordelia,This conversation is reserved...
428.29,430.46,Cordelia,for those who actually
428.29,430.46,Cordelia,have a future.
434.03,435.02,Oz,Angry young woman.
435.1,437.36,Willow,"Oh, Buffy, she was"
435.1,437.36,Willow,just being Cordelia.
437.44,439.3,Willow,Only more so.
439.37,440.84,Willow,Don't pay
439.37,440.84,Willow,any attention to her.
440.91,442.37,Xander,Xander: She's definitely
440.91,442.37,Xander,got a chip goin'.
442.44,444.24,Willow,Maybe if you didn't
442.44,444.24,Willow,goad her so much.
444.31,446.14,Xander,I can't help it.
444.31,446.14,Xander,It's my nature.
446.21,448.44,Willow,Maybe you need
446.21,448.44,Willow,a better nature.
449.72,451.21,Wesley,I don't understand.
451.28,453.48,Buffy,I don't think I can
451.28,453.48,Buffy,"talk any slower, Wes."
453.55,454.48,Buffy,I want to leave.
454.55,455.71,Wesley,"What, now?"
455.79,458.42,Buffy,"No, not now."
455.79,458.42,Buffy,After I graduate.
458.49,459.42,Buffy,College?
459.49,461.55,Wesley,But... you're a slayer.
461.63,463.99,Buffy,Yeah. I'm also a person.
464.06,466.55,Buffy,You can't just define me
464.06,466.55,Buffy,by my slayerness.
466.63,469.26,Buffy,That's... somethingism.
469.34,473.14,Giles,"Buffy, I know we've talked"
469.34,473.14,Giles,about you going away.
473.21,474.9,Buffy,I got into Northwestern.
474.97,477.47,Giles,That's wonderful news.
474.97,477.47,Giles,Good for you.
477.54,482.21,Wesley,"All right, everyone. Monsters,"
477.54,482.21,Wesley,"demons, world in peril."
482.28,484.44,Buffy,I'll betcha they have
482.28,484.44,Buffy,all that stuff in Illinois.
484.52,485.85,Wesley,You cannot leave Sunnydale!
485.92,490.01,Wesley,With the power invested in me
485.92,490.01,Wesley,"by the Council, I forbid it."
492.02,493.86,Giles,"Oh, yes, that should"
492.02,493.86,Giles,settle it.
493.93,495.19,Wesley,With Faith gone bad...
495.26,497.56,Wesley,and the mayor's ascension
495.26,497.56,Wesley,coming up...
497.63,498.86,Buffy,I know it's complicated.
498.93,500.87,Buffy,I'm aware that my graduation...
500.93,503.06,Buffy,"may be, among other things,"
500.93,503.06,Buffy,posthumous...
503.14,505.57,Buffy,but what if I
503.14,505.57,Buffy,stop the ascension?
505.64,506.63,Buffy,What if I capture Faith?
506.71,507.8,Giles,I very much
506.71,507.8,Giles,hope you will.
507.87,509.64,Buffy,"If I do that, then all"
507.87,509.64,Buffy,you guys have to do...
509.71,512.54,Buffy,is keep the runofthemill unholy
509.71,512.54,Buffy,forces at bay through midterms...
512.61,513.87,Buffy,and I'll be back in time
512.61,513.87,Buffy,for homecoming...
513.95,516.57,Buffy,and every school break
513.95,516.57,Buffy,after that.
518.85,520.18,Buffy,Can we at least
518.85,520.18,Buffy,think about it?
520.25,521.95,Wesley,Perhaps if circumstances
520.25,521.95,Wesley,were different...
522.02,525.35,Buffy,I'll make them different.
525.35,526.02,Wesley,What?
524.09,526.99,Buffy,I'm tired of waiting for Mayor McSleaze
524.09,526.99,Buffy,to make his move...
527.06,528.03,Buffy,while we sit on
527.06,528.03,Buffy,our hands...
528.09,529.42,Buffy,counting down
528.09,529.42,Buffy,to ascension day.
529.5,530.83,Buffy,Let's take
529.5,530.83,Buffy,the fight to him.
530.9,532.23,Buffy,No.
532.3,534.46,Wesley,No! Much too reckless.
534.53,536.83,Wesley,We're at a distinct
534.53,536.83,Wesley,disadvantage.
536.9,538.87,Wesley,We don't know anything
536.9,538.87,Wesley,about the mayor's ascension.
538.94,540.91,Giles,She's right.
538.94,540.91,Giles,Time's running out.
540.97,542.41,Giles,We need to take
540.97,542.41,Giles,the offensive.
542.47,543.77,Wesley,What's your plan?
545.51,548.17,Buffy,I gotta have a plan?
545.51,548.17,Buffy,Really?
548.25,550.24,Buffy,I can't just be
548.25,550.24,Buffy,proactive with pep?
550.32,553.48,Giles,"You want to take the fight to them,"
550.32,553.48,Giles,I suggest the first step...
553.55,554.33,Giles,would be to find out
554.33,555.38,Wesley,exactly what they're up to.
555.45,557.62,Buffy,Oh. I actually
555.45,557.62,Buffy,knew that.
557.69,559.39,Buffy,I thought you meant
557.69,559.39,Buffy,a more specific plan...
559.46,560.93,Buffy,"you know,"
559.46,560.93,Buffy,with maps and stuff.
560.99,562.84,Buffy,Great. We'll find out
562.84,564.52,Wesley,what they're up to.
602.23,603.5,Box man,He in the car?
603.57,604.71,Vampire,I'll take you to him.
604.71,605.64,Vampire,I'll take you to him.
608.71,612.15,Box man,The mayor was supposed to be
608.71,612.15,Box man,here in person with the money.
613.42,615.68,Box man,"Well, the price just went up."
615.75,617.48,Box man,I don't like surprises.
617.55,618.81,Box man,
627.7,629.82,Faith,Surprise.
647.42,648.75,Vampire,You killed him.
648.82,651.18,Faith,"What are you, the narrator?"
648.82,651.18,Faith,Get the keys to the cuffs.
657.73,658.99,Vampire,Nothin'.
660.53,661.93,Vampire,
663.53,665.97,Vampire,That won't
663.53,665.97,Vampire,cut through steel.
667.04,669.56,Faith,"No, but it'll"
667.04,669.56,Faith,cut through bone.
715.02,718.58,Mayor,Heyho. There it is.
715.02,718.58,Mayor,Ha ha ha ha.
718.65,720.81,Mayor,"Uh, what happened"
718.65,720.81,Mayor,to the courier?
720.89,722.15,Mayor,I was supposed
720.89,722.15,Mayor,to pay him.
722.22,724.92,Faith,Huh. I made him an offer
722.22,724.92,Faith,he couldn't survive.
728.6,731.5,Mayor,You are one heck of
728.6,731.5,Mayor,"a girl, you know that?"
731.57,734.54,Mayor,"I mean, geez, the initiative,"
731.57,734.54,Mayor,the... the skill.
734.6,736.63,Faith,Go on. Go on.
736.7,737.97,Mayor,I will.
738.04,739.94,Mayor,"I'll tell you, if Buff..."
742.02,741.27,Mayor,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
741.34,743.9,Mayor,If Buffy Summers
741.34,743.9,Mayor,walked in here...
743.98,745.54,Mayor,and said she wanted
743.98,745.54,Mayor,to switch to our side...
745.61,747.64,Mayor,"I'd say,"
745.61,747.64,Mayor,"No, thanks, sister."
747.72,749.98,Mayor,I got all the slayer one man
747.72,749.98,Mayor,could ever need." Ha ha.
751.72,753.05,Mayor,What?
753.12,754.55,Faith,Nothing.
754.62,758.49,Mayor,"Oh, it's 'cause I used"
754.62,758.49,Mayor,"the ""B"" word, huh?"
758.56,759.89,Mayor,Don't tell me
758.56,759.89,Mayor,you're still sore...
759.96,762.29,Mayor,about that whole
759.96,762.29,Mayor,AngelBuffy thing.
762.36,765.96,Faith,"No, I'm over it."
762.36,765.96,Faith,She can have him.
766.03,767.56,Mayor,Better believe she can.
767.64,769.57,Mayor,She deserves
767.64,769.57,Mayor,that poor excuse...
769.64,771.2,Mayor,for a creature
769.64,771.2,Mayor,of the night.
771.27,774.5,Mayor,"You, on the other hand,"
771.27,774.5,Mayor,can do better.
777.98,779.57,Mayor,Don't do that.
788.79,789.78,Mayor,
798.87,801.56,Buffy,"So, what's in the box?"
801.74,803.14,Buffy,The Box of Gavrok.
803.2,805.17,Buffy,It houses some great
803.2,805.17,Buffy,demonic energy or something...
805.24,807.83,Buffy,which His Honor needs to
805.24,807.83,Buffy,chow down on come "A" day.
807.91,809.77,Wesley,Wesley: What's that?
809.84,811.68,Giles,Maps and stuff.
811.75,815.18,Willow,Plans for city hall. They were in
811.75,815.18,Willow,the Water and Power mainframe.
815.25,816.72,Buffy,The box is being
815.25,816.72,Buffy,kept under guard...
816.78,818.75,Buffy,in a conference room
816.78,818.75,Buffy,on the top floor.
818.82,820.55,Buffy,There.
820.62,822.35,Buffy,"Unfortunately, that's all I"
820.62,822.35,Buffy,could get out of my informant...
822.42,823.69,Buffy,before his
822.42,823.69,Buffy,aggressive tendencies...
823.76,825.69,Buffy,forced me to introduce him
823.76,825.69,Buffy,to Mr. Pointy.
825.76,827.56,Wesley,"Well, now, here's what"
825.76,827.56,Wesley,I think we should do.
827.63,829.62,Buffy,I figure we can enter
827.63,829.62,Buffy,through the skylight.
829.7,830.69,Buffy,I'll take Angel with me.
830.77,831.75,Giles,Agreed.
831.83,832.77,Xander,There's a fire ladder...
832.83,834.6,Xander,on the east side
832.83,834.6,Xander,of the building here.
834.67,836.73,Wesley,"Yes, fine. But we still"
834.67,836.73,Wesley,need to consider...
836.8,839.4,Giles,It won't be enough to simply
836.8,839.4,Giles,have possession of the box.
839.47,840.87,Willow,Right. We have
839.47,840.87,Willow,to destroy it.
840.94,842.38,Willow,"Not just physically,"
840.94,842.38,Willow,ritually.
842.44,844.24,Willow,With some downanddirty
842.44,844.24,Willow,black magic.
844.31,847.54,Wesley,Hang on. We don't know what
844.31,847.54,Wesley,such a ritual would require.
847.62,849.11,Giles,I think the "Breath
847.62,849.11,Giles,of the Entropics..."
849.18,851.55,Giles,is standard for
849.18,851.55,Giles,this sort of thing.
851.62,853.45,Giles,Fairly simple recipe.
851.62,853.45,Giles,Xander.
853.52,855.96,Xander,I know.
853.52,855.96,Xander,I'm ingredientgettin' guy.
856.02,858.32,Xander,"All right, stop!"
858.39,861.26,Wesley,I demand everyone
858.39,861.26,Wesley,stop this instant.
861.33,863.26,Wesley,I'm in charge here...
863.33,866.99,Wesley,and I say this is all
863.33,866.99,Wesley,moving much too fast.
867.07,869.43,Wesley,We need time to fully
867.07,869.43,Wesley,analyze the situation
869.5,870.33,Wesley,and devise a proper
870.33,871.37,Buffy,and strategic stratagem.
871.44,874.07,Buffy,"Wes, hop on the train"
871.44,874.07,Buffy,or get off the tracks.
874.14,875.94,Wesley,The mayor will
874.14,875.94,Wesley,most assuredly...
878.02,879.45,Wesley,have supernatural safeguards
878.02,879.45,Wesley,protecting the box.
880.88,883.78,Wesley,"Oh, we all forgot"
880.88,883.78,Wesley,"about that, did we?"
883.85,885.22,Buffy,Looks like a job
883.85,885.22,Buffy,for Wiccan girl.
885.29,887.22,Buffy,"What do you say, Wil?"
885.29,887.22,Buffy,Bigtime danger.
887.29,889.48,Willow,"Hey, I eat danger"
887.29,889.48,Willow,for breakfast.
889.56,892.72,Xander,"But, oddly enough, she panics"
889.56,892.72,Xander,in the face of breakfast foods.
892.79,894.42,Buffy,Let's get to work.
920.89,924.59,Xander,I have a theory.
920.89,924.59,Xander,Your snide remarks earlier?
924.66,927.69,Xander,I'm guessing grapes
924.66,927.69,Xander,a little on the sour side.
927.76,929.89,Xander,Didn't get into
927.76,929.89,Xander,"any schools, did ya?"
929.96,931.4,Xander,The grades were there...
931.47,934.03,Xander,"but, ooh, if it weren't"
931.47,934.03,Xander,for that pesky interview.
934.1,935.13,Xander,minutes with you...
935.2,936.14,Xander,and the admissions
935.2,936.14,Xander,department...
936.2,937.4,Xander,decided that
936.2,937.4,Xander,they'd already reached...
937.47,939.91,Xander,their meanspirited
937.47,939.91,Xander,superficialprincess quotas.
939.97,942.34,Cordelia,And once again...
942.41,944.28,Cordelia,the gold medal in
942.41,944.28,Cordelia,the beingwrong event...
944.35,947.37,Cordelia,goes to Xander "I'm As Stupid
944.35,947.37,Cordelia,As I Look" Harris.
950.22,951.91,Cordelia,"Read 'em and weep,"
950.22,951.91,Cordelia,creep...
951.99,954.42,Cordelia,"U.S.C., Colorado State..."
954.49,957.86,Cordelia,Duke and Columbia.
958.86,960.55,Xander,"Wow. These are,"
960.55,962.69,,"uh, great colleges."
962.76,965.2,Xander,I'm guessing
962.76,965.2,Xander,they must have seen...
965.27,968.57,Xander,a different side
965.27,968.57,Xander,of your father's money.
968.64,969.57,Cordelia,Go away.
969.64,971.47,Xander,Sure. If you'll excuse me...
971.54,973.63,Xander,I have to go back to helping
971.54,973.63,Xander,to save some lives.
973.71,976.97,Xander,Carry on. I know that you have
973.71,976.97,Xander,some important accessorizing to do.
993.09,994.43,Giles,"Now, remember..."
994.5,996.73,Giles,If anything
994.5,996.73,Giles,should go awry...
996.8,998.43,Giles,Wesley and I will
996.8,998.43,Giles,create a diversion.
998.5,999.9,Wesley,Let's synchronize
998.5,999.9,Wesley,our watches.
999.97,1001.99,Xander,I have 214...
1003.4,1005.6,Wesley,"Yes, typical."
1005.67,1007.57,Willow,Maybe we could just
1005.67,1007.57,Willow,"count 11,000, 21,000."
1007.64,1009.7,Giles,"Be careful, all of you."
1012.51,1013.45,Giles,Tea?
1029.1,1030.76,Oz,You got the goods?
1030.83,1031.89,Xander,Yeah.
1031.97,1033.02,Xander,Essence of toad.
1033.02,1034.18,Xander,Essence of toad.
1034.25,1036.69,Xander,Twiceblessed sage.
1036.76,1039.02,Xander,Maybe that's the toad.
1039.09,1041.15,Oz,"Well, we better be sure."
1039.09,1041.15,Oz,Destroying this box...
1041.23,1042.82,Oz,is supposed to be
1041.23,1042.82,Oz,a pretty delicate operation.
1042.89,1045.33,Xander,Then they shouldn't leave it
1042.89,1045.33,Xander,in the hands of the lay people.
1045.4,1047.7,Oz,"Well, Wil laid it out"
1045.4,1047.7,Oz,for us pretty well.
1049.53,1051.3,Xander,"Wow, she even drew"
1049.53,1051.3,Xander,helpful diagrams.
1051.37,1052.56,Xander,That's the pedestal.
1052.64,1053.87,Oz,And the ingredients.
1053.94,1054.87,Oz,And us.
1054.94,1057.1,Oz,"See, there's you,"
1054.94,1057.1,Oz,there's me.
1057.18,1058.54,Xander,"Well, how can you tell"
1057.18,1058.54,Xander,which is which?
1058.61,1060.6,Xander,"I mean, they both kind of"
1058.61,1060.6,Xander,look stick figurey to me.
1060.68,1063.27,Oz,"Well, this one's me."
1060.68,1063.27,Oz,See the little guitar?
1063.35,1064.71,Xander,"Oh, gotcha."
1064.78,1066.75,Oz,Yeah. Nobody
1064.78,1066.75,Oz,like my Wil.
1066.82,1068.79,Xander,"No, sir, there is not."
1072.36,1074.99,Oz,OK... toad me.
1101.85,1103.22,,Thanks.
1112.5,1117.13,Xander,Sis modo dissolutum.
1121.02,1122.96,Xander,Exposco validum scutum.
1123.04,1126.88,Xander,Diutius nec defende...
1126.95,1130.11,Xander,a manibus arcam intende.
1134.99,1137.18,Willow,"Oh, yeah. I'm bad."
1137.26,1138.52,Buffy,"stars, Wil."
1138.59,1140.29,Buffy,Now get gone.
1140.36,1141.99,Willow,I'm gone.
1171.19,1172.35,Buffy,Got it!
1172.42,1173.62,Buffy,
1175.33,1178.3,Buffy,Oh. Angel?
1178.36,1179.46,Angel,It's jammed.
1179.53,1182.06,Buffy,Like very much
1179.53,1182.06,Buffy,"to come up now, please."
1182.13,1183.5,Buffy,
1183.57,1184.93,Buffy,Angel!
1187.02,1186.6,Angel,I know.
1188.84,1190.64,Buffy,Don't suppose you wanna
1188.84,1190.64,Buffy,help me get down.
1191.91,1193.24,Buffy,Didn't think so.
1271.26,1273.02,Angel,
1275.79,1277.85,Mayor,Ha ha ha ha.
1294.41,1298.37,Mayor,"Well, this is"
1294.41,1298.37,Mayor,very unfortunate.
1298.45,1303.25,Mayor,I just had this conference room
1298.45,1303.25,Mayor,"redecorated, for Pete's sake."
1303.32,1305.29,Mayor,At taxpayers' expense.
1305.36,1307.79,Mayor,"And oh, yeah... gaah!"
1310.66,1312.72,Mayor,They've got my box.
1312.8,1314.06,Faith,"Yeah, they do."
1314.13,1317.19,Faith,But looky what we got.
1321.11,1322.77,Faith,Heh heh heh heh.
1326.75,1329.08,Buffy,How did you guys let this...
1329.15,1330.71,Buffy,How did this happen?
1330.78,1333.18,Giles,We thought she stayed
1330.78,1333.18,Giles,with you.
1333.25,1335.34,Angel,They must have grabbed her
1333.25,1335.34,Angel,when she hit the ground.
1335.42,1336.35,Angel,"Buffy, I'm sorry."
1336.42,1338.36,Buffy,"Look, it's nobody's"
1336.42,1338.36,Buffy,"fault, OK?"
1338.42,1341.02,Buffy,We just need to focus
1338.42,1341.02,Buffy,and deal.
1341.09,1343.56,Buffy,"Oz, I swear I won't"
1341.09,1343.56,Buffy,let them hurt her.
1343.63,1344.99,Xander,We go back.
1345.06,1346.66,Xander,Fullon assault.
1346.73,1347.76,Giles,They'll kill her.
1347.83,1349.23,Wesley,We're assuming
1347.83,1349.23,Wesley,they haven't already?
1349.3,1352.74,Buffy,"No. No, they know"
1349.3,1352.74,Buffy,what she means to us.
1352.8,1355.27,Buffy,She's too valuable
1352.8,1355.27,Buffy,as long as we still have...
1355.34,1356.33,Buffy,the box.
1356.41,1357.93,Buffy,We trade.
1360.02,1359.37,Wesley,We can't.
1359.44,1361.41,Buffy,"No, it's the safest plan."
1359.44,1361.41,Buffy,It's the only way. Right?
1361.48,1363.41,Giles,It might well be.
1363.48,1366.68,Buffy,"Look, we call the mayor"
1363.48,1366.68,Buffy,and arrange a meeting.
1366.75,1368.01,Wesley,This box must be destroyed.
1368.09,1369.61,Xander,I need a volunteer
1368.09,1369.61,Xander,to hit Wesley.
1369.69,1371.12,Wesley,"Giles, you know"
1369.69,1371.12,Wesley,I'm right about this.
1371.19,1373.18,Buffy,"Wes, you want to duck and cover"
1371.19,1373.18,Buffy,at this point?
1373.26,1375.19,Wesley,"Damn it,"
1373.26,1375.19,Wesley,you listen to me!
1375.26,1377.69,Buffy,This box is the key
1375.26,1377.69,Buffy,to the mayor's ascension.
1377.76,1380.75,Buffy,Thousands of lives depend upon
1377.76,1380.75,Buffy,our getting rid of it.
1380.83,1383.56,Buffy,"Now, I want to help Willow"
1380.83,1383.56,Buffy,as much as the rest of you...
1383.64,1385.69,Buffy,but we will find
1383.64,1385.69,Buffy,another way.
1385.77,1387.6,Buffy,There is no other way.
1387.67,1390.37,Wesley,You're the one who said
1387.67,1390.37,Wesley,take the fight to the mayor.
1390.44,1394.07,Wesley,You were right. This is the town's
1390.44,1394.07,Wesley,best hope of survival.
1394.15,1396.81,Wesley,It's your chance to get out.
1396.88,1398.82,Buffy,You think I care
1396.88,1398.82,Buffy,about that?
1398.88,1400.28,Buffy,Are you made
1398.88,1400.28,Buffy,of human parts?
1400.35,1402.41,Giles,All right! Let's deal
1400.35,1402.41,Giles,with this rationally.
1402.49,1403.92,Buffy,Are you taking
1402.49,1403.92,Buffy,his side?
1403.99,1405.42,Buffy,
1405.49,1406.48,Wesley,Don't be ridiculous!
1406.56,1407.75,Wesley,Listen to you people!
1407.83,1410.59,Wesley,You'd sacrifice thousands
1407.83,1410.59,Wesley,of lives? Your families?
1410.66,1412.1,Wesley,Your friends?
1412.16,1414.83,Wesley,It can all end right here.
1414.9,1417.83,Wesley,We have the means
1414.9,1417.83,Wesley,to destroy this box.
1425.38,1427.31,Buffy,"Giles, make the phone call."
1439.46,1441.48,Buffy,
1459.02,1458.48,Guard,What are you doing?
1458.54,1459.98,Guard,Um...
1460.05,1461.98,Willow,I'm looking for
1460.05,1461.98,Willow,a sucking candy...
1462.05,1465.02,Willow,cause my mouth gets dry
1462.05,1465.02,Willow,when I'm... I'm nervous...
1465.08,1468.29,Willow,or held prisoner
1465.08,1468.29,Willow,against my will.
1468.43,1469.95,Willow,And suddenly
1468.43,1469.95,Willow,I'm thinking...
1470.03,1471.36,Willow,sucking"
1470.03,1471.36,Willow,isn't a good word...
1471.43,1472.69,Willow,to use around vampires.
1472.76,1475.63,Willow,Hey! Did you get permission
1472.76,1475.63,Willow,to eat the hostage?
1475.7,1477.13,Willow,I don't think so.
1477.2,1479.5,Willow,You're gonna be in some trouble
1477.2,1479.5,Willow,when the mayor gets...
1479.57,1483.02,Willow,No!
1482.07,1483.51,Guard,Just a little taste.
1483.57,1484.7,Guard,
1514.34,1516.97,Faith,They're not gonna be
1514.34,1516.97,Faith,braindamaged enough
1514.34,1516.97,Faith,to come back here tonight.
1517.04,1519.2,Mayor,Mayor: Ever have a dog?
1519.28,1520.37,Faith,What?
1520.44,1521.38,Mayor,I did.
1521.45,1522.38,Mayor,Rusty.
1522.45,1523.38,Mayor,Irish setter.
1523.45,1524.88,Mayor,Swell little pooch.
1524.95,1527.38,Mayor,A dog's friendship
1524.95,1527.38,Mayor,is stronger than reason...
1527.45,1528.98,Mayor,stronger than its own sense...
1529.05,1530.49,Mayor,of selfpreservation.
1530.55,1532.08,Mayor,Buffy's like a dog.
1532.16,1534.12,Mayor,"And, hey, before you can say"
1532.16,1534.12,Mayor,Jack Robinson...
1534.19,1536.79,Mayor,you'll get to see me
1534.19,1536.79,Mayor,kill her like one.
1572.53,1573.93,Faith,Ohh...
1592.22,1594.81,Faith,The Books of Ascension.
1616.14,1617.97,Faith,Check out the bookworm.
1618.04,1619.03,Willow,Faith.
1621.81,1623.75,Faith,Anybody with brains...
1623.81,1626.75,Faith,anybody who knew what was
1623.81,1626.75,Faith,going to happen to her...
1626.82,1630.25,Faith,would be trying to claw her
1626.82,1630.25,Faith,way out of this place.
1630.32,1633.65,Faith,But you... you just can't stop
1630.32,1633.65,Faith,"Nancy Drewing, can you?"
1636.43,1638.36,Faith,I guess now
1636.43,1638.36,Faith,you know too much...
1638.43,1641.23,Faith,and that kind of just
1638.43,1641.23,Faith,naturally leads to killing.
1641.3,1644.53,Willow,"Faith, wait!"
1641.3,1644.53,Willow,I want to talk to you.
1644.6,1646.54,Faith,"Oh, yeah. Give me the speech"
1644.6,1646.54,Faith,"again, please."
1646.6,1648.37,Faith,"Faith, we're still"
1646.6,1648.37,Faith,your friends.
1648.44,1650.37,Faith,We can help you.
1648.44,1650.37,Faith,It's not too late."
1650.44,1653.1,Willow,It's way too late.
1653.18,1656.31,Willow,"You know, it didn't"
1653.18,1656.31,Willow,have to be this way.
1656.38,1658.54,Willow,But you made
1656.38,1658.54,Willow,your choice.
1658.62,1661.55,Willow,I know you had
1658.62,1661.55,Willow,a tough life.
1661.62,1664.78,Willow,I know that some people think
1661.62,1664.78,Willow,you had a lot of bad breaks.
1664.86,1666.29,Willow,"Well, boohoo!"
1666.36,1667.79,Willow,Poor you.
1667.86,1671.02,Willow,"You know, you had"
1667.86,1671.02,Willow,a lot more in your life...
1671.1,1672.53,Willow,than... than some people.
1672.6,1675.53,Willow,"I mean, you had friends"
1672.6,1675.53,Willow,like Buffy.
1675.6,1677.53,Willow,Now you have no one.
1677.6,1680.54,Willow,"You were a slayer,"
1677.6,1680.54,Willow,and now you're nothing.
1680.6,1683.44,Willow,"You're just a big, selfish,"
1680.6,1683.44,Willow,worthless waste.
1685.58,1688.24,Faith,"You hurt me,"
1685.58,1688.24,Faith,I hurt you.
1688.31,1691.34,Faith,I'm just a little more
1688.31,1691.34,Faith,efficient.
1691.42,1694.91,Willow,"Oh, and here I just thought"
1691.42,1694.91,Willow,you didn't have a comeback.
1694.99,1697.95,Faith,You're begging for
1694.99,1697.95,Faith,some deep pain.
1698.02,1699.15,Faith,
1699.22,1700.78,Willow,I'm not afraid of you.
1702.93,1705.12,Faith,Let's see what we can do
1702.93,1705.12,Faith,about that.
1705.2,1707.22,Mayor,Girls.
1707.3,1709.36,Mayor,I hope I don't have to
1707.3,1709.36,Mayor,separate you two.
1709.43,1711.73,Mayor,"Faith, you can play with"
1709.43,1711.73,Mayor,your new toy later.
1711.8,1712.93,Mayor,Something's come up.
1714.74,1716.33,Mayor,Faith.
1716.41,1718.74,Mayor,You know I don't like
1716.41,1718.74,Mayor,repeating myself.
1721.15,1722.87,Faith,I got someone.
1722.95,1724.11,Faith,I got him.
1727.95,1729.44,Mayor,I just received...
1729.52,1731.85,Mayor,a heck of an interesting
1729.52,1731.85,Mayor,phone call.
1747.4,1749.84,Oz,The whole place
1747.4,1749.84,Oz,is locked down...
1749.91,1751.34,Oz,except for the front.
1751.41,1754.07,Xander,"Yeah, it gives me that"
1751.41,1754.07,Xander,comforting "trapped" feeling.
1754.14,1756.54,Buffy,One way out
1754.14,1756.54,Buffy,means one way in.
1756.61,1758.88,Buffy,I want to see them coming.
1760.15,1762.68,Xander,I guess they're shy.
1763.79,1765.72,Angel,I can see all right.
1784.31,1786.44,Mayor,"Well, this is"
1784.31,1786.44,Mayor,"exciting, isn't it?"
1786.51,1788.07,Mayor,Ha ha ha.
1788.15,1790.58,Mayor,Clandestine meetings
1788.15,1790.58,Mayor,by dark of night...
1790.65,1792.05,Mayor,exchange of prisoners.
1792.12,1793.51,Mayor,I just... I...
1793.58,1796.75,Mayor,I feel like we should
1793.58,1796.75,Mayor,all be wearing trench coats.
1796.82,1798.55,Buffy,Let her go.
1800.19,1802.12,Mayor,No!
1802.19,1804.35,Mayor,Not until the box
1802.19,1804.35,Mayor,is in my hands.
1805.7,1806.89,Mayor,So you're
1805.7,1806.89,Mayor,the little girl...
1806.96,1809.52,Mayor,that's been causing me
1806.96,1809.52,Mayor,all this trouble.
1811.24,1813.36,Mayor,"She's pretty, Angel."
1814.97,1816.1,Mayor,A little skinny.
1816.17,1817.44,Mayor,Still don't understand...
1817.51,1821.31,Mayor,why it couldn't work out
1817.51,1821.31,Mayor,with you and my Faith.
1821.38,1823.74,Mayor,Guess you kinda just have
1821.38,1823.74,Mayor,strange taste in women.
1823.81,1825.37,Angel,"Yeah, well,"
1823.81,1825.37,Angel,what can I say?
1825.45,1826.68,Angel,I like 'em sane.
1827.95,1829.51,Oz,Angel.
1830.65,1833.75,Mayor,"I wish you kids the best,"
1830.65,1833.75,Mayor,I really do...
1833.82,1836.32,Mayor,"but, uh, if you don't mind"
1833.82,1836.32,Mayor,a bit of fatherly advice...
1836.39,1840.35,Mayor,"I, uh... I just don't see"
1836.39,1840.35,Mayor,much of a future for you two.
1840.43,1843.63,Mayor,I don't sense
1840.43,1843.63,Mayor,a lasting relationship.
1843.7,1845.1,Mayor,And not just because I plan
1843.7,1845.1,Mayor,to kill the both of you...
1845.17,1847.66,Mayor,but you got
1845.17,1847.66,Mayor,a bumpy road ahead.
1847.74,1850.3,Buffy,I don't think we need
1847.74,1850.3,Buffy,to talk about this.
1850.37,1851.4,Buffy,
1851.48,1853.84,Buffy,"YYou kids, you know..."
1853.91,1855.54,Mayor,you don't like to think
1853.91,1855.54,Mayor,about the future...
1855.61,1857.67,Mayor,you don't like
1855.61,1857.67,Mayor,to make plans...
1857.75,1859.48,Mayor,but unless
1857.75,1859.48,Mayor,you want Faith...
1859.55,1860.98,Mayor,to gut your friend
1859.55,1860.98,Mayor,like a sea bass...
1861.05,1863.95,Mayor,you will show a little
1861.05,1863.95,Mayor,respect for your elders.
1864.02,1864.95,Angel,You're not my elder.
1865.02,1867.25,Angel,I got a lot
1865.02,1867.25,Angel,of years on you.
1867.32,1868.52,Mayor,"Yeah, and that's just"
1867.32,1868.52,Mayor,one of the things...
1868.59,1871.12,Mayor,you're gonna have to
1868.59,1871.12,Mayor,deal with.
1871.19,1872.39,Mayor,You're immortal.
1871.19,1872.39,Mayor,She's not.
1872.46,1873.83,Mayor,It's not easy.
1873.9,1875.69,Mayor,I married my Edna Mae in '03...
1875.77,1878.06,Mayor,and I was with her
1875.77,1878.06,Mayor,right until the end.
1878.14,1882.02,Mayor,Not a pretty picture.
1881.74,1883.6,Mayor,Wrinkled and senile...
1883.67,1886.87,Mayor,and cursing me
1883.67,1886.87,Mayor,for my youth.
1886.94,1890.04,Mayor,Wasn't our happiest time.
1890.11,1891.67,Mayor,And let's forget the fact...
1891.75,1894.92,Mayor,that any moment of true
1891.75,1894.92,Mayor,happiness will turn you evil.
1895.05,1896.35,Buffy,
1896.42,1898.55,Mayor,"I mean, come on,"
1896.42,1898.55,Mayor,what kind of a life...
1898.62,1899.92,Mayor,can you offer her?
1899.99,1902.79,Mayor,I don't see a lot of Sunday
1899.99,1902.79,Mayor,picnics in the offing.
1902.86,1904.85,Mayor,I see skulking
1902.86,1904.85,Mayor,in the shadows...
1904.93,1905.89,Mayor,hiding from the sun.
1905.96,1907.83,Mayor,She's a blossoming
1905.96,1907.83,Mayor,young girl...
1907.9,1909.89,Mayor,and you want to keep her from
1907.9,1909.89,Mayor,the life she should have...
1909.97,1912.43,Mayor,till it's passed her by.
1909.97,1912.43,Mayor,And by God...
1912.5,1914.7,Mayor,I think that's
1912.5,1914.7,Mayor,a little selfish.
1916.41,1918.93,Mayor,Is that what you
1916.41,1918.93,Mayor,came back from hell for?
1921.02,1922.07,Mayor,Is that your
1921.02,1922.07,Mayor,greater purpose?
1927.18,1929.21,Mayor,Make the trade.
1945.33,1946.8,Mayor,"Well, that went"
1945.33,1946.8,Mayor,as smoothly...
1946.87,1948.36,Snyder,Nobody moves!
1956.48,1959.78,Snyder,I knew you kids
1956.48,1959.78,Snyder,were up to something.
1959.85,1960.82,Buffy,"Snyder, get out of here."
1960.88,1962.61,Snyder,"You're not giving orders,"
1960.88,1962.61,Snyder,young lady.
1962.69,1964.62,Snyder,I suppose you're
1962.69,1964.62,Snyder,going to tell me...
1964.69,1967.38,Snyder,I won't find drugs
1964.69,1967.38,Snyder,in this box.
1969.19,1971.32,Buffy,Wait!
1971.39,1973.02,Mayor,Principal Snyder...
1974.33,1976.06,Mayor,I think we have
1974.33,1976.06,Mayor,a problem.
1976.13,1979.53,Snyder,"Mr. Mayor,"
1976.13,1979.53,Snyder,I had no idea you...
1980.7,1983.47,Snyder,I'm terribly sorry.
1983.54,1984.6,Mayor,"No, it's I who"
1983.54,1984.6,Mayor,should apologize.
1984.67,1986.23,Mayor,"I mean, coming down here"
1984.67,1986.23,Mayor,at night.
1986.31,1988.8,Mayor,What must you be thinking?
1986.31,1988.8,Mayor,But you see...
1988.88,1992.14,Mayor,I just needed to...
1988.88,1992.14,Mayor,"Uh, no, don't do that!"
1994.52,1995.68,Mayor,Aah!
1995.75,1997.62,Mayor,Aah!
2000.46,2002.58,Mayor,Aah!
2002.66,2004.85,Mayor,Aaaahhhh!
2018.37,2020.77,Wesley,"Oh, God."
2020.84,2022.57,Xander,Where'd it go?
2022.65,2024.14,Snyder,Get that door open!
2024.21,2025.31,Snyder,Giles: No!
2025.38,2026.97,Giles,You can't let that thing
2025.38,2026.97,Giles,out of here.
2027.05,2029.18,Giles,
2029.25,2030.58,Xander,I still want to know
2029.25,2030.58,Xander,where it went.
2030.65,2031.59,Buffy,Listen.
2036.19,2037.39,Faith,Boss!
2060.62,2062.17,Mayor,I wouldn't
2060.62,2062.17,Mayor,leave that open.
2080.77,2082.33,Wesley,No!
2095.12,2097.05,Oz,Is that all of them?
2097.12,2098.45,,Uh... not really.
2098.52,2100.82,,"You see, there's"
2098.52,2100.82,,"about, uh, 50..."
2100.89,2104.48,,billion of these happy
2100.89,2104.48,,little critters in here.
2104.56,2105.62,,Would you like to see?
2108.06,2110.26,,Raise your hand
2108.06,2110.26,,if you're invulnerable.
2112.97,2114.9,,"Faith, let's go."
2122.11,2123.64,,Faith.
2133.79,2136.66,,"Snyder, you alive"
2133.79,2136.66,,in there?
2138.33,2139.76,,You...
2139.83,2142.35,,all of you...
2142.43,2145.59,,why couldn't you be dealing
2142.43,2145.59,,drugs like normal people?
2166.05,2167.58,,"Well, that went"
2166.05,2167.58,,swimmingly.
2171.16,2172.49,,We did all right.
2178.37,2179.93,,"So Faith was like,"
2178.37,2179.93,,"I'm gonna beat you up,"""
2182.02,2181.86,,"and I'm all,"
2181.86,2181.56,Willow,I'm not afraid of you."
2181.64,2183.73,Willow,"And then she had the knife,"
2181.64,2183.73,Willow,which was less fun.
2183.81,2185.6,Willow,"And then, oh,"
2183.81,2185.6,Willow,I... I told her...
2185.67,2187.54,Willow,You made your choice.
2185.67,2187.54,Willow,Buffy was your friend."
2187.61,2189.6,Giles,Yes. This is
2187.61,2189.6,Giles,fascinating...
2189.68,2192.31,Giles,but just to get
2189.68,2192.31,Giles,back to the point.
2192.38,2195.51,Giles,You actually had your hands
2192.38,2195.51,Giles,on the Books of Ascension?
2195.58,2197.68,Willow,Volumes 1 through 5.
2197.75,2200.05,Giles,Is there anything that you
2197.75,2200.05,Giles,can remember about them...
2200.12,2202.32,Giles,that could be of use to us?
2200.12,2202.32,Giles,Anything at all?
2202.39,2206.16,Willow,"Well, I was in a hurry..."
2206.23,2208.96,Willow,and what I did read
2206.23,2208.96,Willow,was kind of involved.
2209.03,2211.69,Willow,"If you ask me,"
2209.03,2211.69,Willow,way overwritten.
2211.77,2213.23,Willow,Oh.
2213.3,2216.43,Willow,"Actually, there were a few pages"
2213.3,2216.43,Willow,that were kind of interesting...
2216.51,2218.44,Willow,but I didn't have a chance
2216.51,2218.44,Willow,to read them fully.
2222.08,2223.81,Willow,See what you can
2222.08,2223.81,Willow,make of them.
2230.35,2232.22,Buffy,This is your night
2230.35,2232.22,Buffy,"for suave, Wil."
2232.29,2233.98,Buffy,You should get
2232.29,2233.98,Buffy,captured more often.
2234.06,2236.42,Willow,"No, thank you."
2236.49,2240.09,Wesley,"Well, let's hope there's"
2236.49,2240.09,Wesley,something useful in those pages.
2240.16,2242.49,Wesley,The mayor has
2240.16,2242.49,Wesley,the Box of Gavrok.
2242.56,2244.53,Wesley,And as of now...
2244.6,2247.16,Wesley,we are right back
2244.6,2247.16,Wesley,where we started.
2247.24,2249,Wesley,Wouldn't you say?
2262.52,2263.64,Willow,Deep thoughts?
2263.72,2266.05,Buffy,Deep and meaningful.
2267.16,2268.32,Willow,As in?
2269.66,2270.98,Willow,As in I'm never
2270.98,2272.75,Buffy,getting out of here.
2272.83,2276.32,Buffy,I kept thinking if I
2272.83,2276.32,Buffy,stopped the mayor or...
2276.4,2278.92,Buffy,but I was
2276.4,2278.92,Buffy,kidding myself.
2281.02,2281.49,Buffy,There's always
2281.02,2281.49,Buffy,gonna be something.
2281.57,2283.09,Buffy,I'm a Sunnydale girl.
2283.17,2284.66,Buffy,No other choice.
2284.74,2287.4,Willow,It must be tough.
2284.74,2287.4,Willow,"I mean, here I am..."
2287.48,2289.41,Willow,and I can do
2287.48,2289.41,Willow,anything I want.
2289.48,2292.68,Willow,I can go to any college
2289.48,2292.68,Willow,in the country...
2292.75,2294.05,Willow,"or 5 in Europe,"
2292.75,2294.05,Willow,if I want.
2294.12,2295.56,Buffy,Please tell me you're going
2294.12,2295.56,Buffy,somewhere with this.
2295.7,2297.25,Willow,No.
2298.37,2301.43,Willow,I'm not going anywhere.
2301.5,2303.4,Buffy,U.C. Sunnydale?
2303.47,2306.91,Willow,I will be matriculating
2303.47,2306.91,Willow,with the class of 2003.
2306.97,2308.74,Buffy,Are you serious?
2308.81,2311.47,Buffy,"Say, isn't that"
2308.81,2311.47,Buffy,where you're going?
2311.55,2312.77,Buffy,Oh!
2312.85,2315.91,Buffy,
2315.98,2317.68,Buffy,I can't believe it.
2315.98,2317.68,Buffy,Are you serious?
2317.75,2320.81,Buffy,"Wait, what am I saying?"
2317.75,2320.81,Buffy,You can't.
2320.89,2321.82,Willow,What do you mean I can't?
2321.89,2323.32,Buffy,I won't let you.
2323.39,2325.19,Willow,Of the 2 people here...
2325.26,2326.95,Willow,which is
2325.26,2326.95,Willow,the boss of me?
2327.03,2328.29,Buffy,There are better schools.
2328.36,2329.99,Buffy,Sunnydale's not bad...
2330.06,2332.76,Buffy,and... and I can design
2330.06,2332.76,Buffy,my own curriculum.
2332.83,2334.63,Buffy,"OK, well, there are"
2332.83,2334.63,Buffy,safer schools.
2334.7,2336.46,Buffy,There are safer prisons.
2336.54,2339.1,Buffy,I can't let you stay
2336.54,2339.1,Buffy,because of me.
2339.17,2340.9,Willow,"Actually, this isn't"
2339.17,2340.9,Willow,about you.
2340.97,2342.77,Willow,Although I'm fond... don't
2340.97,2342.77,Willow,get me wrong... of you.
2342.84,2344.17,Willow,But the other night...
2344.24,2346.84,Willow,"you know, being"
2344.24,2346.84,Willow,captured and all...
2346.91,2348.81,Willow,facing off with Faith...
2348.88,2352.48,Willow,things just...
2348.88,2352.48,Willow,kinda got clear.
2352.55,2356.22,Willow,"I mean, you've been fighting"
2352.55,2356.22,Willow,evil here for 3 years...
2356.29,2357.88,Willow,and I've helped some...
2357.96,2358.95,Willow,and now we're
2357.96,2358.95,Willow,supposed to decide...
2359.03,2361.52,Willow,what we want to do
2359.03,2361.52,Willow,with our lives.
2361.6,2364.79,Willow,And I just realized
2361.6,2364.79,Willow,that's what I want to do.
2364.87,2367.73,Willow,"Fight evil, help people."
2367.8,2370.4,Willow,"I mean, I... I think"
2367.8,2370.4,Willow,it's worth doing.
2370.47,2374.13,Willow,And I don't think you do it
2370.47,2374.13,Willow,because you have to.
2374.21,2375.44,Willow,"It's a good fight,"
2374.21,2375.44,Willow,Buffy...
2375.51,2377.14,Willow,and I want in.
2377.21,2380.15,Buffy,I kind of love you.
2381.65,2384.98,Willow,"And besides, I have a shot"
2381.65,2384.98,Willow,at being a badass Wicca.
2385.05,2386.68,Willow,And what better
2385.05,2386.68,Willow,place to learn?
2386.75,2388.85,Buffy,I feel the need
2386.75,2388.85,Buffy,for more sugar...
2388.92,2390.41,Buffy,than the human body
2388.92,2390.41,Buffy,can handle.
2390.49,2391.75,Willow,Mochas?
2391.83,2393.38,Buffy,"Yes, please."
2395.06,2397.66,Buffy,It's weird.
2395.06,2397.66,Buffy,You look at something...
2397.73,2399.39,Buffy,and you think you know
2397.73,2399.39,Buffy,exactly what you're seeing...
2399.47,2402.53,Buffy,and... then you find out
2399.47,2402.53,Buffy,it's something else entirely.
2402.6,2404.19,Willow,"Neat, huh?"
2404.27,2406.03,Buffy,Sometimes it is.
2421.19,2422.88,Woman,"Chase, what"
2421.19,2422.88,Woman,are you doing?
2422.96,2424.25,Woman,Your break's been over
2422.96,2424.25,Woman,for 10 minutes.
2424.32,2425.95,Woman,I still need you
2424.32,2425.95,Woman,to restock the shelves...
2426.03,2428.05,Woman,and sweep out
2426.03,2428.05,Woman,the storage room.
2428.13,2429.39,Woman,Let's go!
2459.66,2461.25,Buffy,It's gonna be fun.
2461.33,2465.13,Buffy,Wil and I are gonna go
2461.33,2465.13,Buffy,"on Saturday, look at the campus."
2465.2,2466.89,Buffy,I'm hoping my mom
2465.2,2466.89,Buffy,will let me live there.
2466.97,2469.66,Buffy,It's too far
2466.97,2469.66,Buffy,to come home every night.
2469.74,2475.02,Buffy,Plus the whole
2469.74,2475.02,Buffy,lackofcool factor.
2473.07,2475.23,Buffy,"Either way, I'll be"
2473.07,2475.23,Buffy,close to your place.
2481.02,2481.64,Buffy,I don't know what the mayor
2481.02,2481.64,Buffy,was talking about.
2483.38,2485.21,Buffy,How could he know
2483.38,2485.21,Buffy,anything about us?
2485.29,2487.12,Angel,"Well, he's evil."
2487.19,2488.98,,Bigtime.
2490.32,2492.69,,He doesn't even know what
2490.32,2492.69,,a lasting relationship is.
2492.76,2493.69,,No.
2495.1,2497.79,,Probably the only lasting
2495.1,2497.79,,relationship he's ever had...
2497.86,2499.8,,is with...
2499.87,2500.92,,evil.
2503.02,2503.56,,Yeah.
2503.64,2506.61,,"Big, stupid, evil guy."
2507.71,2510.2,,We'll be OK.
2510.28,2511.47,,We will.
