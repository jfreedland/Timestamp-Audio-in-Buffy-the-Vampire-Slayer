7.73,8.4,ROBSON,Gather them.
8.48,9.96,GILES,l understand.
10.04,11.23,DAWN,l saw Mom.
11.32,14.91,WILLOW,"lt's the Big Bad, Dawn."
11.32,14.91,WILLOW,The one we knew was coming.
17.4,20.15,ANDREW,l did what you told me.
17.4,20.15,ANDREW,lt's not my fault it didn't work.
20.24,21.85,WARREN,l would do this stuff if l could.
21.85,23.71,ANDREW,l don't think l can kill anybody else.
23.8,26.79,JONATHAN,lt's my fault the ritual didn't work.
23.8,26.79,JONATHAN,l don't have enough blood.
26.88,30.31,WILLOW,"Look who l found, buying"
26.88,30.31,WILLOW,mass amounts of blood at the butcher shop.
30.4,33.25,XANDER,Just tell us what... you... know.
33.25,33.51,ANDREW,Ow!
33.6,36.06,BUFFY,"l believe in you, Spike."
40.48,42.51,BUFFY,They were after Spike all along.
43.92,45.63,BUFFY/FIRST,l'm getting tired of subtle.
45.72,47.37,BUFFY,lt's about time we bring
47.37,49.5,BUFFY/FIRST,some authority to our presence.
49.6,52.51,BUFFY/FIRST,"Now, Spike, you wanna see"
49.6,52.51,BUFFY/FIRST,what a real vampire looks like?
58.08,62.63,XANDER,"lt's a loop, like the mummy hand. l'm doomed"
58.08,62.63,XANDER,to replace these windows for eternity.
62.72,66.31,XANDER,We should board these up
62.72,66.31,XANDER,until things are less Hellmouthy.
66.4,70.07,ANYA,"Nothing, and nothing."
66.4,70.07,ANYA,Cliffs Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged.
70.16,73.71,WILLOW,"Yeah, my search"
70.16,73.71,WILLOW,isn't turning anything up either.
73.8,77.03,WILLOW,Are you sure this thing called itself the First?
77.12,81.99,BUFFY,"Pretty sure. lt claimed to be the original evil,"
77.12,81.99,BUFFY,the one that came before anything else.
82.08,84.35,ANYA,How many times
82.08,84.35,ANYA,have l heard that as a demon?
84.44,87.03,ANYA,"l'm so rotten, they don't have a word for it."""
87.12,91.11,ANYA,l'm bad. Baddy bad bad bad.
87.12,91.11,ANYA,Does it make you horny?"
92.08,93.56,ANYA,Or terrified. Whatever.
93.56,95.11,XANDER,i></i> lt wasn't a line.
95.2,98.51,XANDER,"When l came up against this thing, l felt it."
98.6,103.91,XANDER,lt was... ancient and enormous.
98.6,103.91,XANDER,lt nearly got Angel to kill himself.
104.48,106.01,XANDER,"lf we don't rescue Spike soon,"
106.01,108.15,BUFFY,God knows what the First'll get him to do.
108.24,111.63,XANDER,l wish Sleeping Ugly would come to.
108.24,111.63,XANDER,He's been out all night.
111.72,115.23,ANYA,"Yes, he was just starting to squeal"
111.72,115.23,ANYA,when the spooky SWAT attacked.
115.32,119.71,ANYA,Said the First was held up
115.32,119.71,ANYA,at the Seal of... Danzar something?
122.2,127.15,DAWN,Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't
122.2,127.15,DAWN,have to answer any more questions.
128.76,131.05,DAWN,Hm. Or maybe he's in a fugue state.
131.05,131.83,BUFFY,i></i> Dawn.
131.92,132.3,DAWN,What?
132.3,134.64,BUFFY,He'll come to when he comes to.
134.72,140.27,BUFFY,"Keep reading. lf we're gonna rescue Spike,"
134.72,140.27,BUFFY,we need to figure out how to fight this thing.
140.36,142.67,DAWN,Anya gets to hit him.
142.76,147.47,WILLOW,"Hey! Here, the First! Bank of Delaware. Sorry."
150.52,153.39,BUFFY,Hand me the Watchers' Codex again.
155,157.51,JOYCE,"i></i> Can l get you anything else, baby?"
157.6,160.11,JOYCE,How about some tea?
162.08,163.71,BUFFY,Mom?
165.52,167.67,BUFFY,You're not real.
167.76,171.27,JOYCE,"OK, is that slang, like you're not <i>for</i> real, or..."
171.36,173.82,BUFFY,You're the First.
173.92,177.63,JOYCE,"Oh, baby, you're so tired,"
173.92,177.63,JOYCE,you're not making sense.
177.72,180.09,JOYCE,Maybe you should get some sleep.
180.09,180.31,BUFFY,No.
180.4,182.39,JOYCE,You can't win against this thing.
182.48,184.7,JOYCE,Not if you don't rest.
184.7,185.2,BUFFY,Stop.
185.28,187.59,BUFFY,Stop being like this.
189.16,190.91,BUFFY,lt's a lie.
191,195.07,JOYCE,"l don't want to scare you,"
191,195.07,JOYCE,but l want you to take care.
195.16,198.43,JOYCE,You <i>need</i> to wake up.
198.52,199,BUFFY,What?
199,201.19,XANDER (O.S.),i> You're dreaming.</i>
201.28,203.92,XANDER (O.S.),"Buff, wake up."
204,205.16,BUFFY,Did you see it?
205.16,206.95,XANDER,There's nothing to see.
207.04,211.31,XANDER,You were just doing
207.04,211.31,XANDER,"a little dreamtalking, that's all."
211.4,212.8,BUFFY,Oh.
212.88,215.44,XANDER,You OK?
216.24,217.98,XANDER,What'd you see?
217.98,218.91,BUFFY,Nothing.

353.56,355.47,ANYA,Good thinking.
355.56,357.49,ANYA,"Whoa, hey."
357.49,358.07,DAWN,Hi.

382.4,384.27,ANDREW,You saved me.
384.36,386.39,BUFFY,For the time being.
386.48,388.75,BUFFY,"But if you don't tell us what we need to know,"
388.84,394.47,BUFFY,then l'm gonna offer you to the First on a
388.84,394.47,BUFFY,platter and let him chop you into tiny pieces.
394.56,395.75,ANDREW,The first what?
395.84,398.75,ANYA,The evil thing posing as Warren
395.84,398.75,ANYA,to get you to kill Jonathan.
398.84,400.33,ANDREW,Not very ominoussounding.
400.33,402.47,DAWN,lt is if you understand the context.
402.56,406.67,ANDREW,"No, an evil name should be"
402.56,406.67,ANDREW,like Lex or Voldemort or...
406.76,409.51,BUFFY,"Hey, l was intimidating here."
410.6,413.71,ANDREW,"Oh, sorry. Go ahead."
415.44,417.87,BUFFY,Forget it. Where's the seal?
417.96,420.03,ANDREW,"lt's around this corner, l think."
420.12,421.87,BUFFY,You'd better be right this time.
421.87,423.23,ANDREW,"l told you, l'm not sure."
423.32,426.63,XANDER,Maybe you should get sure.
423.32,426.63,XANDER,l'm sick of all the runaround with you.
426.72,429.71,XANDER,Whoa. Check out the goatheaded badness.
430.76,431.73,BUFFY,What's it do?
431.73,434.19,ANDREW,l don't know. Something not good.
434.28,438.32,ANDREW,lt didn't work cos...
434.28,438.32,ANDREW,there wasn't enough blood.
438.4,440.07,ANDREW,OK.
444.52,446.75,DAWN,There's blood on this. Lots.
446.84,450.43,DAWN,Looks like the First made
446.84,450.43,DAWN,another sacrifice. Or a music video.
450.52,452.71,BUFFY,The seal could've been activated.
452.8,454.97,BUFFY,Maybe that's what it needed Spike for.
454.97,456.39,ANDREW,That wasn't there before.
456.48,458.05,ANDREW,l had nothing to do with that.
458.05,459.51,XANDER,Thanks for clearing that up.
459.6,462.83,XANDER,We thought you were up to no good
459.6,462.83,XANDER,at this satanic manhole cover.
462.92,464.95,XANDER,You killed your best friend!
465.04,467.35,ANDREW,He's in a place ofjoy and peace. He told me.
467.44,470.95,XANDER,"No, nobody told you."
467.44,470.95,XANDER,You got tricked by a fake ghost.
471.04,474.71,BUFFY,Can we save the encounter session?
471.04,474.71,BUFFY,We need to cover this thing up.
474.8,478.31,BUFFY,"Whatever it does,"
474.8,478.31,BUFFY,we can't leave it exposed like this.
487,491.99,ANDREW,This place gives me the creeps.
487,491.99,ANDREW,"lt's like in <i>Wonder Woman,</i> issue 297299."
492.08,494.32,XANDER,"Catacombs"". Yeah, with the skeletons."
494.32,495.59,ANDREW & XANDER,i></i> That was cool.
495.68,497.67,XANDER,Move it. This way.
498.68,502.51,DAWN,So what next?
498.68,502.51,DAWN,"We found the seal, but no Spike."
502.6,506.35,BUFFY,l don't know. The First was camped
502.6,506.35,BUFFY,underground last time l found him...
506.44,507.79,PRINCIPAL,Buffy?
508.4,510.07,BUFFY,Hey!
508.4,510.07,BUFFY,Hey.
511.68,513.83,PRINCIPAL,l... thought that you were...
513.92,518.11,DAWN,Sick? She was. Vomiting and oozing
513.92,518.11,DAWN,from various places and...
518.2,521.91,PRINCIPAL,"Yeah, l remember, so please don't go on."
523.44,525.27,DAWN,"Oh, but now it's amazing."
525.36,528.59,DAWN,The doctor gave her some cream.
525.36,528.59,DAWN,Some pills.
528.68,531.27,BUFFY,And a cream. And l'm all better.
534.64,537.15,PRINCIPAL,"Oh, yeah. Um..."
537.24,541.67,PRINCIPAL,Apparently somebody left this
537.24,541.67,PRINCIPAL,"in the courtyard, and l was just returning it."
541.76,545.19,BUFFY,That's some fullservice principalling.
545.28,547.27,PRINCIPAL,l try.
550.12,550.95,BUFFY,Oh!
551.04,554.27,BUFFY,l was down here helping Dawn
551.04,554.27,BUFFY,with a school project.
554.36,555.69,DAWN,For science.
555.69,558.79,BUFFY,We buried a... time capsule.
558.88,564.23,DAWN,"Hello, people of the future."
558.88,564.23,DAWN,Kids today like Red Bull and <i>Jackass!"</i>
564.32,566.15,BUFFY,We'd better go.
566.15,566.88,PRINCIPAL,Buffy?
567.68,570.83,PRINCIPAL,"lf you are feeling better,"
567.68,570.83,PRINCIPAL,l could really use you back at work.
570.92,572.46,PRINCIPAL,l've been waitlisting kids

574.04,578.75,BUFFY,"Oh, yeah. l'm sorry, you know,"
574.04,578.75,BUFFY,l just... l've been ill and stuff.
578.84,583.47,PRINCIPAL,"No, it's fine, and l understand."
578.84,583.47,PRINCIPAL,lt's just... things are starting to back up.
583.56,589.03,BUFFY,"Well, l'll be there tomorrow."
583.56,589.03,BUFFY,No problem. 100<i>%</i> oozefree.

608.08,610.99,BUFFY,Dawn's trying to find out
608.08,610.99,BUFFY,about the Seal of Danzalthar.
611.08,614.59,BUFFY,"Will's about to do a locator spell,"
611.08,614.59,BUFFY,see if we can find the First.
614.68,617.87,XANDER,Why don't you go get some rest?
614.68,617.87,XANDER,You haven't slept for two days.
617.96,619.87,XANDER,We'll call you if we find anything.
619.87,622.11,BUFFY,"Nah, l couldn't sleep. Too much going on."
622.2,625.83,XANDER,"lt'll be OK, Buff."

1729.18,1730.27,JOYCE,They do that.
1730.36,1734.71,JOYCE,"l'm sorry, but these friends of yours put too"
1730.36,1734.71,JOYCE,much pressure on you. They always have.
1734.8,1736.71,BUFFY,Something evil is coming.
1736.71,1740.08,JOYCE,"Buffy, evil isn't coming, it's already here."
1740.64,1742.79,JOYCE,Evil is always here.
1742.88,1745.08,JOYCE,Don't you know? lt's everywhere.
1745.08,1746.59,BUFFY,And l have to stop it.
1746.68,1748.67,JOYCE,How are you gonna do that?
1748.67,1750.51,BUFFY,"l don't know yet, but..."
1750.6,1756.71,JOYCE,"Buffy, no matter what your friends"
1750.6,1756.71,JOYCE,"expect of you, evil is a part of us. All of us."
1757.4,1762.91,JOYCE,lt's natural. And no one can stop that.
1757.4,1762.91,JOYCE,"No one can stop nature, not even..."
1763,1764.87,BUFFY,i></i>
1766.56,1769.31,BUFFY,"Oh, l'm sorry. What were we talking about?"
1769.4,1771.85,TEEN BOY,Only my life. You're just like all the others.
1771.85,1773.23,BUFFY,"No. No, no. l'm different."
1773.32,1776.11,BUFFY,"l'm hip, l relate to the young people."
1776.2,1778.66,BUFFY,"No, don't go..."
1779.28,1779.91,TEEN BOY,Roger.
1779.91,1782.43,BUFFY,Roger! See? l knew that!
1786.44,1788.43,BUFFY,Oh!
1790.68,1792.03,GILES,This day's almost over.
1792.36,1795.55,GILES,And the sun will go down in 17 minutes.
1795.64,1798.03,XANDER,"Hey, junior slayers, don't look so worried."
1798.12,1800.76,XANDER,We don't know where Spike is
1798.12,1800.76,XANDER,"or how to fight the First,"
1800.84,1803.79,XANDER,or if and when the superstyle vampire
1800.84,1803.79,XANDER,is gonna attack us.
1803.88,1806.67,XANDER,"However, house  boarded up."
1806.76,1811.75,WILLOW,Now all we gotta do is trap this Ubervamp
1806.76,1811.75,WILLOW,"in the pantry, and it's game over."
1811.84,1817.51,WILLOW,"Xander, newbies. Let's ease them in to"
1811.84,1817.51,WILLOW,the whole "jokes in the face of death" thing.
1817.6,1820.83,XANDER,Who's joking? That pantry thing could work.
1820.92,1823.91,XANDER,Are you saying
1820.92,1823.91,XANDER,M Night Shyamalan lied to us?
1824,1825.43,BUFFY,You'll be OK.
1825.52,1829.19,WILLOW,"OK, or even better. lt's like our guarantee."
1830.2,1836.23,WILLOW,"Buffy, l just... l want you to know"
1830.2,1836.23,WILLOW,that l'm really sorry for letting you down.
1836.32,1841.15,WILLOW,"You know, here before, with the magic"
1836.32,1841.15,WILLOW,going all "argh" and me going all "eee"
1841.24,1844.01,WILLOW,and everything getting all "rrr".
1844.01,1846.03,BUFFY,l wish l could help out.
1846.12,1848.71,BUFFY,No one expects you to make everything right.
1848.8,1853.51,WILLOW,"l can't do everything, but l should"
1848.8,1853.51,WILLOW,at least be able to do something.
1853.6,1856.63,WILLOW,"l have so much power,"
1853.6,1856.63,WILLOW,but when l try to use it...
1856.72,1860.5,BUFFY,"Don't, OK?"
1856.72,1860.5,BUFFY,OK.
1862.12,1865.19,WILLOW,"But... you need help, Buffy."
1865.28,1870.35,WILLOW,"l know you, and l know you'll"
1865.28,1870.35,WILLOW,"never admit it, but you need help."
1871.36,1875.75,BUFFY,"l'll be OK. OK, or better."
1871.36,1875.75,BUFFY,lt's like my guarantee.
1875.84,1878.3,KENNEDY,"Hey, are we getting weapons?"
1878.4,1880.59,KENNEDY,Trained fighters? Patton is coming?
1880.59,1882.03,ANNABELLE,l've heard worse ideas.
1882.12,1884.55,ANNABELLE,We'll be armed
1882.12,1884.55,ANNABELLE,when the Slayer feels we're ready.
1884.64,1886.99,MOLLY,l feel ready.
1887.08,1890.47,ANNABELLE,You're frightened.
1887.08,1890.47,ANNABELLE,You must learn to control your fear.
1890.56,1893.79,KENNEDY,You know what would help with that?
1890.56,1893.79,KENNEDY,Weapons.
1895.8,1896.52,BUFFY,l don't know.
1896.52,1898.36,KENNEDY,We're sitting ducks without them.
1898.44,1901,ANNABELLE,We're with the Slayer. Safe as houses.
1902.16,1904.75,KENNEDY,Do you see the house we're in?
1909.16,1912.59,ANNABELLE,"lt'll come straight for us, won't it?"
1913.84,1916.43,BUFFY,"We should load them up, Giles."
1917.44,1920.11,ANDREW,Listen to me.
1917.44,1920.11,ANDREW,l've got a bad feeling about this.
1920.2,1923.43,XANDER,Of course you've got a bad feeling.
1920.2,1923.43,XANDER,You're tied to a chair.
1923.52,1928.07,ANDREW,"No. Yeah, but above and beyond that,"
1923.52,1928.07,ANDREW,l'm telling you my SpiderSense is tingling.
1928.16,1933.28,ANDREW,This is gonna get hairy. l'm talking
1928.16,1933.28,ANDREW,weird with a beard. Better untie me.
1933.36,1935.75,BUFFY,And that'll help us how?
1936.64,1942.11,ANDREW,"OK, l know what you're thinking."
1936.64,1942.11,ANDREW,"Andrew, bad guy."""
1942.2,1948.07,ANDREW,You think l'm a supervillain like
1942.2,1948.07,ANDREW,Dr Doom or Apocalypse or The Riddler.
1948.16,1950.59,ANDREW,"l admit l went over to the dark side,"
1950.68,1952.95,ANDREW,"butjust to pick up a few things,"
1952.95,1955.15,BUFFY,and now l'm back. l've learned.
1955.24,1958.43,BUFFY,l'm good again.
1955.24,1958.43,BUFFY,And when were you good before?
1958.52,1961.19,ANDREW,"OK, technically, never. Touché."
1961.28,1966.71,ANDREW,But l'm like Vader in the last five minutes
1961.28,1966.71,ANDREW,"of <i>Jedi,</i> with redemptive powers, and..."
1966.8,1971.19,ANDREW,mine is a redemptive struggle... of...
1971.28,1977.83,ANDREW,epic redemption which chronicles...
1971.28,1977.83,ANDREW,These ropes itch.
1982.88,1984.87,BUFFY,How are we doing on time?
1984.96,1987.63,GILES,Sunset should be any minute now.
1988.6,1990.67,GILES,Done everything we can.
1990.76,1995.55,GILES,"And don't worry, everyone here"
1990.76,1995.55,GILES,understands that you're calling the shots.
1995.64,1998.29,BUFFY,l just hope l'm calling the right ones.
1998.29,1999.79,GILES,You have all my faith.
1999.88,2001.87,GILES,And they're depending on you.
2003.88,2006.11,BUFFY,That's not exactly what l needed to hear.
2006.2,2008.66,MOLLY,Guys?
2008.76,2010.39,MOLLY,Annabelle split.
2184.44,2186.43,XANDER,i></i> Buffy!
2191.84,2193.91,XANDER,"Oh, God almighty."
2196.6,2199.71,DRUSILLA/FIRST,i></i> Do you know why you're alive?
2199.8,2206.24,DRUSILLA/FIRST,Never figured you for...
2199.8,2206.24,DRUSILLA/FIRST,"existential thought, love."
2206.32,2208.99,DRUSILLA/FIRST,"l mean, you hated Paris."
2209.08,2213.83,DRUSILLA/FIRST,"You're alive for one reason,"
2209.08,2213.83,DRUSILLA/FIRST,and one reason only.
2213.92,2216.27,DRUSILLA/FIRST,Because l wish it.
2216.36,2218.95,DRUSILLA/FIRST,Do you know why l wish it?
2219.96,2222.59,DRUSILLA/FIRST,Because l'm not done with you.
2222.59,2223.55,SPIKE,Give it up.
2225.04,2229.03,SPIKE,"Whatever you are,"
2225.04,2229.03,SPIKE,"whatever you get away with, l'm out."
2230.12,2233.39,SPIKE,You can't pull this puppet's strings any more.
2233.48,2235.79,DRUSILLA/FIRST,And what makes you think
2233.48,2235.79,DRUSILLA/FIRST,you have a choice?
2235.88,2240.35,DRUSILLA/FIRST,What makes you think you will ever
2235.88,2240.35,DRUSILLA/FIRST,be any good at all in this world?
2240.44,2243.08,SPIKE,She does.
2245.28,2247.59,SPIKE,Because she believes in me.
2253.4,2254.71,SPIKE,i> We could make plans</i>
2254.71,2257.03,GILES (O.S.),"i>as we always do, but Buffy was our plan.</i>"
2257.12,2259.12,GILES (O.S.),i>There is no backup.</i>
2259.12,2261.35,WILLOW (O.S.),"i> Giles, she looks bad.</i>"
2261.44,2262.79,WILLOW (O.S.),i> She does.</i>
2262.79,2266.83,GILES (O.S.),i>l'm afraid there may be internal bleeding.</i>
2266.92,2270.28,WILLOW (O.S.),i> What does that mean? Will she...</i>
2270.28,2273.99,GILES (O.S.),i> Die? l don't think so. l don't know.</i>
2274.08,2279.87,WILLOW (O.S.),i> What do we do if she can't fight?</i>
2274.08,2279.87,WILLOW (O.S.),i>If she can't beat this thing?</i>
2281,2283.1,GILES,We're back at square one.
2283.1,2286.12,XANDER,"Which square would that be, exactly?"
2286.2,2288.39,,l'm not sure.
2288.48,2291.87,,The First predates
2288.48,2291.87,,everything we've ever known.
2291.96,2295.51,,"Or can know. lt's everywhere, it's pure."
2298.48,2301.04,,l don't know if we can fight it.
2301.12,2303.68,,You're right.
2306.88,2309.95,,We don't know how to fight it.
2310.04,2312.19,,We don't know when it'll come.
2313.36,2316.11,,"We can't run, can't hide."
2317.52,2320.99,,"Can't pretend it's not the end, cos it is."
2322.84,2327.51,,Something's always been there
2322.84,2327.51,,to try and destroy the world.
2327.6,2330.19,,We've beaten them back.
2331.32,2334.39,,But we're not dealing with them any more.
2334.48,2338.11,,We're dealing with the reason they exist.
2338.2,2341.59,,Evil. The strongest.
2342.92,2345.71,,The First.
2345.8,2347.39,,"Buffy, um..."
2347.48,2351.26,,l know you're very tired...
2347.48,2351.26,,l'm beyond tired.
2352.28,2354.27,,l'm beyond scared.
2355.28,2360.3,,"l'm standing on the mouth of hell,"
2355.28,2360.3,,and it is gonna swallow me whole.
2360.4,2363.27,,And it'll choke on me.
2366.12,2368.27,,We're not ready?
2368.36,2370.95,,They're not ready.
2371.04,2375.79,,They think we're gonna wait
2371.04,2375.79,,"for the end to come, like we always do."
2375.88,2377.79,,l'm done waiting.
2377.88,2381.55,,They want an apocalypse?
2377.88,2381.55,,"Well, we'll give 'em one."
2383.16,2388.99,,"Anyone else who wants to run, do it now."
2383.16,2388.99,,Cos we just became an army.
2390.48,2392.87,,We just declared war.
2393.8,2399.27,,"From now on, we won'tjust face"
2393.8,2399.27,,"our worst fears, we will seek them out."
2399.36,2403.11,,We will find them
2399.36,2403.11,,"and cut out their hearts one by one,"
2404.24,2407.87,,until the First shows itself
2404.24,2407.87,,for what it really is.
2408.88,2411.52,,And l'll kill it myself.
