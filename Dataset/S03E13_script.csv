20.54,23.81,,non diutius.
40.5,42.52,,Now!
42.6,44.63,,Aaaaah!
52.18,54.77,,I think that
52.18,54.77,,was the last.
57.68,58.94,,"Willow, you OK?"
59.02,60.11,,"Yeah, I'm fine."
60.18,63.28,,ThThe shaking is a side effect
60.18,63.28,,of the fear.
63.35,64.34,,Thank you.
64.42,66.19,,If it wasn't for
64.42,66.19,,that clouding spell...
66.26,70.32,,"Yeah, it went good."
66.26,70.32,,Nothing melted like last time.
70.39,71.92,,These babes were
70.39,71.92,,wicked rowdy.
72,73.12,,What's their deal?
73.2,74.46,Giles,I wish I knew.
76.03,78.73,Giles,Most of my sources
76.03,78.73,Giles,have dried up
78.8,81.6,Giles,since the Council
78.8,81.6,Giles,has relieved me of my duties.
81.67,83.61,Giles,I was aware there
81.67,83.61,Giles,was a nest here...
83.67,85.8,Giles,"but quite frankly,"
83.67,85.8,Giles,I expected it to be vampires.
85.88,86.81,Giles,These are new.
86.88,88.04,Buffy,And improved.
88.11,89.51,Giles,Yes. I'm sorry.
89.58,91.17,Giles,I should've had you
89.58,91.17,Giles,better prepared...
91.25,93.58,Giles,and I should never
91.25,93.58,Giles,"have allowed Willow and, uh..."
93.65,96.31,Giles,"and, uh..."
98.99,101.58,Xander,I'm good...
98.99,101.58,Xander,We're fine.
103.33,104.92,Xander,Just a little bit dirty.
105,107.02,Xander,"Good show, everyone."
105,107.02,Xander,Just great.
108.83,110.49,Xander,I think we have a hit.
110.57,111.73,Willow,Are you OK?
111.8,114.5,Xander,"Tiptop, really."
114.57,116.77,Xander,If anyone sees
114.57,116.77,Xander,my spine laying around...
116.84,118.87,Xander,just try not
116.84,118.87,Xander,to step on it.
118.94,121.17,Buffy,"Xander, one of these days,"
118.94,121.17,Buffy,you're gonna get yourself hurt.
121.25,122.37,Faith,Or killed.
122.37,123.27,Buffy,Or both.
123.35,126.25,Buffy,"And, you know,"
123.35,126.25,Buffy,with the pain and the death...
126.32,128.91,Buffy,maybe you shouldn't be
126.32,128.91,Buffy,leaping into the fray like that.
128.99,130.5,Buffy,Maybe you should be...
130.5,131.39,Xander,frayadjacent.
131.46,133.22,Xander,Excuse me?
131.46,133.22,Xander,"Who, at a crucial moment..."
133.29,134.42,Xander,distracted the lead demon
134.49,136.76,Xander,by allowing her
134.49,136.76,Xander,to pummel him about the head?
136.83,140.06,Faith,Yeah. That was real manly
136.83,140.06,Faith,how you shrieked and all.
140.13,142.06,Xander,I think you'll find
140.13,142.06,Xander,that was more of a bellow.
142.13,145.07,Buffy,What do we do with the trio here?
142.13,145.07,Buffy,Should we burn them?
145.14,147.76,Willow,I brought marshmallows.
147.84,150.57,Willow,"Occasionally,"
147.84,150.57,Willow,I'm callous and strange.
150.64,152.13,Giles,I expect we can leave them.
152.21,154.87,Giles,I'm more interested
152.21,154.87,Giles,in finding out what they are...
154.95,157.71,Giles,and whether we can expect
154.95,157.71,Giles,more of their kind.
157.78,159.87,Buffy,I hope not.
157.78,159.87,Buffy,They're way too fit.
161.32,162.65,Xander,I say bring 'em on!
162.72,164.62,Giles,"Uh, Xander,"
162.72,164.62,Giles,I think in the future
164.69,169.15,Giles,perhaps it would be best if you
164.69,169.15,Giles,hung back to the rear of the battle...
169.23,170.63,Giles,for your own sake.
170.69,171.72,Xander,"But, gee, Mr. White..."
171.8,174.13,Xander,if Clark and Lois
171.8,174.13,Xander,get all the good stories...
174.2,175.72,Xander,I'll never be
174.2,175.72,Xander,a good reporter.
175.8,176.73,Giles,Hmm?
176.8,177.73,Xander,"Jimmy Olsen joke, sir."
177.8,179.23,Xander,Pretty much gonna
177.8,179.23,Xander,be lost on you.
179.3,180.24,Giles,Sorry.
180.3,181.46,Xander,"Hey, it's OK."
183.42,186.51,Xander,
247.17,249.9,Xander,"Hey, Doug, toss me one!"
252.14,253.48,Xander,"Lesman, I'm open!"
253.55,255.04,Xander,"Les, buddy!"
255.11,257.05,Xander,"Doug, right here, man."
257.12,258.28,Xander,Right here.
258.35,260.38,Xander,"Doug, please."
262.02,263.61,Xander,All right!
262.02,263.61,Xander,It's all me!
270.23,272.16,Xander,"Boy, I am so sorry."
272.23,274.63,Xander,Doug's arm is kinda
272.23,274.63,Xander,like spaghetti.
274.7,276.73,Jack,We're all so
274.7,276.73,Jack,very sad for him.
276.8,278.24,Jack,Is your lunch OK?
278.3,280.24,Jack,"What are you, retarded?"
280.31,282.83,Xander,"No. No, I had to take"
280.31,282.83,Xander,that test when I was 7.
282.91,284.17,Xander,A little slow
282.91,284.17,Xander,in some stuff...
284.24,285.84,Xander,mostly math and
284.24,285.84,Xander,spatial relations...
285.91,287.78,Xander,but certainly not challenged
285.91,287.78,Xander,or anything.
287.85,289.44,Xander,Can I get you
287.85,289.44,Xander,another soda?
289.52,291.75,Jack,I ought to cut
289.52,291.75,Jack,your face open.
291.82,294.88,Xander,"Hey, hey, whoa. It was an accident."
291.82,294.88,Xander,Cool down.
298.52,300.46,Jack,You wanna be
298.52,300.46,Jack,startin' somethin'?
300.53,302.46,Jack,What?
300.53,302.46,Jack,Starting something?
302.53,304.79,Xander,Like that
302.53,304.79,Xander,"MichaelJackson song, right?"
304.86,306.49,Xander,That was a lot of fun.
306.57,309.16,Xander,"Too high to get over,"
306.57,309.16,Xander,"yeah, yeah *"
309.23,310.5,Xander,Remember
309.23,310.5,Xander,that fun song?
310.57,312.5,Jack,I get my buddies
310.57,312.5,Jack,together...
312.57,318.02,Jack,we're gonna kick your ass
312.57,318.02,Jack,till it's a brandnew shape.
316.07,318.47,Jack,"Now, get outta here."
326.25,329.35,Cordelia,"Boy, of all the humiliations"
326.25,329.35,Cordelia,you've had I've witnessed...
329.42,330.68,Cordelia,that was the latest.
330.76,332.02,Xander,I could've taken him.
332.09,334.68,Cordelia,"Oh, please."
332.09,334.68,Cordelia,O'Toole would macram√© your face.
334.76,336.02,Cordelia,He is a psycho...
336.09,338.72,Cordelia,which is still a lot cooler
336.09,338.72,Cordelia,than being a wuss.
338.8,341.06,Cordelia,Why is it that I've
338.8,341.06,Cordelia,come facetoface
341.13,344.63,Cordelia,"with vampires, demons, the most"
341.13,344.63,Cordelia,hideous creatures hell ever spit out...
344.7,347.73,Cordelia,and I'm still afraid
344.7,347.73,Cordelia,of a little bully likeJack O'Toole?
347.81,351.21,Cordelia,"Because, unlike all those creatures"
347.81,351.21,Cordelia,you've come facetoface with...
351.28,353.57,Cordelia,Jack actually noticed
351.28,353.57,Cordelia,you were there.
353.65,355.81,Cordelia,Why am I surprised
353.65,355.81,Cordelia,by how comforting you're not?
355.88,359.78,Cordelia,It must be really hard when
355.88,359.78,Cordelia,all your friends have superpowers...
359.85,362.05,Cordelia,"slayer, werewolf,"
359.85,362.05,Cordelia,"witches, vampires..."
362.12,363.88,Cordelia,"and you're, like,"
362.12,363.88,Cordelia,this little nothing.
363.96,367.98,Cordelia,You must feel
363.96,367.98,Cordelia,likeJimmy Olsen.
368.06,370.89,Cordelia,I was just talking to...
368.06,370.89,Cordelia,"Hey, mind your own business."
370.96,372.4,Cordelia,"Ooh, I struck a nerve."
372.46,374.43,Cordelia,The boy that had no cool.
374.5,376.56,Cordelia,I happen to be an integral part
374.5,376.56,Cordelia,of that group.
376.64,378.07,Cordelia,I have a lot to offer.
378.14,379.12,Cordelia,"Oh, please."
379.12,379.57,Xander,I do!
379.64,381.44,Cordelia,Integral part"
379.64,381.44,Cordelia,of the group?
381.51,384.94,Cordelia,"Xander, you're the useless part"
381.51,384.94,Cordelia,of the group.
387.02,386.44,Cordelia,You're the Zeppo.
386.51,389.21,Cordelia,Cool." Look it up.
389.28,394.34,Cordelia,It's something that a subliterate that's
389.28,394.34,Cordelia,repeated 12th grade 3 times has...
394.42,395.44,Cordelia,and you don't.
399.42,402.19,Cordelia,There was no part of that
399.42,402.19,Cordelia,that wasn't fun.
406.37,409.69,Cordelia,But it's just that it's bugging me...
409.69,411.3,Xander,this "cool" thing.
411.37,414.13,Xander,"I mean, what is it?"
411.37,414.13,Xander,How do you get it?
414.21,416.23,Xander,Who doesn't have it?
416.31,418.57,Xander,And who decides
416.31,418.57,Xander,who doesn't have it?
418.64,420.7,Xander,What is the essence
418.64,420.7,Xander,of cool?
422.11,423.05,Oz,Not sure.
423.12,424.71,Xander,"I mean, you yourself, Oz..."
424.78,426.72,Xander,are considered
424.78,426.72,Xander,more or less cool.
426.79,428.08,Xander,Why is that?
428.15,429.09,Oz,Am I?
429.15,430.55,Xander,Is it about the talking?
430.62,433.15,Xander,"You know, the way"
430.62,433.15,Xander,you tend to express yourself
433.23,435.32,Xander,"in short,"
433.23,435.32,Xander,noncommittal phrases?
435.39,436.66,Oz,Could be.
436.73,438.99,Xander,No. You're in a band.
439.06,441.33,Xander,That's like
439.06,441.33,Xander,a businessclass ticket to cool
441.4,443.33,Xander,with complimentary
441.4,443.33,Xander,mojo after takeoff.
443.4,444.73,Xander,I gotta learn
443.4,444.73,Xander,an instrument.
444.8,446.57,Xander,Is it hard
444.8,446.57,Xander,to play guitar?
446.64,448.3,Oz,Not the way I play it.
448.37,450.47,Xander,But on the other hand...
448.37,450.47,Xander,eighth grade.
450.54,453.14,Xander,I'm taking the flugelhorn
450.54,453.14,Xander,and getting zero trim...
453.21,455.81,Xander,so the whole instrument thing
453.21,455.81,Xander,could be a mislead.
455.88,457.47,Xander,But you need a thing...
457.55,460.14,Xander,one thing
457.55,460.14,Xander,nobody else has.
460.22,461.52,Oz,What do I have?
461.59,463.35,Oz,An exciting new obsession...
463.42,465.91,Oz,which I feel makes
463.42,465.91,Oz,you very special.
465.99,467.75,Xander,Now with the mocking.
467.83,471.26,Xander,Which I can handle because
467.83,471.26,Xander,I know I'm right about this.
471.33,475.77,Xander,I'm on the track.
471.33,475.77,Xander,I just need to find my thing.
475.83,477.83,Oz,It seems like you're
475.83,477.83,Oz,overthinking it.
477.9,480.43,Oz,You got some identity issues.
477.9,480.43,Oz,It's not...
480.51,482.1,Giles,The end of the world?
482.17,483.44,Buffy,Can they do that?
483.51,484.77,Giles,They seem fairly committed.
486.51,488.19,Giles,The Sisterhood ofJhe
488.19,490.04,Buffy,is an apocalypse cult.
490.12,493.98,Buffy,They exist solely to bring about
490.12,493.98,Buffy,the world's destruction...
494.05,496.89,Buffy,and we've not seen the last of them.
494.05,496.89,Buffy,More will follow.
496.96,499.82,Buffy,And they're here in Sunnydale
496.96,499.82,Buffy,"for what, Demon Expo?"
499.89,502.19,Giles,"Buffy, this is"
499.89,502.19,Giles,no laughing matter.
502.26,504.19,Buffy,Hence my no laughing.
505.2,506.79,Giles,I'm sorry.
506.87,510.13,Giles,I know I'm no longer
506.87,510.13,Giles,"your official Watcher, but..."
511.24,512.33,Oz,Hey.
512.4,513.46,Oz,Hey.
513.54,516.41,Giles,"Um, you're cutting it a bit close."
516.48,518.24,Oz,"Well, you know me."
522.55,525.31,Buffy,"Well, do we know"
522.55,525.31,Buffy,why they're here?
525.38,529.75,Giles,I think so. Based on
525.38,529.75,Giles,some artifacts I found with them...
529.82,534.72,Giles,and taking into account
529.82,534.72,Giles,the current astral cycle...
534.79,537.56,Buffy,"Giles, I don't need"
534.79,537.56,Buffy,to see the math.
542.53,544.87,Giles,They intend
542.53,544.87,Giles,to open the hellmouth.
546.87,549.14,Giles,The hellmouth.
549.21,550.5,Buffy,The one that opens...
550.58,553.91,Giles,About 20 feet from
550.58,553.91,Giles,where you're standing.
562.22,564.21,Giles,
564.32,565.72,Willow,And if it opens?
565.79,569.25,Buffy,Do you remember the demon that
565.79,569.25,Buffy,almost got out the night I died?
569.33,570.59,Willow,Every nightmare I have
570.66,573.43,Willow,that doesn't revolve
570.66,573.43,Willow,around academic failure
573.5,575.59,Willow,or public nudity
573.5,575.59,Willow,is about that thing.
575.67,578.26,Willow,"In fact, once I dreamt"
575.67,578.26,Willow,that it attacked me
578.34,580.93,Willow,while I was late
578.34,580.93,Willow,for a test and naked.
583.02,583.34,Buffy,"Well, it'll be"
583.02,583.34,Buffy,the first to come out...
583.41,586.97,Buffy,and Giles says it won't
583.41,586.97,Buffy,be the worst by a long shot.
587.05,590.98,Buffy,The world will be overrun
587.05,590.98,Buffy,with demons if we don't stop it.
591.05,593.81,Willow,Do we know when this
591.05,593.81,Willow,is supposed to happen?
593.89,595.98,Buffy,Giles is trying
593.89,595.98,Buffy,to narrow it down.
596.05,599.99,Buffy,"If you're up for it,"
596.05,599.99,Buffy,we're heading into deep research mode.
600.06,603.32,Willow,I'd be offended if
600.06,603.32,Willow,you haven't already counted me in.
603.4,608.66,Buffy,"Thanks, Wil. There's something"
603.4,608.66,Buffy,about this one that... scares me.
608.73,610.17,Buffy,I need my Willow.
610.24,612.23,Willow,"Oh, you don't have"
610.24,612.23,Willow,to be afraid...
612.3,613.24,Willow,
613.31,614.6,Xander,You girls need a lift?
616.91,618.84,Buffy,What is this?
618.91,620.71,Xander,"What do you mean,"
618.91,620.71,Xander,what is it?
620.78,621.71,Willow,It's my thing.
621.78,624.18,Willow,Your thing?
624.25,625.74,Xander,My thing!
625.82,627.31,Buffy,Is this a penis metaphor?
627.39,629.65,Xander,It's my thing
627.39,629.65,Xander,that makes me cool.
629.72,631.48,Xander,"You know,"
629.72,631.48,Xander,that makes me unique.
631.56,633.58,Xander,I'm "car guy"...
631.56,633.58,Xander,guy with the car.
633.66,635.25,Willow,How can you afford it?
635.33,637.09,Xander,"Uncle Roary,"
635.33,637.09,Xander,stacking up the DUIs...
637.16,641.83,Xander,let me rent this bad boy
637.16,641.83,Xander,till he's mobile again.
641.9,644.7,Buffy,Well... it's nice.
644.77,647.47,Xander,Could you sound
644.77,647.47,Xander,a little less enthused?
647.54,648.3,Buffy,Sorry.
648.3,648.94,Willow,Evil.
651.02,650.5,Xander,Big?
651.02,650.5,Xander,Biggest.
650.58,652.44,Buffy,Maybe more than
650.58,652.44,Buffy,I can handle.
652.51,654.95,Xander,Then we'll handle it
652.51,654.95,Xander,together.
655.01,657.28,Xander,You know I'm here for you.
657.35,660.05,Xander,Just tell me
657.35,660.05,Xander,what I can do.
660.12,661.98,Xander,"I'll take 2 glazed,"
660.12,661.98,Xander,cinnamon...
662.05,663.82,Xander,couple creamfilled
662.05,663.82,Xander,and a jelly.
663.89,665.82,Xander,No. Let's round that out
663.89,665.82,Xander,to 4 jellies.
665.89,667.48,Cordelia,"Ooh, is some evil"
665.89,667.48,Cordelia,going on?
667.56,669.49,Cordelia,Must be big for them
667.56,669.49,Cordelia,to entrust you
669.56,671.15,Cordelia,with this
669.56,671.15,Cordelia,daredevil mission.
671.23,672.99,Xander,Cordelia.
671.23,672.99,Xander,Feel free to drop dead
673.06,674.19,Xander,of a wasting disease
674.19,675.5,Cordelia,in the next 20 seconds.
675.57,677.19,Cordelia,"Ooh, again,"
675.57,677.19,Cordelia,I strike the nerve.
677.27,679.24,Cordelia,I am the surgeon of mean.
679.3,680.74,Xander,I'm kinda busy
679.3,680.74,Xander,"right now, OK?"
680.81,681.08,Xander,Right.
681.08,682.03,Cordelia,Buffy need your help?
682.11,684.04,Xander,Can you say "expendable"?
684.11,685.7,Xander,You think
684.11,685.7,Xander,you know everything.
685.78,687.68,Cordelia,I think I know you.
687.75,688.84,Xander,That's a laugh.
688.91,690.54,Cordelia,"What, you got a shiny car..."
690.62,691.91,Cordelia,and now you're someone new?
691.98,694.18,Cordelia,Like anybody
691.98,694.18,Cordelia,even cares about...
694.25,696.98,Lysette,Is that your car?
697.06,700.39,Xander,"Why, uh... yes, it is."
700.46,703.19,Lysette,Chevy Bel Aire...
703.26,704.89,Lysette,C.I. D...
704.96,708.49,Lysette,solid lifter...
704.96,708.49,Lysette,fuelinjected V8.
708.57,711.87,Xander,Uh... very possibly.
711.94,713.43,Lysette,How does she handle?
713.51,717,Xander,Like a dream about
713.51,717,Xander,"warm, sticky things."
717.08,720.34,Xander,Would you like to go
717.08,720.34,Xander,for a little drive?
720.41,722.57,Lysette,You busy?
722.65,724.58,Xander,Just gotta drop
722.65,724.58,Xander,this stuff off...
724.65,727.71,Xander,and then I would describe myself
724.65,727.71,Xander,as... expendable.
748.81,752.25,Lysette,and then I started
748.81,752.25,Lysette,seeing Dave Peck.
752.31,754.54,Lysette,"Had a Thunderbird,"
752.31,754.54,Lysette,engine completely tricked out...
754.61,756.71,Lysette,but the upholstery
754.61,756.71,Lysette,was kind of shot.
756.78,758.84,Lysette,So then I started
756.78,758.84,Lysette,seeing his friend Mike.
758.92,760.35,Lysette,Not the Mike
758.92,760.35,Lysette,with the Mercedes.
760.42,761.79,Lysette,The Mike with the Mustang...
761.86,764.32,Xander,An '82 V6.
761.86,764.32,Xander,You know the look.
764.39,766.02,Xander,Angel!
766.09,767.08,Xander,Buddy!
767.16,770.93,Xander,Friendbuddy.
767.16,770.93,Xander,You wanna sit and talk?
771,772.12,Angel,I'm looking for Buffy.
772.2,773.93,Xander,Library last I saw.
776.02,777.09,Angel,Something's happening.
776.02,777.09,Angel,I've seen portents.
777.17,779.5,Xander,The apocalypse.
777.17,779.5,Xander,They're on top of it.
779.57,781.87,Angel,I don't think they know
779.57,781.87,Angel,what they're dealing with.
781.94,783.97,Xander,Let's go there...
781.94,783.97,Xander,and tell them that.
784.04,786.71,Angel,No. It's best
784.04,786.71,Angel,you stay out of harm's way.
786.78,789.21,Xander,But I can help.
790.38,792.65,Lysette,"Hey, you wanna go"
790.38,792.65,Lysette,for another drive?
798.29,799.56,Lysette,"You know, it's not like"
799.56,800.89,Xander,I haven't helped before.
800.96,803.56,Xander,I've done some quality violence
800.96,803.56,Xander,for those people.
803.63,805.56,Xander,Do they even
803.63,805.56,Xander,think about that?
807.63,810.23,Xander,I mean...
810.3,812.9,Xander,they act like I'm
810.3,812.9,Xander,some sort of klutz.
812.97,814.57,Xander,
814.64,816.4,Xander,"Oh, God!"
814.64,816.4,Xander,Are you all right?
817.48,818.41,Xander,"Oh, God!"
819.65,821.08,Xander,Stay calm.
821.15,824.31,Xander,Little fender bender.
821.15,824.31,Xander,It's not...
828.29,831.05,Xander,the end of the world.
844.1,846.07,Willow,He's cranky.
846.14,848.87,Buffy,It's a good night for it.
848.94,853.74,Willow,Can't dogs sense when there's
848.94,853.74,Willow,"an earthquake, and they bark?"
853.81,855.5,Buffy,Or cows lie down
855.5,856.87,Willow,or something?
856.95,858.88,Buffy,Sisterhood ofJhe."
858.95,861.82,Buffy,"Race of female demons,"
858.95,861.82,Buffy,fierce warriors..."
861.89,865.85,Buffy,Eww. "...celebrate victory
861.89,865.85,Buffy,in battle by eating their foes."
865.93,867.89,Giles,They couldn't just pour Gatorade
865.93,867.89,Giles,on each other?
867.96,871.66,Giles,Wouldn't even take
867.96,871.66,Giles,my calls. Idiots.
871.73,873.64,Giles,Anything useful in the books?
873.64,874.36,Buffy,Not wildly.
874.43,877.34,Willow,We still have the Books of Pherion
874.43,877.34,Willow,to go through.
877.4,879.4,Buffy,I'm getting
877.4,879.4,Buffy,"itchy feet, Giles."
879.47,880.94,Buffy,We don't turn up
879.47,880.94,Buffy,something soon...
883.02,882.57,Buffy,I'm gonna hit
883.02,882.57,Buffy,the streets.
882.64,883.57,Buffy,Maybe check out Willy's.
883.64,884.06,Giles,Fine.
884.06,885.74,Willow,Where are you going?
885.81,888.75,Giles,"Um, to try and contact"
885.81,888.75,Giles,the spirit guides.
888.82,892.38,Giles,"They exist out of time,"
888.82,892.38,Giles,but have knowledge of the future.
892.45,897.22,Giles,I have no idea if they will respond
892.45,897.22,Giles,"to my efforts, but I have to try."
897.29,900.95,Giles,All we know is that the fate
897.29,900.95,Giles,of the entire world rests on it.
901.03,902.86,Buffy,Did you eat
901.03,902.86,Buffy,all the jellies?
904.86,906.67,Buffy,Did you want a jelly?
906.67,908.56,Giles,I always have a jelly.
908.64,911.54,Giles,I'm always the one that says
908.64,911.54,Giles,Let's have a jelly in the mix."
911.61,914.23,Willow,We're sorry. Buffy had 3.
916.31,919.34,Giles,No matter.
916.31,919.34,Giles,If Xander makes another run...
919.41,921.35,Buffy,No. Xander's out of this.
921.41,923.35,Buffy,He nearly got killed
921.41,923.35,Buffy,last time we fought.
923.42,926.35,Buffy,This whole thing will be easier
923.42,926.35,Buffy,if we know he's safe.
926.42,929.12,Xander,"Oh, gosh, Jack,"
926.42,929.12,Xander,are... are you OK?
929.19,931.12,Xander,I am really sorry
929.19,931.12,Xander,about that...
931.19,933.42,Xander,but your car came
931.19,933.42,Xander,out of nowhere.
934.83,936.09,Jack,I was parked.
936.16,938.72,Xander,Exactly.
936.16,938.72,Xander,"Look, I can cover the damages."
938.8,942.26,Xander,I don't have insurance
938.8,942.26,Xander,in the strictest sense of the word...
942.34,944.27,Xander,but I have
942.34,944.27,Xander,a little money.
944.34,946.6,Xander,The important thing
944.34,946.6,Xander,is that we're all right
946.67,949.11,Xander,and we can work this out
946.67,949.11,Xander,like two reasonable...
949.18,951.04,Xander,frontiersmen.
951.11,952.2,Jack,Where do you want it?
952.28,954.11,Xander,What?
954.18,955.58,Jack,Where do you want it?
955.65,958.41,Xander,I'm fairly certain
955.65,958.41,Xander,I don't want it at all...
958.49,959.75,Xander,"but, uh, thank you."
959.82,962.22,Lysette,Wow. Cool knife.
963.22,965.16,Xander,Yeah. Great knife.
965.23,968.96,Xander,Although I think
965.23,968.96,Xander,it may technically be a sword.
969.03,970.55,Jack,She's called "Katie."
970.63,972.56,Xander,You gave it
970.63,972.56,Xander,a girl's name.
972.63,975.23,Xander,How very serial killer
972.63,975.23,Xander,of you.
975.3,978.13,Xander,"Listen, I think"
975.3,978.13,Xander,we should be going.
978.2,981.23,Jack,Are you scared?
981.31,983.57,Xander,Would that
981.31,983.57,Xander,make you happy?
983.64,987.31,Jack,"Your woman looking on,"
983.64,987.31,Jack,you can't stand up to me?
987.38,989.28,Jack,Don't you feel pathetic?
989.35,992.11,Xander,Mostly I feel Katie.
994.05,997.39,Jack,You know what the difference
994.05,997.39,Jack,between you and me is?
997.46,1000.69,Xander,Again... Katie's
997.46,1000.69,Xander,springing to mind.
1000.76,1002.79,Jack,Fear.
1004.23,1006.13,Jack,Who has the least fear.
1006.2,1007.93,Xander,And it has
1006.2,1007.93,Xander,nothing to do
1010.02,1010.33,Xander,with who has
1010.02,1010.33,Xander,"the big, sharp..."
1011.57,1013.04,Jack,Come on.
1014.11,1015.97,Lysette,I want to go
1014.11,1015.97,Lysette,for a drive.
1016.04,1017.34,Lysette,I'm bored.
1017.41,1020.28,Xander,"Oh, gee, I'm really sorry"
1017.41,1020.28,Xander,my lifeanddeath situation
1020.35,1022.04,Xander,isn't exciting enough
1020.35,1022.04,Xander,for you...
1025.09,1026.18,Police Officer,Hey!
1027.39,1028.85,Police Officer,What's going on?
1028.92,1032.29,Jack,Nothing. Just rasslin'.
1033.69,1035.66,Jack,O'Toole. Heh heh.
1035.73,1038.63,Jack,What a surprise.
1040.73,1042.17,Jack,He attack you?
1043.94,1048.53,Jack,No. Just
1043.94,1048.53,Jack,blowing off steam.
1048.61,1050.58,Jack,Two guys rasslin'.
1050.64,1052.58,Xander,But not in a gay way.
1052.65,1054.31,Police Officer,"Do it somewhere else, huh?"
1058.49,1059.58,Xander,What?
1059.65,1061.21,Jack,That was all right.
1061.29,1063.78,Jack,Could've narked on me.
1061.29,1063.78,Jack,Didn't do it.
1063.86,1065.52,Jack,That's decent of you.
1067.43,1069.69,Jack,I like you.
1071.06,1072,Xander,Yea?
1072.07,1074.73,Jack,You two wanna
1072.07,1074.73,Jack,have some fun?
1074.8,1076.77,Lysette,"Like, with driving?"
1076.84,1078,Jack,Yeah.
1078.07,1080.1,Xander,What do you have
1078.07,1080.1,Xander,in mind?
1080.17,1084.94,Jack,I was on my way to get the boys.
1080.17,1084.94,Jack,Gonna cruise around.
1087.02,1088.28,Jack,We'll take your wheels.
1088.35,1090.75,Xander,What about your car?
1090.82,1092.08,Jack,It ain't mine.
1096.16,1097.42,Xander,Great. Where to?
1097.49,1099.08,Jack,Gonna get the boys!
1101.16,1102.22,Xander,Yeah.
1103.53,1105.69,Xander,"So, where're the boys?"
1107.7,1109.5,Xander,Jack: He calls forth
1109.5,1112.64,Jack,"the spirit of Uurthu, the restless."
1112.71,1115.3,Jack,No one shall speak.
1115.38,1117.43,Jack,He shall arise!
1117.51,1122.78,Jack,Hear me. The blood of the earth
1117.51,1122.78,Jack,shall restore him...
1128.45,1130.39,Jack,and he shall arise.
1131.79,1133.05,Jack,Shall arise.
1143.4,1145.3,Bob,Buddy.
1145.37,1146.8,Jack,Bob...
1146.87,1150.27,Jack,"you big, hideous corpse..."
1146.87,1150.27,Jack,come here!
1151.34,1153.74,Xander,Aaah!
1153.81,1159.02,Xander,Ha ha ha ha!
1157.08,1158.98,Xander,I'll call ya!
1159.05,1161.52,Bob,"Man, you raised me!"
1161.59,1164.08,Jack,I told you Grandpappy
1161.59,1164.08,Jack,could work that mojo.
1164.16,1166.47,Jack,Big Bob is back in action!
1166.47,1166.82,Bob,Yes!
1166.89,1168.83,,Daah!
1166.89,1168.83,,Daah!
1168.9,1170.55,,"Oh, man, I can't believe"
1170.55,1171.52,Bob,you raised me.
1171.6,1172.86,Bob,That is so awesome!
1174.6,1176.26,Xander,You're the coolest.
1176.34,1179.17,Xander,Maybe I should just let you guys
1176.34,1179.17,Xander,catch up.
1179.24,1182.87,Jack,"Bob, this is Xander."
1179.24,1182.87,Jack,He's our wheel man.
1182.94,1183.93,Bob,Hey.
1185.71,1186.84,Xander,Howdy.
1186.91,1188.54,Bob,"Dude, where are"
1186.91,1188.54,Bob,the other guys?
1188.62,1189.88,Bob,We gotta go get 'em.
1189.95,1190.61,Jack,Absolutely.
1190.61,1191.21,Bob,All right.
1191.28,1194.22,Xander,"Are, um..."
1191.28,1194.22,Xander,Are all your friends dead?
1194.29,1195.38,Jack,"Xander, let's roll."
1195.46,1196.72,Bob,How long I been down?
1196.79,1199.45,Jack,months. I had to wait
1196.79,1199.45,Jack,till the stars aligned.
1199.53,1201.46,Bob,months. I got some
1199.53,1201.46,Bob,catching up to do.
1201.53,1203.46,Bob,"Walker, Texas Ranger..."
1201.53,1203.46,Bob,You been taping 'em?
1203.53,1203.97,Jack,Every ep.
1203.97,1204.46,Bob,All right.
1204.53,1206.29,Bob,We're gonna get
1204.53,1206.29,Bob,the guys together...
1206.37,1207.8,Bob,"and we're gonna party, man!"
1207.87,1210.3,Bob,It's gonna be a night to remember!
1207.87,1210.3,Bob,Yeah!
1210.37,1212.13,Xander,I'm sensing that.
1212.21,1215.14,Jack,Jack: The blood of the earth
1212.21,1215.14,Jack,shall restore him...
1215.21,1216.47,Jack,and he shall arise.
1219.41,1220.9,Dickie,Dudes!
1220.98,1222.91,Dickie,Beer!
1230.55,1232.11,Dickie,
1267.25,1268.55,Xander,"Giles, hey..."
1268.62,1270.92,Xander,what's going on?
1270.99,1276.59,Giles,"Oh, uh, I was just trying"
1270.99,1276.59,Giles,to gain access to the spirit guides.
1276.66,1278.63,Giles,"Not going very well,"
1276.66,1278.63,Giles,I'm afraid.
1278.7,1280.79,Giles,What are you doing here?
1280.87,1284.36,Xander,"Oh, we were just raising,"
1280.87,1284.36,Xander,um... some heck.
1284.44,1286,Jack,Xander!
1286.07,1289.02,Jack,Let's go!
1289.51,1291.94,Xander,"Listen, do you guys"
1289.51,1291.94,Xander,need any help?
1294.02,1297.02,Giles,"Hmm? Oh, no."
1294.02,1297.02,Giles,Thank you.
1295.08,1298.64,Giles,Probably best if you stay out
1295.08,1298.64,Giles,of trouble.
1298.72,1300.24,Xander,No chance of that.
1300.32,1302.58,Jack,Xander! Motor!
1302.66,1308.03,Giles,There's something...
1302.66,1308.03,Giles,different about this menace.
1308.1,1312.09,Giles,Something in the air...
1308.1,1312.09,Giles,the stench of death.
1312.17,1313.66,Xander,"Yeah, I think it's Bob."
1313.73,1316.46,Giles,We may all be called upon
1313.73,1316.46,Giles,to fight when it happens.
1316.54,1319.44,Xander,"When what happens,"
1316.54,1319.44,Xander,exactly?
1319.51,1320.27,Jack,Come on!
1320.27,1321.6,Giles,I'd better go.
1321.68,1325.3,Giles,"Hopefully, we shall have time"
1321.68,1325.3,Giles,to prepare. All we need is a few weeks.
1325.48,1326.64,Buffy,Tonight?
1326.71,1328.7,Willy,Before sunrise.
1328.78,1331.55,Willy,That's what they said.
1331.62,1333.21,Buffy,Why did they do this?
1333.29,1334.98,Willy,They were looking for Angel.
1335.06,1335.99,Buffy,Angel? Why?
1336.06,1339.29,Willy,Said they were coming
1336.06,1339.29,Willy,"after you, too..."
1339.36,1343.46,Willy,and nothing could stand in their way
1339.36,1343.46,Willy,because tonight was the night...
1343.53,1345.56,Willy,"Oh, man."
1345.63,1347.57,Buffy,The ambulance is on its way.
1347.63,1350.03,Willy,"Look, kid, my clientele"
1350.1,1352.37,Willy,ain't exactly
1350.1,1352.37,Willy,nuns and orphans...
1352.44,1355.34,Willy,but I never seen anything
1352.44,1355.34,Willy,like these demons.
1355.41,1358.94,Buffy,I'm gonna stop them.
1361.02,1361.61,Willy,That hellmouth opens...
1361.68,1367.62,Willy,they're gonna be the least of
1361.68,1367.62,Willy,your problems is my train of thought.
1367.69,1371.71,Willy,If I were you...
1367.69,1371.71,Willy,I'd go find Angel...
1371.79,1375.06,Bob,go somewhere
1371.79,1375.06,Bob,quiet together.
1375.13,1379.5,Bob,I'd be thinking about how
1375.13,1379.5,Bob,I wanna spend my last night on Earth.
1379.57,1383.53,Bob,Let's get some beer!
1383.6,1384.87,Parker,Yeah!
1384.94,1387.87,,Let's go
1384.94,1387.87,,"pick up some girls, man."
1387.94,1390.71,,We'll hang out
1387.94,1390.71,,at Taco Bell...
1390.78,1393.18,,"get some girls,"
1390.78,1393.18,,go cruise around.
1393.25,1394.94,Dickie,I wanna bake a cake.
1395.02,1396.88,Bob,"Hey, we need"
1395.02,1396.88,Bob,"some beers, though."
1396.95,1401.05,Parker,"I can't believe you got shot, man."
1396.95,1401.05,Parker,Was it them Jackals?
1401.12,1402.78,Jack,Are you kidding?
1401.12,1402.78,Jack,We wiped them out
1402.86,1404.69,Jack,after they threw you
1402.86,1404.69,Jack,off the bridge.
1404.76,1406.85,Parker,"Oh, man."
1404.76,1406.85,Parker,"You guys are the best, man."
1406.93,1408.39,Parker,The best!
1406.93,1408.39,Parker,I mean that.
1408.46,1409.72,Bob,There's a liquor store.
1409.8,1411.53,Bob,Little Armenian guy
1409.8,1411.53,Bob,runs the place?
1411.6,1413.62,Bob,He had a gun
1411.6,1413.62,Bob,behind the counter.
1415.94,1420.64,Bob,Hey... we should
1415.94,1420.64,Bob,go kick his ass!
1420.71,1421.51,Parker,Yeah!
1421.51,1422.94,Bob,Yeaaaaah!
1425.02,1426.41,Xander,If you guys want me
1425.02,1426.41,Xander,"to drop you off somewhere, that's..."
1426.48,1428.11,Jack,Nah. You're with us now.
1428.18,1430.95,Parker,"Yeah, you on the team now,"
1428.18,1430.95,Parker,baby. Whoohoo!
1432.39,1433.98,Bob,What're we gonna do?
1434.05,1435.45,Jack,I've heard
1434.05,1435.45,Jack,some interesting suggestions...
1435.52,1438.65,Jack,but I'm gonna have to go with Dickie's.
1435.52,1438.65,Jack,Let's bake a cake.
1438.73,1442.59,Dickie,Yeah!
1438.73,1442.59,Dickie,Yeah!
1438.73,1442.59,Dickie,Ha ha ha!
1445.73,1449.43,Jack,All right. You stay here
1445.73,1449.43,Jack,and keep the motor running.
1449.5,1452.94,Xander,"This time of night,"
1449.5,1452.94,Xander,I'm pretty sure nothing's open.
1455.91,1458.31,Xander,But they're always
1455.91,1458.31,Xander,open for crime.
1462.38,1466.32,Xander,OK... now
1462.38,1466.32,Xander,I'm involved in crime.
1466.39,1467.98,Xander,I'm the criminal element.
1468.05,1470.18,Xander,Having a car sure is cool.
1470.26,1473.49,Willow,Willow: Thank you.
1470.26,1473.49,Willow,Sorry to wake you.
1473.56,1475.26,Xander,Wil!
1477.56,1480.36,Willow,"Xander, what are"
1477.56,1480.36,Willow,you doing here?
1480.43,1482.7,Xander,Nothing.
1480.43,1482.7,Xander,Certainly not crime.
1482.77,1484.2,Xander,WhWhat about you?
1484.27,1487.21,Willow,I needed supplies for
1484.27,1487.21,Willow,a protection spell.
1487.27,1490.47,Willow,Buffy called from Angel's.
1487.27,1490.47,Willow,It's happening tonight.
1490.54,1493.21,Xander,And that thing that's happening
1490.54,1493.21,Xander,would be...?
1493.28,1495.61,Willow,I can't stay.
1493.28,1495.61,Willow,Buffy'll need this.
1500.89,1502.45,Willow,"I love you, Xander."
1507.39,1509.16,Xander,"OK, that's it."
1507.39,1509.16,Xander,I'm gonna...
1509.23,1511.32,Jack,Where you going?
1511.4,1513.16,Xander,"Look, something's"
1511.4,1513.16,Xander,just come up.
1513.23,1515.96,Jack,"You gonna bail on me,"
1513.23,1515.96,Jack,is that it?
1516.04,1517.24,Dickie,We got cake mix.
1517.24,1519.03,Parker,Where you wanna bake it?
1519.11,1521.07,Jack,Xander's looking to leave.
1521.14,1522.63,Bob,No way.
1522.71,1524.68,Bob,We need a wheel man.
1524.74,1526.97,Jack,Xander doesn't feel like
1524.74,1526.97,Jack,he's part of the group.
1527.05,1528.41,Xander,No. It's just I'm kinda busy.
1528.48,1530.24,Bob,He doesn't feel
1528.48,1530.24,Bob,like part of the group
1530.32,1532.68,Bob,because he hasn't
1530.32,1532.68,Bob,been initiated.
1532.75,1533.74,Jack,Do you think he's ready?
1533.82,1536.22,Parker,I think he's earned his stripes.
1536.29,1538.55,Parker,"I say we let him in, boys."
1539.59,1542.19,Xander,Great. I wanna be
1539.59,1542.19,Xander,"in the gang, sure."
1542.26,1543.92,Parker,All right! Yeah.
1544,1545.43,Jack,That's the spirit.
1545.43,1545.83,Parker,Yeah.
1545.9,1548.42,Xander,What do I gotta do?
1550.67,1551.93,Jack,You gotta die.
1558.95,1560.88,Xander,"All right, guys,"
1558.95,1560.88,Xander,what...
1560.95,1562.68,Xander,Let's just talk about this.
1562.75,1564.91,Parker,You want to be part
1562.75,1564.91,Parker,"of the gang now, don't you?"
1564.99,1566.42,Xander,"Yes, yes..."
1566.49,1568.58,Xander,but I'm not dying
1566.49,1568.58,Xander,to be in the gang...
1568.66,1570.59,Xander,"if you get the, um..."
1570.66,1572.52,Xander,the pun there.
1572.59,1576.39,Bob,"What, are you..."
1572.59,1576.39,Bob,are you too good to be dead?
1577.76,1579.79,Bob,You got a problem
1577.76,1579.79,Bob,with dead people?
1579.87,1582.73,Xander,What aboutJack?
1579.87,1582.73,Xander,Jack's not dead.
1585.14,1586.63,Xander,
1588.48,1590.97,Jack,Driveby 3 weeks ago.
1591.04,1592.64,Xander,"Oh, boy."
1592.71,1594.51,Jack,Grandpappy found my body.
1594.58,1597.95,Jack,I wasn't gone but 10 minutes
1594.58,1597.95,Jack,before he raised me.
1598.02,1599.82,Jack,"It's a rush, man."
1599.89,1602.32,Dickie,Let's kill Xander.
1599.89,1602.32,Dickie,It'll be fun.
1602.39,1604.72,Parker,"Yeah, man. You could be"
1602.39,1604.72,Parker,a fullfledged member.
1604.79,1608.78,Jack,"Come on, Xander."
1604.79,1608.78,Jack,Take it like a man.
1608.86,1610.19,Xander,All right. Enough.
1610.26,1611.53,Xander,You guys have had your fun...
1611.6,1613.59,Xander,but you forgot
1611.6,1613.59,Xander,about one thing.
1615.04,1616.59,Jack,Get him!
1629.02,1631.64,Bob,Rrr. Damn him!
1631.72,1633.65,Bob,There goes the wheels.
1633.72,1634.88,Parker,"He took all our stuff, man."
1634.95,1636.79,Dickie,I want to bake a cake.
1636.86,1638.35,Jack,It's all right.
1638.43,1640.36,Jack,We'll get more.
1640.43,1642.45,Jack,The night is young.
1645.3,1646.66,Xander,I'd say that's pretty much
1646.73,1648.46,Xander,enough excitement
1646.73,1648.46,Xander,for one evening.
1648.54,1651.27,Xander,Aah. Ooh.
1677.73,1679.03,Xander,Get in!
1684.88,1686.37,Xander,Rrr!
1696.85,1698.38,Xander,You think demon mama
1696.85,1698.38,Xander,followed us?
1698.46,1699.82,Faith,"No, we're cool."
1699.89,1703.16,Faith,The bitch dislocated
1699.89,1703.16,Faith,"my shoulder, though."
1704.23,1705.75,Faith,Hold me.
1719.81,1721.47,Faith,That's better.
1722.58,1725.11,Faith,She got me
1722.58,1725.11,Faith,really wound up.
1728.95,1732.98,Faith,A fight like that
1728.95,1732.98,Faith,and no kill...
1735.16,1737.89,Faith,I'm about ready to pop.
1737.96,1739.9,Faith,Really?
1741.43,1742.63,Faith,Pop?
1742.7,1744.63,Faith,You up for it?
1744.7,1747.03,Xander,"Oh, I'm up."
1752.34,1757.02,Xander,I'm suddenly very up.
1755.08,1757.48,Xander,"It's just, um..."
1757.55,1759.12,Xander,I've never been up
1759.12,1760.78,Faith,with people before.
1766.52,1768.29,Faith,Just relax...
1768.36,1770.29,Faith,and take your pants off.
1770.36,1772.49,Xander,Those two concepts
1772.56,1774.33,Xander,are antithetical.
1787.14,1788.17,Faith,Don't worry.
1790.15,1794.02,Faith,I'll steer you
1790.15,1794.02,Faith,around the curves.
1792.08,1794.61,Xander,Did I mention that I'm having
1792.08,1794.61,Xander,a very strange night?
1816.11,1818.58,Faith,That was great.
1816.11,1818.58,Faith,I got to shower.
1828.82,1830.34,Willow,I've never seen him
1828.82,1830.34,Willow,like this.
1830.42,1832.25,Giles,It's the hellmouth.
1830.42,1832.25,Giles,He can sense it's going to open.
1832.32,1834.15,Giles,Be ready just in case.
1836.26,1837.59,Giles,"Now, don't hesitate."
1837.66,1839.25,Willow,Do it.
1840.33,1841.26,Giles,"Now, Oz..."
1841.33,1842.42,Giles,
1844.07,1845.19,Giles,Again!
1852.48,1853.88,Giles,Ah.
1855.78,1858.54,Giles,We've got to move him
1855.78,1858.54,Giles,before he wakes up.
1858.62,1860.38,Willow,Sorry.
1860.45,1864.11,Willow,I hope you're not mad at me
1860.45,1864.11,Willow,in the morning.
1894.45,1896.04,Xander,Hey.
1896.12,1898.92,Xander,They're not baking
1896.12,1898.92,Xander,any cake.
1907,1908.93,Xander,Long gone.
1909,1912.16,Xander,Probably loaded with supplies.
1909,1912.16,Xander,Got to think.
1913.24,1915.57,Xander,I can't believe
1913.24,1915.57,Xander,I had sex.
1915.64,1916.77,Xander,OK. Bombs.
1916.84,1919.67,Xander,Alreadydead guys
1916.84,1919.67,Xander,with bombs.
1919.74,1921.97,Buffy,"Oh, man."
1919.74,1921.97,Buffy,I'm out of my league.
1922.05,1923.95,Buffy,Buffy will know what to do.
1925.02,1925.95,Buffy,I don't know what to do.
1926.02,1927.81,Angel,Then let me
1926.02,1927.81,Angel,decide for you.
1929.25,1931.11,Angel,I can face this thing.
1931.11,1931.95,Buffy,You can't.
1932.02,1933.32,Angel,"Look, I can at least"
1932.02,1933.32,Angel,buy you enough time
1933.39,1935.32,Angel,for Willow's spell
1933.39,1935.32,Angel,to bind it.
1935.39,1939.89,Angel,"Buffy, this is worse"
1935.39,1939.89,Angel,than anything we've ever faced.
1939.96,1942.76,Angel,"Honey,"
1939.96,1942.76,Angel,it's the only way.
1942.83,1945.96,Buffy,I can't watch you die
1942.83,1945.96,Buffy,again.
1948.71,1950.67,Angel,I love you.
1952.08,1953.13,Angel,I love you.
1953.21,1954.7,Angel,Nothing can change that.
1954.78,1956.8,Angel,Not even death.
1956.88,1959.28,Buffy,Don't talk to me like that.
1959.35,1960.82,Buffy,You may be ready to go...
1960.88,1963.05,Buffy,but I am not ready
1960.88,1963.05,Buffy,to lose you.
1963.12,1964.45,Buffy,"OK, this is my fight..."
1964.52,1966.49,Buffy,and if you won't do it
1964.52,1966.49,Buffy,"my way, then you're..."
1966.56,1968.49,Angel,
1970.49,1971.79,Xander,Hey.
1971.86,1973.99,Xander,"I've got this, um..."
1974.06,1977.06,Xander,"There's this, uh..."
1979.97,1982.13,Xander,It's probably a bad time.
1985.48,1987.03,Xander,Can I help?
1991.05,1992.81,Xander,OK.
2003.99,2005.99,Xander,"OK, I can work this out."
2006.06,2007.29,Xander,I just got to figure out
2007.36,2008.99,Xander,what they'd
2007.36,2008.99,Xander,be likely to bomb.
2013.5,2016.7,Giles,"Giles: Terra, vente,"
2013.5,2016.7,Giles,ignis et pluvia.
2016.77,2018.97,Giles,Cuncta quattuor numina...
2019.04,2021.84,Giles,vos obsecro.
2021.91,2023.85,Giles,Defendete nos
2023.91,2027.32,Giles,a recente malo resoluto.
2027.38,2029.48,Xander,OK.
2029.55,2030.85,Willow,Oz is moved.
2030.92,2031.72,Willow,He could barely walk
2031.72,2032.95,Giles,after that mickey I gave him...
2033.02,2035.12,Giles,but we made it.
2035.19,2037.13,Giles,Is he going to be
2035.19,2037.13,Giles,all right there?
2037.19,2038.79,Giles,Anywhere is safer
2037.19,2038.79,Giles,than here.
2038.86,2040.66,Giles,Help me
2038.86,2040.66,Giles,with the candles.
2041.87,2043.2,Willow,We're doing
2041.87,2043.2,Willow,the binding spell
2043.27,2044.7,Willow,from the Hebron's Almanac?
2044.77,2046.2,Giles,"Yes, but once it's ready..."
2046.27,2048.97,Giles,you're to stay back
2046.27,2048.97,Giles,and let me finish the recitation.
2049.04,2052.03,Giles,Don't argue.
2049.04,2052.03,Giles,I want you safe.
2052.11,2054.17,Giles,Who knows what's going
2052.11,2054.17,Giles,to come up from beneath us.
2061.72,2063.65,Xander,
2066.49,2068.01,Parker,Whoo!
2074.16,2076.66,Parker,
2076.73,2079.07,Jack,This is going
2076.73,2079.07,Jack,to be large.
2079.14,2081.07,Parker,"Oh, yeah."
2079.14,2081.07,Parker,
2087.64,2090.58,Xander,Giles will know what to do.
2090.65,2093.64,Xander,He's way more calm
2090.65,2093.64,Xander,than Buffy.
2094.69,2096.48,Xander,
2096.55,2098.52,Xander,"OK, I need a plan."
2100.79,2104.96,Bob,"Hey, our wheels."
2100.79,2104.96,Bob,
2106.8,2109.6,Bob,Hey. Hey. Hey!
2117.74,2119.7,Parker,"Stop. Come on, man. Stop."
2119.7,2121.04,Xander,Where's the bomb?
2121.11,2122.64,Parker,It's in the high school.
2122.71,2126.02,Xander,In the school where?
2124.08,2126.31,Parker,"Oh, God."
2124.08,2126.31,Parker,"This really, really hurts."
2127.25,2129.31,Parker,Stop!
2129.39,2131.22,Parker,It's in the... It's
2129.39,2131.22,Parker,in the boiler room.
2131.29,2132.38,Xander,All right.
2132.46,2132.99,Parker,Now I'm going
2132.99,2133.92,Xander,to ask you this once...
2133.99,2135.52,Xander,and you better pray
2133.99,2135.52,Xander,you get the answer right.
2135.59,2136.52,Parker,"OK, OK."
2136.59,2137.99,Xander,How do I defuse...
2138.06,2139.03,Xander,Aah!
2141.1,2143.33,Xander,I probably should've
2141.1,2143.33,Xander,left out that whole middle part.
2145.47,2148.23,Dickie,He's headed
2145.47,2148.23,Dickie,for the school!
2153.51,2155.24,Jack,There he is!
2155.37,2158.57,Xander,Where's a slayer
2155.37,2158.57,Xander,when you need one?
2165.02,2165.88,Giles,"Oh, my God."
2165.02,2165.88,Giles,It's grown.
2177.69,2178.92,Dickie,Wow.
2180.83,2182.69,Jack,"Jack: Come on, man!"
2189.2,2190.3,Bob,Bob: Which way?
2190.37,2192.7,Jack,He couldn't have
2190.37,2192.7,Jack,gotten far.
2192.77,2194.47,Jack,Let's split up.
2204.69,2206.78,Bob,Good for chopping.
2216.97,2219.4,Bob,"Now, this is what"
2216.97,2219.4,Bob,I call fun.
2240.49,2243.62,Xander,Should've learned by now.
2240.49,2243.62,Xander,If you're gonna play with fire...
2243.69,2246.18,Xander,you gotta expect
2243.69,2246.18,Xander,sooner or later...
2246.26,2248.32,Xander,I wasn't finished!
2248.4,2250.19,Xander,Note to self: Less talk.
2254.97,2257.1,Buffy,"Faith, go for the heart!"
2278.89,2281.09,Buffy,
2285.07,2288.2,Xander,"OK, boiler room."
2288.27,2290.8,Xander,Other way.
2305.62,2307.32,Xander,"Hello, nasty."
2316.97,2319.02,Xander,Less than 2 minutes.
2319.1,2324.87,Xander,Dumb guy. Little bomb.
2319.1,2324.87,Xander,How hard can it be?
2333.18,2335.08,Jack,It just got harder.
2335.15,2337.02,Xander,I'm not leaving till
2335.15,2337.02,Xander,that thing's disarmed.
2337.09,2339.28,Jack,I guess you're not leaving.
2345.59,2349.46,Jack,I'm gonna carve you up
2345.59,2349.46,Jack,and serve you with gravy.
2349.53,2353.02,Jack,"You piss me off, boy."
2349.53,2353.02,Jack,Now you pay the price.
2353.1,2355.54,Jack,"First the eyes,"
2353.1,2355.54,Jack,then the tongue.
2355.6,2357.54,Jack,I'm gonna break every
2355.6,2357.54,Jack,one of your fingers.
2357.61,2359.54,Xander,You gonna do all that
2357.61,2359.54,Xander,in 49 seconds?
2373.66,2376.39,Xander,I know what you're thinkin'.
2373.66,2376.39,Xander,Can I get by him?
2376.46,2378.45,Xander,"Get up the stairs,"
2376.46,2378.45,Xander,out of the building?
2378.53,2381.55,Xander,Seconds ticking away.
2378.53,2381.55,Xander,I don't love your chances.
2381.63,2383.5,Jack,Then you'll die too.
2383.57,2385.06,Xander,"Yeah, looks like."
2385.13,2387.83,Xander,So I guess the question
2385.13,2387.83,Xander,really is...
2387.9,2390.3,Xander,Who has less fear?
2390.37,2393.81,Jack,I'm not afraid to die.
2390.37,2393.81,Jack,I'm already dead.
2393.88,2396.34,Xander,"Yeah, but this is different."
2396.41,2400.54,Xander,Being blowed up isn't walking around
2396.41,2400.54,Xander,and drinking with your buddies dead.
2400.62,2402.91,Xander,It's little bits being
2400.62,2402.91,Xander,swept up by a janitor dead...
2402.98,2405.48,Xander,and I don't think
2402.98,2405.48,Xander,you're ready for that.
2416.26,2418.1,Jack,Are you?
2421.44,2423.13,Xander,I like the quiet.
2426.78,2428.74,Giles,Omnia...
2428.81,2432.02,Giles,vasa...
2430.08,2431.34,Giles,veritatis!
2431.41,2435.02,Giles,"Now, Buffy!"
2467.48,2469.51,Xander,Good boy.
2478.13,2482.36,Xander,I don't think I wanna be seeing you
2478.13,2482.36,Xander,"on campus anymore, Jack."
2500.25,2502.68,Jack,I'm not going
2500.25,2502.68,Jack,"anywhere, Harris."
2502.75,2505.95,Jack,The first time
2502.75,2505.95,Jack,you turn your back...
2506.02,2507.35,Jack,Aah!
2513.04,2515.81,Willow,Even after the hellmouth
2513.04,2515.81,Willow,was closed...
2515.88,2518.44,Willow,we could still
2515.88,2518.44,Willow,hear it screaming.
2522.62,2525.02,Oz,But Angel's gonna be OK?
2525.09,2527.58,Buffy,He was only out
2525.09,2527.58,Buffy,for a few minutes.
2527.66,2529.68,Buffy,Longest of my life.
2529.76,2532.46,Willow,I will never forget
2529.76,2532.46,Willow,that thing's face.
2532.53,2534.83,Willow,"Its real face, I mean."
2534.9,2535.83,Giles,Giles: Yes.
2535.9,2539.16,Buffy,I don't know
2535.9,2539.16,Buffy,how you managed.
2540.74,2543.87,Buffy,It was the bravest thing
2540.74,2543.87,Buffy,I've ever seen.
2544.94,2546.91,Giles,Stupidest.
2546.98,2550.04,Giles,But the world
2546.98,2550.04,Giles,continues to turn.
2551.11,2553.55,Willow,No one will ever know
2553.62,2555.45,Willow,how close it came
2553.62,2555.45,Willow,to stopping.
2555.52,2558.28,Willow,Never know what we did.
2558.36,2560.59,Xander,Guys.
2560.66,2562.02,Willow,Oz: Hey.
2562.09,2565.58,Willow,"Xander. Boy, you're lucky"
2562.09,2565.58,Willow,you weren't at school last night.
2565.66,2567.69,Willow,It was crazed.
2568.77,2572.13,Xander,"Well, uh,"
2568.77,2572.13,Xander,give me the quiet life.
2572.2,2574.53,Xander,I'm gonna grab a snack.
2572.2,2574.53,Xander,Anyone want?
2574.6,2575.94,Giles,"No, thank you."
2578.02,2576.94,Xander,Oz?
2579.02,2579.74,Oz,No. Oddly full today.
