15.1,16.22,2 INT. XANDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT,You'll live in there.
16.22,18.57,XANDER,"It looks like a closet, but it's a room now."
18.66,20.73,BUFFY,And I hate this plan. I don't understand
20.73,22.34,XANDER,when his problems became yours.
22.42,25.06,BUFFY,The school basement is making him crazy.
25.14,28.93,BUFFY,It's just things are different now.
25.14,28.93,BUFFY,He has a soul.
29.02,30.62,DAWN,Mom?

62.9,65.42,WILLOW,"From beneath you, it devours."
66.18,68.7,BUFFY,What do you mean?
66.18,68.7,BUFFY,How do you know Spike?
68.78,70.16,BUFFY,"What do you mean, how?"
70.16,72.86,HOLDEN,"He was the guy that... Oh, what's the word?"
72.94,73.42,BUFFY,Sired.
73.42,76.25,HOLDEN,"Yeah, he was the guy that sired me."

97.98,98.52,XANDER,Buffy?
98.52,101.58,BUFFY,"Where's Spike? Xander, is he here?"
101.66,104.94,XANDER,He's out. At least he was when I got home.
104.94,106.74,BUFFY,Any idea where he went?
106.82,111.58,XANDER,"I don't know. Creature of the night, Buff."
106.82,111.58,XANDER,He's probably out creaturing.
111.66,113.81,XANDER,"Why, what happened?"
114.62,117.06,XANDER,Is he in trouble?
117.14,119.13,BUFFY,I hope not.

277.54,282.02,WILLOW,"Dawn? Oh, my God."
281.46,283.29,WILLOW,What are you...
283.38,286.26,WILLOW,"Dawn, what happened here? What..."
287.34,288.94,WILLOW,You're cut.
289.02,290.12,DAWN,I'm all right.
290.12,291.86,WILLOW,"Let me see, make sure."
291.94,294.17,DAWN,I saw Mom.
294.26,296.3,WILLOW,What?
296.38,299.1,DAWN,"She was here, Willow. I saw her."
299.18,301.82,DAWN,"She was here, and she spoke to me."
301.9,303.46,WILLOW,Sweetie...
303.54,308.78,DAWN,"No, she was right here,"
303.54,308.78,DAWN,and... then she wasn't. She...
308.86,311.22,WILLOW,It wasn't her.
311.3,311.87,DAWN,What?
311.87,314.58,WILLOW,"At least, I don't think."
315.7,321.49,WILLOW,"I saw something too, and it looked like..."
315.7,321.49,WILLOW,someone else.
321.58,323.7,WILLOW,But it wasn't.
323.78,325.69,DAWN,I don't understand.
325.78,330.1,WILLOW,"It's the big bad, Dawn."
325.78,330.1,WILLOW,The one we knew was coming.
330.98,332.97,DAWN,But that's what she said.
333.06,337.26,DAWN,"Mom, she said that things were coming,"
333.06,337.26,DAWN,"that things were on their way,"
337.34,340.86,DAWN,and... that she loved us.
342.02,346.57,DAWN,"So it had to be her, right?"
342.02,346.57,DAWN,"I mean, her warning was true."
346.66,352.14,WILLOW,I don't know. I just don't think
346.66,352.14,WILLOW,we can trust anything right now.
352.22,355.37,DAWN,So maybe the evil thing
352.22,355.37,DAWN,messing with you was here too.
355.46,359.66,DAWN,Only maybe it was the thing
355.46,359.66,DAWN,trying to keep mom away.
360.66,363.42,DAWN,Cos she was trying to protect me.
365.38,367.58,DAWN,Maybe.
367.9,370.29,XANDER,Why would a vampire lie
367.9,370.29,XANDER,about who sired him?
370.38,376.46,XANDER,What's that? Some kind of status symbol for
370.38,376.46,XANDER,the undead? "My sire can beat up your sire."
376.54,378.61,BUFFY,I'm not saying I don't believe him.
379.1,381.57,XANDER,You just don't want to.
383.06,385.21,XANDER,"OK, let's look at this objectively."
385.3,388.82,XANDER,"Figure it out in a cold,"
385.3,388.82,XANDER,"impersonal, CSllike manner,"
388.9,391.86,XANDER,cos we're a couple of carpet fibres
388.9,391.86,XANDER,away from a case.
391.94,394.9,BUFFY,Spike can't be doing this.
391.94,394.9,BUFFY,He couldn't if he wanted to.
394.98,395.54,XANDER,Why not?
395.54,398.5,BUFFY,"Pain chip, remember? He can't hurt anyone."
398.58,400.62,XANDER,It didn't stop him from hurting you.
400.7,404.66,XANDER,"Hey, objective here."
400.7,404.66,XANDER,Maybe the chip's not working any more.
404.74,406.91,BUFFY,"Oh, it's working. I've seen it."
406.91,410.06,XANDER,Is it? Or is that what he wants you to think?
410.14,411.45,BUFFY,You think it's an act?
411.45,413.82,XANDER,I don't really know. And neither do you.
413.9,416.78,BUFFY,No. There's something. I can feel it.
416.86,419.9,BUFFY,He's different. He's changed.
420.86,424.94,BUFFY,"And, if it is an act, then the Oscar goes to..."

428.78,431.86,SPIKE,"Well, this can't be good "
428.78,431.86,SPIKE,you here at this hour.
432.54,434.47,SPIKE,Is there trouble?
434.47,436.17,BUFFY,No. No trouble.
436.26,438.09,BUFFY,I was just...
438.18,439.9,BUFFY,We were just...
441.82,443.42,SPIKE,Right.
443.5,446.42,SPIKE,None of my business. No worries.
448.18,449.78,BUFFY,"Spike, I..."
453.5,455.86,BUFFY,How was your night?
455.94,458.09,BUFFY,It was all right.
458.18,462.62,SPIKE,And yours? Did you... bag any baddies?
463.62,465.69,BUFFY,One.
465.78,467.77,BUFFY,Vampire.
468.82,471.7,BUFFY,"Someone I used to know, actually, a little."
473.9,475.62,BUFFY,Holden.
475.7,477.98,BUFFY,Holden Webster.
478.54,480.74,SPIKE,"You knew him, huh?"
481.66,484.78,SPIKE,That must've been a picnic.
486.66,488.78,BUFFY,Yeah.
491.42,495.58,SPIKE,Well... I'm gonna turn in before I drop.
497.58,499.38,SPIKE,Night.
504.98,508.29,XANDER,You see that? You see how he reacted
504.98,508.29,XANDER,when you mentioned Webs?
508.38,511.26,XANDER,Cool as Cool Whip.
508.38,511.26,XANDER,What's up with that?
511.34,516.34,BUFFY,The sun's coming up. I need to go and check
511.34,516.34,BUFFY,on Dawn. We need to keep an eye on Spike.
516.42,520.18,XANDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. When you say ""we"""
516.42,520.18,XANDER,you mean me. Me's gotta go to work.
520.26,522.58,XANDER,I got a big meeting in a couple of hours.
522.58,523.49,BUFFY,This is serious.
523.58,527.34,BUFFY,We cannot let him leave this house
523.58,527.34,BUFFY,until we know if he's killing again.
527.42,529.18,BUFFY,We need someone to watch him.
529.26,530.73,ANYA,"Uhuh. Forget it, Harris."
530.73,532.81,XANDER,You said you'd do it on the phone.
532.9,535.91,ANYA,That was before you told me Spike's killing
535.91,538.98,XANDER,again. You want to leave me alone with him?!
539.06,541.85,XANDER,Didn't mind being alone with him before.
541.85,542.82,ANYA,What was that?
542.9,548.9,XANDER,"Nothing. Look, we don't actually know"
542.9,548.9,XANDER,"that he's killed anyone. You know, lately."
548.98,550.56,XANDER,Might all just be a mistake.
550.56,551.86,ANYA,But you don't think so.
551.94,557.18,ANYA,Have you searched his room for clues?
551.94,557.18,ANYA,Trophies from victims?
557.26,562.21,ANYA,Killers like to keep trophies sometimes.
557.26,562.21,ANYA,"Scalps, necklaces made from human teeth."
563.54,566.26,XANDER,"It didn't occur to me to look,"
563.54,566.26,XANDER,but thanks for the tip.
566.34,569.46,XANDER,You'll be safe here.
566.34,569.46,XANDER,Plenty of sunlight for you to hide in.
569.54,571.3,ANYA,What? That's it?
571.38,575.7,ANYA,You're not gonna leave a crossbow or a
571.38,575.7,ANYA,flamethrower? Something to protect myself?
575.78,579.94,XANDER,We don't want him to know we suspect.
575.78,579.94,XANDER,"If he tries to leave, don't confront him."
580.02,585.89,XANDER,Call Buffy and just let her know that
580.02,585.89,XANDER,he's on the move. You're gonna be fine.
585.98,589.9,ANYA,"Better be, cos if I get vamped,"
585.98,589.9,ANYA,I'm gonna bite your ass.
589.98,592.59,XANDER,Wouldn't be the first time.
592.59,593.94,ANYA,What was that?
599.34,600.86,XANDER,i></i>
600.94,603.78,BUFFY,Dawn? Dawn!
603.86,607.01,WILLOW,"Buffy, it's OK. She's OK. Not hurt."
607.1,610.14,WILLOW,She's just exhausted. Finally fell off to sleep.
610.22,612.62,BUFFY,What the hell happened? It looks like...
612.62,613.82,WILLOW,Hell happened? Yeah.
613.9,618.9,WILLOW,This big evil that's been promising to
613.9,618.9,WILLOW,"devour us? Well, I think it started chomping."
618.98,621.64,BUFFY,"Oh, God. And it started with Dawn?"
621.64,622.5,WILLOW,Both of us.
622.58,628.14,WILLOW,"Buffy, this thing knows us. It made us think"
622.58,628.14,WILLOW,that we were talking to people we knew.
628.22,634.14,WILLOW,Mine said it came with a message from Tara.
628.22,634.14,WILLOW,But Dawn actually saw...
636.98,638.97,WILLOW,your mother.
641.46,645.06,WILLOW,This thing  it had me for a while.
645.14,649.3,WILLOW,"I mean, before it started letting loose"
645.14,649.3,WILLOW,with the pulsepounding terror.
649.38,653.62,WILLOW,"But before that,"
649.38,653.62,WILLOW,the lies were very convincing.
653.7,655.98,WILLOW,It just seems real.
657.86,659.09,BUFFY,Lies?
659.18,662.89,WILLOW,"Maybe to confuse us, to mess us up."
662.98,665.9,WILLOW,Or maybe just to be cruel.
665.98,670.3,BUFFY,Vampire I killed last night
665.98,670.3,BUFFY,told me Spike sired him.
672.74,674.94,BUFFY,Two nights ago.
675.02,677.33,WILLOW,"Well, that's impossible. Right?"
678.74,683.02,WILLOW,So maybe it was another one.
678.74,683.02,WILLOW,A fake out. You got one too.
683.1,685.12,WILLOW,It wasn't a real vamp.
685.12,686.86,BUFFY,Dusted real enough.
686.94,689.7,WILLOW,"Buffy, do you think Spike is..."
689.7,690.41,BUFFY,I can't.
692.42,694.41,BUFFY,I hope not.
695.98,698.98,BUFFY,But if I'm wrong and he is...
700.14,703.5,BUFFY,then I have to see it for myself.
704.9,707.7,BUFFY,I have to be there to stop it.
813.42,818.9,SPIKE,"Anya, do be specific and tell a fella"
813.42,818.9,SPIKE,just exactly what you're doing here.
821.3,822.98,ANYA,Well...
823.06,824.86,ANYA,Spike...
826.7,829.58,ANYA,"I'm... here, obviously..."
830.3,832.61,ANYA,for... um...
835.86,837.58,ANYA,sex.
837.66,838.54,SPIKE,Uh...
838.62,840.5,SPIKE,Beg pardon?
840.58,842.65,ANYA,You and me.
842.74,844.89,ANYA,Here and now.
844.98,846.66,ANYA,Let's go.
846.74,850.42,ANYA,"Let's... get it on, you big bad boy."
850.5,853.38,SPIKE,"Wait, Anya. Just a minute."
850.5,853.38,SPIKE,This is not exac...
853.46,855.9,SPIKE,Is that a stake?
855.98,858.1,ANYA,Yes. Kinky.
858.18,860.19,SPIKE,"Well, yeah, but what do you..."
860.19,860.46,ANYA,Shh.
860.54,862.61,ANYA,No questions.
862.7,864.93,ANYA,No talking.
865.02,867.14,ANYA,I can't help it.
867.22,873.9,ANYA,I can't stop thinking about you and us
867.22,873.9,ANYA,and our brief but unforgettable time together.
874.94,877.5,ANYA,"I mean, it's..."
874.94,877.5,ANYA,Why else would I be here?
877.58,882.78,ANYA,It's not like I'm snooping around for proof
877.58,882.78,ANYA,that you're some whackedout serial killer.
882.86,885.25,ANYA,I don't know why I said that.
882.86,885.25,ANYA,Forget I said that.
885.34,889.05,ANYA,It's craziness talking.
885.34,889.05,ANYA,It's just nerves. Nerves.
890.46,893.06,ANYA,Nerves and... and horniness.
893.14,897.34,ANYA,"Oh, just shut up, William, and take me."
893.14,897.34,ANYA,Take me now.
909.34,910.27,SPIKE,Anya.
910.27,910.82,ANYA,Hm?
910.9,916.66,SPIKE,"It's not that I'm not tempted. Obviously,"
910.9,916.66,SPIKE,"if things were different, you're a right catch."
917.22,920.77,ANYA,I got it. No problem. I understand.
922.34,923.65,ANYA,You think I'm fat.
923.65,924.02,SPIKE,What?
924.1,925.97,ANYA,It's either that or the haircut.
925.97,927.38,SPIKE,The do's quite fetching.
927.46,929.48,ANYA,"Oh, right. Now you like the haircut."
929.48,929.93,SPIKE,Love it.
930.02,933.3,ANYA,"Sure, as a friend. You were more fun"
930.02,933.3,ANYA,when you didn't have a soul.
933.38,935.61,SPIKE,"Oh, come on."
933.38,935.61,SPIKE,I've just explained...
935.7,941.94,ANYA,Soulless Spike would have had me upside
935.7,941.94,ANYA,down and halfway to happy land by now.
942.02,944.22,SPIKE,I need my pants.
962.94,965.46,SPIKE,"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, love."
965.54,968.26,ANYA,Who's hurt? I'm fine.
969.82,971.62,SPIKE,Right.
973.22,975.61,SPIKE,"Look, I've got things to do."
975.7,978.5,ANYA,Don't stick around on my account.

1172.54,1174.53,YOUNG WOMAN,Is everything...
1174.62,1176.61,YOUNG WOMAN,i></i>
1180.58,1183.5,BUFFY,There's my guy.
1188.82,1191.46,BUFFY,"Now, doesn't that feel better?"
1205.78,1208.86,SPIKE-2,How could you use a poor maiden so?
1215.78,1217.11,BUFFY,Did you kill her?
1217.11,1217.5,SPIKE,What?
1217.58,1218.83,BUFFY,The girl. Last night.
1218.83,1221.1,SPIKE,What girl? What are you talking about?
1221.18,1226.62,BUFFY,I caught the first act. I missed the curtain call.
1221.18,1226.62,BUFFY,Did you kill her? Did you turn her?
1226.7,1228.93,SPIKE,Did you... Are you following me?
1229.02,1231.58,BUFFY,Answer the question. Where is she?
1231.66,1233.81,SPIKE,Who knows? I talked to her is all.
1233.9,1236.87,BUFFY,Really? Looked like more than talking to me.
1236.87,1239.1,SPIKE,"Well, I certainly didn't off her."
1239.18,1242.73,SPIKE,Where are you getting this?
1239.18,1242.73,SPIKE,You know I can't.
1242.82,1244.42,BUFFY,Right. The chip.
1244.5,1246.16,BUFFY,"No, not the chip!"
1246.16,1248.21,SPIKE,"Not the chip, dammit."
1249.18,1255.42,SPIKE,You think I'd go to the end of the underworld
1249.18,1255.42,SPIKE,and back to get my soul and then...?
1255.5,1259.89,SPIKE,"Buffy, I can barely live with what I did."
1255.5,1259.89,SPIKE,It haunts me.
1260.78,1262.77,SPIKE,All of it.
1262.86,1267.25,SPIKE,If you think that I would add
1262.86,1267.25,SPIKE,"to the body count now, you are crazy."
1267.34,1272.9,BUFFY,So you go looking for drunk coeds
1267.34,1272.9,BUFFY,cos you're hungry for conversation?
1272.98,1275.7,SPIKE,"Oh, is that what this is? Right."
1275.7,1276.13,BUFFY,What?
1276.22,1277.48,SPIKE,You're jealous.
1277.48,1279.66,BUFFY,Don't play games. Not now.
1279.74,1283.94,SPIKE,"You saw me chatting up another bird,"
1279.74,1283.94,SPIKE,giving the eye to somebody else.
1284.02,1285.92,SPIKE,"Touched a nerve, didn't it?"
1285.92,1287.54,BUFFY,Don't flatter yourself.
1287.62,1293.57,SPIKE,"It burns. But you can't admit it, so you trump"
1287.62,1293.57,SPIKE,up some charge that I'm back on the juice.
1293.66,1296.17,BUFFY,This vampire I killed told me...
1296.17,1298.45,SPIKE,Told you what? That I go out?
1298.54,1301.9,SPIKE,"Yeah, I talk to people. Women."
1301.98,1305.13,SPIKE,I talk to them cos I can't talk to you.
1305.13,1306.66,BUFFY,"Oh, Spike, save it."
1306.74,1309.66,SPIKE,As daft a notion as
1306.74,1309.66,SPIKE,"soulful Spike the killer"" is,"
1309.74,1315.3,SPIKE,it is nothing compared to the idea that
1309.74,1315.3,SPIKE,another girl could mean anything to me.
1316.18,1319.81,SPIKE,This chip... they did <i>to</i> me.
1319.9,1321.94,SPIKE,I couldn't help it.
1322.02,1324.98,SPIKE,"But the soul, I got on my own."
1325.06,1327.05,SPIKE,For you.
1330.58,1331.83,BUFFY,I know. But...
1331.83,1334.78,SPIKE,"So, yeah. I go and pass the time."
1334.86,1336.69,SPIKE,With someone.
1336.78,1342.34,SPIKE,"But that's all it is, is time. Cos God help me,"
1336.78,1342.34,SPIKE,"Buffy, it's still all about you."
1345.3,1348.2,BUFFY,"Spike, this vampire told me you sired him."
1348.2,1349.58,SPIKE,That doesn't mean...
1349.66,1353.13,BUFFY,"He said you killed him,"
1349.66,1353.13,BUFFY,dumped him in a parking lot somewhere.
1353.22,1355.8,SPIKE,And you believed him? Vampires aren't...
1355.8,1357.61,BUFFY,I did follow you last night.
1357.7,1362.22,BUFFY,You didn't look lonely or casual to me.
1357.7,1362.22,BUFFY,You looked like you were on the prowl.
1362.3,1363.46,SPIKE,You can't know that.
1363.46,1365.85,BUFFY,"So, then, tell me. Tell me what happened."
1365.94,1367.55,BUFFY,"You talked to her, then what?"
1367.55,1369.38,SPIKE,We talked. That's all I remember.
1369.46,1370.63,BUFFY,All you remember?
1370.63,1372.22,SPIKE,I don't know. I go out.
1372.3,1377.06,SPIKE,I talk to people or I don't.
1372.3,1377.06,SPIKE,It's boring. It all bleeds together.
1377.14,1379.52,BUFFY,"Well, if you seem to forget that much..."
1379.52,1380.06,SPIKE,Not that.
1380.14,1383.45,SPIKE,The taste of human blood.
1380.14,1383.45,SPIKE,"That, I'd remember."
1383.54,1388.66,BUFFY,You were camped out on the Hellmouth
1383.54,1388.66,BUFFY,talking to invisible people. Recently.
1388.74,1390.66,BUFFY,How can you be sure of...
1390.66,1392.05,SPIKE,No! You are wrong.
1392.14,1397.78,SPIKE,You've got an accusation
1392.14,1397.78,SPIKE,"from a pile of dust, and not a shred of proof."
1397.86,1400.33,BUFFY,So I'll get some.
1411.14,1414.66,BUFFY,"OK, guys, find me some evidence"
1411.14,1414.66,BUFFY,that he did this.
1414.74,1417.91,ANYA,Really? Are you sure that's what you want?
1417.91,1420.1,BUFFY,Find me proof that he didn't.
1420.18,1424.46,DAWN,You only think Spike is turning people
1420.18,1424.46,DAWN,"cos that vampire told you so, right?"
1424.54,1429.14,DAWN,"But that night,"
1424.54,1429.14,DAWN,we were all told things that weren't true.
1429.22,1430.98,WILLOW,Maybe.
1431.06,1433.53,DAWN,What? What "maybe"?
1433.62,1437.62,WILLOW,Just because those weren't
1433.62,1437.62,WILLOW,"the spirits of, you know, our people,"
1437.7,1442.14,WILLOW,"just because it was some evil thing,"
1437.7,1442.14,WILLOW,doesn't mean what they said can't be true.
1442.22,1446.06,ANYA,I used to tell the truth all the time
1442.22,1446.06,ANYA,when I was evil.
1446.14,1448.78,BUFFY,We can't assume anything.
1446.14,1448.78,BUFFY,We need hard facts.
1448.86,1453.73,ANYA,"If Spike is biting people again, shouldn't"
1448.86,1453.73,ANYA,there be more dead people with neck trauma?
1453.82,1457.13,ANYA,Right? And we can find that.
1457.22,1457.39,WILLOW,No.
1457.39,1459.69,ANYA,"No, we can't find that? But that's easy."
1459.78,1461.58,ANYA,That computer's a moron.
1461.66,1467.58,WILLOW,"I mean, no, there's not really"
1461.66,1467.58,WILLOW,an increase in neck injuries. But...
1467.66,1469.54,BUFFY,But what?
1469.62,1472.66,,"Missing people. Eight, maybe."
1473.3,1475.34,,"Oh, ten of them."
1475.42,1478.94,,"No bodies, they're just missing."
1479.02,1481.33,,Mostly young. Lots of girls.
1482.82,1488.74,,So it's true. What that vampire
1482.82,1488.74,,told Buffy turned out to be true.
1488.82,1490.73,WILLOW,Maybe.
1490.82,1493.82,BUFFY,But it still doesn't prove that it's Spike.
1493.9,1497.61,WILLOW,"Right now,"
1493.9,1497.61,WILLOW,he's the only one who knows for sure.
1527.06,1529.38,XANDER,"No, no, no. You're not going out."
1529.38,1530.29,SPIKE,I have to go.
1530.38,1532.61,XANDER,Buffy was very clear
1530.38,1532.61,XANDER,on the not leaving of you.
1532.7,1536.74,SPIKE,I know what she told you. It's not true.
1532.7,1536.74,SPIKE,"Let me go, and I'll find a way to prove it."
1536.82,1539.97,XANDER,"OK, I'm gonna list the reasons"
1536.82,1539.97,XANDER,that won't happen. One...
1540.54,1541.86,SPIKE,Ow!
1549.5,1552.3,SPIKE,i></i>
1591.98,1599.02,SPIKE,She had blonde hair. A nicelooking girl.
1591.98,1599.02,SPIKE,I was here talking with her.
1597.62,1601.22,SPIKE,The other night. I'm looking for
1597.62,1601.22,SPIKE,someone who might've seen her.
1601.3,1603.29,WAITRESS,No. Sorry.
1624.14,1625.31,BUFFY,He hit you?
1625.31,1626.9,XANDER,Knocked me out.
1626.98,1629.55,XANDER,He's been gone at least half an hour.
1629.55,1631.42,BUFFY,Any idea where he's headed?
1631.5,1634.3,BUFFY,i></i>
1641.74,1644.62,YOUNG WOMAN,One of 'em take your wallet?
1646.06,1647.38,SPIKE,What's that?
1647.46,1651.66,YOUNG WOMAN,The way you're scanning that crowd.
1647.46,1651.66,YOUNG WOMAN,You look like you're out for blood.
1651.74,1657.69,SPIKE,I'm just looking for a certain bird
1651.74,1657.69,SPIKE,I met here the other night.
1658.7,1659.56,YOUNG WOMAN,Is it me?
1659.56,1662.25,SPIKE,"Sorry, love. Don't think so."
1663.58,1666.18,YOUNG WOMAN,Not even if I ask nice?
1669.3,1673.74,YOUNG WOMAN,Or are you the type that has to be convinced?
1673.82,1677.26,SPIKE,"Friendly warning, pet."
1673.82,1677.26,SPIKE,I'm the type best left alone.
1677.34,1680.1,SPIKE,Oh. I get it.
1680.18,1684.38,YOUNG WOMAN,You'd rather I slip into
1680.18,1684.38,YOUNG WOMAN,something more comfortable.
1687.46,1692.17,YOUNG WOMAN,"Shall we pick off the crowd one by one,"
1687.46,1692.17,YOUNG WOMAN,or block the exits and ravish the place?
1692.26,1693.49,SPIKE,Get away from me.
1693.49,1695.73,YOUNG WOMAN,What's with the wallflower act?
1695.82,1699.18,YOUNG WOMAN,You didn't seem so shy
1695.82,1699.18,YOUNG WOMAN,when you were biting me.
1701.54,1707.54,YOUNG WOMAN,I'm not asking if you wanna be soul mates.
1701.54,1707.54,YOUNG WOMAN,Just figured you'd wanna have some fun.
1708.62,1709.69,SPIKE,Mm.
1709.78,1714.94,YOUNG WOMAN,"I take him, you take her."
1709.78,1714.94,YOUNG WOMAN,Or the other way around. Whatever.
1715.46,1717.85,SPIKE,"No, you're lying."
1720.86,1723.5,YOUNG WOMAN,Is that all I was to you? A onebite stand?
1797.54,1800.69,BOUNCER,"Hey, sweetheart."
1797.54,1800.69,BOUNCER,"If you wanna go in, go ahead."
1800.78,1803.58,BUFFY,"Actually, I need some help."
1800.78,1803.58,BUFFY,I'm looking for this guy.
1803.66,1808.94,BUFFY,"Bleachblond hair, leather jacket, British"
1803.66,1808.94,BUFFY,"accent. Kind of sallow, but in a hot way?"
1809.02,1811.98,BOUNCER,"Yeah, yeah, I know the guy."
1809.02,1811.98,BOUNCER,Billy Idol wannabe.
1812.06,1816.38,BUFFY,"Actually, Billy Idol stole his look from..."
1812.06,1816.38,BUFFY,Never mind. Has he been here?
1816.46,1819.06,BOUNCER,This guy your boyfriend or something?
1819.14,1823.42,BUFFY,"No, I just... I need to find him,"
1819.14,1823.42,BUFFY,as soon as possible.
1823.5,1829.5,BOUNCER,He comes in a lot lately. Every night leaves
1823.5,1829.5,BOUNCER,with a different girl. Chicks like Billy Idol.
1830.42,1832.65,BUFFY,How many girls?
1832.74,1835.86,BOUNCER,"Look, this guy, this notyourboyfriend guy."
1835.94,1838.54,BOUNCER,"If I were you, I'd lose him."
1835.94,1838.54,BOUNCER,He's a real player.
1848.42,1851.5,AIMEE MANN,"Man, I hate playing vampire towns."
1858.7,1860.69,SPIKE,Hello? It's me.
1863.18,1865.3,SPIKE,I'm seeing...
1865.38,1870.38,SPIKE,I think I'm remembering.
1865.38,1870.38,SPIKE,I think I've done some very bad things.
1871.1,1872.7,BUFFY,Where are you?
1872.78,1878.34,SPIKE,I need to see you. There's a house.
1872.78,1878.34,SPIKE,Hoffman Terrace.
1878.42,1880.81,BUFFY,I'll meet you.
1883.46,1885.58,SPIKE-2,You shouldn't have done that.
1885.66,1887.78,SPIKE-2,It's not time yet.
1887.86,1889.66,SPIKE-2,Not nearly.
1889.74,1892.34,SPIKE-2,You're going against the plan.
1893.22,1895.58,SPIKE-2,But we can make it work.
1909.5,1911.49,SPIKE,Down here.
1921.34,1923.73,SPIKE,You won't come down?
1925.18,1927.25,SPIKE,I understand.
1927.34,1930.14,SPIKE,It's a risky proposition.
1930.22,1935.06,SPIKE,There's an order. The Slayer's not in order.
1930.22,1935.06,SPIKE,But it can't hurt to play.
1935.14,1939.82,SPIKE,"Get your claws in the mouse, you know?"
1935.14,1939.82,SPIKE,You are not here.
1948.98,1952.82,BUFFY,All right. What do you wanna show me?
1952.9,1955.7,SPIKE,I've been remembering.
1955.78,1958.66,SPIKE,The girl. I walked her home.
1959.5,1962.18,SPIKE,The one you saw.
1962.26,1964.86,SPIKE,And the one before that.
1965.74,1968.54,SPIKE,And I think I killed her.
1968.62,1973.7,SPIKE,And I think I... I think I killed...
1968.62,1973.7,SPIKE,the lady who lived here.
1974.54,1977.93,SPIKE,And... and there might be others.
1980.66,1982.38,BUFFY,"Oh, my God."
1983.34,1985.14,SPIKE,Here.
1989.42,1992.14,SPIKE,II think I buried them here.
1994.74,1996.5,BUFFY,"Spike, why?"
1996.58,2000.26,SPIKE,"Well, I don't know, do I?"
1996.58,2000.26,SPIKE,I don't even know how. I shouldn't be able...
2000.34,2002.23,SPIKE,i># Early one morning
2002.23,2004.58,SPIKE-2,just as the sun was rising
2004.66,2009.13,SPIKE-2,i># I heard a fair maid sing
2004.66,2009.13,SPIKE-2,in the valley down below
2009.58,2012.1,BUFFY,"i># Oh, don't deceive me"
2009.58,2012.1,BUFFY,What? What is it?
2012.18,2014.62,BUFFY,"i># Oh, never leave me"
2014.7,2018.33,BUFFY,i># How could you use a poor maid...
2018.42,2019.78,BUFFY,Spike!
2025.9,2028.29,BUFFY,What are you doing? Oh!
2031.58,2033.94,BUFFY,"Spike, listen to me. You don't wanna do this."
2035.18,2037.54,SPIKE-2,And it's just about to get fun.
2045.42,2046.41,BUFFY,"Oh, God."
2060.38,2062.53,SPIKE-2,You know what I want you to do.
2073.82,2078.42,SPIKE-2,They're waiting for you.
2073.82,2078.42,SPIKE-2,"Take her, taste her. Make her weak."
2081.66,2083.54,BUFFY,"Spike, no!"
2116.1,2118.06,SPIKE,I remember.
2142.78,2145.09,SPIKE-2,You failed them.
2146.1,2148.38,SPIKE-2,Now she's gonna kill you.
2148.46,2150.22,SPIKE-2,"You lose, mate."
2154.62,2157.7,BUFFY,"Sorry, ma'am, but it's my job."
2191.82,2194.21,SPIKE,"Do it fast, OK?"
2196.78,2198.77,SPIKE,He said you would do it.
2198.86,2200.85,BUFFY,Who said?
2202.38,2204.18,SPIKE,Me.
2205.5,2207.49,SPIKE,It was me.
2208.54,2210.77,SPIKE,I saw it.
2210.86,2214.54,SPIKE,"I was here the whole time,"
2210.86,2214.54,SPIKE,talking and singing.
2216.58,2218.78,SPIKE,There was a song.
2219.7,2223.33,BUFFY,What are you talking about?
2219.7,2223.33,BUFFY,I don't know.
2223.42,2225.94,,"Please, I don't remember."
2226.02,2228.41,,Don't make me remember.
2229.9,2233.9,,Make it so I forget again!
2229.9,2233.9,,I did what you wanted!
2236.66,2239.13,BUFFY,There's something here.
2244.18,2247.26,SPIKE,"Oh God, no. Please. I need that."
2248.66,2251.34,SPIKE,I can't cry this soul out of me.
2251.42,2253.86,SPIKE,It won't come.
2254.34,2257.06,SPIKE,"I've killed, and I can feel them."
2258.1,2260.9,SPIKE,I can feel every one of 'em.
2269.22,2272.14,BUFFY,There's something playing with us.
2272.22,2274.02,BUFFY,All of us.
2279.62,2281.85,SPIKE,What is it?
2281.94,2284.41,SPIKE,Why is it doing this to me?
2285.66,2287.46,BUFFY,I don't know.
2292.38,2294.06,SPIKE,Help me.
2297.58,2299.38,SPIKE,Can you help me?
