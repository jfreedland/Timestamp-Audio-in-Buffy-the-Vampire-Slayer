2.21,4.17,GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
4.25,9.28,MONK,We had to hide the Key.
4.25,9.28,MONK,Made it human and sent it to you.
9.41,10.4,BUFFY,Dawn.
10.49,12.33,DOCTOR,"OK, your mom's in recovery."
12.33,13.49,BUFFY,Is she all right?
13.57,16.25,DOCTOR,I think your mother's going to be fine.
16.45,18.67,SPIKE,I wanna show you something.
18.67,19.25,RILEY,Harder.
24.85,25.89,RILEY,Buffy.
25.97,29.6,BUFFY,I've given you everything that I have.
25.97,29.6,BUFFY,"My heart, my body and soul."
29.69,32.29,RILEY,"I just don't feel it. They want me back, Buffy."
33.29,35.81,RILEY,The military. I'm leaving tonight.
42.13,43.25,BUFFY,Riley!
50.77,53.37,XANDER,You ever have that feeling
50.77,53.37,XANDER,where there's something to do
53.45,55.92,XANDER,and you forgot what it was?
56.85,57.92,ANYA,Nope.
58.01,61.37,XANDER,I've been having that feeling
58.01,61.37,XANDER,and I just realised what it was.
61.45,64.65,XANDER,Three weeks ago Riley asked me
61.45,64.65,XANDER,to borrow a Crescent wrench.
64.73,67.65,XANDER,I keep having this feeling
64.73,67.65,XANDER,I'm supposed to give it to him.
67.73,70.45,ANYA,That's not going to happen
67.73,70.45,ANYA,unless he comes back.
70.53,73.89,ANYA,"You know, not to get the Crescent wrench."
70.53,73.89,ANYA,Just to come back.
74.09,79.57,XANDER,"I just mean, sometimes I sort of forget"
74.09,79.57,XANDER,"that he's gone. It's, like, ""Where's Riley?"""
80.25,83.85,XANDER,"Oh, wait, the Central Republic"
80.25,83.85,XANDER,of WhereInTheHell."
84.85,86.97,ANYA,Xander?
87.05,90.6,ANYA,"If you ever decide to go, I want a warning."
90.69,93.05,ANYA,"You know, big flashing red lights"
93.13,97.09,ANYA,and one of those clocks that
93.13,97.09,ANYA,"counts down like a bomb in a movie,"
97.33,102.25,ANYA,"and there's a bunch of coloured wires, and"
97.33,102.25,ANYA,"I'm not sure which is the right one to cut,"
102.33,105.17,ANYA,"but I guess the green one,"
102.33,105.17,ANYA,then at the last second "No. Red."
105.25,110.33,ANYA,And then it stops with three tenths
105.25,110.33,ANYA,"of a second left, but then you don't leave."
110.41,112.54,ANYA,"Like that, OK?"
112.54,113.45,XANDER,Check.
114.21,116.81,XANDER,Big bomb clock. Come here.
120.02,124.07,XANDER,Advertise your product or brand here
120.02,124.07,XANDER,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
125.21,127.2,ANYA,Maybe it's her.
128.53,133.85,ANYA,"Well, maybe it won't happen to us because"
128.53,133.85,ANYA,it's all about her messing things up.
133.93,137.4,ANYA,"She couldn't make it work with Angel,"
133.93,137.4,ANYA,and then she let Riley go away.
138.49,143.69,XANDER,"Yeah, relationship debris is kind of"
138.49,143.69,XANDER,piling up on the Buffy highway.
143.77,146.53,ANYA,Humans make the same
143.77,146.53,ANYA,mistakes over and over.
146.61,148.81,ANYA,I saw it when I was a vengeance demon.
148.89,152.89,ANYA,"Some guy dumps a girl, she calls me,"
148.89,152.89,ANYA,"I exact vengeance, blah, blah, blah."
152.97,155.73,ANYA,"The next year, same girl, different guy."
155.81,159.97,ANYA,After you smite a few of 'em you start
155.81,159.97,ANYA,"going ""My goodness, young lady."""
160.05,162.57,ANYA,Maybe you're doing
160.05,162.57,ANYA,something wrong here too."
162.65,164.77,XANDER,I don't think it's a pattern with her.
164.85,166.84,XANDER,"No, it's just..."
167.29,170.44,XANDER,"You know, now that it happened again,"
171.69,176.29,XANDER,"man number two, I wonder"
171.69,176.29,XANDER,how she's dealing with it.
177.93,180.97,NUN,"Sister Abigail, the choir is ready."
177.93,180.97,NUN,Thank you.
228.89,232.65,NUN,What was that? He looked like a demon.
232.89,235.17,BUFFY,"Yeah, he did. Are you OK?"
235.77,237.53,NUN,"Yeah, I think so."
237.53,238.05,BUFFY,Here.
241.45,244.84,BUFFY,"So, about being a nun."
245.69,250.32,BUFFY,"You know, with the whole"
245.69,250.32,BUFFY,abjuring the company of men.
250.41,253.45,BUFFY,How's that working for you? The abjuring.
255.65,256.48,NUN,Good.
256.57,262.02,BUFFY,Yeah. Do you have to be superreligious?
260.09,260.79,NUN,Well...
260.79,262.29,BUFFY,How's the food?
316.65,319.21,GILES,All right. Switch. Left lead.
323.17,325.29,BUFFY,You think they might be able to help us?
325.37,328.24,BUFFY,If you mean are they gonna help us
328.24,331.02,GILES,find out something about Glory...
329.09,332.21,GILES,I saw that coming.
329.09,332.21,GILES,You're dropping your shoulder.
332.53,336.45,GILES,The resources that the Watchers'
332.53,336.45,GILES,Council have at its disposal...
336.53,338.66,GILES,The Central Library alone is just...
338.66,340.61,BUFFY,Don't talk about the books again.
340.85,343.45,BUFFY,You get all... And sometimes there's drool.
343.69,346.47,BUFFY,"I'm sorry, but we've exhausted the materials"
346.47,348.93,GILES,"I have here, and we're coming up empty."
350.93,355.4,GILES,You're still dropping your shoulder. I can see
350.93,355.4,GILES,when you're going to go with your right.
355.49,357.13,GILES,You're doing it again.
357.93,359.92,GILES,Sorry.
360.01,363.45,BUFFY,"So, Glory's all you're gonna"
360.01,363.45,BUFFY,"talk to them about, right?"
363.53,365.42,GILES,Let's take a break.
365.42,366.41,BUFFY,Answer me.
366.93,370.53,GILES,I'm not going to mention Dawn's name.
366.93,370.53,GILES,"I wouldn't do that, I promise."
371.21,373.44,BUFFY,But you're gonna tell them about the Key?
373.53,375.92,BUFFY,That Glory's looking for
373.53,375.92,BUFFY,something called the Key?
376.09,379.13,GILES,"Well, knowing her goal is crucial."
379.21,383.92,GILES,"I mean, if anything helps them"
379.21,383.92,GILES,"uncover her origins, her plans..."
384.17,388.53,BUFFY,"I know. It's just, I trust these watchers"
384.17,388.53,BUFFY,about as far as you could throw them.
388.61,390.37,GILES,Thank you very much.
391.93,397.49,BUFFY,I'm freaked about the idea of giving them any
391.93,397.49,BUFFY,information that could lead them to Dawn.
397.57,400.45,GILES,"Truly, Buffy, if I saw an alternative..."
400.53,403.81,GILES,"If the Initiative were still around,"
400.53,403.81,GILES,"I'd consider using them,"
403.89,409.01,GILES,"but they're gone, and Riley was"
403.89,409.01,GILES,the last link we had to the government.
411.49,414.46,GILES,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
414.46,415.25,BUFFY,It's OK.
415.33,417.93,BUFFY,You can say his name.
418.01,422.96,BUFFY,I'm doing all right. These things happen.
418.01,422.96,BUFFY,People break up and they move on.
423.73,427.17,BUFFY,For a while it feels like the end
423.73,427.17,BUFFY,"of the world but, big picture..."
427.41,429.4,GILES,Not so huge.
429.97,433.76,BUFFY,Not so huge? I just said it feels like
429.97,433.76,BUFFY,the end of the world. Don't you listen?
437.41,439.85,BUFFY,I'm teasing.
439.93,442.45,BUFFY,Sort of. I'll be OK.
443.69,446.45,GILES,"Well, I do hate to go if you're feeling badly."
446.53,451.77,BUFFY,"Look, if it helps you find out something"
446.53,451.77,BUFFY,"about Glory, I'm thrilled to have you gone."
452.33,455.45,ANYA,You're going away for a week? That's great.
455.53,457.6,GILES,Yes. Everybody seems delighted about it.
457.6,459.16,ANYA,"I get to run the store, right?"
460.61,465.64,GILES,"You? Well, it's quite a lot for one person"
460.61,465.64,GILES,"to take care of. The trashmen, for example."
465.73,470.2,GILES,They've been making such a mess in the alley
465.73,470.2,GILES,the recycling people can't get in to collect.
470.29,471.84,GILES,Somebody has to talk to them.
471.84,473.13,ANYA,I can take care of that.
473.21,478.08,TARA,"I'm envious, Mr Giles. A trip to England"
473.21,478.08,TARA,sounds so exciting and exotic.
478.17,479.87,TARA,Unless you're English.
479.87,481.96,BUFFY,Don't worry about the shop.
482.05,484.44,BUFFY,"We can open, close and deal with everyone."
484.44,486.21,WILLOW,We can come by between classes.
486.29,489.37,WILLOW,Usually I use that time
486.29,489.37,WILLOW,to copy over my class notes
489.45,492.37,WILLOW,"with a system of differentcoloured pens,"
492.45,496.24,WILLOW,but it's been pointed out to me
492.45,496.24,WILLOW,"that that's, you know, insane."
496.65,498.33,TARA,I said quirky.
498.41,500.88,ANYA,Hello. I work here. I'll take care of everything.
500.97,502.58,XANDER,"Yeah, Anya can do it."
502.58,503.81,ANYA,"Thanks, sweetie."
504.77,506.6,ANYA,Well said.
504.77,506.6,ANYA,"Yes, well, Anya,"
506.69,512.29,GILES,while I completely trust you to take care
506.69,512.29,GILES,"of the inventory and the money,"
513.21,516.68,GILES,dealing with people
513.21,516.68,GILES,requires a certain finesse.
516.97,518.53,ANYA,I have finesse.
518.61,522.49,ANYA,I have it coming out of my bottom. I can
518.61,522.49,ANYA,completely lie to the health inspector.
522.57,526.36,ANYA,I can distract him with coy smiles
522.57,526.36,ANYA,and bribe him with money and goods.
526.45,528.25,XANDER,See there? She'll be great.
528.33,529.79,XANDER,Don't worry. I'll help her
529.79,531.13,WILLOW,take care of everything.
531.21,534.49,WILLOW,"It'll be shipshape. Better, it'll be shopshape."
535.17,539.45,ANYA,"Xander, she's talking to Giles"
535.17,539.45,ANYA,like I'm not here. Make her stop.
539.53,541.41,GILES,Perhaps I'd better call the airline.
541.41,542.92,WILLOW,I'm trying to help. Tell her.
543.01,545.7,GILES,Schedule an earlier flight back. Excuse me.
545.7,547.96,ANYA,Tell her that I don't need her help.
548.05,549.48,XANDER,"So, how goes the slaying?"
549.48,551.93,BUFFY,I killed something in a convent last night.
552.01,556.53,XANDER,"In any other room, a frightening declaration."
552.01,556.53,XANDER,"Here, a welcome distraction."
556.61,558.93,XANDER,"Tell us all about the killing, Buff."
558.93,561.05,BUFFY,Pretty standard. Vampire staking.
561.13,566.02,BUFFY,"But I met a nun, and she"
561.13,566.02,BUFFY,let me try on her wimple.
564.09,566.08,XANDER,"OK, now we're back to frightening."
573.77,577.24,BUFFY,"You with the actual clothing, who are you?"
578.25,580.15,BUFFY,"Dawn, come look at this."
580.15,582.29,JOYCE,Is it hard to recognise me?
583.89,585.77,BUFFY,No more bathrobe.
585.85,589.21,JOYCE,I looked at it today and
585.85,589.21,JOYCE,"there it was, all fuzzy and blue,"
589.29,591.41,JOYCE,and I just couldn't stand it any more.
591.49,593.88,BUFFY,I don't think the rest of us will miss it much.
593.97,595.68,DAWN,It was getting a little ripe.
595.68,597.09,BUFFY,Maybe we should burn it.
597.17,599.43,DAWN,It would keep the bugs away.
599.43,600.8,JOYCE,It doesn't smell.
600.89,605.73,JOYCE,"Fine, make your funny jokes at the expense"
600.89,605.73,JOYCE,of the woman with the hole in her skull.
606.49,609.09,BUFFY,Let's go. I think we've tired her out.
623.41,624.65,DAWN,What you doing?
624.65,625.88,BUFFY,Playing soccer.
626.89,629.28,DAWN,Can I hang out in here?
629.37,631.36,BUFFY,Don't touch anything.
637.81,640.24,DAWN,You took down his pictures.
640.24,640.69,BUFFY,Yeah.
643.09,645.85,DAWN,I think I would've done that sooner.
645.93,649.4,DAWN,Like: "Don't wanna see that face again."
651.05,654.25,BUFFY,It wasn't like that. I was never angry with him.
655.97,657.96,DAWN,"OK, that's a lie."
659.21,662.44,BUFFY,But it's not like I didn't want to see his face.
663.97,672.02,DAWN,"I was just starting to kinda like the guy,"
663.97,672.02,DAWN,and then he's gone. So fast.
670.37,673.37,BUFFY,It wasn't really so fast. Him leaving.
674.97,679.13,BUFFY,"According to everyone who isn't me,"
674.97,679.13,BUFFY,it was kind of gradual.
683.37,685.91,DAWN,Does that make it any better?
685.91,686.17,BUFFY,No.
687.69,690.33,DAWN,Because you should have noticed earlier?
691.45,694.45,BUFFY,Stop being insightful. It's creepy.
699.69,701.68,BUFFY,It hurts.
702.25,704.85,BUFFY,In all kinds of horrible ways.
704.93,707.61,BUFFY,"In the way where I'm furious at him,"
707.69,710.53,BUFFY,"in the way where I blame myself,"
710.61,714.45,BUFFY,in all the little ways I imagine
710.61,714.45,BUFFY,how I could have fixed things.
716.77,718.97,DAWN,It'll get better.
719.05,720.85,DAWN,Won't it?
721.89,726.02,BUFFY,I hope so.
724.09,726.08,BUFFY,Yes. It has to.
728.69,733.69,BUFFY,"I'll just keep going like I have been,"
728.69,733.69,BUFFY,and every day it'll get a little bit better.
734.69,736.68,DAWN,Really? Every day?
737.57,740.69,BUFFY,Not really. But it'll be better soon.
741.65,744.53,DAWN,"It still feels a little sudden to me,"
744.61,747.57,DAWN,with him gone where no one can talk to him.
747.89,750.41,BUFFY,But you never know.
750.49,752.96,BUFFY,Maybe he'll come back.
753.05,758.84,BUFFY,Maybe he'll hate the jungle or maybe
753.05,758.84,BUFFY,he'll want to give it another try.
761.09,764.05,BUFFY,I could say all the things I didn't get to say.
767.29,771.84,SPIKE,There's somethin' I got to tell you
767.29,771.84,SPIKE,about showing you Riley in that place.
774.09,776.48,SPIKE,I didn't mean to...
779.29,783.57,SPIKE,"Anyway, I know you're feeling"
779.29,783.57,SPIKE,"all betrayed  by him, not me."
783.65,788.12,SPIKE,"I was trying to help, you know."
783.65,788.12,SPIKE,"Not like I made him be there, after all."
788.21,793.02,SPIKE,Actually trying to help you.
791.09,793.21,SPIKE,Best intentions.
793.29,797.25,SPIKE,"I mean, pretty state you'd be in,"
793.29,797.25,SPIKE,thinkin' things were all right
797.33,801.25,SPIKE,while he's toddlin' halfway round the bend.
801.33,806.45,SPIKE,I'll insult him if I want to.
801.33,806.45,SPIKE,I'm the one who's on your side.
806.53,811.29,SPIKE,"Me. Doin' you a favour, and"
806.53,811.29,SPIKE,you bein' dead petty about it.
811.37,816.77,SPIKE,"Me, gettin' nothin' but your hatred and"
811.37,816.77,SPIKE,your venom and... You ungrateful bitch.
846.77,849.77,SPIKE,"Buffy, there's somethin' I wanted to tell you."
850.69,853.21,WILLOW,"Good, and hellebore?"
853.29,855.1,WILLOW,It's up and to the right.
855.1,857.41,TARA,"Hellebore, one of my favourites."
857.49,862.17,WILLOW,It's powerful stuff. I tried to use it
857.49,862.17,WILLOW,to derat Amy and it didn't work.
862.25,864.85,WILLOW,But I think it might have
862.25,864.85,WILLOW,made her really smart.
864.93,868.4,WILLOW,She keeps giving me these looks
864.93,868.4,WILLOW,like she's planning something.
868.49,870.88,WILLOW,Rubbing her paws together.
873.09,874.89,ANYA,What are you two doing?
874.97,876.84,WILLOW,We're gonna try out a few spells.
876.84,879.21,TARA,"There's this thing where you create light,"
879.29,880.66,WILLOW,"and we thought, what if we"
880.66,882.25,TARA,could make simulated sunlight?
882.33,887.93,WILLOW,"Yeah, so there Buffy is, middle of the night,"
882.33,887.93,WILLOW,"and she finds this whole nest of vamps,"
888.01,890.32,WILLOW,and then she just goes "Presto!"
890.41,892.77,TARA,Only it won't be "presto" exactly.
892.85,895.97,WILLOW,And there's a floating ball of sunlight.
896.05,896.95,WILLOW,Vamps get dusty.
896.95,898.69,TARA,"Don't look right at it, though."
898.77,901.08,ANYA,"That's swell, but you can't use this stuff."
901.17,905.17,ANYA,Giles has only been gone two days
901.17,905.17,ANYA,and you're already causing trouble.
905.25,907.88,ANYA,You shouldn't do things while he's gone.
907.88,908.93,WILLOW,You're the fish.
909.41,909.98,ANYA,What?
909.98,915.02,WILLOW,"The fish in the bowl, in The Cat in the Hat."
913.09,919.02,WILLOW,He was always saying that the cat shouldn't
913.09,919.02,WILLOW,be there while the mother was out.
917.53,919.74,ANYA,What are you talking about?
919.74,923.02,TARA,A book. This cat does all this mischief.
921.09,926.04,WILLOW,"It's so cute. He balances a bunch of stuff,"
921.09,926.04,WILLOW,including that fish in the bowl. And...
926.13,932.02,WILLOW,But don't try it when you're six or you're
926.13,932.02,WILLOW,not allowed to have fish for five years.
930.09,933.48,ANYA,You're referencing literature
930.09,933.48,ANYA,I have no way to be familiar with
933.57,935.77,ANYA,"so that I feel left out, and you're stealing."
935.85,939.73,WILLOW,I'm not stealing. I'm just taking
935.85,939.73,WILLOW,things without paying for th...
939.81,942.12,WILLOW,In what twisted dictionary is that stealing?
942.12,943.44,TARA,Maybe we should just pay.
943.53,947.77,WILLOW,"Anya, Giles would be totally fine"
943.53,947.77,WILLOW,"with this. Come on, it'll be fun."
948.21,952.89,WILLOW,We could show you how to do some stuff.
948.21,952.89,WILLOW,You could be floatin' pencils by tonight.
953.97,956.36,ANYA,Sometimes I miss having powers.
959.29,961.85,ANYA,I know what this is. This is peer pressure.
961.93,964.89,ANYA,Any second now you'll make me
961.93,964.89,ANYA,smoke tobacco and have drugs.
965.73,967.72,WILLOW,Look how easy.
972.05,974.25,ANYA,Don't float the merchandise.
976.45,978.41,ANYA,Stop that.
978.49,981.53,XANDER,Look at this. My two favourite girls.
978.49,981.53,XANDER,Three favourite girls.
981.61,984.73,ANYA,"Xander, Willow's stealing. She's a burglar."
984.81,988.44,WILLOW,"Right. The cunning, broaddaylight"
984.81,988.44,WILLOW,infrontofeveryone burglar.
988.53,991.57,WILLOW,"Xander, I'm just doing a spell to help Buffy."
991.65,993.88,ANYA,"Xander, Giles left me in charge. Tell her."
994.29,996.07,XANDER,Judge Xander requesting a recess.
996.07,997.84,TARA,You shouldn't pull him into this.
997.93,1000.53,XANDER,"Yeah, see? Tara's with me. Protect me, Tara."
1002.29,1004.65,WILLOW,"Xander, what I'm doing, it's a good thing."
1004.73,1008.52,WILLOW,"And if it doesn't work, Giles"
1004.73,1008.52,WILLOW,never even needs to know about it.
1010.05,1011.12,WILLOW,Oops.
1013.73,1019.02,ANYA,The cash resister.
1013.73,1019.02,ANYA,What did you do with it? Dear God.
1017.09,1018.81,WILLOW,I'll fix it.
1019.37,1021.36,WILLOW,Recursat.
1022.57,1025.09,WILLOW,"There, all back. Good as new."
1025.17,1027.69,ANYA,Money. Did you hurt the money?
1027.77,1030.65,ANYA,Money good? She endangered the money.
1031.93,1036.61,WILLOW,"Of course, that's what she cares about."
1031.93,1036.61,WILLOW,I like money better than people."
1036.69,1040.65,WILLOW,People can so rarely be exchanged
1036.69,1040.65,WILLOW,for goods and/or services."
1040.73,1042.24,ANYA,She's pretending to be me.
1042.24,1044.44,WILLOW,Can you even believe how she's acting?
1044.53,1046.97,XANDER,Know what? I'm tired of being in the middle.
1047.05,1049.25,XANDER,I won't let you pull me into this.
1049.25,1049.77,WILLOW,I'm not.
1049.85,1053.37,XANDER,"Whatever the issue is between you two,"
1049.85,1053.37,XANDER,just figure it out without me.
1054.29,1055.93,ANYA,"Xander, don't go."
1061.97,1064.42,WILLOW,You made him mad.
1064.42,1064.85,ANYA,Me?
1064.93,1070.02,WILLOW,"Tara, who do you think he was more mad at?"
1068.09,1073.12,TARA,"You know, I think maybe you guys"
1068.09,1073.12,TARA,have some stuff you need to work out.
1073.21,1075.6,TARA,"You know, just really talk."
1083.61,1084.8,WILLOW,Fleabane.
1084.8,1085.6,ANYA,cents.
1087.97,1089.14,WILLOW,Salamander eyes.
1089.14,1091.33,ANYA,Ten bucks for twelve. Bargain.
1093.41,1094.18,WILLOW,Bindweed.
1094.18,1095.88,ANYA,That's a pricey one.
1096.09,1098.45,WILLOW,Would you stop that? It's very distracting.
1099.09,1102.97,ANYA,Fine. Make your little ball
1099.09,1102.97,ANYA,of sunshine. I'll be quiet.
1103.61,1106.53,WILLOW,"Good, because this spell is very sensitive."
1106.61,1109.69,WILLOW,"Once I begin,"
1106.61,1109.69,WILLOW,any nonritual word can disrupt it.
1110.65,1111.97,ANYA,Fine.
1112.05,1114.04,WILLOW,"OK, here we go."
1121.33,1123.56,ANYA,Did you start yet?
1123.56,1123.93,WILLOW,No.
1124.41,1126.4,WILLOW,This is it.
1127.41,1130.41,WILLOW,"Spirits of light, I invoke thee."
1131.25,1134.53,WILLOW,Let the gloom of darkness part before you.
1134.61,1139.56,WILLOW,Let the moonlight be made pale
1134.61,1139.56,WILLOW,by your presence. Spirits...
1139.65,1141.64,ANYA,Is it done?
1143.01,1146.45,WILLOW,"Spirits of light, grant my wishes."
1146.53,1148.77,ANYA,I'm sorry. I thought you were done.
1148.77,1150.49,WILLOW,Do you wanna screw this up?
1151.05,1154.52,ANYA,No. I'm sure you can do that all on your own.
1154.61,1157.97,WILLOW,"Anya, whatever really has you mad,"
1154.61,1157.97,WILLOW,"why don't you just say it,"
1158.05,1160.89,WILLOW,like you do every thought
1158.05,1160.89,WILLOW,that stomps through your brain?
1160.97,1162.74,ANYA,I believe I have said it.
1162.74,1165.36,WILLOW,No. You haven't. Come on. Let it out.
1197.53,1200.25,WILLOW,He's not a ball of sunshine.
1203.89,1206.2,BUFFY,"New semester, new classes."
1206.29,1210.08,BUFFY,Whole new vistas of knowledge
1206.29,1210.08,BUFFY,to be confused and intimidated by.
1210.17,1213.8,TARA,I think this one's gonna be fun.
1210.17,1213.8,TARA,Greek Art is gonna touch on so many things.
1213.89,1215.98,TARA,Mythology and history and philosophy...
1215.98,1218.28,BUFFY,The professor spit too much when he talked.
1218.37,1224.02,BUFFY,It was like being at SeaWorld.
1218.37,1224.02,BUFFY,The first five rows will get wet."
1222.09,1224.73,TARA,That was just enthusiasm.
1224.81,1227.2,BUFFY,It seemed very much like saliva.
1227.29,1229.37,TARA,We'll sit farther back next time.
1229.37,1231.76,BUFFY,Good plan. I need to keep this course.
1231.85,1236.8,BUFFY,The only other thing that fits into
1231.85,1236.8,BUFFY,my schedule is Central American Geopolitics.
1236.89,1238.88,BUFFY,"And no, thank you."
1239.41,1243.04,BUFFY,"I even hear the word ""jungle"","
1239.41,1243.04,BUFFY,and all I can think of is him.
1244.13,1247.41,BUFFY,"You know, ""Is that the one Riley's in?"""
1247.49,1250.41,BUFFY,Really don't need a daily
1247.49,1250.41,BUFFY,two o'clock knife in the heart.
1250.49,1252.88,TARA,Is it that bad?
1253.41,1257.04,BUFFY,Sort of. But I'm starting to get
1253.41,1257.04,BUFFY,perspective on the whole situation.
1257.13,1260.17,BUFFY,Maybe Riley's where he's supposed to be.
1260.25,1263.09,BUFFY,Maybe he needed to be where he was needed.
1263.29,1266.29,TARA,Willow says that things
1263.29,1266.29,TARA,always happen for a reason.
1266.37,1269.92,BUFFY,But you ever notice people
1266.37,1269.92,BUFFY,only say that about bad things?
1270.01,1271.92,BUFFY,But not for me the furrowed brow.
1272.01,1276.13,BUFFY,What do you say we go pick up Willow
1272.01,1276.13,BUFFY,and indulge in an afterschool hamburger?
1276.21,1278.52,TARA,We could. She might still
1276.21,1278.52,TARA,be at the magic shop.
1278.61,1280.16,TARA,I was there earlier and she and
1280.16,1281.76,BUFFY,Anya kinda got in this squabble.
1281.85,1285.29,TARA,Xander and I cleared out. He was pretty upset.
1285.37,1287.36,BUFFY,Anya and Xander are in trouble?
1288.25,1290.37,TARA,"No, I said that all wrong. It was nothing."
1290.45,1294.61,TARA,"Willow and Anya were fighting, and then"
1290.45,1294.61,TARA,Xander snapped at both of them and he left.
1294.69,1296.09,TARA,He left?
1296.17,1298.24,BUFFY,Xander left Anya?
1298.33,1302.96,TARA,No. Not "left her" left her. He just left.
1298.33,1302.96,TARA,"It was only a little thing, really."
1303.05,1306.68,BUFFY,"Little thing? See, the thing is,"
1303.05,1306.68,BUFFY,"the little things get bigger,"
1306.77,1309.33,BUFFY,"and if you don't catch the little thing,"
1309.41,1314.04,BUFFY,then you have this whole huge thing.
1314.13,1317.89,BUFFY,Not them with the little things.
1314.13,1317.89,BUFFY,They can't break up.
1317.97,1319.06,TARA,I think...
1319.06,1322.02,BUFFY,They have a beautiful love.
1320.09,1322.08,TARA,I think they'll be fine.
1323.73,1326.14,BUFFY,They have a miraculous love.
1326.14,1326.57,TARA,What?
1327.01,1331.02,BUFFY,A miraculous love.
1332.45,1334.76,ANYA,That car. We're still on his trail.
1334.85,1339.24,WILLOW,I don't even get how we made that guy
1334.85,1339.24,WILLOW,"because, wow, advanced."
1339.33,1343.33,ANYA,No one made him. He must have been
1339.33,1343.33,ANYA,"trapped in that crystal, and you released him."
1343.41,1346.69,WILLOW,"I released him? No,"
1343.41,1346.69,WILLOW,this was definitely a "we" thing.
1346.77,1350.29,WILLOW,Or a "you" thing.
1346.77,1350.29,WILLOW,It definitely feels like a "you" thing.
1350.37,1354.92,ANYA,"Look, just find the reversal spell. And hurry."
1350.37,1354.92,ANYA,Look what he did to that lamppost.
1355.01,1358.37,WILLOW,I'm trying. Put the top up.
1355.01,1358.37,WILLOW,The pages are all blowy.
1358.45,1362.16,ANYA,I don't know how to. I only just
1358.45,1362.16,ANYA,figured out what the left pedal does.
1362.25,1364.24,ANYA,It makes us stop.
1365.37,1368.52,WILLOW,You don't know how to drive?
1365.37,1368.52,WILLOW,Why didn't you say?
1368.85,1372.53,ANYA,"Well, I couldn't know if I could"
1368.85,1372.53,ANYA,"until I tried, could I?"
1373.89,1379.02,WILLOW,"This is very, very bad."
1373.89,1379.02,WILLOW,There's an ogre on the loose...
1377.09,1378.45,ANYA,Troll.
1378.53,1378.98,WILLOW,What?
1378.98,1380.68,ANYA,Troll on the loose.
1380.77,1385.29,ANYA,Now hold on. I'm gonna press the right
1380.77,1385.29,ANYA,pedal harder. I expect us to accelerate.
1387.21,1390.21,WILLOW,There's a troll loose and
1387.21,1390.21,WILLOW,you're gonna crash Giles' car.
1390.29,1393.92,ANYA,It's likely. You should have listened
1390.29,1393.92,ANYA,to me and not done the spell.
1394.01,1396.01,ANYA,Giles put me in charge.
1396.01,1400.02,WILLOW,"He can be an idiot. The smart kind, but still."
1398.09,1399.23,ANYA,Xander agreed.
1399.23,1402.41,WILLOW,Right. Xander doesn't step out of line.
1402.49,1404.62,ANYA,"Well, what do you mean by that?"
1404.62,1405.17,WILLOW,Nothing.
1408.89,1411.45,ANYA,Find that spell quickly.
1411.45,1412.73,WILLOW,That's gone.
1419.89,1421.57,SPIKE,Watch it.
1421.65,1423.21,SPIKE,It's you.
1423.29,1426.05,XANDER,"Spike, don't let me stop you"
1423.29,1426.05,XANDER,from not being here.
1426.13,1428.12,SPIKE,"I was here first, you know."
1429.37,1431.36,XANDER,Go away.
1434.57,1438.12,SPIKE,"Why would I do that, when it's buggin'"
1434.57,1438.12,SPIKE,you so much having me here?
1439.33,1443.77,SPIKE,"They have chicken wings, too. Also a sort"
1439.33,1443.77,SPIKE,of a flowershaped thing made from an onion.
1443.85,1445.84,SPIKE,It's brilliant.
1445.93,1450.4,XANDER,Are you talking to me hoping I'll get so
1445.93,1450.4,XANDER,depressed I'll impale myself on a fork?
1450.93,1452.45,SPIKE,Lovely thought.
1452.53,1455.89,SPIKE,"If I don't hurt you myself, the chip"
1452.53,1455.89,SPIKE,wouldn't zap me. I could eat you.
1456.21,1458.96,SPIKE,Beat the onion thing all to hell.
1458.96,1460.21,XANDER,Those are mine.
1461.53,1464.13,SPIKE,"My, my. Someone's in a temper."
1464.85,1468.21,SPIKE,This all sympathetic misery
1464.85,1468.21,SPIKE,borrowed from the Slayer?
1468.93,1471.97,XANDER,"What? No, nothing to do with Buffy."
1472.05,1476.29,SPIKE,"So she's all right, then?"
1472.05,1476.29,SPIKE,Not holding grudges?
1476.89,1481.52,XANDER,What are you talking about? What does Buffy
1476.89,1481.52,XANDER,have to do with anything? What grudges?
1481.61,1484.21,SPIKE,"OK. No need to talk about it, then."
1484.29,1489.16,SPIKE,I'm sure she's merrily slaying some pals
1484.29,1489.16,SPIKE,"of mine, havin' a grand old time."
1489.25,1490.53,BUFFY VOICEOVER,This is very bad.
1491.21,1493.52,BUFFY,Willow? Anya?
1493.61,1497.21,TARA,They're not back there either. They're gone.
1497.29,1500.17,TARA,"Buffy, something's been here"
1497.29,1500.17,TARA,and Willow's gone.
1500.25,1503.33,BUFFY,"Don't worry. We'll get her back, I promise."
1503.49,1506.37,BUFFY,"Come on, this thing's"
1503.49,1506.37,BUFFY,probably leaving a huge trail.
1515.41,1517.4,OLAF,Puny receptacle.
1521.41,1523.64,OLAF,"You do well to flee, townspeople."
1523.93,1526.37,OLAF,I will pillage your lands and dwellings.
1526.53,1531.81,OLAF,I will burn your crops and make merry sport
1526.53,1531.81,OLAF,with your more attractive daughters.
1533.13,1535.12,OLAF,Mark my words.
1538.17,1539.57,OLAF,Ale.
1539.65,1542.29,OLAF,I smell delicious ale.
1544.29,1547.68,XANDER,They get in these fights and they
1544.29,1547.68,XANDER,both look at me like I'm the referee.
1547.77,1550.4,XANDER,"I'll say something about Anya, and Willow'll"
1550.4,1552.8,SPIKE,get this "what do you see in her?" look.
1552.89,1555.89,SPIKE,I know that look.
1552.89,1555.89,SPIKE,A lot of people never really got Dru.
1555.97,1560.6,XANDER,"Well, she was insane. Then I get all torn"
1560.69,1566.13,XANDER,because Willow's my best friend and I really
1560.69,1566.13,XANDER,"value her opinion, but Anya's my girlfriend."
1566.21,1569.29,SPIKE,What does the Slayer think of
1566.21,1569.29,SPIKE,all this friction in the ranks?
1569.37,1571.32,SPIKE,Can't be good for morale.
1571.32,1572.33,XANDER,I don't know.
1572.85,1575.69,SPIKE,"She's a little preoccupied, maybe."
1575.77,1580.61,SPIKE,"It's understandable, what with all the upset,"
1575.77,1580.61,SPIKE,all that blamin' of innocent bystanders.
1580.69,1580.96,XANDER,What?
1580.96,1583.25,SPIKE,"I mean, did she want to be made a fool of?"
1583.33,1585.29,XANDER,And what does a person have to do
1585.29,1587.25,SPIKE,"to make it right? Watch it, mate."
1588.09,1591.13,SPIKE,"On second thought, do what you like."
1591.21,1593.28,OLAF,Ale. Yes.
1593.37,1595.28,OLAF,Fragrant ale.
1597.65,1600.57,XANDER,"So, think I should run get Buffy?"
1606.89,1613.13,OLAF,"Barmaid. Bring me stronger ale,"
1606.89,1613.13,OLAF,"and some plump, succulent babies to eat."
1613.37,1616.6,XANDER,I'm gonna run get Buffy.
1613.37,1616.6,XANDER,Or maybe you could fight him.
1616.69,1619.89,SPIKE,"I could do that, but I'm paralysed"
1616.69,1619.89,SPIKE,with not caring very much.
1619.97,1621.96,OLAF,You there.
1622.05,1624.09,OLAF,Do you know where there are babies?
1624.17,1626.53,SPIKE,What do you think? The hospital?
1626.53,1627.56,XANDER,What? Shut up.
1628.57,1629.28,XANDER,Listen...
1629.28,1631.33,OLAF,I find myself very hungry.
1631.41,1633.73,OLAF,When I'm hungry I grow short of patience.
1633.73,1635.93,XANDER,"Well, we can take care of the ""hungry"","
1636.01,1638.89,XANDER,so how's about you just sit down
1636.01,1638.89,XANDER,in one of the sturdier chairs
1638.97,1642.33,XANDER,and we could have a calm
1638.97,1642.33,XANDER,talk and something to eat?
1642.41,1644.13,OLAF,Can it be babies?
1644.13,1645.96,XANDER,"Well, not so much."
1646.29,1651.16,XANDER,But maybe some roast pigs and stags and...
1651.73,1652.86,XANDER,much hearty grog.
1652.86,1654.93,SPIKE,They've got this onion thing...
1655.01,1658.13,OLAF,You cannot appease me. Do not try.
1658.29,1660.28,OLAF,More ale.
1662.01,1665.61,ANYA,Xander. You shouldn't be here. There's a troll.
1665.69,1668.84,XANDER,A big guy? Hammer?
1665.69,1668.84,XANDER,I think I noticed him.
1670.09,1672.29,WILLOW,I wish Buffy was here.
1672.37,1673.81,BUFFY,I'm here.
1673.89,1675.88,WILLOW,I wish I had a million dollars.
1676.89,1677.82,WILLOW,Just checking.
1677.82,1680.49,BUFFY,What's going on? Where did he come from?
1682.29,1683.93,SPIKE,"Hello, Buffy."
1684.01,1688.93,ANYA,Willow stole ingredients and released him
1684.01,1688.93,ANYA,from a purple crystal. He's a troll.
1689.41,1690.7,BUFFY,You did this?
1690.7,1691.8,WILLOW,"Me? No, we."
1691.89,1694.38,WILLOW,"I mean, us. Her. It's very complex."
1694.38,1697.09,ANYA,"We can stop him. Willow, do the spell."
1699.45,1701.6,WILLOW,Let the conjuring be..."
1701.6,1702.05,OLAF,Stop.
1703.77,1705.75,WILLOW,Nobody lets me finish.
1705.75,1709.25,OLAF,"You told the witch to do that, Anyanka."
1709.33,1711.69,OLAF,You seem determined
1709.33,1711.69,OLAF,"to put an end to all my fun,"
1711.77,1714.24,OLAF,just like you always did when we were dating.
1720.81,1722.49,XANDER,You dated him?
1722.57,1723.77,BUFFY,You dated a troll?
1723.77,1726.04,WILLOW,And we're what? Surprised by this?
1726.33,1729.13,ANYA,"Well, he wasn't a troll then."
1726.33,1729.13,ANYA,"He was just a big dumb guy,"
1729.21,1731.97,ANYA,and he cheated on me
1729.21,1731.97,ANYA,"and I made him into a troll,"
1732.05,1735.41,ANYA,"which, by the way, is how I got"
1732.05,1735.41,ANYA,the job as a vengeance demon.
1737.81,1740.09,OLAF,I did not cheat.
1740.17,1743.53,OLAF,Not in my heart. It was only one wench.
1744.25,1748.8,OLAF,I had had a great deal of mead.
1744.25,1748.8,OLAF,"The next thing I know, I'm a troll."
1751.21,1754.97,OLAF,"You did this, Anyanka."
1751.21,1754.97,OLAF,You will die for this.
1755.05,1758.73,XANDER,But you seem to enjoy the being a troll.
1759.93,1761.45,OLAF,I adjusted.
1761.53,1763.76,OLAF,And then what happened? Witches.
1763.85,1766.53,OLAF,"Filthy, dirty, disgusting witches."
1766.61,1771.69,OLAF,They trapped me. I was imprisoned
1766.61,1771.69,OLAF,in that crystal for centuries.
1771.77,1775.4,OLAF,A curse on all witches. All must die.
1775.49,1776.35,BUFFY,"Willow, again."
1776.35,1778.13,WILLOW,Let the conjuring be undone."
1778.21,1780.06,WILLOW,Return the beast to native form."
1780.06,1780.73,OLAF,"Witch, stop."
1780.81,1784.73,WILLOW,Keep him far from us and ours
1780.81,1784.73,WILLOW,as long as my voice shall sound."
1788.53,1789.86,OLAF,It did not work.
1789.86,1792.53,WILLOW,"OK, wait. ""Let the conjuring..."""
1837.85,1839.8,BUFFY,Where is he?
1839.8,1840.61,WILLOW,Gone.
1840.69,1845.32,BUFFY,"Xander, follow him. Anya, Willow, go to the"
1840.69,1845.32,BUFFY,magic shop. Find a spell that will stop him.
1858.45,1859.82,BUFFY,What are you doing?
1859.82,1862.33,SPIKE,Makin' this woman more comfortable.
1862.41,1866.69,SPIKE,"I'm not samplin', I'll have you know. Just"
1862.41,1866.69,SPIKE,look at all the lovely bloodcovered people.
1866.77,1869.12,SPIKE,"I could, but not a taste for Spike."
1869.12,1871.8,BUFFY,Not a lick. I know you wouldn't like it.
1872.85,1876.93,BUFFY,You want credit for not feeding
1872.85,1876.93,BUFFY,off bleeding disaster victims?
1877.01,1878.97,SPIKE,"Well, yeah."
1879.05,1881.09,BUFFY,You're disgusting.
1883.05,1885.04,SPIKE,What's it take?
1886.37,1890.97,WILLOW,Hurry up. I'm taking everything on
1886.37,1890.97,WILLOW,"relocation spells, suspension spells,"
1891.05,1895.68,WILLOW,and  what the heck  spells to make him
1891.05,1895.68,WILLOW,really sleepy because... slightly better.
1895.77,1899.4,ANYA,"In case we need 'em, I'm getting"
1895.77,1899.4,ANYA,more of all the things you stole.
1899.49,1901.9,WILLOW,I didn't... Why do you do that?
1901.9,1902.29,ANYA,What?
1902.61,1907.21,WILLOW,"You're so rude. I mean, sure, at first,"
1902.61,1907.21,WILLOW,"exdemon, doesn't know the rules."
1907.29,1909.98,WILLOW,"Well, you been here for ever. Learn the rules."
1909.98,1910.97,ANYA,Rules are stupid.
1912.09,1917.29,WILLOW,"Great, whatever. I just thought you might"
1912.09,1917.29,WILLOW,be interested in learning to act more human.
1917.37,1922.05,WILLOW,Some of us enjoy it. Look for spells
1917.37,1922.05,WILLOW,"with dimensional portals, too."
1922.13,1926.84,ANYA,I am a human. And there are many
1922.13,1926.84,ANYA,humans who are stranger than me.
1927.41,1930.96,WILLOW,"Uhhuh, but unless I'm really wrong"
1927.41,1930.96,WILLOW,"about Crazy Larry at the bus stop,"
1931.05,1933.44,WILLOW,he's probably not gonna
1931.05,1933.44,WILLOW,turn Xander into a troll.
1933.53,1936.53,ANYA,"Well, now, that's a very complicated proced..."
1939.09,1943.64,ANYA,You think I'm gonna hurt Xander?
1939.09,1943.64,ANYA,I would never hurt Xander.
1944.41,1946.27,ANYA,You really think I would do that.
1946.27,1947.56,WILLOW,"Anya, it's what you do."
1947.65,1950.49,WILLOW,"You spent, what,"
1947.65,1950.49,WILLOW,a thousand years hurting men?
1950.57,1953.33,WILLOW,You got your "thousand years
1950.57,1953.33,WILLOW,of hurting men" gold watch.
1953.41,1957.53,ANYA,"I was a demon then, and I don't even"
1953.41,1957.53,ANYA,have any powers now. Is this the spell?
1958.25,1962.33,WILLOW,Only if you want him to double in size
1958.25,1962.33,WILLOW,"and grow extra arms, which... Let's not."
1962.41,1966.77,WILLOW,"And by the way, you weren't a demon when"
1962.41,1966.77,WILLOW,you turned Olaf into Lord of the Hammers.
1966.85,1969.21,WILLOW,You managed that.
1969.41,1971.93,WILLOW,"Also, there's other ways to hurt Xander."
1972.37,1975.49,ANYA,I don't do magic now.
1972.37,1975.49,ANYA,You're the one with that kind of power.
1975.57,1980.17,ANYA,D'Hoffryn offered you my old job. You're
1975.57,1980.17,ANYA,closer to being a vengeance demon than I am.
1980.25,1981.9,ANYA,Xander should be afraid of you.
1981.9,1982.97,WILLOW,He's my best friend.
1983.05,1987.29,ANYA,You don't want anyone else to have him.
1983.05,1987.29,ANYA,I know what broke up him and Cordelia.
1987.37,1989.32,ANYA,It was you. And your lips.
1989.32,1990.45,WILLOW,"No, it was not."
1991.65,1996.33,WILLOW,"Well, yes it was so, but that was a long"
1991.65,1996.33,WILLOW,time ago. Do you think I'd do that again?
1996.41,1997.15,ANYA,Why not?
1997.15,1999.09,WILLOW,"Well, hello. Gay now."
1999.49,2003.2,ANYA,But you're always doing all you can
1999.49,2003.2,ANYA,to point out how much I'm an outsider.
2003.29,2007.13,ANYA,You've known him since you were infants.
2003.29,2007.13,ANYA,You'll always know him better than I do.
2007.21,2009.36,WILLOW,You could poison his mind against me.
2009.45,2012.17,WILLOW,You're insane. I am not gonna take him away.
2012.25,2013.71,WILLOW,And I am not gonna hurt him.
2013.71,2014.81,ANYA,"Well, I'm not either."
2020.29,2021.73,OLAF,I knew it.
2021.81,2024.61,OLAF,"You two, performing more spells."
2024.89,2030.37,OLAF,"I could be out pillaging, devouring babies,"
2024.89,2030.37,OLAF,"making merry with the local virgins,"
2030.61,2035.05,OLAF,"but instead, I had to come"
2030.61,2035.05,OLAF,all the way back here to kill you.
2035.13,2036.93,WILLOW,Run.
2044.65,2047.04,XANDER,No. Get away from them.
2048.45,2051.37,OLAF,"I will get away from them, after I kill them."
2051.45,2054.21,XANDER,You are not touching these women.
2069.97,2072.77,OLAF,You wish for more? Admirable.
2097.09,2100.69,OLAF,"You fight well, although you are a tiny man."
2105.05,2109.65,OLAF,I shall reward you.
2105.05,2109.65,OLAF,"Only one of your women shall die,"
2109.73,2112.37,OLAF,and you shall be the one to choose.
2119.77,2121.49,WILLOW,Did he just say...?
2121.49,2122.13,OLAF,Choose.
2122.21,2126.57,OLAF,Anyanka or the witch.
2122.21,2126.57,OLAF,One of your women must die.
2126.65,2128.17,XANDER,No.
2128.85,2133.37,XANDER,You are one crazy troll. I'm not choosing
2128.85,2133.37,XANDER,between my girlfriend and my best friend.
2133.45,2135.23,XANDER,That's insane troll logic.
2135.23,2136.81,ANYA,"Go, Xander. I love you."
2138.37,2140.97,OLAF,Good for you. You are a Ioyal man.
2143.73,2145.17,WILLOW,Xander.
2145.37,2147.41,OLAF,Now. Choose.
2147.61,2148.51,ANYA,"Olaf, no."
2148.51,2150.21,XANDER,I'm not choosing.
2150.49,2153.57,OLAF,Then you shall be the one who dies.
2153.81,2155.11,OLAF,No. Choose me.
2155.11,2158.73,ANYA,Just don't take him. Don't take Xander.
2160.29,2163.09,WILLOW,E conspectu abeat monstrum.
2165.29,2166.81,WILLOW,Damn.
2166.89,2167.39,ANYA,Buffy.
2167.39,2168.72,WILLOW,"Tara, stay back."
2169.61,2172.57,ANYA,The hammer. His strength's in the hammer.
2180.49,2181.69,ANYA,How can I help?
2181.69,2183.61,WILLOW,Distract him from Buffy.
2183.69,2184.57,WILLOW,Piss him off.
2184.57,2185.73,ANYA,I don't know how.
2185.81,2189.49,WILLOW,"Anya, I have faith in you."
2185.81,2189.49,WILLOW,There is no one you cannot piss off.
2191.53,2195.32,ANYA,"Olaf, you're as inadequate"
2191.53,2195.32,ANYA,a troll as you were a boyfriend.
2198.13,2200.6,ANYA,You're hairy and unattractive.
2200.69,2203.33,ANYA,Even women trolls are
2200.69,2203.33,ANYA,put off by your various odours.
2203.41,2207.37,WILLOW,"Instrumentum ultionis, telum fabuloso,"
2207.45,2210.33,WILLOW,"surge, surge, terram pro voca."
2212.37,2215.89,ANYA,Your menacing stance is
2212.37,2215.89,ANYA,merely mildly alarming.
2218.25,2221.04,ANYA,And your roar is less than fullthroated.
2221.04,2221.53,OLAF,Desist.
2223.01,2226.4,OLAF,"My God, woman. It's been a thousand years"
2226.49,2231.52,OLAF,and yet you are as aggravating
2226.49,2231.52,OLAF,and emasculating as ever you were.
2232.25,2236.49,WILLOW,"Vola cum viribus, dominum tuum nega. Vola."
2242.49,2243.17,ANYA,Good job.
2243.17,2245.05,WILLOW,You too. Very irritating.
2245.89,2248.45,BUFFY,So. Your power's in your hammer?
2256.17,2259.8,ANYA,"Oh, yeah. I forgot he still"
2256.17,2259.8,ANYA,has all that troll strength.
2259.89,2263.89,OLAF,You shall all die.
2259.89,2263.89,OLAF,I will dispense no mercy now.
2274.49,2278.17,OLAF,"What are you fighting for,"
2274.49,2278.17,OLAF,minuscule blonde one? Your friends?
2278.61,2281.65,OLAF,These two? They will never last.
2282.33,2285.05,OLAF,"Anyanka is very difficult to live with,"
2285.53,2286.73,OLAF,and he...
2287.41,2292.02,OLAF,He's ludicrous and far too breakable.
2290.69,2293.41,OLAF,Their love will never last.
2303.13,2305.57,WILLOW,She's got him now.
2305.65,2307.72,ANYA,Poor baby.
2309.41,2311.85,XANDER,You really dated him?
2311.93,2313.13,ANYA,Yes.
2313.21,2315.18,XANDER,But you like me better.
2315.18,2315.52,ANYA,Yes.
2315.61,2319.45,ANYA,"And Willow likes you too,"
2315.61,2319.45,ANYA,"but not in a sexy way, cos she's gay."
2320.45,2321.56,ANYA,She's not gonna try to
2321.56,2322.97,WILLOW,"break us up, so it's all OK."
2323.05,2326.84,BUFFY,Their love will last for ever.
2330.57,2333.33,WILLOW,The transposition be complete.
2338.65,2340.1,BUFFY,Where did you send him?
2340.1,2342.49,ANYA,The land of the trolls. He'll like it.
2342.57,2343.54,ANYA,Full of trolls.
2343.54,2345.61,WILLOW,"It's hard to be precise, though."
2345.69,2348.16,WILLOW,Alternate universes don't stay put.
2348.25,2351.17,WILLOW,Trying to send him to a
2348.25,2351.17,WILLOW,specific place is sort of like...
2351.85,2354.89,WILLOW,trying to hit a puppy
2351.85,2354.89,WILLOW,by throwing a live bee at it.
2355.53,2361.02,WILLOW,"Which is a weird image,"
2355.53,2361.02,WILLOW,and you should all just forget it.
2359.09,2362.56,ANYA,It's possible that he's in
2359.09,2362.56,ANYA,the land of perpetual Wednesday
2362.65,2364.03,ANYA,or the crazy melty land.
2364.03,2365.65,TARA,Or the world without shrimp.
2365.73,2367.53,TARA,There's a world without shrimp?
2367.61,2369.44,TARA,I'm allergic.
2369.53,2371.81,WILLOW,He's probably in troll land.
2371.89,2376.49,BUFFY,"I only care that he's not here,"
2371.89,2376.49,BUFFY,and I got this nifty souvenir.
2380.29,2381.36,BUFFY,Oops.
2381.45,2383.73,XANDER,The place is trashed enough anyway.
2383.81,2386.41,BUFFY,But see how well things worked out?
2387.45,2393.77,BUFFY,And look at you guys.
2387.45,2393.77,BUFFY,So good and alive and together.
2394.13,2397.68,BUFFY,"So together and good,"
2398.53,2400.52,BUFFY,and alive.
2401.41,2403.17,BUFFY,"Oh, God."
2403.37,2406.09,BUFFY,I'm just so happy for you.
2411.17,2415.17,GILES,I cringe to think what the place would have
2411.17,2415.17,GILES,looked like if I'd been away for longer.
2415.25,2419.64,BUFFY,Maybe we would have had time to clean it up
2415.25,2419.64,BUFFY,if Willow used some magics to help.
2419.73,2422.77,GILES,"Yes, cos nothing could"
2419.73,2422.77,GILES,possibly go wrong with that.
2422.85,2426.48,JOYCE,"Rupert, I still don't understand  thank you "
2426.57,2432.68,JOYCE,why the other watchers made you go
2426.57,2432.68,JOYCE,to England when they don't know anything.
2433.21,2435.49,GILES,"Well, they don't know it yet."
2435.57,2438.69,GILES,"I mean, they had no record"
2435.57,2438.69,GILES,"of Glory or anyone like her,"
2438.77,2442.61,GILES,but based on the information I've
2438.77,2442.61,GILES,"given them, they're gonna look into it."
