68.71,72.07,GILES,You need to make difficult decisions
68.71,72.07,GILES,regardless of cost.
72.15,73.55,BUFFY,You're stalling me.
73.63,77.31,ROBIN WOOD,l've been searching for you
73.63,77.31,ROBIN WOOD,"for a very, very long time."
77.39,79.43,ROBIN WOOD,Ever since you killed my mother.
80.39,83.54,BUFFY,"You try anything again, he'll kill you."
84.91,88.79,BUFFY,"More importantly, l'll let him."
90.43,93.47,BUFFY,l think you've taught me
90.43,93.47,BUFFY,everything l need to know.
105.55,107.94,GIRL,"Stop! Stop! Stop, please!"
108.67,110.39,GIRL,Get me out of here!
110.47,112.67,MAN,ls someone hurt? What is it?

126.39,128.62,GIRL,Thank you. Thank God you were there.
128.71,131.18,MAN,"Well, let's not give him credit for everything."
131.27,134.26,MAN,l'm funning you.
131.27,134.26,MAN,l don't believe it was a coincidence.
134.35,138.31,MAN,l also don't believe young girls should be
134.35,138.31,MAN,in the woods at night. Should be in bed.
138.39,139.48,GIRL,Wish l was.
139.48,141.86,MAN,l expect you do at that.
141.95,146.79,MAN,"Look, l don't mean to pry,"

188.03,190.15,SHANNON,l'm not sure.
190.23,195.55,CALEB,Do you ever think that maybe they were
190.23,195.55,CALEB,chasin' you because you're a whore?
195.63,196.02,SHANNON,What?
196.02,198.19,CALEB,l know what you're thinkin'.
198.27,202.82,CALEB,Crazy preacher man spouting off at

202.91,205.55,CALEB,That ain't me. l'm not here to lecture you.
205.63,206.8,SHANNON,What's the point?
206.8,209.55,CALEB,My words would just curdle in your ears.
209.63,211.7,CALEB,Wouldn't take in a thing.
212.47,216.7,CALEB,Head filled with so much filth that...

221.71,223.51,CALEB,l'm not!
223.59,226.79,CALEB,"Now, now, now. There's no blame here."
226.87,229.86,CALEB,You were born dirty. Born without a soul.
230.43,236.03,CALEB,Born with that gapin' maw that wants
230.43,236.03,CALEB,"to open up, suck out a man's marrow."
236.11,239.1,CALEB,Makes me puke to think too hard on it.
241.19,243.99,CALEB,"Yeah, that there door's problematical."
244.07,248.7,CALEB,l couldn't recommend steppin' out at this
244.07,248.7,CALEB,speed. You're like as much to tumble some.
248.79,252.31,CALEB,"Of course, there's my boys back there."
248.79,252.31,CALEB,They hate to miss a mark.
252.39,253.38,SHANNON,i>Your</i> boys?
253.47,257.26,CALEB,"They ain't exactly my blueeyed boys,"
253.47,257.26,CALEB,but they're hard workers.
257.35,260.71,CALEB,And they don't truck with Satan.
257.35,260.71,CALEB,That was just me having fun.
260.79,262.78,CALEB,Satan is a little man.
267.43,270.03,CALEB,l don't like backseat drivers.
274.31,277.46,SHANNON,Please... don't hurt me.
277.55,278.58,SHANNON,ls this the part
278.58,280.59,CALEB,where you offer to do anything?

558.99,562.59,FAITH,Guess it doesn't matter
558.99,562.59,FAITH,as long as you got the true Slayer intact.
562.67,565.63,WILLOW,You were in prison.
562.67,565.63,WILLOW,We figured you were safe there.
565.71,567.91,FAITH,"Yeah, that's prison. Safe as a kitten."

602.78,603.19,WILLOW,Wait.
604.11,607.99,WILLOW,Maybe you meeting Buffy alone

608.07,611.38,FAITH,"You told her the sitch, right?"
608.07,611.38,FAITH,She knows l'm coming.

706.67,709.51,BUFFY,"Sorry, Faith. l didn't realise that was you."
709.59,714.54,FAITH,"lt's all right, B."

714.63,715.63,BUFFY,You OK?
715.63,717.78,SPIKE,Yeah. Terrific.
717.87,719.91,FAITH,You're protecting vampires?

719.99,722.79,FAITH,Am l the good slayer now?
722.87,725.39,BUFFY,He's with me. He has a soul.
725.47,726.72,FAITH,He's like Angel?
726.72,726.95,SPIKE,No.
727.03,727.56,BUFFY,Sort of.
727.56,729.07,SPIKE,l'm nothing like Angel.
729.15,732.75,BUFFY,He fights on my side.
729.15,732.75,BUFFY,Which is more than l can say for some of us.

754.75,757.95,SPIKE,"Angel's dull as a table lamp,"

814.31,816.7,GILES,"Well, Faith, we'd better..."
817.79,821.42,GILES,see if we can find someplace
817.79,821.42,GILES,to squeeze you in for the night.
828.39,831.54,SPIKE,Not all that tension was about you.
831.63,835.18,SPIKE,Giles was part of a plan to kill me...
831.63,835.18,SPIKE,for Buffy's own good.
836.35,839.71,FAITH,"Well, that makes me feel better about me,"
839.79,841.99,FAITH,"worse about Giles,"
842.07,844.87,FAITH,kinda shaky about you.
847.91,849.9,CALEB,"Drink of this,"
850.71,852.91,CALEB,for it is my blood.
856.91,860.7,CALEB,"You know, l always loved"
856.91,860.7,CALEB,the story of the Last Supper.
860.79,864.99,CALEB,The body and blood of Christ
860.79,864.99,CALEB,"becomin' rich, red wine."
865.99,868.95,CALEB,"l recall, as a boy, though,"
865.99,868.95,CALEB,l couldn't help but think
869.03,872.87,CALEB,What would happen if you were at
869.03,872.87,CALEB,"the Last Supper, and you ordered the white?"""
872.95,875.94,CALEB,A nice oaky Chardonnay or White Zin.
876.95,880.55,CALEB,Would he make that
876.95,880.55,CALEB,out of his lymph or somehow?
881.59,883.23,CALEB,Never did bring it up.
883.31,888.78,CALEB,Suppose there was a reason
883.31,888.78,CALEB,why l never spent too long in one parish.
890.03,892.47,CALEB,Just lookin' for answers.
892.55,896.94,CALEB,Just lookin' for the Lord
892.55,896.94,CALEB,in the wrong damn places.
898.15,900.83,CALEB,Then you showed me the light.
902.27,904.47,BUFFY/FIRST (O.S.),Do you think l'm God?
906.79,910.79,CALEB,l certainly do not.
906.79,910.79,CALEB,l am beyond concepts like that.
910.87,913.07,BUFFY/FIRST,But you still wear the outfit.
913.15,915.38,CALEB,Man can't turn his back
913.15,915.38,CALEB,on what he come from.
915.47,918.07,CALEB,"Besides, black is slimmin'."
915.47,918.07,CALEB,Everyone knows that.
918.15,920.35,BUFFY/FIRST,How do you like what l'm wearing?
921.87,925.23,CALEB,Just another dirty girl.
921.87,925.23,CALEB,"And since you only dress up in dead folk,"
925.31,929.31,CALEB,l'm guessin' one who's already
925.31,929.31,CALEB,been paid her wage.
930.07,932.51,BUFFY/FIRST,Look hard.
932.59,934.58,BUFFY/FIRST,What do you see?
937.63,939.91,CALEB,Strength.
939.99,944.54,CALEB,And... the loneliness
939.99,944.54,CALEB,that comes with real strength.
944.63,948.02,BUFFY/FIRST,Nothing about my pert and bouncy hairdo?
951.19,952.95,CALEB,You're her.
952.95,954.71,BUFFY/FIRST,The Slayer.
957.03,959.02,CALEB,At long last.
963.91,965.9,CALEB,All this time.
966.59,968.58,CALEB,All the work l've done for you.
968.67,972.51,CALEB,"Blowin' up the Council,"
968.67,972.51,CALEB,"organisin' the Ray Charles brigade,"
972.59,975.06,CALEB,and... stickin' all them splits.
976.23,977.68,CALEB,You never showed me.
977.68,979.35,BUFFY/FIRST,"Well, you've earned it."
980.87,983.99,BUFFY/FIRST,And you'll be meeting her soon. Am l right?
984.07,986.51,CALEB,"Oh, yeah. She'll get the message."
986.59,989.43,BUFFY/FIRST,And what makes you so sure she'll come?
989.43,991.54,CALEB,Curiosity. Woman's first sin.
991.63,995.91,CALEB,l offer her an apple.
991.63,995.91,CALEB,What can she do but take it?
999.31,1001.51,AMANDA,l'll see you soon.

1080.19,1084.15,AMANDA,He studied volcanoes. He was a professor.

1197.37,1197.83,BUFFY,Right.

1216.79,1219.91,BUFFY,Some of these girls
1216.79,1219.91,BUFFY,haven't even been tested in battle.
1219.99,1223.95,ROBIN WOOD,"Then, l guess, maybe you should test them."
1224.83,1229.06,BUFFY,Couldn't l come to work parttime?
1224.83,1229.06,BUFFY,l could make fliers for encounter groups.

1318.67,1321.53,SPIKE,So why aren't you up there... imparting?
1321.53,1323.03,FAITH,That's Buffy's thing.
1323.11,1326.74,FAITH,"Anyway, l just spent a good stretch"
1323.11,1326.74,FAITH,locked away with a mess of females.

1328.92,1329.27,SPIKE,Hm.
1329.35,1332.34,SPIKE,But you waited until Angel

1338.25,1340.95,FAITH,Last one was <i>Glitter.</i>
1341.03,1343.18,FAITH,l guess it couldn't have been worse.

1426.91,1429.06,SPIKE,Failed to mention who was driving her skin.
1429.15,1430.98,FAITH,l may have said a few things.
1431.07,1433.63,SPIKE,You could ride me at a gallop
1431.07,1433.63,SPIKE,"till my knees buckled,"
1433.71,1437.42,SPIKE,squeeze me till l pop like warm champagne.

1532.63,1535.54,SHANNON,Before he... cut me...
1537.03,1540.23,SHANNON,he told me to give the Slayer a message.
1543.19,1544.48,BUFFY,What is it?
1544.48,1545.66,SHANNON,He said...

1606.75,1608.55,CALEB,That right?
1608.63,1612.1,HELPLESS GIRL,l heard you speakin' tonight. Preachin'.
1612.19,1614.31,HELPLESS GIRL,l felt your words go straight to me.
1614.39,1618.67,CALEB,"Well, the truth is like a sword,"
1614.39,1618.67,CALEB,"isn't it, girl? Cuts deep."
1618.75,1619.87,HELPLESS GIRL,Yeah.
1619.95,1622.23,CALEB,The words l use got a power to 'em.
1622.31,1626.27,CALEB,"Power, now. They're notjust words."
1622.31,1626.27,CALEB,They're truth.
1626.91,1628.54,HELPLESS GIRL,They brought me here.
1628.54,1629.79,CALEB,They called you.
1630.95,1633.75,CALEB,Know why? Because you're human.
1635.03,1637.59,CALEB,You got your urges.
1637.67,1640.74,CALEB,A woman's got hers. A man's got his.
1642.31,1645.7,CALEB,Our whole race can be so damnably weak.
1645.79,1649.58,CALEB,"That's why we seek the strength, the power."
1651.15,1655.27,HELPLESS GIRL,lt's not wrong to be drawn
1651.15,1655.27,HELPLESS GIRL,"to the power, is it, preacher?"
1655.35,1658.5,CALEB,"Oh, no, child. lt's not wrong."
1660.67,1662.39,CALEB,i></i>
1665.75,1667.34,CALEB,Just human.
1673.95,1676.94,BUFFY/FIRST,Most people don't like visits
1673.95,1676.94,BUFFY/FIRST,"from their dead, you know."
1677.03,1679.91,CALEB,Heathens. No appreciation for life's pleasures.
1679.99,1681.67,CALEB,Do it again.
1681.67,1683.91,BUFFY/FIRST,l take requests.
1683.99,1686.58,BUFFY/FIRST,"One of those potentials you killed, perhaps?"
1686.58,1687.99,CALEB,No. Save them for later.
1688.07,1690.91,CALEB,l'm in more of an old
1688.07,1690.91,CALEB,memory lane kinda mood.
1691.67,1697.11,CALEB,"Back before l met you, there was a choirgirl"
1691.67,1697.11,CALEB,in Knoxville l gave singing lessons to.
1697.19,1700.87,CALEB,She even screamed on key. Show me her.
1701.71,1705.63,BUFFY/FIRST,All these girls. They followed you willingly.
1705.71,1706.9,BUFFY/FIRST,You tricked them.
1706.9,1708.78,CALEB,l only told them the truth.
1708.87,1712.91,CALEB,"As for following, well..."
1708.87,1712.91,CALEB,that seems to be what they do best.
1713.23,1716.19,BUFFY,We need to arm the girls.
1713.23,1716.19,BUFFY,l wanna be ready when we find him.
1716.27,1719.39,WILLOW,We don't know where we're going.
1716.27,1719.39,WILLOW,We're gonna do some recon.
1719.47,1720.2,BUFFY,You up for it?
1720.2,1721.62,FAITH,Point me where you want me.
1721.71,1727.47,GILES,You're certain about this? You don't know
1721.71,1727.47,GILES,"what this man has of yours, if anything."
1727.55,1730.02,BUFFY,"lt could be a girl,"
1727.55,1730.02,BUFFY,a potential trying to get to us.
1730.11,1732.07,GILES,Could be a stapler.
1732.15,1733.42,BUFFY,l'm going in anyway.
1733.42,1734.38,GILES,With the girls?
1734.47,1738.31,GILES,"Most of whom have yet to be in the field,"
1734.47,1738.31,GILES,let alone a lifeordeath situation.
1738.39,1742.91,BUFFY,lt's time we test them. l'll take the ones that
1738.39,1742.91,BUFFY,have been here longest. The rest can stay.
1742.99,1745.98,SPIKE,Could be that's what he wants.
1742.99,1745.98,SPIKE,The old baitandswitch.
1746.07,1749.59,WILLOW,He lures us away
1746.07,1749.59,WILLOW,and then kills the girls we leave behind.
1750.11,1752.07,WILLOW,l know. That's why l need you
1752.07,1753.63,BUFFY,to stay here with them.
1754.19,1758.74,BUFFY,"You're my most powerful weapon, Will."
1754.19,1758.74,BUFFY,You can keep them safe if anything happens.
1758.83,1762.27,XANDER,"An unknown man breezes into town,"
1758.83,1762.27,XANDER,says he has something of yours.
1762.35,1764.47,XANDER,"Buffy, this has ""trap"" written all over it."
1764.55,1768.07,BUFFY,He won't be expecting a full attack.
1764.55,1768.07,BUFFY,That's why we have to move.
1768.15,1770.19,GILES,We know nothing about this man.
1770.27,1773.39,GILES,We cannot go into battle unprepared.
1770.27,1773.39,GILES,We need more time.
1773.47,1778.26,BUFFY,"Giles, we don't have time."
1773.47,1778.26,BUFFY,And you're not going into battle.
1778.35,1780.91,BUFFY,l need you to stay behind with the others.
1780.99,1783.22,BUFFY,Help the girls who still need a teacher.
1788.91,1792.7,FAITH,"No eyes, but look at him go."
1788.91,1792.7,FAITH,He got sonar or somethin'?
1792.79,1796.47,BUFFY,"Or something, l guess."
1792.79,1796.47,BUFFY,Pretty good when they attack.
1796.55,1798.7,FAITH,They just roam free around town?
1798.79,1804.07,BUFFY,"Normally they show up out of nowhere,"
1798.79,1804.07,BUFFY,"and either stab or get stabbed, then run off."
1804.15,1806.4,BUFFY,Looks like this guy wants to be found.
1806.4,1808.83,FAITH,Lends weight to the "it's a trap" theory.
1808.91,1811.43,BUFFY,l am through waiting for people to attack us.
1811.51,1812.8,BUFFY,l'm with you. Drop me in
1812.8,1814.58,FAITH,"the hornet's nest, what the hell?"
1819.11,1824.55,FAITH,"You got a rough sitch here, trying to turn"
1819.11,1824.55,FAITH,a bunch of little girls into an army.
1824.63,1828.42,BUFFY,"They're potential slayers, just like we were."
1828.51,1831.57,FAITH,Right. Maybe they'll do as good as us.
1831.57,1833.43,BUFFY,They're getting better.
1833.51,1835.98,FAITH,l'll work with them.
1833.51,1835.98,FAITH,Some of 'em seem real eager.
1836.07,1839.78,FAITH,"Fashion disasters, yeah,"
1836.07,1839.78,FAITH,but they're ready to fight.
1839.87,1841.61,BUFFY,Why did you come back?
1841.61,1843.66,FAITH,Willow said you needed me.
1843.75,1846.63,FAITH,Didn't give it a lot of thought. Do you...
1846.71,1849.91,FAITH,Am l getting you want me to be not here?
1849.91,1852.15,BUFFY,"No, that's not what l meant."
1853.59,1858.03,BUFFY,i></i> l'm... glad that you're here. lt's good.
1858.91,1860.24,BUFFY,Thank you.
1860.24,1861.71,FAITH,No problem.
1861.79,1864.86,FAITH,You know me. All about the good deeds.
1866.59,1869.19,BUFFY,Willow said you helped out Angel.
1869.27,1871.47,FAITH,Yeah. He says "Hi."
1872.43,1873.82,BUFFY,Really?
1873.82,1874.82,FAITH,Sure.
1876.35,1878.02,BUFFY,How is he?
1878.02,1879.19,FAITH,Better.
1879.27,1881.63,FAITH,l had to do this magical mindwalk with him.
1881.71,1884.01,BUFFY,You were in Angel's mind?
1884.01,1884.75,FAITH,Buffy...
1886.79,1888.24,FAITH,What is this place?
1888.24,1890.23,BUFFY,"Look, there's more of 'em."
1891.75,1894.79,FAITH,l think we just found our hornet's nest.
1894.79,1896.46,BUFFY,Let's get the cavalry.
1896.79,1900.26,XANDER,"Now remember, we're looking for"
1896.79,1900.26,XANDER,"killing blows only, people."
1900.35,1906.7,XANDER,"So, chest and throat if it's a vampire."
1900.35,1906.7,XANDER,"Stomach, chest and face if it's a bringer."
1906.79,1908.46,RONA,What if it's something else?
1908.46,1909.23,XANDER,Could happen.
1909.31,1912.91,XANDER,Something otherworldly.
1909.31,1912.91,XANDER,Here's a handy rule:
1912.99,1916.83,XANDER,don't go for the tentacles just because
1912.99,1916.83,XANDER,they wave 'em about for attention.
1916.91,1922.31,XANDER,"Go for the centre. Brain, heart, eyes."
1916.91,1922.31,XANDER,Everything's got eyes.
1922.39,1925.43,DAWN,i></i> Except the Bringers.
1922.39,1925.43,DAWN,Except the Bringers.
1925.51,1929.03,MOLLY,l don't want there to be tentacles.
1925.51,1929.03,MOLLY,l'm not good with squishy.
1929.11,1932.31,KENNEDY,l don't care if it's Godzilla.
1929.11,1932.31,KENNEDY,l wanna get in this thing.
1932.39,1936.02,ANDREW,"Godzilla's mostly Tokyobased,"
1932.39,1936.02,ANDREW,so he's probably a noshow.
1936.11,1940.42,AMANDA,"Besides, if Matthew Broderick"
1936.11,1940.42,AMANDA,"can kill Godzilla, how tough is he?"
1940.51,1941.07,ANDREW,Xander!
1941.07,1944.3,XANDER,Matthew Broderick did not kill Godzilla.
1944.39,1947.54,XANDER,"He killed a big, dumb lizard"
1944.39,1947.54,XANDER,that was <i>not</i> the real Godzilla.
1947.63,1950.7,RONA,You people are even crazier than her.
1951.59,1952.56,XANDER,Than who?
1952.56,1953.74,RONA,"Buffy, man."
1954.11,1956.5,RONA,"l mean, taking us right into the bad guy's lair."
1956.59,1959.87,XANDER,"That's where, generally speaking,"
1956.59,1959.87,XANDER,you'd go to find the bad guy.
1959.95,1962.25,XANDER,l don't think you came here to fight plaque.
1962.25,1963.87,RONA,"No, l came here for protection."
1963.95,1967.5,XANDER,"Well, you signed on to fight with..."
1963.95,1967.5,XANDER,"Look, l know..."
1967.59,1970.9,RONA,This plan is trouble.
1967.59,1970.9,RONA,Buffy doesn't care if she puts us in danger.
1970.99,1974.75,XANDER,Let me tell you something about Buffy.
1970.99,1974.75,XANDER,You should all listen to this.
1974.83,1976.79,KENNEDY,We kinda were.
1976.87,1981.55,XANDER,l've been through more battles with Buffy
1976.87,1981.55,XANDER,than you all can ever imagine.
1981.63,1984.7,XANDER,She's stopped everything
1981.63,1984.7,XANDER,that's ever come up against her.
1984.79,1988.67,XANDER,"She's laid down her life, literally,"
1984.79,1988.67,XANDER,to protect the people around her.
1988.75,1991.95,XANDER,"This girl has died two times,"
1988.75,1991.95,XANDER,and she's still standing.
1992.03,1995.79,XANDER,You're scared? That's smart.
1992.03,1995.79,XANDER,You got questions? You should.
1995.87,2001.66,XANDER,"But you doubt her motives, you think Buffy's"
1995.87,2001.66,XANDER,all about the kill? Then take the bus to battle.
2001.75,2004.74,XANDER,"l've seen her heart,"
2001.75,2004.74,XANDER,and this time not literally.
2004.83,2009.46,XANDER,"l'm telling you right now, she cares more"
2004.83,2009.46,XANDER,about your lives than you will ever know.
2009.55,2012.59,XANDER,You gotta trust her.
2012.67,2014.66,XANDER,She's earned it.
2017.91,2021.11,FAITH,Damn! l never knew you were that cool.
2021.19,2023.47,BUFFY,"Well, you always were a little slow."
2023.47,2024.42,FAITH,l get that now.
2024.51,2027.15,BUFFY,All right. Saddle up.
2042.19,2046.87,BUFFY,"OK. Set up a perimeter, guard the door."
2042.19,2046.87,BUFFY,l don't want anything getting in behind us.
2046.95,2050.26,BUFFY,"My team goes in first, we check it out."
2046.95,2050.26,BUFFY,You guys are our safety net.
2050.35,2053.98,BUFFY,"lf it's a trap, we give the signal,"
2050.35,2053.98,BUFFY,"you guys come in, guns ablazing."
2054.07,2055.2,XANDER,What's the signal?
2055.2,2057.59,BUFFY,l'm thinkin' lots and lots of yelling.
2057.67,2058.71,XANDER,Got it.
2059.11,2061.15,BUFFY,Shall we?
2079.15,2080.72,MOLLY,What is this place?
2080.72,2082.94,BUFFY,Looks like an old vineyard.
2083.03,2084.92,KENNEDY,"An evil vineyard, huh?"
2084.92,2086.47,SPIKE,Like Falcon Crest.
2087.23,2090.67,BUFFY,"Stay alert, you guys."
2087.23,2090.67,BUFFY,The Bringers are here somewhere.
2090.75,2092.9,BUFFY,Just need to find out where.
2092.9,2094.59,SPIKE,Shouldn't be too hard.
2134.35,2140.03,CALEB,"Well, now! You girls are just burnin'"
2134.35,2140.03,CALEB,"with righteousness, aren't you?"
2140.11,2142.1,CALEB,"But you think you're blazing like suns,"
2142.19,2146.55,CALEB,when really you're burning like matchsticks
2142.19,2146.55,CALEB,in the face of the darkness.
2146.63,2147.83,BUFFY,You havin' fun?
2147.91,2151.35,BUFFY,l hope my boys haven't worn you out.
2147.91,2151.35,BUFFY,l need you fit for when l purify you.
2151.43,2154.82,BUFFY,"Save the sermon, padre."
2151.43,2154.82,BUFFY,l heard you have something of mine.
2154.91,2157.71,BUFFY,"Well, l do now."
2157.79,2162.23,BUFFY,"You liked my message, did you?"
2157.79,2162.23,BUFFY,l ruined a perfectly good knife on that girl.
2162.31,2165.99,CALEB,Got her soiled blood all over the place.
2162.31,2165.99,CALEB,l may need to get a new truck.
2166.39,2168.59,CALEB,So you're the Slayer.
2168.67,2172.27,CALEB,"The Slayer. The strongest, the fastest,"
2172.35,2176.9,CALEB,the most aflame with that
2172.35,2176.9,CALEB,most precious invention of all mankind 
2176.99,2179.38,CALEB,the notion of goodness.
2181.31,2184.43,CALEB,The Slayer must indeed be powerful.
2188.31,2190.7,CALEB,"So, what else you got?"
2209.07,2210.19,KENNEDY,i></i> Let's go!
2213.83,2215.19,RONA,Kennedy!
2217.99,2221.91,CALEB,"Miss, you have your own problems"
2217.99,2221.91,CALEB,you should be worried about.
2232.55,2234.75,CALEB,"i></i> Oh, good. There's more of you."
2236.87,2238.02,XANDER,Buffy!
2240.91,2243.98,CALEB,"You're the other one, aren't you?"
2240.91,2243.98,CALEB,Your Cain to her Abel.
2244.07,2246.83,CALEB,"No offence meant to Cain, of course."
2253.23,2255.12,FAITH,Never was much for the Good Book.
2255.12,2256.43,CALEB,"Oh, it has its moments."
2256.51,2261.11,CALEB,"Paul had some good stuff,"
2256.51,2261.11,CALEB,but overall l find it a tad complicated.
2261.79,2264.47,CALEB,l like to keep things simple.
2265.59,2267.63,CALEB,"Good folk, bad folk."
2270.31,2272.51,CALEB,"Clean folk, dirty folk."
2275.35,2276.5,MOLLY,No!
2277.07,2278.43,CALEB,Yes.
2278.51,2283.59,BUFFY,"Xander, get them outta here."
2278.51,2283.59,BUFFY,We have to retreat. Do it.
2298.99,2302.11,CALEB,What can l say? l work in mysterious ways.
2306.27,2309.42,CALEB,Also some fairly straightforward ones.
2317.11,2319.39,SPIKE,We are leaving.
2321.43,2323.15,XANDER,Are you OK?
2323.23,2325.22,XANDER,Let's go. Come on.
2326.23,2328.22,XANDER,Let's go! Come on!
2329.91,2332.67,CALEB,You're the one who sees
2329.91,2332.67,CALEB,"everything, aren't you?"
2332.75,2335.22,CALEB,Let's see what we can't do about that.
2335.75,2337.58,BUFFY,Argh!
2339.11,2341.1,BUFFY,Xander!
2341.75,2343.34,BUFFY,Come on.
2355.23,2359.15,CALEB (V.O.),"i> Now, it's a simple story.</i>"
2355.23,2359.15,CALEB (V.O.),i>Stop me if you've heard it.</i>
2359.23,2363.27,CALEB (V.O.),i>l have found and truly believe</i>
2359.23,2363.27,CALEB (V.O.),i>that there is nothing so bad</i>
2363.35,2366.42,CALEB (V.O.),i>it cannot be made better with a story.</i>
2370.43,2373.23,CALEB (V.O.),i>And this one's got a happy endin'.</i>
2375.27,2379.5,,"i>There once was a woman,</i>"
2375.27,2379.5,,"i>and she was foul, like all women,</i>"
2379.59,2382.5,,"i>for Adam's rib was dirty,</i>"
2379.59,2382.5,,"i>just like Adam himseIf,</i>"
2382.59,2384.87,,i>for what was he but human?</i>
2388.87,2393.74,,"i>But this woman, she was filled</i>"
2388.87,2393.74,,"i>with darkness, despair...</i>"
2393.83,2398.91,,i>And why? Because she did not know.</i>
2393.83,2398.91,,i>She could not see.</i>
2398.99,2404.02,,"She didn't know the good news,"
