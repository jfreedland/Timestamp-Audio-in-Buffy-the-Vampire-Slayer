24.53,27.56,D'HOFFRIN,"When you were a vengeance demon,"

27.65,30.8,XANDER,I wish we could just go back

30.89,33.16,ANYA,And I wish you were never born!
33.25,35.74,SPIKE,I'm gonna make you feel it!

415.33,418.92,XANDER,Those kids are lucky having a slayer
415.33,418.92,XANDER,and a friend on campus there for 'em.
421.02,421,XANDER,I hope they appreciate it.
421.09,423.2,XANDER,I know I did.

427.44,428.32,DAWN,i> </i> I thought you hated Sunnydale.
428.41,433.6,XANDER,"Yes, and no, with an emphasis on the yes."
428.41,433.6,XANDER,"But, at least then I was dating."
433.69,435.2,BUFFY,You could be dating now.
435.29,438.14,XANDER,I don't know what's not clicking for me.
438.14,440.2,BUFFY,There's that thing with Anya.
440.29,443.6,XANDER,The leaving her at the altar thing?
443.6,445.02,BUFFY,"Yeah, that one."
443.09,445.34,BUFFY,It's not something you bounce back from.
445.34,445.96,XANDER,Sure it is.
446.05,449.88,XANDER,"She bounced back to a vengeance demon,"
446.05,449.88,XANDER,I bounced back to a dateless nerd.
449.97,451.84,DAWN,Do you guys talk at all?
451.93,454.31,XANDER,I've seen her at the Bronze a couple of times.
454.41,458.19,XANDER,"There's scorned women there,"
454.41,458.19,XANDER,making vengeance wishes on their exes.
458.29,460.2,BUFFY,It's where I go to get my scorn on.
461.21,464.08,DAWN,You need to ease up
461.21,464.08,DAWN,with the whole dating demons thing.
464.17,468.68,BUFFY,"I'm sorry, didn't you have a smoochathon"
464.17,468.68,BUFFY,with Teen Vampire last Halloween?
468.77,473.12,DAWN,"See, this is why I don't want you"
468.77,473.12,DAWN,talking to my friends.
473.45,475.4,PRINCIPAL,We'll sort of feel our way around.
475.49,479.92,PRINCIPAL,"Some students will be sent to you, and"
475.49,479.92,PRINCIPAL,others will start to come in on their own.
482.02,482.85,BUFFY,What if they don't? Should I panic?
482.85,483.32,PRINCIPAL,You'll be surprised.
483.41,487.64,PRINCIPAL,"You're the youngest,"
483.41,487.64,PRINCIPAL,and least stuffy member of this faculty.
487.73,492.24,PRINCIPAL,The students will wanna talk to you.
487.73,492.24,PRINCIPAL,"And when they do, don't evaluate them."
492.33,493.76,PRINCIPAL,Just listen.
493.85,498.44,PRINCIPAL,They need to feel like there's someone
493.85,498.44,PRINCIPAL,around here who actually understands them.
499.21,500.6,BUFFY,Can I give detention?
500.6,501.2,PRINCIPAL,OK by me.
501.29,503.12,PRINCIPAL,Authority can be a wonderful thing.
503.21,506.96,PRINCIPAL,"Remember while you are here to help,"
503.21,506.96,PRINCIPAL,you're not here to be their friend.
507.05,510.92,PRINCIPAL,"Trust me, you open that door,"
507.05,510.92,PRINCIPAL,and these students will eat you alive.
511.45,514.17,BUFFY,"You heard about Principal Flutie, right?"
514.17,514.44,PRINCIPAL,Hmm?
514.53,516.08,BUFFY,Forget it.

516.92,519.92,PRINCIPAL,"OK, then. And, Buffy, relax."
522.02,524.64,PRINCIPAL,There's only three things kids understand:
522.02,524.64,PRINCIPAL,"the boot, the bat, and the bastinada."
526.81,532.6,PRINCIPAL,It's the... it's a bad joke. It's the bastinada.
526.81,532.6,PRINCIPAL,No one ever knows what that thing is.
533.29,538.28,BUFFY,Wooden rod used to slap the soles of the feet
533.29,538.28,BUFFY,"in Turkish prisons, and is a great billy club."
539.25,541.44,PRINCIPAL,I think you're gonna fit in just fine.
542.97,544.96,PRINCIPAL,Is there something else?
545.73,547.72,PRINCIPAL,Yeah. Just one more thing.
548.41,553.2,BUFFY,"I was just curious, you know,"
548.41,553.2,BUFFY,"not that I'm not grateful or anything, but,"
553.29,555.43,BUFFY,I guess I was wondering why I...
555.43,556.36,PRINCIPAL,Have this job?
557.13,561.16,BUFFY,I still haven't finished college.
561.16,562.02,PRINCIPAL,I know.
560.09,561.96,BUFFY,Was it my sparkling personality?
562.05,565.12,BUFFY,Or maybe you enjoyed my work
562.05,565.12,BUFFY,at the Double Meat Palace?
565.21,567.2,PRINCIPAL,I'm a vegetarian.
567.29,570.04,PRINCIPAL,These students need
567.29,570.04,PRINCIPAL,someone who understands them.
570.13,572.69,PRINCIPAL,I need someone
570.13,572.69,PRINCIPAL,who understands these students.
572.77,576.92,PRINCIPAL,Why? Is there something about you
572.77,576.92,PRINCIPAL,that I don't know that maybe I should?
579.02,578.6,BUFFY,Nothing I can think of.
580.97,584.56,PRINCIPAL,"Oh, if you'll excuse me. First catch of the day."
585.29,587.28,PRINCIPAL,I'll be in my office if you need me.
587.28,587.67,BUFFY,Thanks.
587.77,591.52,BUFFY,I'm just gonna have a look around.
587.77,591.52,BUFFY,Get to know the place.

924.33,927.72,XANDER,"I'm thinking here,"
924.33,927.72,XANDER,with good friends and pointy weapons.
927.81,931.34,BUFFY,You said something about quick?
931.34,932.02,SPIKE,I did.
931.13,935.84,SPIKE,"Before I start, and for the record,"
931.13,935.84,SPIKE,"the last you saw me, I was a mess."
935.93,937.92,SPIKE,Out of my head. Admitted.
939.25,941.88,SPIKE,"Last week, living in the school basement..."
942.89,944.48,SPIKE,"Well, you saw me."
947.97,949.36,DAWN,You did?
949.89,952.86,BUFFY,"Just a second. Yes, I saw Spike. I didn't..."
952.86,953.2,DAWN,What?
953.29,954.8,DAWN,You forgot to mention it?
954.8,956.91,BUFFY,Things were insane in the basement.
959.02,960.37,BUFFY,I saved your life. We can discuss this later.
960.37,960.52,DAWN,Sure.
960.61,965.04,XANDER,i> </i> Whatever you want.
960.61,965.04,XANDER,Right. That's the only time you let us in.
965.13,966.2,XANDER,Whenever you want.
966.2,967.56,SPIKE,In fairness to Buffy...
967.65,969.19,XANDER,"Shut up, Spike!"
969.19,971.96,BUFFY,"OK, guys. Give us a second."
980.97,982.9,BUFFY,Do not start by saying you're sorry.
982.9,984.4,SPIKE,I didn't come here to atone.
984.49,985.66,BUFFY,What do you want?
985.66,986.48,SPIKE,To help you.
986.57,987.46,BUFFY,Help me what?
987.46,989.32,SPIKE,I was hoping you'd tell me.
989.41,996.02,SPIKE,You're the Slayer. Connected to the visions.
989.41,996.02,SPIKE,"Long line of worthies, right?"
994.09,997.36,SPIKE,"I'm a guy with his ear to the ground,"
994.09,997.36,SPIKE,but even I can feel it.
997.45,1001.36,SPIKE,Something's coming. I don't know
997.45,1001.36,SPIKE,"what exactly, but something's brewing."
1001.45,1007.12,SPIKE,"And it's so big, ugly and damned, it makes"
1001.45,1007.12,SPIKE,you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces.
1007.21,1010.4,SPIKE,"And if I'm wrong, say so."
1007.21,1010.4,SPIKE,Lovely. No hard feelings.
1010.49,1014.4,SPIKE,I'll go out that door and you can lock it
1010.49,1014.4,SPIKE,behind me with any spell you like.
1014.49,1016.1,SPIKE,"So, am I wrong?"
1016.1,1020.08,BUFFY,"Everything about you is wrong, Spike."
1022.93,1024.92,BUFFY,But something is coming.
1027.61,1029.4,SPIKE,You're gonna need some help.
1029.49,1031.45,BUFFY,When did you become people's champion?
1031.45,1031.92,SPIKE,I didn't.
1034.02,1036.24,SPIKE,"I'm just a guy who can lend a hand,"
1034.02,1036.24,SPIKE,if you'll let me.
1036.33,1038.36,SPIKE,"Ball's in your court, Slayer."
1041.25,1045.52,SPIKE,We're gonna split. Two pairs. This creature
1041.25,1045.52,SPIKE,is burrowing through solid ground.
1045.61,1047.37,SPIKE,A strength and power we don't usually
1047.37,1049.36,BUFFY,"deal with, but we may have to get used to,"
1049.45,1052.04,BUFFY,now the Hellmouth is getting all perky.
1052.04,1053.96,NANCY,Shouldn't we call the police?
1054.05,1055.54,XANDER,And tell them...?
1055.54,1057.56,NANCY,I'll stop interrupting.
1058.29,1061.88,BUFFY,"Take Nancy home. Drive, don't walk,"
1058.29,1061.88,BUFFY,and don't stop till you get there.
1061.97,1065.24,NANCY,Understood.
1061.97,1065.24,NANCY,Is your girlfriend always this commanding?
1065.81,1067.2,XANDER,Who?
1070.02,1069.32,XANDER,Buffy?
1069.93,1071.72,XANDER,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. See..."
1071.81,1077.32,XANDER,"I mean, she's a girl, and she's a friend,"
1071.81,1077.32,XANDER,but she's not my girlfriend.
1077.41,1078.8,DAWN,Xander.
1079.33,1081.68,DAWN,A little drool.
1082.81,1084.88,BUFFY,Spike and I will check out the scene.
1087.02,1088.4,XANDER,"OK, in the biggest way,"
1087.02,1088.4,XANDER,I am not loving this plan.
1089.05,1090.76,XANDER,I'm not loving Spike.
1091.53,1093.46,XANDER,i> </i> He tried to rape you.
1093.46,1095.92,BUFFY,And he failed. I know I can take him.
1098.02,1098.76,BUFFY,"Xander, take Nancy home."
1098.02,1098.76,BUFFY,Spike and I will patrol.
1100.13,1103.64,DAWN,"I'm Command Central,"
1100.13,1103.64,DAWN,so everybody check in with me.
1103.73,1107.43,DAWN,"OK, I'll be here doing my homework,"
1103.73,1107.43,DAWN,but the other one sounded cooler.
1107.81,1109.8,BUFFY,Be safe. Let's go.
1111.41,1113.4,SPIKE,"Rightyo, then."
1114.49,1115.88,DAWN,Spike.
1118.49,1120.48,DAWN,"You sleep, right?"
1120.57,1123.13,DAWN,You. Vampires. You sleep?
1123.21,1125.4,SPIKE,"Yeah. What's your point, niblet?"
1125.49,1130.12,DAWN,"I can't take you in a fight or anything,"
1125.49,1130.12,DAWN,even with a chip in your head.
1130.21,1131.88,DAWN,But you do sleep.
1131.97,1133.96,DAWN,If you hurt my sister at all.
1134.41,1140.02,DAWN,Touch her. You're gonna wake up on fire.
1143.73,1145.49,SPIKE,i> </i> You're awfully quiet.
1145.49,1147.56,BUFFY,i> </i> Wouldn't know what to say.
1147.65,1151.43,SPIKE,Fine with me. I was more halfexpecting
1147.65,1151.43,SPIKE,to get an earful anyway.
1151.53,1154.92,SPIKE,And when exactly did your sister
1151.53,1154.92,SPIKE,get unbelievably scary?
1155.61,1158.04,BUFFY,What are you doing?
1155.61,1158.04,BUFFY,What?
1158.13,1161.72,SPIKE,"I told you once, straight up,"
1158.13,1161.72,SPIKE,"I'm here to help, and that's all."
1162.29,1164.17,SPIKE,Think this here's our spot?
1164.17,1165.28,BUFFY,How'd you guess?
1166.17,1168.59,SPIKE,I don't fancy sticking my head in that.
1168.59,1171.32,BUFFY,"If something bites it off, that'd be a clue."
1182.13,1184.16,BUFFY,So what happened to you?
1184.16,1185.52,SPIKE,"When you saw me,"
1185.61,1189.6,SPIKE,"those ghostly types in the school basement,"
1185.61,1189.6,SPIKE,they were in my head.
1189.69,1192.28,SPIKE,"Made me flatout, bugshagging crazy."
1193.13,1196.72,SPIKE,"And I'm not bragging about it,"
1193.13,1196.72,SPIKE,but they were stronger than I was.
1196.81,1199.8,SPIKE,"Made me see things, do things."
1202.05,1205.26,SPIKE,Why did you not tell anyone you saw me?
1205.26,1207.24,BUFFY,I don't know. I guess...
1208.57,1211.08,BUFFY,I was partly hoping you were a mirage.
1211.08,1212.4,SPIKE,Sorry to disappoint.
1213.61,1214.63,BUFFY,Not your fault.
1214.63,1216.4,SPIKE,"Hold the torch, would you?"
1227.65,1229.64,BUFFY,"Look, this..."
1229.73,1233.84,BUFFY,Us working together is not a way
1229.73,1233.84,BUFFY,"to get back together, if that's what you want."
1233.93,1235.72,BUFFY,It's not.
1237.13,1241.2,SPIKE,"Look, I can't blame you for being all skittish."
1237.13,1241.2,SPIKE,Skittish?
1241.29,1243.48,BUFFY,That's not a word I would use for it.
1244.41,1246,BUFFY,You tried to rape me.
1247.45,1249.97,BUFFY,I don't have the words.
1249.97,1251.4,SPIKE,Neither do I.
1252.45,1255.44,SPIKE,I can't say sorry. Can't use forgive me.
1257.05,1260.56,SPIKE,"All I can say is, Buffy, I've changed."
1261.05,1262.26,BUFFY,I believe you.
1262.26,1264.24,SPIKE,"Well, that's something."
1264.33,1267.04,BUFFY,I just don't know what you've changed into.
1268.05,1271.96,BUFFY,"You come back to town,"
1268.05,1271.96,BUFFY,you make with the big surprises. Twice.
1272.05,1276.2,BUFFY,"I don't know what your game is,"
1272.05,1276.2,BUFFY,but I know you're not telling me something.
1276.29,1278.88,SPIKE,You're right. There is.
1281.21,1284.99,SPIKE,"But we're not best friends any more,"
1281.21,1284.99,SPIKE,so too bad for me. I'm not sharing.
1285.81,1289.04,SPIKE,We've been through things.
1285.81,1289.04,SPIKE,The end of the world and back.
1289.13,1293.12,SPIKE,"I can be useful cos, honestly,"
1289.13,1293.12,SPIKE,I've got nothing better to do.
1293.21,1295.04,SPIKE,Make use of me if you want.
1296.89,1302.44,SPIKE,And there's nothing here. Just a bit of slime.
1296.89,1302.44,SPIKE,Mounds of displaced dirt and such.
1302.53,1304.91,SPIKE,"Whatever our beastie is, he's gone."
1323.13,1326.12,NANCY,I still can't believe that all this is happening.
1326.21,1330.56,NANCY,"Even with this town's reputation for,"
1326.21,1330.56,NANCY,"you know, unexplained weirdness."
1330.65,1334.19,XANDER,"Right. Sunnydale: come for the food,"
1330.65,1334.19,XANDER,stay for the dismemberment.
1334.61,1336.91,NANCY,There's good food?
1337.93,1341.16,NANCY,"Well, thanks. <i></i>"
1342.21,1345.52,NANCY,That's a couple levels of lameness
1342.21,1345.52,NANCY,"right there, me saying,"

1345.61,1348.52,NANCY,you've done for me tonight.
1348.61,1351.88,XANDER,"You could slip me a twenty,"
1348.61,1351.88,XANDER,but then I'd have to act offended.
1351.97,1354.12,NANCY,Got it. So...
1355.37,1359.07,NANCY,"D'you think I might, instead,"
1355.37,1359.07,NANCY,give you a call sometime?
1359.17,1359.84,XANDER,To check in?
1359.84,1361.68,NANCY,"No, actually, I'm hitting on you."
1361.77,1363.76,XANDER,Even better. I'm very listed.
1363.85,1368.28,NANCY,"And I'm really pushy,"
1363.85,1368.28,NANCY,"so that works out well, then."
1373.02,1373.14,NANCY,Good night.

1405.81,1406.8,NANCY,I just...
1407.77,1410.33,XANDER,Dumb question.
1407.77,1410.33,XANDER,Are you injured? Are you hurt?
1411.49,1413.84,NANCY,I don't think so. I just...
1413.93,1416.52,NANCY,I don't think that I can take any more of this.
1418.81,1423.72,XANDER,Two attacks in the same night.
1418.81,1423.72,XANDER,I'm starting to think it's not coincidence.
1423.81,1426.6,NANCY,"Oh, sure. Why not?"
1423.81,1426.6,NANCY,A monster trying to kill me.
1426.69,1430.72,NANCY,It's just the thing that was missing
1426.69,1430.72,NANCY,to make my life absolutely perfect.
1430.81,1433.6,NANCY,Urgh! Ronnie would love this. Boy!
1436.02,1435.4,XANDER,Right.

1439.34,1439.79,NANCY,Oh.
1440.81,1445.72,NANCY,Only my psycho exboyfriend that I've been
1440.81,1445.72,NANCY,trying to get rid of for the past few weeks.
1445.81,1448.53,NANCY,I almost prefer the monster.

1487.02,1486.52,XANDER,Yes.
1486.61,1492,NANCY,And you get so tired of feeling helpless
1486.61,1492,NANCY,that all you can do is wish that it would stop?
1493.85,1495.32,XANDER,Wish?
1495.81,1499.8,YOUNG WOMAN,"And it's not the fact that he cheated,"
1495.81,1499.8,YOUNG WOMAN,"it's the way he cheated, you know?"
1499.89,1503.04,YOUNG WOMAN,"I mean, we could have talked."

1530.05,1534.64,YOUNG WOMAN,He should just...

1579.41,1582.95,ANYA,I didn't think you'd go all narc on me.
1583.05,1584.86,BUFFY,You wished your ex was a worm?
1584.86,1586.12,NANCY,We were just talking.
1587.25,1589.71,XANDER,Anya has a way of making things happen.
