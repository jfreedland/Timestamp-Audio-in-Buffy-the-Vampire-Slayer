22.02,24.61,,Gotcha.
22.02,24.61,,Right in the heart.
25.15,27.19,Buffy,Satisfied?
27.65,30.2,Angel,I'm not sure that's the word.
32.03,33.53,Buffy,OK.
33.91,35.73,Buffy,I didn't mean satisfied like...
35.73,37.2,Angel,"No, I wasn't trying to..."
37.66,41.88,Buffy,Cos we're not having satisfaction
37.66,41.88,Buffy,in the personal sense.
42.67,43.92,Angel,Of course.
43.92,45.66,Buffy,I should go. Giles is...
45.66,48.05,Angel,"Is waiting for you. Yeah, I know."
48.92,51.47,Buffy,Thanks. For the workout.
52.68,54.51,Angel,Am I going to see you this weekend?
54.55,56.68,Angel,You... you... you probably have plans.
57.06,60.89,Buffy,"Right. Birthday. Actually, I do have a thing."
62.69,64.61,Angel,A thing. Date?
65.19,67.19,Buffy,Nice attempt at casual.
68.32,70.2,Buffy,"Actually, I do have a date."
70.2,72.36,Angel,Older man. Very handsome.
73.32,75.2,Buffy,Likes it when I call him "Daddy".
75.2,78.08,Angel,"Your father. It is your father, right?"
80.21,82.87,Buffy,He's taking me to the ice show.
80.21,82.87,Buffy,It should be big fun.
83.96,86.42,Buffy,I could use a little fun.
87.09,88.84,Giles,This one?
89.59,91.05,Buffy,Amethyst.
91.05,92.51,Giles,Used for?
92.72,94.3,Buffy,Breath mints?
94.59,98.56,Giles,"Charm bags, money spells,"
94.59,98.56,Giles,and for cleansing one's aura.
98.97,99.93,Buffy,OK. How do you know
99.93,101.1,Giles,if one's aura is dirty?
101.48,104.06,Buffy,Does somebody come by
101.48,104.06,Buffy,and write "wash me" on it?
104.6,107.9,Giles,"Buffy, I'm aware of your distaste"
104.6,107.9,Giles,"at studying vibratory stones,"
108.36,112.45,Giles,"but since it is part of your training,"
108.36,112.45,Giles,I would appreciate your glibfree attention.
113.36,116.62,Buffy,"Sorry. It's just, with Faith on one"
113.36,116.62,Buffy,"of her unannounced walkabouts,"
117.12,118.95,Buffy,somebody should be patrolling.
118.99,121.96,Giles,Faith is not interested in proper
118.99,121.96,Giles,training. So I must rely on you.
122.75,124.62,Buffy,I hate being the good one.
124.62,127.5,Giles,"As for patrolling, you'll be there soon."
128.38,129.88,Buffy,Why so anxious?
130.26,134.8,Buffy,I guess that I just have some energy to burn.
135.26,137.85,Giles,"Well, in due time. But, for the present,"
139.01,143.81,Giles,"if it's not entirely beyond your capabilities,"
139.01,143.81,Giles,try to concentrate.
154.03,155.68,Buffy,That looked funny. Do it again.
155.68,156.91,Vampire,I'll kill you for that.
157.16,160.45,Buffy,For that? What were you
157.16,160.45,Buffy,trying to kill me for before?
164.04,165.67,Buffy,"OK, so here's the deal..."
184.06,186.81,Vampire,Let me know if I'm not doing this right.
276.28,278.61,Giles,A bit early in the day.
278.78,280.78,Buffy,"Giles, something's wrong."
281.28,283.12,Giles,Wrong?
286.91,289.37,Giles,Perhaps you shouldn't
289.41,290.37,Giles,do that any more.
290.67,294.21,Buffy,"On top of that, I got a bad case of"
290.67,294.21,Buffy,the dizzies and almost let a vamp stake me.
295.05,297.51,Buffy,With my own stake.
300.05,301.3,Buffy,I'm way off my game.
301.3,305.72,Buffy,My game's left the county. It's in
301.3,305.72,Buffy,"Cuernavaca. Giles, what's going on here?"
306.93,310.14,Giles,Perhaps you've got
306.93,310.14,Giles,a bad flu bug or something.
310.69,313.36,Buffy,"No. No, not sick. I can't get sick."
313.81,315.77,Buffy,My dad's coming to take me to the ice show.
316.32,318.74,Buffy,We do it every year for my birthday.
319.44,321.32,Buffy,"If I cancel, it's gonna break his heart."
321.32,323.87,Giles,"Well, just take it easy for 48 hours."
325.08,328.12,Giles,Forgo patrolling until you feel yourself again.
328.83,332.29,Buffy,"No. No, I just need to spend"
328.83,332.29,Buffy,a little more time training.
335.71,336.6,Buffy,I'm gone.
336.6,337.59,Giles,Thank you.
337.59,340.67,Xander,An ice show? A show performed on ice.
341.34,342.44,Xander,How old are we again?
342.44,344.64,Willow,I went to Snoopy on Ice when I was little.
345.1,348.93,Willow,My dad took me backstage and I got
345.1,348.93,Willow,so scared I threw up on Woodstock.
350.1,352.85,Buffy,"I know you think it's a big,"
350.1,352.85,Buffy,"dumb, girly thing, but it's not."
353.23,355.4,Buffy,A lot of the skaters
353.23,355.4,Buffy,are Olympic medal winners.
355.73,357.32,Oz,Dad buys me cotton candy and
357.32,359.53,Buffy,one of those souvenir programmes and...
360.11,363.11,Buffy,"OK, it's a big, dumb, girly thing, but I love it."
363.86,367.78,Oz,It's not so girly. Ice is cool.
363.86,367.78,Oz,"It's water, but it's not."
369.49,371.75,Willow,It's sweet you and your dad have a tradition.
372,374.46,Willow,Especially now that
372,374.46,Willow,he's not around so much.
375.13,377.79,Willow,Ixnay on the caramel corn though
375.13,377.79,Willow,if you go backstage.
378.25,383.13,Xander,But we're still talking party? Some of us still
378.25,383.13,Xander,love to relish celebrating the birth of the Buff.
383.88,389.02,Buffy,I don't know. It might be time to put
383.88,389.02,Buffy,a moratorium on parties in my honour.
389.02,390.1,Buffy,They tend to go badly.
389.02,390.1,Buffy,"Monsters crash, people die..."
390.77,395.9,Willow,"But 18's a big one, Buffy. I mean,"
390.77,395.9,Willow,you can vote now. You can be drafted.
397.02,399.52,Willow,You can vote not to be drafted.
399.52,402.11,Buffy,I think I'll celebrate this one
399.52,402.11,Buffy,with quiet reflection.
402.65,406.66,Xander,Where's it written that quiet reflection
402.65,406.66,Xander,can't be combined with cake and funny hats?
416.29,420.02,Joyce,Buffy?
418.17,420.92,Buffy,Present. Present.
421.3,424.09,Joyce,They're not. They're from your father.
424.42,428.6,Joyce,His quarterly projections are unravelling
424.42,428.6,Joyce,and he can't afford to take off.
430.06,434.06,Joyce,He promises to make it up to you.
430.06,434.06,Joyce,It's all right there in the letter.
435.69,439.52,Joyce,"If you want, I could ask somebody"
435.69,439.52,Joyce,to cover for me at the gallery.
440.07,441.9,Joyce,"I mean, if you want me to take you."
442.57,444.78,Buffy,"No. No, that's not necessary."
445.7,449.57,Buffy,I was just thinking it might be
445.7,449.57,Buffy,nice to have a quiet birthday.
478.85,480.76,Quentin,"How much longer, Hobson?"
480.76,482.9,Hobson,"Five, maybe six hours, sir."
484.48,487.36,Quentin,"Once you've finished,"
484.48,487.36,Quentin,you and Blair can get some rest.
487.61,489.82,Quentin,But sleep in shifts.
497.62,500.08,Quentin,We're getting very close.
500.13,502.96,Quentin,The Slayer's preparation is nearly complete.
505.21,510.72,Buffy,"You know, it's not just cartoon characters."
505.21,510.72,Buffy,They do pieces from operas and ballets.
512.1,515.18,Buffy,Brian Boitano doing Carmen is a life changer.
516.47,521.1,Buffy,He doesn't actually play Carmen.
516.47,521.1,Buffy,But a lot of sophisticated people go.
521.48,525.69,Giles,"Yes, I think we should start"
521.48,525.69,Giles,with the grounding crystal again.
527.11,530.16,Buffy,It's usually something
527.11,530.16,Buffy,that families do together.
530.86,533.53,Giles,Look very carefully for
530.86,533.53,Giles,the tiny flaw at its core.
533.99,538.71,Buffy,"If someone were free, they'd take"
533.99,538.71,Buffy,"their daughters, or their student,"
539,540.5,Buffy,or their slayer.
541.5,544.38,Giles,"Yes, but, Buffy, I think"
541.5,544.38,Giles,we should concentrate now.
545.25,547.92,Giles,"Now, look for the flaw at its centre."
565.27,567.11,Giles,Buffy?
623.46,625.38,Buffy,I'm sorry. Did I zone out on you?
625.96,627.88,Buffy,I'm just... I'm nursing that flu bug.
628.46,630.46,Giles,Best take care of that.
630.96,632.4,Giles,Perhaps we should...
632.4,633.55,Buffy,Call it a night.
634.09,635.93,Buffy,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
636.59,638.43,Buffy,Thanks.
643.48,645.31,Giles,Good night.
651.4,652.99,Buffy,How's it going with Amy the rat?
653.28,656.53,Willow,Good. She loves her exercise wheel.
653.28,656.53,Willow,"She runs around, her nose wiggles..."
657.03,660.45,Buffy,"I meant, how's it going changing"
657.03,660.45,Buffy,her back into a human being?
660.79,664.08,Willow,Still working on it.
660.79,664.08,Willow,But I just got her the cutest little bell...
664.54,667.71,Boy,You don't do that to me.
664.54,667.71,Boy,I waited for you at the Bronze all night.
668.92,669.96,Cordelia,And the big deal is...?
670.17,673.51,Boy,You made me look like some
670.17,673.51,Boy,kind of dork in front of my posse.
673.92,676.59,Boy,"First of all, ""posse""? Pass√©."
677.05,681.22,Cordelia,"Second, anyone with a teaspoon of brains"
677.05,681.22,Cordelia,knows not to take my flirting seriously.
682.06,683.03,Cordelia,Especially with my
683.03,684.43,Boy,extenuating circumstances.
684.56,686.25,Boy,What circumstances?
686.25,688.02,Cordelia,Rebound. Look it up.
688.31,690.51,Boy,"Hey, I'm not through here."
690.51,691.86,Buffy,I beg to differ.
695.82,697.76,Cordelia,What is wrong with you?
697.76,699.53,Boy,The chick started it.
701.45,703.45,Willow,Are you OK?
710.21,714.26,Buffy,"OK, I just got swatted down by some"
710.21,714.26,Buffy,no neck and rescued by Cordelia.
714.59,715.55,Buffy,What is happening?
715.55,716.84,Giles,It will sort itself out.
717.09,720.8,Buffy,"Look, you're not getting the big picture"
717.09,720.8,Buffy,here. I have no strength.
722.1,724.39,Buffy,I have no coordination.
724.6,726.75,Buffy,I throw knives like...
726.75,727.44,Giles,A girl?
730.23,732.9,Buffy,Like I'm not the Slayer.
733.36,735.4,Giles,"Look, Buffy, I... I assure you,"
735.86,740.87,Giles,"given time, we'll get to the bottom"
735.86,740.87,Giles,of whatever's causing this anomaly.
742.12,744.11,Buffy,Promise me?
744.11,744.83,Giles,Yes.
745.25,747.58,Giles,I give you my word.
749,750.67,Quentin,"You're having doubts,"
750.88,754.21,Quentin,Cruciamentum is not easy.
750.88,754.21,Quentin,For Slayer or Watcher.
755.26,757.92,Quentin,But it's been done this way
755.26,757.92,Quentin,for a dozen centuries.
758.38,759.97,Quentin,Whenever a slayer turns 18.
759.97,762.1,Giles,It's a timehonoured rite of passage.
762.76,765.35,Giles,It's an archaic exercise in cruelty.
766.52,771.06,Giles,"To lock her in this tomb,"
766.52,771.06,Giles,"weakened, defenceless,"
774.02,776.32,Giles,and to unleash that on her.
780.91,783,Giles,If any one of the Council still had contact
783,784.41,Quentin,"with a slayer they would see,"
785.29,786.95,Giles,but I'm the one in the thick of it.
787.16,789.62,Quentin,You can't make this decision 
787.16,789.62,Quentin,you're too close.
789.66,790.69,Giles,That's not true.
790.69,793.13,Quentin,A slayer is not just physical prowess.
794.04,796.38,Quentin,"She must have cunning, imagination."
797.17,800.13,Quentin,A confidence derived from selfreliance.
800.93,804.64,Quentin,"And believe me, once this is all over,"
800.93,804.64,Quentin,your Buffy will be stronger for it.
805.31,807.81,Giles,Or she'll be dead for it.
817.82,822.82,Quentin,"Rupert, if this girl is everything you say,"
817.82,822.82,Quentin,then you've nothing to worry about.
828.45,832.54,Hobson,"Sir, if you can spare me for a short spell,"
828.45,832.54,Hobson,I'll need to make a run to the hardware store.
836.59,838.71,Quentin,Take care of it.
859.11,861.28,Quentin,"Come along, come along."
871,873.37,Blair,Kralik. Your pills.
874.12,876.13,Blair,Open your mouth.
896.65,898.61,Quentin,That's enough. Close it up.
906.41,908.49,Willow,A curse on slayers."
909.53,912.41,Willow,"Oh, no, wait. It's ""lawyers""."
912.66,916.75,Xander,Maybe we're on the wrong track with
912.66,916.75,Xander,"the whole spell, curse and whammy thing."
917.04,920.92,Xander,Maybe what we should be looking for
917.04,920.92,Xander,is something like slayer kryptonite.
922.05,924.13,Oz,Faulty metaphor. Kryptonite kills.
924.55,927.68,Oz,You assume I meant green kryptonite.
924.55,927.68,Oz,"I was referring to red kryptonite,"
927.68,929.89,Xander,which drains Superman of his powers.
930.81,933.1,Oz,"Wrong, gold kryptonite's the powersucker."
933.31,935.69,Oz,The red kryptonite mutates Superman into...
935.81,937.85,Buffy,Guys? Reality?
940.82,946.03,Willow,"Buffy, I know you are definitely, without"
940.82,946.03,Willow,"a doubt, gonna get your powers back."
947.7,948.95,Buffy,"Thanks, Will."
948.95,951.16,Willow,But what if you don't?
951.45,953.29,Buffy,OK.
955.21,958.42,Buffy,"If I don't get my powers back, then I don't."
959.58,961.42,Willow,I'll deal.
962.09,964.83,Buffy,And there's a whole lot of good sides to it.
964.83,967.26,Willow,"Actually, this could open up so many..."
968.34,970.13,Buffy,Did you find anything?
970.13,971.1,Giles,No. Not yet.
990.24,992.41,Hobson,It's your shift.
1003.38,1004.73,Kralik,Pills.
1004.73,1005.63,Blair,Yes.
1021.52,1023.19,Blair,It's coming.
1032.16,1034.28,Kralik,Pills.
1043.42,1044.75,Blair,Take them.
1044.75,1045.55,Kralik,Pills.
1045.92,1048.38,Blair,They're right in front of you.
1045.92,1048.38,Blair,Where?
1049.05,1049.53,Blair,Here.
1049.53,1053.3,Kralik,I can't see... can't... can't reach it.
1060.31,1061.98,Blair,Open your eyes.
1069.07,1070.82,Kralik,Everything's OK now.
1094.02,1094.43,Buffy,Thank you. It's beautiful.
1095.14,1096.35,Angel,You really like it?
1096.35,1097.31,Buffy,Of course I do.
1100.14,1102.73,Buffy,It's sweet and thoughtful and
1103.9,1108.65,Buffy,"full of neat words to learn and say,"
1103.9,1108.65,Buffy,like "wilt" and "henceforth".
1109.53,1114.16,Angel,Then why did you seem more excited last
1109.53,1114.16,Angel,year when you got a severed arm in a box?
1115.78,1118.24,Buffy,I'm sorry.
1118.28,1123.08,Buffy,It's just suddenly there's this chance
1118.28,1123.08,Buffy,"that my calling's a wrong number, and"
1123.92,1125.89,Buffy,it's freaking me out a little.
1125.89,1127.34,Angel,That's understandable.
1128.29,1130.46,Buffy,"Angel, what if I have lost my power?"
1130.8,1133.38,Angel,You've lived a long time without it.
1130.8,1133.38,Angel,You can do it again.
1133.93,1135.76,Buffy,I guess.
1136.43,1138.56,Buffy,But what if I can't?
1138.93,1142.39,Buffy,I've seen too much. I know
1138.93,1142.39,Buffy,what goes bump in the night.
1143.31,1145.06,Buffy,Not being able to fight it...
1145.81,1149.15,Buffy,"What if I just hide under my bed,"
1145.81,1149.15,Buffy,all scared and helpless?
1149.57,1151.4,Buffy,"Or what if I become pathetic,"
1151.44,1153.39,Buffy,"hanging out at the old slayers' home,"
1153.39,1154.86,Angel,"talking about my glory days,"
1155.82,1157.99,Angel,showing them the stake I had bronzed?
1158.32,1162.41,Angel,"Buffy, you could never be helpless"
1158.32,1162.41,Angel,"or boring, not even if you tried."
1164.58,1167.08,Buffy,Don't be so sure.
1169.59,1175.84,Buffy,"Before I was the Slayer, I was..."
1169.59,1175.84,Buffy,"well, I don't want to say shallow, but"
1177.72,1181.6,Buffy,"let's say a certain person, who will"
1177.72,1181.6,Buffy,remain nameless  we'll call her Spordelia 
1182.1,1185.19,Buffy,looked like a classical
1182.1,1185.19,Buffy,philosopher next to me.
1187.1,1191.86,Angel,"Angel, if I'm not the Slayer,"
1187.1,1191.86,Angel,what do I do? What do I have to offer?
1193.99,1196.03,Angel,Why would you like me?
1197.74,1200.53,Angel,I saw you before you became the Slayer.
1202.12,1202.64,Buffy,What?
1202.64,1206.37,Angel,"I watched you, and I saw you called."
1211.02,1212.17,Angel,"It was a bright afternoon,"
1211.02,1212.17,Angel,out in front of your school.
1212.75,1217.02,Angel,"You walked down the steps,"
1217.13,1219.14,Angel,and... and I loved you.
1220.89,1223.01,Buffy,Why?
1223.39,1225.31,Angel,Because I could see your heart.
1230.27,1232.69,Angel,"You held it before you for everyone to see,"
1233.4,1236.7,Angel,and I worried that it
1233.4,1236.7,Angel,would be bruised or torn.
1237.15,1242.83,Angel,And more than anything in my life I wanted
1237.15,1242.83,Angel,"to keep it safe, to warm it with my own."
1250.92,1252.88,Buffy,That's beautiful.
1255.92,1258.34,Buffy,"Or, taken literally, incredibly gross."
1259.68,1261.68,Angel,I was just thinking that too.
1280.95,1285.54,Kralik,You're up. I was afraid I'd drained
1280.95,1285.54,Kralik,you too much. I do that sometimes.
1289.71,1295.05,Kralik,Ever have a tune you can't get out of your
1289.71,1295.05,Kralik,"head, that keeps playing over and over?"
1296.59,1301.02,Kralik,It drives me nuts.
1305.35,1307.18,Kralik,Thank you.
1309.73,1311.9,Kralik,That is much better.
1324.12,1325.99,Kralik,"It's a game, you know."
1325.99,1331.12,Kralik,"We're not going to play by their rules,"
1325.99,1331.12,Kralik,but that doesn't mean we're not gonna play.
1332.87,1337.13,Kralik,Why don't you call your friend in here?
1332.87,1337.13,Kralik,We'll discuss it over dinner.
1348.64,1350.48,Giles,Quentin?
1374.29,1376.13,Giles,Hello?
1378.67,1380.84,Giles,Quentin? Hob...?
1453.62,1455.08,Giles,She's cute.
1453.62,1455.08,Giles,Yeah.
1455.5,1457.5,Man,Let's find out.
1459.25,1461.06,Man,"Hey, sweet girl. How much for"
1461.06,1463.05,Buffy,a lap dance for me and my buddy?
1473.64,1477.85,Buffy,"Walk me home, Angel? No, I'm fine."
1473.64,1477.85,Buffy,I can take care of myself."
1481.15,1483.4,Buffy,Hummers. Big turnoff.
1484.9,1487.57,Buffy,I like guys that can remember the lyrics.
1488.66,1492.12,Kralik,"You know, I wish I could,"
1488.66,1492.12,Kralik,but my mind just isn't what it used to be.
1492.41,1493.22,Buffy,Let me go.
1493.22,1495.16,Kralik,You didn't say "please".
1495.54,1497.75,Buffy,"Help me, somebody. Please."
1499.92,1502.79,Buffy,"Help me, please. Help me, please."
1504.3,1506.38,Buffy,"Somebody, please help me."
1521.81,1523.15,Buffy,No.
1528.7,1531.2,Buffy,Stop. Please. I need help.
1532.45,1533.87,Buffy,Please stop.
1541.21,1542.29,Giles,Hurry.
1558.1,1561.98,Buffy,"When I hit him, it felt like my arm"
1558.1,1561.98,Buffy,"was broken, it hurt so much."
1563.73,1568.44,Buffy,I can't be just a person.
1563.73,1568.44,Buffy,I can't be helpless like that.
1568.74,1573.03,Buffy,"Giles, please. We have to"
1568.74,1573.03,Buffy,figure out what's happening to me.
1580,1588.02,Giles,It's an organic compound
1580,1588.02,Giles,of muscle relaxants and adrenal suppressors.
1590.63,1592.59,Giles,The effect is temporary.
1593.76,1596.3,Giles,You'll be yourself again in a few days.
1600.02,1601.94,Buffy,You?
1603.77,1605.77,Giles,"It's a test, Buffy."
1607.52,1612.49,Giles,It's given to the Slayer once she...
1607.52,1612.49,Giles,if she reaches her 18th birthday.
1614.41,1617.78,Giles,"The Slayer is disabled,"
1618.79,1623.92,Giles,and then entrapped with a vampire whom
1618.79,1623.92,Giles,she must defeat in order to pass the test.
1627.54,1631.26,Buffy,The vampire you were to face has escaped.
1633.8,1635.84,Giles,His name is Zackary Kralik.
1636.93,1641.39,Giles,"As a mortal, he murdered and tortured"
1636.93,1641.39,Giles,more than a dozen women
1641.93,1645.4,Giles,before he was committed to
1641.93,1645.4,Giles,an asylum for the criminally insane.
1646.31,1648.31,Giles,When a vamp...
1648.82,1650.57,Buffy,You bastard.
1650.69,1653.28,Buffy,All this time you saw
1650.69,1653.28,Buffy,what it was doing to me.
1653.82,1655.95,Buffy,All this time and you didn't say a word.
1656.32,1657.97,Giles,I wanted to.
1657.97,1658.66,Buffy,Liar.
1658.83,1662.29,Giles,"In matters of tradition and protocol,"
1658.83,1662.29,Giles,I must answer to the Council.
1663.2,1666.54,Giles,My role in this was very specific.
1666.96,1673.02,Giles,I was to administer the injections and to
1666.96,1673.02,Giles,direct you to the old boarding house
1671.34,1672.39,Giles,on Prescott Lane.
1672.39,1674.17,Buffy,I can't... I can't hear this.
1675.09,1677.34,Giles,"Buffy, please."
1680.1,1682.43,Buffy,Who are you?
1682.6,1684.43,Buffy,How could you do this to me?
1684.48,1686.77,Giles,"I am deeply sorry,"
1684.48,1686.77,Giles,and you have to understand...
1687.6,1689.94,Buffy,"If you touch me, I'll kill you."
1692.61,1696.99,Giles,You have to listen to me. Because
1692.61,1696.99,Giles,"I've told you this, the test is invalidated."
1698.87,1700.7,Giles,"You will be safe now, I promise."
1700.74,1703.95,Giles,Whatever I have to do to deal with Kralik
1704.5,1706.02,Giles,and to win back your trust...
1706.02,1707.33,Buffy,You stuck a needle in me.
1707.62,1709.5,Buffy,You poisoned me.
1712.63,1714.55,Cordelia,What's going on?
1715.13,1718.59,Cordelia,"Oh, God. Is the world ending?"
1715.13,1718.59,Cordelia,"I have to research a paper on Bosnia,"
1719.51,1722.64,Cordelia,"but if the world's ending,"
1719.51,1722.64,Cordelia,I'm not gonna bother.
1725.14,1728.23,Giles,"You can't walk home alone,"
1725.14,1728.23,Giles,Buffy. It isn't safe.
1732.02,1733.82,Buffy,I don't know you.
1735.78,1738.45,Cordelia,Did something take her memory? He's Giles.
1739.53,1741.03,Buffy,Giles.
1742.03,1744.41,Cordelia,He hangs out here a lot.
1745.16,1748.29,Buffy,"Cordelia, could you please drive me home?"
1748.92,1750.96,Cordelia,Of course.
1752.04,1755.21,Cordelia,"But if the world doesn't end,"
1752.04,1755.21,Cordelia,I'm gonna need a note.
1778.32,1779.78,Joyce,Buffy?
1787.08,1788.2,Kralik,Mother.
1836.09,1837.92,Kralik,Mother.
1840.47,1842.72,Kralik,May I call you Mother?
1843.59,1847.56,Kralik,My own mother was a person
1843.59,1847.56,Kralik,"with no selfrespect of her own,"
1848.6,1850.77,Kralik,so she tried to take mine.
1853.6,1858.69,Kralik,"Ten years old, she had the scissors  you"
1853.6,1858.69,Kralik,wouldn't believe what she did with those.
1860.49,1862.53,Kralik,But she's dead to me now.
1863.61,1866.07,Kralik,"Mostly because I killed and ate her,"
1866.74,1871.33,Kralik,but also because I know
1866.74,1871.33,Kralik,I won't be alone much longer.
1873,1874.87,Kralik,I'll have your daughter.
1875.5,1878.38,Kralik,"I won't kill her, I'll just make her like me."
1878.63,1880.59,Kralik,Different.
1881.13,1882.38,Kralik,"She'll go to sleep,"
1882.38,1887.47,Kralik,"and when she wakes up,"
1882.38,1887.47,Kralik,your face will be the first thing she eats.
1891.77,1894.89,Kralik,I have a problem with mothers.
1891.77,1894.89,Kralik,I'm aware of that.
1995.29,1997.25,Giles,I was just trying to reach you.
1997.79,1999.82,Quentin,"I was on watch, by the boarding house."
1999.82,2001.58,Giles,Then you'll know what's happened.
2002.17,2003.25,Quentin,Yes.
2003.42,2005.8,Giles,He's killed Hobson
2003.42,2005.8,Giles,and made Blair one of his own.
2006.55,2009.26,Giles,Your perfectly controlled test
2009.68,2014.18,Giles,seems to have spun rather impressively
2009.68,2014.18,Giles,"out of control, don't you think?"
2016.56,2018.08,Quentin,It changes nothing.
2018.08,2019.69,Giles,"Well, then allow me."
2020.31,2022.61,Giles,I've told Buffy everything.
2024.69,2027.15,Giles,That is in opposition to the Council's orders.
2027.19,2030.53,Giles,"Yes. Interestingly, I don't give"
2027.19,2030.53,Giles,a rat's arse about the Council's orders.
2030.95,2032.7,Giles,There will be no test.
2033.45,2037.95,Quentin,The test has already begun. Your slayer
2033.45,2037.95,Quentin,entered the field of play ten minutes ago.
2038.46,2038.78,Giles,Why?
2038.78,2042.5,Quentin,I don't know. I returned there as she entered.
2043.46,2045.69,Quentin,"Giles, we've no business interfering."
2045.69,2046.96,Giles,This is not business.
2118.66,2121.29,Kralik,Hide and seek.
2125.54,2127.38,Kralik,Hide and seek.
2142.43,2145.27,Kralik,Why did you come
2142.43,2145.27,Kralik,to the dark of the woods?
2146.81,2150.07,Kralik,To bring all these sweets
2146.81,2150.07,Kralik,to Grandmother's house?
2161.2,2165.37,Kralik,"Oh, no, no. Just a little lower. Right... Oh, yes."
2166.21,2168.17,Kralik,Yes...
2170.59,2172.8,Kralik,Thank you very much.
2273.82,2277.28,Kralik,"If you stray from the path,"
2273.82,2277.28,Kralik,you will lose your way.
2278.82,2281.2,Kralik,I won't take it all. I won't take it all...
2300.09,2301.59,Kralik,No. No. No.
2311.98,2313.81,Joyce,Buffy?
2315.73,2317.44,Joyce,"Buffy, we have to get out."
2320.74,2322.32,Kralik,Where are they?
2322.61,2324.45,Kralik,Where are they?
2347.01,2352.23,Kralik,You... you don't seem to
2347.01,2352.23,Kralik,understand your place in all of this.
2353.27,2355.27,Kralik,Do you have any idea...?
2356.4,2358.02,Kralik,"Oh, my."
2358.27,2360.86,Kralik,What have you...? My pills?
2368.91,2371.91,Kralik,No. No.
2372.66,2375.71,Buffy,"If I was at full Slayer power,"
2372.66,2375.71,Buffy,I'd be punning right about now.
2376.42,2378.5,Kralik,No. No.
2387.68,2389.56,Joyce,"Buffy, thank God you're OK."
2389.56,2391.39,Joyce,"Oh, that man..."
2393.31,2395.75,Buffy,I can't get these. They're too tight.
2395.75,2396.94,Joyce,Can't you just...?
2397.69,2401.23,Buffy,Not right now. Maybe there's
2397.69,2401.23,Buffy,some clippers around.
2422.02,2422.67,Quentin,"Congratulations, You passed,"
2423.76,2427.14,Quentin,You exhibited extraordinary courage
2423.76,2427.14,Quentin,and clearheadedness in battle.
2428.14,2430.18,Quentin,The Council is very pleased.
2430.64,2432.68,Buffy,Do I get a gold star?
2433.14,2435.3,Quentin,I understand that you're upset...
2435.3,2436.81,Buffy,You understand nothing.
2437.52,2440.19,Buffy,You set that monster loose
2437.52,2440.19,Buffy,and he came after my mother.
2440.65,2442.53,Quentin,You think the test was unfair?
2443.15,2447.2,Buffy,I think you better leave town
2443.15,2447.2,Buffy,before I get my strength back.
2448.16,2451.28,Quentin,We're not in the business of "fair".
2448.16,2451.28,Quentin,We're fighting a war.
2451.91,2453.95,Giles,You're waging a war. She's fighting it.
2454.41,2456.21,Quentin,"Mr Giles, if you don't mind..."
2456.29,2458.15,Giles,The test is done. We're finished.
2458.15,2458.71,Quentin,Not quite.
2459.42,2461.38,Quentin,She passed. You didn't.
2463.17,2466.68,Quentin,The Slayer is not the only one
2463.17,2466.68,Quentin,who must perform in this situation.
2466.93,2469.14,Quentin,I have recommended to the Council
2469.43,2474.22,Quentin,that you be relieved of your duties
2469.43,2474.22,Quentin,as watcher immediately. You're fired.
2476.31,2478.19,Giles,On what grounds?
2478.19,2482.57,Quentin,Your affection for your charge has
2478.19,2482.57,Quentin,rendered you incapable of clear judgement.
2484.44,2489.74,Quentin,"You have a father's love for the child,"
2484.44,2489.74,Quentin,and that is useless to the cause.
2491.32,2494.99,Quentin,It would be best if you had
2491.32,2494.99,Quentin,no further contact with the Slayer.
2495.7,2497.11,Giles,I'm not going anywhere.
2497.11,2499.62,Quentin,I didn't expect you would adhere to that.
2500.08,2505.67,Quentin,"However, if you interfere with the new"
2500.08,2505.67,Quentin,"watcher in any way, you will be dealt with."
2507.59,2510.3,Giles,Are we clear?
2507.59,2510.3,Giles,We're very clear.
2512.6,2515.18,Quentin,Congratulations again.
2516.98,2519.23,Buffy,Bite me.
2519.48,2521.65,Quentin,"Yes, well..."
2522.61,2524.73,Quentin,Colourful girl.
2574.87,2578.24,Willow,I can't believe Giles was fired.
2574.87,2578.24,Willow,How could Giles get fired?
2578.62,2580.66,Oz,"So, how did you manage to kill Kralik?"
2581.12,2583.17,Joyce,She was very clever.
2584.25,2587.03,Joyce,You go ahead and tell it. You tell it better.
2587.03,2589.38,Willow,"When you say fired, do you mean fired?"
2589.88,2592.55,Xander,You're not cruising past
2589.88,2592.55,Xander,"that concept anytime soon, are ya?"
2595.02,2598.77,Willow,"Well, it's just... I mean, he's been fired."
2595.02,2598.77,Willow,He's... he's unemployed. He's between jobs.
2599.89,2603.19,Buffy,"Giles isn't going anywhere, Will."
2599.89,2603.19,Buffy,He's still librarian.
2603.65,2605.47,Willow,"OK, but I'm writing an angry letter."
2605.47,2606.98,Buffy,Nothing's really gonna change.
2607.4,2611.99,Buffy,The important thing is that I kept up my
2607.4,2611.99,Buffy,birthday tradition of misery and horror.
2613.03,2615.45,Oz,Bright side to everything?
2616.16,2619.16,Buffy,I'll just feel better when
2616.16,2619.16,Buffy,I get my strength back.
2619.29,2621.66,Xander,"Give you a hand with that, little lady?"
2623.67,2625.58,Buffy,You're loving this far too much.
2626.17,2629.38,,Admit it. Sometimes you
2626.17,2629.38,,"just need a big, strong man."
2636.18,2638.76,,Will? Give me a hand with that?
