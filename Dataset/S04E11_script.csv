2.61,4.6,Willow’s ,Let's try again.
4.69,6.25,Spike ,Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
6.33,9.29,Spike ,I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.
9.37,10.94,Willow ,How's with you and Riley?
10.94,13.08,Buffy ,"Every time we talk, I have to lie."
13.17,14.97,Buffy ,I wish I could just come clean.
15.05,16.21,Initiative ,"Well, you can't."
16.21,19.25,Riley ,"Yeah, I know I can't. But Buffy's special."
27.49,30.07,Willow’s ,I guess we have to talk.
30.07,31.57,Buffy ,I guess we do.
35.02,39.07,Buffy ,Advertise your product or brand here
35.02,39.07,Buffy ,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
50.29,54.45,Buffy ,Somebody should speak
50.29,54.45,Buffy ,before one of us graduates.
70.09,72.16,Riley ,What are you?
72.25,75.45,Buffy ,Capricorn on the cusp of Aquarius. You?
76.29,79.89,Riley ,Sorry. That came out
76.29,79.89,Riley ,a little blunter than I intended.
81.53,85.13,Riley ,It's just you're amazing.
81.53,85.13,Riley ,"Your speed, your strength."
85.21,88.6,Buffy ,"Also passionate, artistic and inquisitive."
89.93,90.97,Buffy ,Who are you?
90.97,92.53,Riley ,You know who I am.
93.29,95.68,Riley ,The rest... What I do...
97.61,102.02,Riley ,I can't tell you.
102.69,107.05,Buffy ,"Well, then, let me. You're part"
102.69,107.05,Buffy ,of some military monster squad
107.13,110.05,Buffy ,"that captures demons, vampires..."
110.17,116.81,Buffy ,Probably has officialsounding euphemisms
110.17,116.81,Buffy ,"for them, like ""unfriendlies"" or ""nonsapiens""."
116.89,118.65,Riley ,Hostile subterrestrials.
118.73,124.65,Buffy ,"So, you deliver these HSTs to a bunch of lab"
118.73,124.65,Buffy ,"coats, who perform experiments on them,"
124.73,128.77,Buffy ,"which, among other things,"
124.73,128.77,Buffy ,turn some into harmless little bunnies.
128.85,130.37,Buffy ,How am I doin' so far?
130.37,131.61,Riley ,A little too well.
131.69,137.33,Buffy ,"Meanwhile, by day, you pretend"
131.69,137.33,Buffy ,"to be Riley Finn, cornfed Iowa boy."
139.13,142.52,Buffy ,"Ever been to Iowa, Riley?"
139.13,142.52,Buffy ,"God, if that's even your name."
142.61,145.13,Riley ,It is. Born and raised.
145.21,150.21,Riley ,"And hey, bulletin: I'm not the only one"
145.21,150.21,Riley ,who's been a little less than honest here.
154.17,159.77,Buffy ,I thought a professional demonchaser like
154.17,159.77,Buffy ,yourself would have figured it out by now.
159.85,162.24,Buffy ,I'm the Slayer.
163.73,166.45,Buffy ,Slayer. Chosen One.
167.93,170.65,Buffy ,She who hangs out a lot in cemeteries?
171.57,173.56,Buffy ,You're kidding.
175.85,177.92,Buffy ,Ask around. Look it up.
178.01,180.4,Buffy ,"Slayer, comma, the."
181.49,184.05,Riley ,And you fight demons?
184.13,186.36,Riley ,"I mean, you whaled on those guys."
186.45,188.33,Buffy ,You did pretty well yourself.
188.33,190.73,Riley ,"Yeah, but I'm a walking bruise today."
190.81,194.28,Riley ,"You see me with my clothes off, I look like..."
196.13,202.02,Riley ,"I mean, I have bruises..."
196.13,202.02,Riley ,I don't see a scratch on you.
200.09,202.03,Buffy ,You're not looking hard enough.
202.03,203.53,Riley ,I'm looking pretty hard.
212.41,214.4,Riley ,So then...
216.69,217.93,Riley ,What do we do?
217.93,219.08,Buffy ,I don't know.
222.45,224.44,Buffy ,I just...
225.49,228.45,Buffy ,I really thought that
225.49,228.45,Buffy ,"you were a nice, normal guy."
228.53,229.52,Riley ,I am.
229.61,233.89,Buffy ,"Maybe by this town's standards,"
229.61,233.89,Buffy ,but I'm not grading on a curve.
235.33,240.53,Buffy ,I think we both need a little time
235.33,240.53,Buffy ,to process everything.
243.53,244.59,Buffy ,Maybe then...
244.59,247.77,Riley ,"Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea."
257.45,259.16,Riley ,I don't think I need to tell you...
259.16,260.09,Buffy ,I won't say a word.
260.17,263.09,Riley ,Good. It'll be safer for all...
273.25,274.73,Riley ,Over here.
284.37,286.76,Riley ,Wow. That was some ride!
292.73,296.52,Riley ,Sorry I'm so excited. It's my first earthquake.
298.93,301.32,Buffy ,It's not mine.
356.57,360.41,Spike ,My soddin' sleeping chair's bloody sodden.
361.09,365.48,Xander ,The quake knocked a couple of pipes loose.
361.09,365.48,Xander ,There's a wrench over by the workbench.
365.57,367.1,Xander ,Try tightening the coupling.
367.1,368.85,Spike ,Do I look like a plumber to you?
368.93,373.53,Xander ,"No, you look like a big mooch who doesn't"
368.93,373.53,Xander ,"lift a finger here, but I have to get to work."
373.61,378.4,Spike ,"Yeah, delivering melted cheese on bread,"
373.61,378.4,Spike ,doing your part to keep America constipated.
378.49,381.88,Xander ,Mock not. Remember who pays
378.49,381.88,Xander ,"for the plasma round here, pal."
381.97,384.36,Xander ,"You earn your keep, or you don't get kept."
387.69,390.65,Xander ,"When you're done fixing that leak,"
387.69,390.65,Xander ,try cleaning up this mess.
390.73,393.2,Xander ,And doing a little laundry for once
393.2,395.52,Willow ,"wouldn't kill you, unfortunately."
403.09,406.29,Willow ,Hey! I was in the library during the quake.
406.37,409.29,Willow ,Almost got buried
406.37,409.29,Willow ,in some 19thcentury literature.
409.37,413.81,Willow ,And I don't have to tell you how hard it is
409.37,413.81,Willow ,to dig through some of that stuff.
413.89,415.08,Willow ,You OK?
415.08,415.93,Spike ,Yeah.
416.01,418.57,Buffy ,"A couple of broken knickknacks,"
416.01,418.57,Buffy ,but no biggies.
418.65,420.96,Willow ,Porter Dorm is completely blacked out.
421.05,426.17,Willow ,So they're dealing with the crisis the only
421.05,426.17,Willow ,way they know how: Aftershock Party.
426.25,430.29,Buffy ,The dorm that had the Somebody Sneezed
426.25,430.29,Buffy ,Party and the Day That Ends In Y Party.
430.37,433.57,Willow ,They do seem to be
430.37,433.57,Willow ,pretty generous with the milestones.
433.65,438.36,Willow ,"Hey, you should ask Riley to come."
433.65,438.36,Willow ,Much carousing by flattering candlelight.
438.85,441.21,Willow ,"Riley's, um, busy."
441.29,445.45,Buffy ,I'm pretty sure. But you go on ahead
441.29,445.45,Buffy ,and I'll catch up with you there.
445.53,448.33,Buffy ,I'm on my way for a little Giles oneonone.
448.41,451.49,Willow ,Anything wrong?
448.41,451.49,Willow ,Wrong?
451.57,453.77,Buffy ,No. Not at all.
458.81,460.64,Buffy ,Something horrible's gonna happen.
460.64,461.77,Giles ,It was an earthquake.
461.85,465.97,Giles ,Not uncommon in southern California.
461.85,465.97,Giles ,No reason to think it was anything more.
466.05,471.08,Buffy ,I so have a reason. A darn good reason.
466.05,471.08,Buffy ,"The last time we had an earthquake, I died."
471.17,478.02,Giles ,"Yes, I know that, and therefore"
471.17,478.02,Giles ,I completely understand your anxiety.
476.09,480.64,Buffy ,"Oh, good. Cos I'd hate for my little untimely"
476.09,480.64,Buffy ,horrible death concern to be ambiguous.
480.73,485.2,Giles ,"But unless evidence suggests otherwise,"
480.73,485.2,Giles ,we can assume that it's shifting landmasses
485.29,488.29,Giles ,and not a portent of some imminent doom.
488.37,493.45,Giles ,"Now, in the meantime, I've got a few theories"
488.37,493.45,Giles ,about our mysterious commando friends.
495.57,496.1,Buffy ,Really?
496.1,499.12,Giles ,"Based on the locations of our sightings,"
499.21,503.25,Giles ,and Spike's reluctant description
499.21,503.25,Giles ,of their underground installation...
503.33,506.25,Buffy ,What if the quake was a sign 
503.33,506.25,Buffy ,a bad omen  and we ignore it?
506.33,508.8,Buffy ,There'll be a lot of red faces
506.33,508.8,Buffy ,when the world ends.
508.89,510.86,Buffy ,"Buffy, if the quake heralded"
510.86,512.41,Giles ,"some such catastrophe,"
512.49,517.61,Giles ,I'm sure there will be other signs to follow
512.49,517.61,Giles ,which will afford us plenty of time to avert it.
517.69,522.85,Giles ,I believe the commando installation is either
517.69,522.85,Giles ,very close to or directly under your school.
522.93,526.24,Giles ,"If that is the case, one or more of them"
522.93,526.24,Giles ,may be in your very midst.
526.33,527.47,Buffy ,Plague!
527.47,528.29,Giles ,What?
528.37,532.57,Buffy ,If the end of the world comes in the form of
528.37,532.57,Buffy ,"a plague, too many people may be infected..."
532.65,537.41,Giles ,Buffy! Will you stop worrying about
532.65,537.41,Giles ,what may be and concentrate on what is.
537.49,542.57,Giles ,"Vigilance is all well and good, but as we're"
537.49,542.57,Giles ,"close, there is a more pressing question."
542.65,544.96,Riley ,What's a slayer?
542.65,544.96,Riley ,Slayer?
545.05,548.36,Forrest ,Thrash band. Anvilheavy guitar rock
545.05,548.36,Forrest ,with delusions of Black Sabbath.
548.45,550.96,Riley ,"No. A girl, with powers."
550.96,552.53,Forrest ,Oh. The Slayer.
552.61,554.92,Forrest ,"Oh, yeah, I've heard of the Slayer."
554.92,555.65,Riley ,Fill me in.
555.73,557.69,Riley ,"Well, the Slayer is like some kind"
557.69,559.77,Forrest ,"of bogeyman for the subterrestrials,"
559.85,563.24,Riley ,something they tell their spawn
559.85,563.24,Riley ,to make 'em eat their vegetables.
563.33,565.72,Riley ,You're telling me she doesn't exist.
565.72,566.45,Forrest ,Wait a sec.
566.53,568.81,Forrest ,Am I bursting somebody's bubble here?
568.89,572.89,Forrest ,Maybe this is a bad time
568.89,572.89,Forrest ,to tell you about the Easter Bunny?
574.13,578.37,Forrest ,"Sorry, sorry. It's a myth, Rye."
574.13,578.37,Forrest ,All a part of that medieval folklore garbage
578.45,582.77,Forrest ,kooks dream up to explain things
578.45,582.77,Forrest ,we deal with every day.
583.97,586.65,Riley ,How do you explain
583.97,586.65,Riley ,"the things we deal with, Forrest?"
586.73,594.02,Forrest ,They're just animals. Rarer than the ones
586.73,594.02,Forrest ,you grew up with on that farm in Smallville...
606.85,609.45,Forrest ,Where's that hypo?
618.93,620.92,Riley ,Never mind.
622.13,624.25,Forrest ,"Like I said,"
624.33,626.37,Forrest ,animals.
626.45,628.44,Forrest ,What's that racket?
628.53,630.71,Riley ,Animals rattling in their cages.
630.71,632.21,Forrest ,Been doin' it all day.
632.29,634.33,Riley ,What's got 'em all worked up?
634.33,637.08,Forrest ,Earthquakes. They make everybody crazy.
639.09,641.08,Forrest ,
648.73,650.72,Forrest ,You say you wanna help me out
651.45,654.21,Forrest ,But you just fill my head with doubt
654.29,657.68,Forrest ,"Hey, I got my own reality"
654.29,657.68,Forrest ,and it sure ain't virtual
659.77,662.45,Forrest ,"It's my highway, I choose"
662.53,665.09,Forrest ,My lane and I control the cruise
665.17,668.88,Forrest ,"Yeah, I got feelings"
665.17,668.88,Forrest ,but bet your ass they're not mutual
670.45,672.09,Willow ,Percy! Hi!
672.17,674.53,Percy ,"Hey, Willow. What's goin' on?"
675.05,679.13,Willow ,Stuff. I thought you got
675.05,679.13,Willow ,that football scholarship to USC.
679.21,681.4,Percy ,I did. Laurie goes here.
681.4,681.77,Laurie ,Hey.
682.53,684.65,Willow ,Hi.
684.73,686.77,Willow ,"Some party, huh?"
686.85,688.84,Laurie ,It's OK.
693.57,694.47,Percy ,How's Oz?
694.47,696.37,Willow ,"Oh, actually, Oz..."
703.49,706.37,Willow ,"Listen, we're gonna go get some drinks."
703.49,706.37,Willow ,Cool to see you.
706.45,708.17,Laurie ,Bye.
708.25,710.85,Willow ,"Yeah, catch you later."
737.01,740.61,Guy ,"Hey, you guys serious"
737.01,740.61,Guy ,about naked limbo? I'm in.
754.49,756.88,Guy ,
765.05,766.93,Willow ,"Buffy, where are you?"
767.01,769.16,Laurie ,So I can watch you flirt with that redhead?
769.25,774.49,Percy ,"What, Rosenberg? She's just some egghead"
769.25,774.49,Percy ,who tutored me a little in high school.
774.57,779.02,Percy ,"She's nice, but come on "
774.57,779.02,Percy ,captain of the nerd squad.
777.09,779.77,Laurie ,"Well, I don't know."
777.09,779.77,Laurie ,Maybe you have a thing for geeks.
779.85,783.05,Percy ,"Uh, no. I like my women hot."
784.01,788.02,Percy ,Call me oldfashioned.
795.97,797.93,Willow ,Hello?
798.01,802.02,Willow ,Anyone in here?
843.25,845.97,Xander ,"Spike, the place looks worse than when I left!"
846.05,848.09,Xander ,You didn't even fix the drip!
848.17,850.29,Spike ,Don't turn around.
850.37,852.8,Xander ,"Spike, what is it? What happened?"
852.8,854.05,Spike ,Don't look at me.
863.49,865.45,Spike ,I shrunk them.
865.53,869.37,Spike ,"Bleeding shirt, trousers... I hate this place."
869.45,872.09,Xander ,I'm no happier about you
869.45,872.09,Xander ,wearing my stuff than you are.
872.17,874.93,Spike ,Go out. Get me some decent stuff.
872.17,874.93,Spike ,And I want more blood.
875.01,877.32,Xander ,No! You're not a guest.
878.13,880.41,Spike ,You want me to tear
878.13,880.41,Spike ,"this place apart, you poof?"
880.49,883.8,Spike ,That's it! I am way past through with you.
883.89,885.93,Spike ,"I hate to break it to you, O impotent one,"
885.93,887.68,Xander ,but you're not the Big Bad any more.
887.77,893.13,Xander ,You're not even the Kind of Naughty. You're
887.77,893.13,Xander ,nothing but a waste of space  my space!
893.21,896.89,Xander ,And as much as I got a big laugh
893.21,896.89,Xander ,"watching Buffy kick your shiny white bum,"
896.97,902.37,Xander ,and as much as I know I can give you a
896.97,902.37,Xander ,"bumkicking, I'm here to tell you somethin'."
903.77,906.16,Xander ,You're not even worth it.
907.33,909.64,Willow ,I'm outta here.
918.09,920.08,Willow ,Buffy! Over here.
922.21,927.21,Buffy ,"Wow. I wasn't sure where the party was,"
922.21,927.21,Buffy ,and then I saw the lights and the ambulance
927.29,932.61,Buffy ,"and I was, like, ""Right, of course."
927.29,932.61,Buffy ,"Death, carnage... It's a Buffy party."""
932.69,935.05,Willow ,I'm so glad you're here.
935.13,936.85,Buffy ,What happened?
936.85,942.02,Willow ,"I found him, this guy, on the bed with me."
940.09,942.93,Willow ,"Dead. Not me dead, he dead."
943.01,947.02,Buffy ,"God, are you OK?"
945.81,947.77,Buffy ,Vampire?
947.85,951.53,Willow ,"There was so much blood,"
947.85,951.53,Willow ,and there was a symbol.
951.61,953.65,Willow ,And Percy said I was a nerd.
953.65,955.4,Buffy ,Percy called you a nerd?
956.61,963.02,Willow ,"I guess we should report to Giles,"
956.61,963.02,Willow ,get with the demontracking.
965.17,967.16,Buffy ,Does Percy even go here?
969.57,972.69,Forrest ,"OK, that makes 04 billion."
972.77,976.24,Forrest ,"You don't got game, son."
972.77,976.24,Forrest ,What's going on in that head of yours?
976.33,979.93,Riley ,I'm just trying to make up my mind
976.33,979.93,Riley ,about something.
981.45,983.92,Riley ,"Buffy. She's pretty cool, isn't she?"
984.01,988.21,Forrest ,"Yes already! She's cool, she's hot,"
984.01,988.21,Forrest ,"she's tepid, she's alltemperature Buffy."
988.29,991.21,Forrest ,Now can we concentrate on the game here?
995.61,997.65,Forrest ,Good block. Use your face more often.
997.73,999.98,Graham ,We have an alpha codeblue situation.
999.98,1000.73,Riley ,One of ours?
1000.81,1003.75,Graham ,Negative. Civilian at the Porter Hall party.
1003.75,1004.49,Forrest ,HST attack?
1004.57,1008.45,Graham ,Cannot confirm. I couldn't get close
1004.57,1008.45,Graham ,without drawing attention to myself.
1008.53,1010.44,Forrest ,Should we mobilise?
1010.53,1013.89,Riley ,"No, I'll go. Do a little recon."
1010.53,1013.89,Riley ,See if it falls in our domain.
1013.97,1020.02,Riley ,You alert Professor Walsh. Tell her we have
1013.97,1020.02,Riley ,a casualty of an indeterminate nature.
1018.09,1021.85,Riley ,Let's not make a move
1018.09,1021.85,Riley ,until we get the whole story.
1021.93,1024.85,Giles ,Itjust made me feel
1021.93,1024.85,Giles ,like I was right back in high school.
1024.93,1028.24,Xander ,"Dumb jock. If it wasn't for you,"
1024.93,1028.24,Xander ,he still would be.
1028.33,1032.25,Willow ,"I mean, I know the Percy thing"
1028.33,1032.25,Willow ,isn't really important.
1032.33,1034.15,Willow ,It's the dead guy on the bed.
1034.15,1035.53,Xander ,"Yeah, that's bad, too."
1035.89,1040.81,Willow ,"Ooh, and something else."
1035.89,1040.81,Willow ,"He  the dead guy  was propped up,"
1040.89,1046.02,Willow ,like whatever killed him
1040.89,1046.02,Willow ,wanted to drain the blood out of him.
1044.09,1049.21,Willow ,So I'm thinking the "whatever"
1044.09,1049.21,Willow ,took a bunch of the guy's blood with him.
1049.29,1052.25,Willow ,And I haven't been a nerd
1049.29,1052.25,Willow ,for a very long time.
1052.33,1054.32,Willow ,Hello! Dating a guitarist!
1055.25,1055.86,Willow ,Or I was.
1055.86,1057.69,Buffy ,Tell them about the symbol.
1057.77,1063.29,Willow ,"Right. It was carved into his chest,"
1057.77,1063.29,Willow ,like a big creepy eye.
1064.09,1066.13,Xander ,It's kind of the CBS logo.
1066.21,1070.09,Xander ,"Hey, could this be the handiwork"
1066.21,1070.09,Xander ,of one Mr Morley Safer?
1070.17,1073.56,Buffy ,I've seen this somewhere before.
1070.17,1073.56,Buffy ,I just can't remember where.
1073.65,1075.08,Buffy ,"I mean, it's like..."
1075.08,1076.93,Giles ,It's the end of the world.
1077.01,1078.49,All ,Again?
1078.57,1081.85,Giles ,It's the earthquake. That symbol is...
1081.93,1087.13,Buffy ,I told you. I said "end of the world" and
1081.93,1087.13,Buffy ,"you're like ""Pooh, pooh, southern California."""
1087.21,1091.97,Giles ,I'm so very sorry. My contrition completely
1087.21,1091.97,Giles ,dwarfs the impending apocalypse.
1092.05,1096.05,Willow ,"No, it can't be. We've done this already."
1096.13,1099.89,Giles ,It's the end of the world. Everyone dies.
1096.13,1099.89,Giles ,"It's rather important, really."
1099.97,1102.73,Willow ,So what do we do?
1102.81,1105.2,Buffy ,I stop it.
1111.69,1116.02,Buffy ,I wonder where I've seen this before.
1114.09,1117.21,Buffy ,Where else? The place I spend
1114.09,1117.21,Buffy ,most of my waking hours
1117.29,1120.33,Buffy ,memorising stuff
1117.29,1120.33,Buffy ,off the sides of mausoleums.
1120.41,1122.48,Buffy ,Big freaky cereal boxes of death.
1135.65,1138.33,Buffy ,Door was open.
1192.17,1194.45,Riley ,Wow! That flippy thing that you did...
1194.53,1195.79,Buffy ,Where did it go?
1195.79,1196.57,Riley ,It's gone.
1196.65,1198.75,Riley ,I saw it take off toward the woods.
1198.75,1200.25,Buffy ,And you didn't follow it?
1200.33,1204.69,Riley ,"No weapons, no backup. You don't"
1200.33,1204.69,Riley ,go after a demon that size by yourself.
1204.77,1205.35,Buffy ,I do.
1205.35,1208.37,Riley ,"Yeah, well, I'm no slayer."
1210.53,1213.07,Riley ,"Base One, this is Lilac One."
1213.07,1213.61,Buffy ,Lilac?
1213.69,1214.65,Riley ,Go.
1214.65,1219.68,Riley ,Sighting of an unidentified SubT. Mobilise
1214.65,1219.68,Riley ,patrol team for debriefing at 0800 hours.
1219.77,1221.84,Radio ,Copy that.
1224.73,1226.77,Buffy ,Very commandery.
1226.85,1228.84,Buffy ,Lilac notwithstanding.
1231.61,1233.49,Buffy ,What are you doing here?
1233.57,1237.17,Riley ,Looking for you.
1233.57,1237.17,Riley ,She who hangs out in cemeteries.
1240.69,1243.57,Buffy ,"Well, I have to get the demon."
1243.65,1246.04,Riley ,Don't sweat it. We'll bag it.
1246.97,1248.49,Buffy ,It's not that simple.
1248.49,1249.36,Riley ,"Yeah, but..."
1250.05,1251.7,Riley ,"Look, I really think..."
1251.7,1252.85,Buffy ,"Riley, I just..."
1254.49,1256.85,Riley ,I can't.
1254.49,1256.85,Riley ,Can't talk?
1257.41,1259.4,Buffy ,Can't any of it.
1260.85,1266.8,Buffy ,"I can't be with you. It's a huge, black pit"
1260.85,1266.8,Buffy ,of a mistake and I can't go there again.
1266.89,1268.93,Riley ,Again? You've dated me before?
1269.01,1271.81,Buffy ,"No! Look, I was involved..."
1275.25,1277.01,Buffy ,You don't know what my life is like.
1277.01,1278.09,Riley ,I'm dying to find out.
1278.17,1283.57,Buffy ,Dying being the operative word here.
1278.17,1283.57,Buffy ,There's too much risk. There is too much...
1284.49,1289.89,Buffy ,It's just doomed. And I can't do doomed
1284.49,1289.89,Buffy ,again right now. I'm sorry.
1289.97,1292.89,Riley ,I don't understand where this is coming from.
1292.97,1295.81,Riley ,You like me. It's not like
1292.97,1295.81,Riley ,we don't have anything in common.
1295.89,1297.67,Buffy ,But that's not enough.
1297.67,1299.77,Riley ,"Buffy, I'm thrown by this."
1299.85,1301.84,Riley ,I'm confused.
1303.69,1308.02,Riley ,But I can feel my skin humming.
1306.09,1308.69,Riley ,"My hands, my every inch of me."
1309.61,1313.4,Riley ,I've never been this excited
1309.61,1313.4,Riley ,about anybody before.
1313.49,1316.96,Riley ,I'm not trying to scare you
1313.49,1316.96,Riley ,"and I'm not gonna force myself on you, but"
1317.05,1321.29,Riley ,"I am, by God, not gonna walk away"
1317.05,1321.29,Riley ,because I think it might not work.
1321.37,1323.93,Riley ,I don't know what's happened in your past...
1324.01,1326.81,Buffy ,"Pain, death,"
1327.29,1329.41,Buffy ,apocalypse.
1329.49,1331.48,Buffy ,None of it fun.
1332.57,1336.36,Buffy ,Do you know what a hellmouth is?
1332.57,1336.36,Buffy ,Do you have a fancy term for it?
1336.45,1339.84,Buffy ,Because I went to high school on it
1336.45,1339.84,Buffy ,for three years.
1341.69,1345.05,Buffy ,We do not have that much in common.
1341.69,1345.05,Buffy ,This is ajob to you.
1345.13,1346.47,Riley ,It's notjust ajob.
1346.47,1348.33,Buffy ,"It's an adventure, great."
1348.41,1351.21,Buffy ,"But for me, it's destiny."
1351.29,1354.84,Buffy ,"It is something I can't change,"
1351.29,1354.84,Buffy ,something I can't escape. I'm stuck.
1354.93,1359.45,Riley ,You don't have to be.
1354.93,1359.45,Riley ,You're not in high school any more.
1359.53,1361.1,Riley ,You can change things.
1361.1,1361.81,Buffy ,"Riley, no."
1361.89,1363.94,Riley ,I know it may seem...
1363.94,1364.53,Buffy ,Riley!
1364.61,1366.92,Buffy ,My answer is no.
1384.13,1386.52,Giles ,A Vahrall demon.
1386.52,1386.97,Willow ,Ew!
1387.05,1389.28,Xander ,I second that revulsion.
1389.28,1389.65,Giles ,Yes.
1389.73,1395.49,Giles ,"Slick like ghoul and gird in moonlight,"
1389.73,1395.49,Giles ,father of portents and brother to blight."
1395.57,1400.33,Buffy ,"Limbs with talons, eyes like knives,"
1395.57,1400.33,Buffy ,"bane to the blameless, thief of lives."""
1400.41,1406.36,Riley ,"Three metres tall, approximately 100120"
1400.41,1406.36,Riley ,"kilograms, based on my visual analysis."
1406.45,1408.16,Graham ,Special hazards?
1408.16,1409.01,Riley ,Unknown.
1409.09,1412.09,Riley ,Probably nothing we haven't handled before.
1412.17,1414.02,Buffy ,"There's no pattern we can discern,"
1414.02,1416.53,Riley ,"so we assume it's on a ""kill, crush, destroy."""
1416.97,1419.33,Buffy ,It isn't digging up the bones of a child for fun.
1419.41,1422.17,Xander ,A demon's got some
1419.41,1422.17,Xander ,pretty hilarious ideas about fun.
1422.25,1424.61,Xander ,"The bones of a child, though."
1424.69,1426.65,Willow ,I saw that...
1431.77,1436.32,Willow ,"An ancient ritual. It uses the blood of a man,"
1431.77,1436.32,Willow ,"the bones of a child,"
1436.41,1440.25,Willow ,and something called the Word of Valios.
1440.33,1444.21,Willow ,It's all part of a sacrifice.
1440.33,1444.21,Willow ,The sacrifice of three.
1444.29,1446.73,Buffy ,Let me guess  ends the world?
1446.81,1451.33,Willow ,"Well, yeah."
1446.81,1451.33,Willow ,"It's not big with the details, though."
1451.41,1456.12,Willow ,It doesn't say how the world ends
1451.41,1456.12,Willow ,or what the ritual entails exactly.
1456.21,1460.29,Xander ,The sacrifice of three.
1456.21,1460.29,Xander ,Three people are gonna die?
1460.37,1464.84,Buffy ,"No, they won't. Because Claw Boy"
1460.37,1464.84,Buffy ,is not getting all of his ingredients.
1464.93,1468.21,Buffy ,"We have to find the Word of Valios,"
1464.93,1468.21,Buffy ,keep him from getting it.
1468.29,1472.57,Willow ,If he doesn't already have it.
1468.29,1472.57,Willow ,"I mean, who knows where he's been?"
1472.65,1476.53,Riley ,Here's one for the good guys. This thing's
1472.65,1476.53,Riley ,got a pheromone signature a mile wide.
1476.61,1479.92,Riley ,Agent Gates has been working
1476.61,1479.92,Riley ,with the detection system.
1480.01,1483.13,Forrest ,"Can't tell where it's going,"
1480.01,1483.13,Forrest ,but I know where it's been.
1483.21,1486.97,Forrest ,Residual traces showing up
1483.21,1486.97,Forrest ,in populated areas. The thing's not shy.
1487.05,1488.79,Forrest ,We're going out in civvies.
1488.79,1490.33,Riley ,Weapons stowed in packs.
1490.41,1495.33,Riley ,Keep 'em out of sight till nightfall.
1490.41,1495.33,Riley ,"Remember, this isn't a capture, it's a kill."
1495.41,1498.09,Forrest ,Pick up assignments from me.
1495.41,1498.09,Forrest ,We'll blanket the town.
1498.17,1501.37,Buffy ,I'll check the magic shop
1498.17,1501.37,Buffy ,for a book called the Word of Valios.
1501.45,1502.82,Buffy ,How about the museum?
1502.82,1505.16,Xander ,"We'll stop by my house, get weapons,"
1505.25,1509.17,Xander ,and I'll change into something
1505.25,1509.17,Xander ,that isn't quite as anchovyscented.
1509.25,1513.77,Buffy ,This thing takes wicked very seriously. Be
1509.25,1513.77,Buffy ,careful. I couldn't stand anybody getting hurt.
1514.65,1517.25,Spike ,"Goodbye, Dru. See you in hell."
1520.53,1523.13,Willow ,What are you doing?
1523.21,1526.25,Spike ,Bloody rot! Can't a person knock?
1526.33,1528.37,Willow ,What are you doing?
1528.37,1532.02,Xander ,You were trying to stake yourself.
1530.09,1533.17,Spike ,Fag off! It's no concern of yours.
1533.69,1537.16,Xander ,"Is too. For one thing,"
1533.69,1537.16,Xander ,that's my shirt you're about to dust.
1537.25,1541.57,Xander ,"For another, we've shared a lot. You should"
1537.25,1541.57,Xander ,have trusted me enough to do it for you.
1541.65,1542.13,Willow ,Xander.
1542.13,1544.61,Xander ,"What? He wants to die, I wanna help."
1544.69,1548.05,Willow ,It's ooky. We know him.
1544.69,1548.05,Willow ,We can'tjust let him poof himself.
1548.13,1552.97,Spike ,"Oh, but you can. You know I'd drain you drier"
1548.13,1552.97,Spike ,than the Sahara if I had half the chance.
1553.05,1556.81,Spike ,"Besides, I'm beyond pathetic."
1553.05,1556.81,Spike ,Stuck in this basement washing skivvies
1556.89,1560.25,Spike ,for a blighter I wouldn't have bothered
1556.89,1560.25,Spike ,to bite a few months ago.
1560.33,1563.33,Spike ,"I mean, am I even remotely scary any more?"
1564.29,1566.6,Spike ,Tell me the truth.
1569.57,1574.36,Willow ,"Well, the shirt is kinda"
1569.57,1574.36,Willow ,"not very threatening, and the short pants..."
1574.45,1578.84,Willow ,"But it could also be cos I know you can't bite,"
1574.45,1578.84,Willow ,which isn't what you really need to hear...
1578.93,1580.65,Spike ,"Stop. Look, just clear out, OK?"
1580.65,1582.48,Xander ,Fine. But you break anything else
1582.57,1584.84,Xander ,and you'll be sleeping in the garage.
1584.84,1586.93,Willow ,We can't leave him here like this.
1587.01,1589.99,Willow ,We'll have to take him to the museum.
1589.99,1590.8,Spike ,You go on.
1590.89,1593.89,Spike ,I won't do anything.
1590.89,1593.89,Spike ,I feel better now. Promise.
1596.25,1599.88,Spike’s ,"If we don't find what we're looking for,"
1596.25,1599.88,Spike’s ,we're facing an apocalypse.
1599.97,1602.57,Spike ,Really? You're notjust saying that?
1620.85,1622.53,Riley ,Buffy.
1622.61,1625.81,Buffy ,Is this really the time for Donkey Kong?
1625.81,1626.21,Riley ,What?
1630.73,1634.28,Riley ,It takes trace readings
1630.73,1634.28,Riley ,of the creature's pheromones.
1634.37,1635.44,Buffy ,And?
1635.53,1640.53,Riley ,And it's either mating season for this thing
1635.53,1640.53,Riley ,or it's movin' all over town.
1641.41,1642.45,Riley ,"You know, Buffy..."
1642.45,1643.77,Buffy ,"Actually, I need to go."
1643.85,1645.96,Buffy ,Big Bad needs to be squished.
1645.96,1647.56,Riley ,"Right. I'm on it, too."
1647.65,1652.52,Riley ,"It's just, this thing,"
1647.65,1652.52,Riley ,"this youandme thing, it's stupid."
1652.61,1657.21,Buffy ,"I know. Which is why we can't do it,"
1652.61,1657.21,Buffy ,the youandme thing.
1657.29,1659.65,Riley ,"No, I mean you're stupid."
1660.29,1662.97,Riley ,"I mean, I don't mean that."
1663.05,1664.72,Riley ,"No, I think maybe I do."
1664.72,1666.97,Buffy ,"Wow. With sweet talk like that,"
1667.05,1669.34,Buffy ,you'll definitely melt my reservations.
1669.34,1670.05,Riley ,I'm serious.
1670.13,1674.52,Riley ,You have this twisted way of looking
1670.13,1674.52,Riley ,at things. This doomandgloom mentality.
1674.61,1678.85,Riley ,You keep thinking like that and things will
1674.61,1678.85,Riley ,probably turn outjust the way you expect.
1678.93,1685.02,Buffy ,"You know, there's nothing more dangerous"
1678.93,1685.02,Buffy ,than a psych grad student.
1683.09,1686.13,Riley ,"Buffy, where is the bad here?"
1686.21,1689.73,Riley ,It turns out that we're even more
1686.21,1689.73,Riley ,wellmatched than we thought we were.
1689.81,1693.49,Buffy ,"I mean, you're a fry cook and so am I."
1693.57,1696.37,Buffy ,"Yes, but you're an amateur fry cook,"
1696.45,1700.05,Buffy ,and I come from a long line
1696.45,1700.05,Buffy ,of fry cooks that don't live past 25.
1700.13,1704.84,Riley ,Which is exactly the attitude I'm talking
1700.13,1704.84,Riley ,"about. Look, I know the risks of what we do."
1704.93,1708.48,Riley ,I also know it's more rewarding than
1704.93,1708.48,Riley ,any otherjob on the planet. And fun!
1708.57,1715.02,Buffy ,Fun? The last person I know that
1708.57,1715.02,Buffy ,believed that is in a coma right now
1713.09,1715.53,Buffy ,because she had so much fun on the job.
1715.61,1718.45,Riley ,I'm not saying you shouldn't
1715.61,1718.45,Riley ,take your work seriously.
1718.53,1721.84,Buffy ,That I should just turn my frown
1718.53,1721.84,Buffy ,upside down? Is that it?
1721.93,1726.53,Buffy ,I wish I could. But this isn't the kind of gig
1721.93,1726.53,Buffy ,where you can just hang it up at night
1726.61,1728.21,Buffy ,and snuggle with your honey.
1728.21,1729.13,Riley ,Why can't it be?
1729.21,1733.76,Buffy ,"Because I tried it, OK?"
1729.21,1733.76,Buffy ,And every time itjust fell apart.
1733.85,1736.24,Buffy ,Then I get sucked right back
1733.85,1736.24,Buffy ,into the Überevil.
1736.33,1742.12,Riley ,Welcome to the story of the world. Things
1736.33,1742.12,Riley ,"fall apart, Buffy. And evil, it comes and goes."
1742.21,1747.05,Riley ,"But the way people manage is, they don't"
1742.21,1747.05,Riley ,do it alone. They pull each other through.
1747.13,1750.13,Riley ,If you weren't so selfinvolved you'd see that.
1751.37,1755.97,Buffy ,You have no idea what you're talking about.
1751.37,1755.97,Buffy ,You barely know me.
1757.53,1759.57,Buffy ,I know that it's notjust the job thing.
1759.65,1763.28,Buffy ,I'm sure there's some goodIooking guy
1759.65,1763.28,Buffy ,"who done you wrong in there, too."
1763.37,1766.57,Buffy ,But mostly I think you wanna
1763.37,1766.57,Buffy ,"stay down in the dark place,"
1766.65,1769.65,Buffy ,cos maybe it's safer down there.
1766.65,1769.65,Buffy ,You are so out of line.
1769.73,1772.12,Riley ,"No. See, I don't think so."
1772.81,1778.52,Riley ,"We have an opportunity, you and me, but"
1772.81,1778.52,Riley ,the fact that you're too scared to even try
1778.81,1783.02,Buffy ,Is my business.
1781.09,1783.69,Buffy ,So why don't you just leave me alone?
1786.97,1789.25,Riley ,Fair enough.
1799.89,1801.58,Willow ,Great. No Word of Valios.
1801.58,1803.6,Xander ,Not even a syllable of Valios.
1803.69,1806.92,Spike ,So I'm one step closer to melting
1803.69,1806.92,Spike ,in a sea of molten hellfire?
1807.01,1810.37,Willow ,You shouldn't talk like that.
1807.01,1810.37,Willow ,"OK, so you can't kill any more,"
1810.45,1814.08,Willow ,but there's other fun things
1810.45,1814.08,Willow ,you can do. You'll adjust.
1814.17,1819.09,Spike ,Adjust? And what? End up
1814.17,1819.09,Spike ,"like the two of you? No, thank you."
1819.17,1823.21,Xander ,Here it goes. "We can'tjust leave him here
1819.17,1823.21,Xander ,to stake himself. It's not right."
1823.29,1826.44,Spike ,I should think you would be glad
1823.29,1826.44,Spike ,to greet the end of days.
1826.53,1829.76,Spike ,"I mean, neither one of you"
1826.53,1829.76,Spike ,is making much of a go at it.
1829.85,1833.16,Spike ,You... Kids your age
1829.85,1833.16,Spike ,are going off to university.
1833.25,1836.45,Spike ,You've made it as far as the basement.
1833.25,1836.45,Spike ,"And Red here,"
1836.53,1841.24,Spike ,you couldn't even keep Dog Boy happy. You
1836.53,1841.24,Spike ,"can take the loser out of high school, but..."
1841.33,1843.97,Willow ,You're trying to get us to dust you.
1844.05,1848.84,Spike ,Am not! I just don't want pity
1844.05,1848.84,Spike ,from geeks more useless than I am.
1848.93,1854.09,Willow ,We're not useless. We help people.
1848.93,1854.09,Willow ,We fight the forces of evil.
1854.17,1856.64,Spike ,Buffy fights the forces of evil.
1856.73,1861.81,Spike ,You're her groupies. She'd do just
1856.73,1861.81,Spike ,"as well without you, better I'd wager,"
1861.89,1864.85,Spike ,since she wouldn't have to save
1861.89,1864.85,Spike ,your hides all the time.
1864.93,1868.29,Xander ,That is so not true.
1864.93,1868.29,Xander ,We're part of the team. She needs us.
1868.37,1872.69,Spike ,Or you're just the same tenthgrade losers
1868.37,1872.69,Spike ,you've always been
1872.77,1874.91,Spike ,and she's too much of a softy
1874.91,1876.16,Giles ,to cut you loose.
1890.85,1894.56,Giles ,Oh  as usual  dear.
1934.65,1935.73,Buffy ,What happened?
1935.73,1938.44,Xander ,It's my fault. I should have known.
1939.53,1940.57,Buffy ,Giles...
1940.65,1945.41,Giles ,The Word of Valios
1940.65,1945.41,Giles ,"is the name of a talisman, not a book."
1945.49,1947.89,Giles ,I blame myself entirely. I had it here.
1947.89,1948.88,Xander ,You had it here?
1948.97,1951.73,Xander ,I thought you were being
1948.97,1951.73,Xander ,"too hard on yourself, but..."
1951.81,1955.57,Giles ,Thank you. I bought it
1951.81,1955.57,Giles ,at a sorcerer's estate sale.
1956.05,1958.77,Giles ,I only glanced at it once.
1956.05,1958.77,Giles ,I thought it was a knockoff.
1958.85,1964.02,Buffy ,They have it. They probably have
1958.85,1964.02,Buffy ,"their sacrifices by now, too."
1962.09,1964.53,Giles ,They're on their way
1962.09,1964.53,Giles ,to perform the sacrifice now.
1964.61,1967.73,Buffy ,On their way where?
1964.61,1967.73,Buffy ,You found out what the ritual is for?
1967.81,1970.81,Giles ,The Hellmouth.
1967.81,1970.81,Giles ,They're going to open the Hellmouth.
1972.77,1975.49,Giles ,The one in the library.
1981.33,1984.13,Buffy ,Looks like we're going back to high school.
1997.13,2001.09,Buffy ,"OK, be careful, you guys."
1997.13,2001.09,Buffy ,The place doesn't look too stable.
2002.09,2004.73,Spike ,Fine by me. Hope we all go under.
2004.81,2007.81,Buffy ,Why is he even here? It's not like he can fight.
2007.89,2010.69,Willow ,"If we leave him alone, he'll stake himself."
2010.77,2013.37,Buffy ,And that's bad because...?
2013.45,2016.49,Buffy ,Fine. Whatever. Just keep him out of the way.
2016.57,2018.56,Buffy ,I do not have time for this.
2019.73,2024.12,Buffy ,"When we get to the library, look out for"
2019.73,2024.12,Buffy ,victims they're keeping alive for the sacrifice.
2024.21,2027.02,Buffy ,Getting them out is the first priority.
2027.02,2027.6,Willow ,Will do.
2028.53,2030.73,Buffy ,OK. You guys ready?
2031.73,2033.72,Xander ,Let's rock and roll.
2034.45,2036.36,Xander ,Let's rock and roll."
2041.97,2043.88,Xander ,Sunnydale High.
2043.97,2048.29,Xander ,"If these walls were still walls,"
2043.97,2048.29,Xander ,what stories they could tell.
2049.09,2050.24,Xander ,Eeuw!
2053.17,2055.56,Xander ,Mayor meat. Extra crispy.
2061.97,2064.53,Willow ,I think we're near the library.
2073.61,2074.89,Willow ,Whoa.
2074.97,2077.69,Willow ,Check out the new floor plan.
2077.77,2079.76,Buffy ,Three of them.
2083.09,2085.89,Willow ,I don't see any sacrifice people.
2085.97,2088.17,Buffy ,They must be around here somewhere.
2088.25,2091.72,Buffy ,The ritual's not finished.
2088.25,2091.72,Buffy ,And it's not gonna be.
2107.05,2108.61,Xander ,The blood!
2110.37,2113.17,Xander ,Get the talisman. They can't do the ritual.
2117.53,2119.76,Willow ,I've got the bones!
2121.81,2123.8,Willow ,Here!
2127.65,2132.41,Xander ,You're picking on the wrong guy. I've had
2127.65,2132.41,Xander ,a lot of practice at this with my lunch money.
2132.49,2133.61,Willow ,Spike!
2134.29,2136.28,Vahral ,"Right, perfect."
2149.53,2151.92,Xander ,"OK, I guess I won."
2154.57,2156.85,Xander ,The demons! They are the sacrifice!
2168.57,2170.45,Spike ,No pain.
2172.25,2177.02,Spike ,I can hurt a demon.
2183.21,2188.24,Spike ,"That's right. I'm back,"
2183.21,2188.24,Spike ,and I'm a bloody animal! Yeah!
2192.41,2192.67,Xander ,No!
2192.67,2194.64,Willow ,"Spike, not in the hole!"
2201.09,2202.97,Spike ,What? I was helping.
2209.53,2212.73,Buffy ,Get outta here!
2209.53,2212.73,Buffy ,The building's gonna come down!
2238.53,2242.29,Buffy ,Don't let him jump in the Hellmouth.
2238.53,2242.29,Buffy ,"If he does, we're finished!"
2261.05,2263.28,Buffy ,I'm going in.
2265.17,2267.85,Riley ,You're coming back out.
2316.01,2317.65,Riley ,Buffy...
2330.29,2332.89,Riley ,"Well, hey! Willow."
2332.97,2336.93,Riley ,"And Xander, right?"
2332.97,2336.93,Riley ,"Jeez, what are the chances, huh?"
2337.01,2340.24,Riley ,"Yeah, I was just passing by"
2337.01,2340.24,Riley ,and I thought I heard people inside.
2340.33,2342.29,Riley ,You were just passing by
2342.29,2344.09,Willow ,in your GI Joe outfit?
2347.21,2350.49,Buffy ,"No offence, but you do look"
2347.21,2350.49,Buffy ,wicked conspicuous.
2350.57,2352.48,Riley ,I do?
2353.05,2356.49,Riley ,"Paintball. Yeah, I was playing paintball."
2353.05,2356.49,Riley ,And then the aftershock...
2356.57,2359.34,Xander ,"So, you're one of the commando guys, huh?"
2359.34,2361.97,Riley ,"Oh, no, no, no. Commando? No, I mean..."
2362.73,2364.73,Riley ,Do I know you?
2364.73,2365.73,Spike ,Me? No.
2365.81,2370.25,Spike ,"No, sir. I'm just an old pal of Xander's here."
2370.33,2372.32,Riley ,Oh. That's nice.
2378.25,2381.09,Willow ,"It's kinda weird being back, isn't it?"
2378.25,2381.09,Willow ,Yeah.
2381.17,2383.45,Willow ,Everything seems so small.
2383.53,2385.92,Willow ,And more charred and ruiny.
2407.09,2409.08,Riley ,Come in.
2415.05,2417.44,Buffy ,"You never called, so I didn't know..."
2417.44,2419.44,Riley ,"Oh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm just..."
2420.77,2424.61,Riley ,I'm a dead man. Secret. Highly.
2424.69,2429.81,Riley ,Or it's supposed to be. And then you find out.
2424.69,2429.81,Riley ,I can deal. You're special.
2431.01,2434.45,Riley ,But last night was a disaster.
2431.01,2434.45,Riley ,Could I have been less convincing?
2434.53,2439.21,Riley ,I was trained to be sneaky and stuff
2434.53,2439.21,Riley ,"and I'm, like, ""Hi. Paintball. Just passing by."""
2439.29,2441.41,Buffy ,I should have given 'em
2439.29,2441.41,Buffy ,my security code and rank.
2441.49,2443.96,Buffy ,You have a security code and rank?
2444.05,2446.44,,No. Did I just say...?
2447.17,2449.16,,This is so not good.
2452.73,2455.69,,Everybody knows about me. I'm finished.
