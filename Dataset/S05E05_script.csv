4.21,7.25,,"Hello, you two, come on in."
4.21,7.25,,"Thank you, kind proprietor."
7.33,9.13,,Don't touch anything.
9.53,12.45,,She still thinks I'm Little Miss Nobody.
12.53,13.93,,Just her sister.
14.01,16.16,,"Boy, is she in for a surprise!"
16.25,17.69,,Who are you?
20.53,23.89,,You know Walsh pumped chemicals into us?
20.53,23.89,,You got more than anyone.
23.97,25.71,BUFFY,I'm taking you to the doctor.
25.71,28.17,,The one from the government who did this?
28.25,29.73,,All patched up.
30.17,32.45,,How's it going in there?
32.53,34.89,,Good. Back to normal.
42.45,43.85,,I love you so much.

118.25,120.71,BIKER VAMPIRE,I've always wanted to kill the Slayer.
120.71,122.85,BUFFY,I've always wanted piano lessons.
122.93,125.85,BUFFY,Who's surprised we have
122.93,125.85,BUFFY,all this unexpressed rage?
131.45,134.41,BUFFY,"But, honestly, I think"
131.45,134.41,BUFFY,I'm expressing mine better.
135.41,137.4,BUFFY,Tell you what.
139.57,142.88,BUFFY,You find yourself
139.57,142.88,BUFFY,"a good angermanagement class,"
144.17,147.45,BUFFY,and I'll jam this poky wood stick
144.17,147.45,BUFFY,through your heart.
150.73,153.33,BUFFY,That sets the world speed record for closure.
153.41,155.21,BUFFY,Hey.
156.09,160.21,BUFFY,"If you're looking for one of those rave parties,"
156.09,160.21,BUFFY,I'm afraid you're late.
160.29,164.61,BUFFY,Chased a bunch of kids out last night.
160.29,164.61,BUFFY,"Oh, right. Yeah. Darn."
164.69,169.4,BUFFY,My fellow ravers will be so disappointed.
164.69,169.4,BUFFY,It was my turn to bring the Bundt cake.
169.49,171.72,BUFFY,"If it was my call, I'd let you do whatever."
171.81,174.96,BUFFY,It's not like anybody's
171.81,174.96,BUFFY,using this place or nothin'.
175.05,177.52,BUFFY,They just don't pay enough
175.05,177.52,BUFFY,to argue with the boss.
177.61,178.63,BUFFY,Already gone.
178.63,179.73,NIGHT WATCHMAN,"Hold it, miss."
179.81,183.57,NIGHT WATCHMAN,"Take your, whatever this is, with you."
185.09,186.29,BUFFY,Thank you.
186.37,190.84,NIGHT WATCHMAN,"Glow balls, huh?"
186.37,190.84,NIGHT WATCHMAN,"I swear, I don't get your generation."
190.93,192.92,BUFFY,Now what is that thing?
193.65,196.25,BUFFY,I'll let you know as soon as I find out.
253.73,255.2,BUFFY,"Dawn, touch nothing."
255.2,257.85,DAWN,Who died and made you the Iron Chef?
257.93,261.81,BUFFY,Mom's sick and I made her
257.93,261.81,BUFFY,a nice noninstant breakfast for once.
261.89,263.69,BUFFY,I don't need you...
264.13,265.12,DAWN,Oops!
267.33,269.45,BUFFY,doing that.
267.33,269.45,BUFFY,"Morning, guys."
270.85,273.08,JOYCE,Check out the pamperMom platter.
273.17,274.57,JOYCE,You two do all this?
274.57,275.48,DAWN,Buffy helped.
276.49,278.21,BUFFY,I didn't help...
278.29,280.12,JOYCE,I'm sure you did.
280.21,287.02,JOYCE,"So neither of you is pregnant, failing,"
280.21,287.02,JOYCE,or under indictment? Just checking.
285.85,288.65,BUFFY,We knew you were feeling
285.85,288.65,BUFFY,"less than great, so..."
288.73,292.49,JOYCE,The headaches they said would go away
288.73,292.49,JOYCE,came back and brought some friends.
292.57,294.4,BUFFY,What did the doctor say?
294.49,297.61,JOYCE,Take four of some pills a day
294.49,297.61,JOYCE,and come back for tests.
298.09,299.71,BUFFY,They don't know what's wrong?
299.71,300.16,JOYCE,Not yet.
300.25,301.33,BUFFY,That's unacceptable.
301.33,302.69,JOYCE,We need a second opinion.
302.77,305.09,JOYCE,"We need a first opinion first, honey."
305.09,306.16,BUFFY,OK. We'll go now.
306.25,309.77,JOYCE,"Buffy, I know you're concerned, but don't be."
309.85,312.97,JOYCE,"I'm still the mom, which means"
309.85,312.97,JOYCE,I get to worry about you two.
313.05,316.57,JOYCE,Which is a good thing
313.05,316.57,JOYCE,because you're a vampire slayer.
316.65,319.33,JOYCE,"And you, you are my little pumpkin belly."
319.41,321.69,JOYCE,"Mom! That's, like, my kid name."
321.77,323.06,JOYCE,So I can't be retro?
323.06,325.32,BUFFY,Did you ever have any names for me?
326.01,328.65,JOYCE,"No, I think you were always just Buffy."
329.57,331.96,DAWN,I got some names for ya.
333.13,336.68,BUFFY,What are you doing hanging around?
333.13,336.68,BUFFY,Isn't this Giles' big day?
336.77,339.08,BUFFY,Bigger than big. It's his grand opening.
339.17,341.85,JOYCE,So go. Bring me back a...
341.93,343.97,BUFFY,I don't know...
344.05,346.25,,A flying broomstick or something.
346.33,348.07,DAWN,Those never really work.
348.07,348.72,JOYCE,Whatever.
349.69,351.73,JOYCE,Book club tonight?
352.85,355.32,BUFFY,You guys have a book club?
357.17,359.48,BUFFY,"OK, I'm gonna go. I will be back later."
359.48,361.49,DAWN,When is your doctor's appointment?
361.85,367.13,DAWN,I just wanna know. Take it easy. I want you
361.85,367.13,DAWN,"to relax, keep your feet up, plenty of Oprah."
368.13,372.17,DAWN,Plus you can check my rainforest report.
368.13,372.17,DAWN,And there's old board games...
372.25,374.02,DAWN,Hey. You said I couldn't come.
374.02,374.97,BUFFY,Changed my mind.
405.93,407.81,5 INT. THE MAGIC BOX- DAY 5,I told you you couldn't ditch me.
409.49,411.21,5 INT. THE MAGIC BOX- DAY 5,Mr Giles.
411.29,413.93,5 INT. THE MAGIC BOX- DAY 5,This place is so... wow.
414.29,416.65,5 INT. THE MAGIC BOX- DAY 5,"I mean, check out all the magic junk."
416.65,417.6,GILES,Our new slogan.
418.13,420.63,DAWN,So when's it open? For customers?
420.63,422.45,GILES,Since nine this morning.
422.77,425.89,BUFFY,Dawn. Go. Browse. And...
425.97,427.93,DAWN,"You break it, you bought it."""
427.93,429.89,GILES,Heard you the first 60 times.
429.97,433.85,GILES,"Still, not to worry."
429.97,433.85,GILES,I have good feelings about this place.
434.61,438.81,GILES,"Magic's a small niche market,"
434.61,438.81,GILES,"but... well, think about it."
438.89,443.05,GILES,"Sunnydale, monsters, supply and demand."
443.13,445.93,GILES,They'll be lining up
443.13,445.93,GILES,round the block in no time.
446.29,449.29,BUFFY,Yeah. You'll be making money hand over fist.
454.33,456.45,BUFFY,Which I guess is a good thing.
456.53,459.37,GILES,You all right? You seem a little distracted.
459.45,463.05,BUFFY,It's just my mom's still sick
459.45,463.05,BUFFY,and we have no idea what the deal is.
463.13,465.04,GILES,She is getting medical attention?
465.04,465.33,BUFFY,Yeah.
465.41,469.61,BUFFY,We have a highly trained medical staff
465.41,469.61,BUFFY,working round the clock to tell us diddly.
469.69,474.24,GILES,"I'm sorry. Still, you know,"
469.69,474.24,GILES,time and patience... both great comforts.
476.89,479.28,WILLOW,"Giles, where's your hat and cloak?"
479.37,481.52,RILEY,"Yeah, the hype was out of control."
481.61,483.76,DAWN,"Willow, you gotta see this."
483.85,486.89,DAWN,They have the coolest
483.85,486.89,DAWN,talis... mans. Talisguys.
487.85,492.13,DAWN,"Actually, I have a little"
487.85,492.13,DAWN,Scoobycentric deal to deal with first.
492.53,494.84,BUFFY,I put this before the group.
494.93,496.92,BUFFY,What the hell is it?
497.05,499.39,GILES,It appears to be paranormal in origin.
499.39,500.44,WILLOW,How can you tell?
500.89,503.12,GILES,"Well, it's so shiny."
503.21,504.38,BUFFY,I found it on patrol.
504.38,506.21,RILEY,May be more where that came from.
506.29,508.97,RILEY,I say we go back out again tonight.
509.61,510.6,BUFFY,Sure.
510.69,514.53,BUFFY,You can't patrol. Buffy said.
510.69,514.53,BUFFY,"No, I didn't."
514.61,518.21,DAWN,You said it'd be easier if you
514.61,518.21,DAWN,didn't have to look out for anybody.
518.29,520.3,BUFFY,I wasn't talking about Riley.
520.3,521.13,RILEY,Don't worry.
521.21,526.37,DAWN,She said you look even cuter when you're
521.21,526.37,DAWN,"all weak and kitteny, but you'd get hurt."
526.45,529.84,DAWN,So welcome to the club.
526.45,529.84,DAWN,She'll never let me go either.
534.25,536.61,DAWN,What? What?
537.49,540.21,RILEY,"Giles, you got that danger room"
537.49,540.21,RILEY,set up out back?
540.29,544.17,RILEY,I'm feeling the need for physical rehab.
540.29,544.17,RILEY,"Of course, yes."
544.25,545.53,RILEY,If any customers...
545.53,545.93,WILLOW,On it.
546.01,550.02,BUFFY,"Dawn, we're going."
548.61,550.6,WILLOW,"Buffy, wait."
552.05,554.17,WILLOW,Go easy on her.
554.17,554.73,BUFFY,Why?
555.45,559.49,WILLOW,I can't help it. I just have all this
555.45,559.49,WILLOW,involuntary empathy for Dawn.
559.57,562.61,WILLOW,"Cos she's, you know, a big spaz."
563.05,568.61,BUFFY,She's so annoying now Mom's sick. She's
563.05,568.61,BUFFY,all over her while I have to be the grownup.
568.69,574.21,BUFFY,The two of them are like the Giggle Twins.
568.69,574.21,BUFFY,Why can't I ever be "little pumpkin belly"?
574.29,577.41,WILLOW,While I don't feel qualified
574.29,577.41,WILLOW,"to address the last part,"
577.49,581.81,WILLOW,I can tell you that Dawn's not
577.49,581.81,WILLOW,"just the youngest, she's the baby."
581.89,584.17,WILLOW,Maybe your mom needs that right now.
584.25,586.24,BUFFY,Dawn doesn't care what my mom...
588.41,590.24,BUFFY,You just have no idea how much
590.24,592.61,DAWN,I wish I were an only child these days.
596.01,600.02,DAWN,Oops!
600.33,602.8,DAWN,We can't all be born
600.33,602.8,DAWN,with Chosen One reflexes.
602.89,604.45,BUFFY,Sh. Mom?
606.37,607.81,BUFFY,Mom?
607.89,609.88,DAWN,What's wrong?
610.85,612.61,BUFFY,It's just my head.
612.69,614.6,BUFFY,I'm taking you to the doctor.
614.6,616.24,JOYCE,"No, sweetheart. I'm fine."
616.65,619.8,BUFFY,We don't know that.
616.65,619.8,BUFFY,We don't know anything. We're going.
619.89,622.69,JOYCE,I just need my prescription. Please?
624.61,626.6,BUFFY,Hospital pharmacy open?
626.69,628.68,BUFFY,Ten minutes.
635.57,637.85,BEN,"Hey, it's Buffy, isn't it?"
638.93,641.4,BEN,Ben. But call me mannurse.
638.93,641.4,BEN,Everybody else does.
641.49,645.33,NIGHT WATCHMAN,I don't belong here.
641.49,645.33,NIGHT WATCHMAN,I have important instructions.
645.41,646.04,NIGHT WATCHMAN,Fascists!
646.04,648.49,BEN,Now you're hurting the nice intern.
648.57,650.96,BEN,I need nine cc's of phenobarbital...
653.17,654.32,BEN,Or not.
654.41,656.93,BEN,Let's strap him.
654.41,656.93,BEN,"For your own good, I promise."
657.01,661.72,BEN,"Not to be rampantly sexist, but you've"
657.01,661.72,BEN,got some serious muscles for a girl.
662.45,662.76,BUFFY,I...
662.76,664.52,BEN,Radioactivespider bite?
665.41,666.5,BUFFY,How'd you guess?
666.5,668.33,BEN,"I'm a doctor. Well, almost."
668.85,672.37,NIGHT WATCHMAN,Doesn't even help.
668.85,672.37,NIGHT WATCHMAN,Doesn't make a damn bit of difference!
672.45,675.33,NIGHT WATCHMAN,I've met this guy. He's a security guard.
675.41,676.88,BUFFY,He's not crazy.
676.88,678.25,BEN,If you say so.
678.33,680.85,BUFFY,They're coming at you.
680.93,683.21,BUFFY,"Don't think you're above it, missy."
683.29,687.37,BUFFY,They come through the family.
683.29,687.37,BUFFY,They get to your family!
687.45,689.49,BUFFY,My family? What do you mean?
689.49,692.32,BEN,Get him to Exam One. Now would be nice.
692.41,695.96,BEN,They come through the family.
692.41,695.96,BEN,Your family.
696.25,698.61,BEN,I'm real sorry about that.
698.69,700.37,BEN,Here.
700.45,701.65,BEN,For your mom?
701.65,702.84,BUFFY,Yeah. Thanks.
703.81,706.14,BEN,She's not feeling better?
706.14,706.89,BUFFY,Not yet.
706.97,708.96,BUFFY,But she will be.
709.05,712.09,BUFFY,I'm starting to figure out what's wrong.
759.17,760.32,MAN,There you are.
760.32,763.37,GLORY,I have been looking all over for you.
770.73,774.57,GILES,Thank you for choosing to shop at
770.73,774.57,GILES,the Magic Box. Please do come again.
780.69,783.29,GILES,Did you see that?
780.69,783.29,GILES,Real live customers.
783.37,789.05,GILES,"They came in, I gave them things, they gave"
783.37,789.05,GILES,me money and then they left. It's brilliant!
789.13,793.25,WILLOW,Congratulations.
789.13,793.25,WILLOW,You're an official capitalist running dog.
793.33,795.03,WILLOW,But on the orbular front
795.03,796.45,GILES,we're batting zeros.
796.53,798.97,GILES,"Well, we'll just have to keep trying."
799.05,802.25,GILES,"If there's anything you need help with,"
799.05,802.25,GILES,let me know.
803.09,806.04,ANYA,Your conjuring powder is overpriced.
806.04,806.61,GILES,Anya...
808.09,813.77,ANYA,I'm nearly out of money. I've never had to
808.09,813.77,ANYA,afford things before and it's making me bitter.
814.41,817.88,GILES,The change is palpable.
814.41,817.88,GILES,That stuff doesn't come cheap.
817.97,823.37,ANYA,"Well, you're getting ripped off. I could"
817.97,823.37,ANYA,hook you up direct with the troll that sheds it.
823.45,826.29,BUFFY,"Giles, I have an idea"
823.45,826.29,BUFFY,what's making my mom sick.
826.37,828.89,GILES,Have you spoken with her doctors?
828.89,832.24,BUFFY,They won't find anything. It's supernatural.
832.33,837.04,BUFFY,"The night watchman who found this thing,"
832.33,837.04,BUFFY,he went crazy overnight.
838.49,843.02,BUFFY,It won't hurt us. I had it on me all night.
841.09,844.48,BUFFY,"But this guy, he saw things. He said things."
844.57,846.48,GILES,Such as?
847.05,849.97,BUFFY,They'll come at me through my family.
850.05,851.01,GILES,Who will?
851.01,853.13,BUFFY,I don't know... yet.
853.21,858.45,BUFFY,"But whatever touched this guy, it made him"
853.21,858.45,BUFFY,see through what the rest of us are seeing.
858.53,861.81,BUFFY,He knew someone's hurting my mom
858.53,861.81,BUFFY,and they're trying to get to me.
861.89,866.84,GILES,"It's possible, but still... the ramblings"
861.89,866.84,GILES,of a madman aren't much to go on.
866.93,871.05,BUFFY,"Yeah, but it's a start. We need to find out"
866.93,871.05,BUFFY,"who's making my mom sick, and how."
871.13,873.12,WILLOW,Then what?
873.21,877.49,BUFFY,"Then I hunt them, find them, and kill them."
880.73,884.33,GLORY,"When you think about it,"
880.73,884.33,GLORY,I'm the victim here.
884.89,887.49,GLORY,"First off, I don't even wanna be here."
887.57,892.81,GLORY,"I'm not talking about this room, city, state"
887.57,892.81,GLORY,or planet. I'm talking about the mortal coil.
892.89,895.49,GLORY,It's disgusting.
895.57,900.44,GLORY,"The food, the clothes... the people."
900.53,903.13,GLORY,I could crap a better existence than this.
904.45,906.09,GLORY,But...
906.17,912.17,GLORY,Tell me if this next part gets a little too
906.17,912.17,GLORY,"personal, because I have boundary issues."
913.33,915.13,GLORY,But I'm hurt.
916.65,921.04,GLORY,Yes. By your incredibly selfish behaviour.
923.65,927.53,GLORY,"Newsflash, hairdo: it's not always about you."

1158.05,1164.21,XANDER,No one. It's just a long cultural tradition

1177.97,1182.76,BUFFY,Someone put a spell on my mom.

1295.61,1297.81,RILEY,You need me to light incense and pour sand?
1297.89,1301.49,BUFFY,Magic incense... and spooky sand.
1301.57,1303.25,BUFFY,The ritual itself is...
1303.25,1304.93,RILEY,Something you do alone.
1305.01,1309.05,RILEY,Are you sure this isn'tjust your way

1328.53,1330.73,RILEY,Had to give it back sometime.
1331.89,1336.76,BUFFY,I know you can handle yourself.
1331.89,1336.76,BUFFY,I just didn't wanna see you get hurt.
1337.77,1342.53,RILEY,Maybe instead of you trying to take care
1337.77,1342.53,RILEY,"of me, we agree to take care of each other."
1342.61,1344.89,RILEY,Deal?

1681.17,1684.56,GILES,We've uncovered

1718.01,1723.33,BUFFY,I'm gonna go back to the factory. Whoever

1751.85,1754.32,BUFFY,Slayer stuff.
1754.41,1756.64,BUFFY,I'm going out.
1756.73,1759.49,DAWN,Do you really think I care you're the Slayer?
1762.81,1765.09,BUFFY,What's that supposed to mean?

1841.92,1844.25,SPIKE,"Yeah, OK. Let me guess, you won't kill me?"
1845.93,1850.21,SPIKE,The whole crowdpleasing threats
1845.93,1850.21,SPIKE,and swagger routine. How original.
1850.29,1852.36,SPIKE,I'm just passing through.

1953.45,1955.84,JOYCE,Dawn. Where's Buffy?
1955.93,1958.16,DAWN,You don't have to worry about her.
1958.25,1962.09,JOYCE,You're probably right.
1958.25,1962.09,JOYCE,It's not like she's never patrolled before.
1962.17,1964.41,JOYCE,"Anyway, I was feeling kind of..."
1964.41,1966.64,DAWN,What's the medical term? Crappy.
1966.73,1968.72,JOYCE,So I called off the big night out.
