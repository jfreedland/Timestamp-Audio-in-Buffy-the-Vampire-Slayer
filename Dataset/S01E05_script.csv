14.96,16.8,Buffy,We haven't been properly introduced.
16.83,19.55,Buffy,"I'm Buffy, and you're... history!"
22.57,25.63,Giles,"Poor technique. Prioritising, subpar."
25.85,28.22,Giles,"Execution was adequate,"
28.25,30.93,Giles,but a bit too... bloody for my taste.
31.48,35.24,Buffy,"Giles, don't mention it. It was my pleasure"
31.48,35.24,Buffy,to make the world safe for humanity again.
35.62,37.7,Giles,I'm not saying that
35.62,37.7,Giles,your methods are without merit.
37.73,39.93,Giles,It's... You're spending
37.73,39.93,Giles,too much time and energy.
39.93,41.14,Giles,It should simply be
41.14,43.24,you're spending too much time and energy. It should simply be,"plunge and move on, plunge and..."
43.28,45.46,you're spending too much time and energy. It should simply be,Hello.
50.89,52.53,Buffy,"Oh, that's great!"
52.57,55.71,Buffy,"I kill 'em, you fence their stuff."
55.8,57.43,Buffy,What is it?
57.43,59.36,Giles,I don't know.
59.49,62.1,Buffy,But it bothers you.
59.49,62.1,Buffy,Yes. I...
62.14,64.18,Giles,I thought this vampire
62.14,64.18,Giles,"was just on a random kill,"
64.18,66.22,Giles,but it may be something else.
66.22,67.2,Buffy,Something big?
67.24,70.51,Giles,Yes. I'd best consult my books.
73.78,76.16,Master,And there will be a time of crisis."
76.24,78.95,Master,Of worlds hanging in the balance."
79.03,81.12,Master,And in this time shall come...
82.12,84.21,Master,the Anointed."
84.29,86.79,Master,The Master's great warrior."
87.46,89.96,Master,"And the Slayer will not know him,"
90.05,92.3,Master,"will not stop him,"
92.38,96.22,Master,and he will lead her into Hell."
96.31,98.39,Master,"As it is written,"
98.47,100.56,Master,so shall it be."
101.9,104.19,Master,"Five will die,"
104.27,108.82,Master,and from their ashes
104.27,108.82,Master,the Anointed shall rise."
109.86,114.24,Master,The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him
114.33,120.25,Master,and usher him to his immortal destiny."
120.33,122.42,Master,"As it is written,"
122.5,124.59,Master,so shall it be."
125.46,129.26,Master,And one of the Brethren
125.46,129.26,Master,shall go out hunting
129.29,132.11,Master,"the night before and get himself killed,"
132.15,136.06,Master,because he couldn't wait
132.15,136.06,Master,to finish his job before he ate.
136.73,138.48,Master,"Oh, wait."
140.69,143.32,Giles,That's not written anywhere.
145.61,149.32,Giles,The Anointed will be
145.61,149.32,Giles,my greatest weapon against the Slayer.
149.41,151.62,Giles,"If you fail to bring him to me,"
152.58,155.08,Giles,if you allow that girl to stop you...
161.38,163.47,Giles,Here endeth the lesson.
222.82,224.91,Giles,That symbol on the ring.
224.99,228.08,Giles,I believe it's the rune for fidelity but...
228.16,232.13,Giles,it doesn't connect with any
228.16,232.13,Giles,of the sects that I've studied.
232.21,236.38,Buffy,What about this? On the inside
232.21,236.38,Buffy,it's a sun and three stars.
236.4,238.58,Buffy,Haven't we seen that somewhere?
238.58,239.35,Giles,Let me see.
242.6,245.23,Giles,"No, I don't think this represents any..."
245.51,248.43,Buffy,Wait. It's right here. "Sun and three stars."
248.46,252.86,Giles,Ugh. Check these guys out.
248.46,252.86,Giles,I told you it looked familiar.
252.9,257.31,Giles,"By the Order of Aurelius."" Yes, you're right."
257.35,261.54,Buffy,Ooh! Two points for the Slayer
257.35,261.54,Buffy,while the Watcher has yet to score.
262.74,267,Buffy,Oh. Owen. Hi.
267.29,269.5,Giles,What do you want?
269.5,270.41,Owen,A book?
271.26,274.05,Buffy,"See, this is a school and we have students"
274.05,276.44,Buffy,and they check out books
274.05,276.44,Buffy,and then they learn things.
276.47,278.72,Giles,I was beginning to suspect that was a myth.
278.91,282.38,Owen,I lost my Emily... Dickinson.
282.41,286.19,Owen,It's dumb but... I like her around.
282.41,286.19,Owen,Kind of a security blanket.
286.27,289.94,Buffy,I have something like that.
286.27,289.94,Buffy,"Well, it's an actual blanket."
290.03,293.07,Buffy,And I don't really
290.03,293.07,Buffy,carry it around any more.
293.49,296.53,Buffy,"So! Emily Dickens, huh? She's great."
296.62,297.42,Owen,Dickinson.
297.42,298.7,Buffy,She's good also.
300.08,301.54,Giles,Poetry.
302.67,304.75,Owen,I didn't think I'd find you here.
306.67,307.37,Buffy,Why not?
307.37,308.76,Owen,I didn't mean...
308.84,311.89,Owen,I mean... I think you can read.
311.97,313.85,Buffy,"Oh, thanks."
313.93,316.1,Owen,But... you don't seem bookwormy.
317.1,319.54,Owen,The type of person to lock themselves
319.54,324.02,Owen,in a dark room with a lot of
319.54,324.02,Owen,"musty, old books."
324.06,327.19,Owen,"Oh, and I've offended you."
327.74,329.32,Buffy,No!
329.4,333.24,Buffy,"No, I'm just surprised"
329.4,333.24,Buffy,you gave any thought to what I'm like.
333.33,335.41,Owen,You shouldn't be.
337.08,339.46,Buffy,"Oh, well, I love books."
339.54,342.25,Buffy,"I mean, I really love books."
343.05,343.86,Owen,What's this?
343.86,345.13,Buffy,Oh... Not this one.
345.22,347.3,Giles,This one she doesn't love.
347.38,349.3,Giles,Oh! Emily Dickinson.
349.39,350.87,Buffy,We're both fans.
350.87,353.56,Giles,Yes. She's quite a good poet.
353.64,355.98,Giles,"I mean, for a..."
356.06,356.82,Buffy,A girl?
356.82,358.56,Giles,For an American.
358.65,360.73,Owen,I'll see you in math
360.82,363.32,Owen,if I open my eyes at some point.
363.4,365.49,Buffy,Cool.
367.16,370.37,Giles,The Order of Aurelius
367.16,370.37,Giles,is a very old and venerated sect.
370.45,372.91,Giles,"If they're here, it's for a good reason."
373,374.46,Buffy,That was Owen.
374.46,376.13,Giles,"Yes, I remember."
377.17,380.92,Buffy,Do you have any more copies
377.17,380.92,Buffy,of Emily Dickinson? I need one.
383.02,384.77,Giles,"Buffy, while the mere fact of you"
383.02,384.77,Giles,wanting to check out a book
384.77,387.6,Giles,"would be grounds for a national holiday,"
387.64,390.74,Giles,I think we should focus
387.64,390.74,Giles,on the problem at hand.
390.85,392.94,Buffy,Right. I'm sorry. You're right.
393.02,395.11,Buffy,Vampires.
395.77,399.34,Buffy,Oh. Does this outfit make me look fat?
400.86,402.95,Willow,Owen Thurman was talking to you?
403.03,404.87,Buffy,It's all true.
404.95,407.03,Willow,Wow! He hardly talks to anyone.
407.12,409.2,Willow,"He's solitary, mysterious."
409.29,412.67,Willow,He can brood for 40 minutes straight.
409.29,412.67,Willow,I've clocked him.
412.75,414.84,Buffy,"He was so nice, it was eerie."
414.92,417.48,Willow,What did you guys have to talk about?
417.48,418.59,Buffy,Emily Dickinson.
418.67,420.76,Buffy,He reads Emily Dickinson?
420.84,423.43,Willow,"He's sensitive, yet manly."
423.54,426.33,Willow,But wait. You've never even read her.
426.39,428.48,Willow,You vixen!
428.56,431.34,Xander,Has anybody given any thought
428.56,431.34,Xander,to what this green stuff is?
431.34,433.94,Buffy,I'm avoiding the subject.
433.98,437.28,Xander,I think it's kale.
433.98,437.28,Xander,Or possibly string cheese.
437.53,439.68,Xander,"So, Buffy, how'd the slaying go last night?"
439.69,441.37,Buffy,Xander!
441.4,443.54,Xander,I mean... how'd the laying go?
444.83,448.08,Buffy,"No, I don't mean that either."
444.83,448.08,Buffy,"It went fine, thank you."
448.17,450.79,Buffy,There's some new hoitytoity
448.17,450.79,Buffy,vampire sect in town.
450.88,452.37,Willow,That's bad.
452.38,454.77,Xander,"Hey, they're bringing in"
452.38,454.77,Xander,muchneeded tourist dollars.
457.02,457.34,Buffy,Ooh. Look at Mr Excitement.
457.43,459.68,Buffy,Owen. He's all alone.
460.3,462.77,Buffy,Maybe somebody should sit with him.
462.85,465.06,Willow,"Mm, just to be polite."
466.52,468.19,Willow,Good luck.
470.82,473.54,Xander,"OK, what just happened?"
473.58,474.95,Cordelia,Look! An empty seat.
477.03,478.78,Owen,Let me get that.
478.78,479.54,Buffy,Thanks.
479.62,483.48,Buffy,"Boy, Cordelia's hips are wider than I thought."
483.51,485.54,Owen,At least you don't have to eat
483.51,485.54,Owen,your Soylent Green.
485.98,490.34,Cordelia,"Owen, a bunch of us are loitering"
485.98,490.34,Cordelia,at the Bronze tonight. You there?
490.42,491.52,Owen,Who else's going?
491.52,493.13,Cordelia,"Well, I'm gonna be there."
493.22,494.28,Owen,Who else?
494.28,496.64,Cordelia,You mean besides me?
497.47,499.52,Owen,"Buffy, what about you?"
499.52,499.98,Buffy,What?
500.06,501.73,Cordelia,"No, no, no."
501.81,503.94,Cordelia,"She, uh... She doesn't like fun."
504.38,506.92,Owen,How about we meet there at eight?
507.73,510.55,Buffy,Yeah. Eight.
510.59,512.85,Buffy,There.
513.31,516.91,Buffy,It's not a big deal. It's just
513.31,516.91,Buffy,a bunch of people getting together.
516.99,518.45,Willow,It's a very big deal!
518.45,519.08,Buffy,It's not.
519.88,522.15,Willow,It is! Tell her.
522.18,524.07,Giles,I'm afraid it's very big.
524.07,524.82,Willow,Thank you.
524.86,526.96,Willow,Wait. What are you talking about?
527.47,529.01,Willow,What are you talking about?
529.01,529.3,Buffy and Willow,Boys.
529.88,532.5,Giles,"Yes, well, I'm talking about trouble."
529.88,532.5,Giles,A violent and disturbing
532.5,534.24,Giles,prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
534.24,535.36,Buffy,The Order of Aurelius.
535.39,537.71,Giles,You were spoton about the connection.
537.75,540.7,Giles,I've looked at the writings of Aurelius himself.
540.73,544.03,Giles,He prophesied that the brethren of
540.73,544.03,Giles,his order would come to the Master and...
544.03,545.56,Giles,bring him the Anointed.
545.6,546.18,Willow,Who's that?
546.18,548.2,Giles,"Well, I don't know exactly. A warrior."
548.28,552.03,Giles,But it says "He will rise
548.28,552.03,Giles,from the ashes of the five...
552.07,555.32,Giles,"on the evening of the 1,000th day"
552.07,555.32,Giles,after the advent of Septus."
555.36,557.02,Buffy,"Well we'll be ready, whenever it is."
557.06,558.4,Giles,Which is tonight.
558.4,559.34,Buffy,"Tonight, OK."
559.37,561.19,Buffy,Not OK! It can't be tonight!
561.19,563.02,Giles,My calculations are precise.
563.06,565.63,Buffy,They're bad calculations! Bad!
565.72,568.43,Willow,Buffy has a really important date.
568.43,568.83,Buffy,Owen.
568.86,570.9,Giles,All right.
568.86,570.9,Giles,"I'll just jump in my time machine,"
570.93,573.02,Giles,go back to the 12th century
570.93,573.02,Giles,and ask the vampires to
573.02,576.48,Giles,postpone their ancient prophecy for a few
573.02,576.48,Giles,days while you take in dinner and a show.
576.51,579.28,Buffy,"OK, at this point you're abusing sarcasm."
579.31,581.95,Giles,"Buffy, this is no ordinary vampire."
581.98,584.52,Giles,We have to stop him
581.98,584.52,Giles,before he reaches the Master.
584.56,587.03,Buffy,But... cute guy!
587.06,589.44,Buffy,Teenager! Postpubescent fantasies!
589.48,592.11,Giles,Those will just have to be put on hold.
592.14,596.42,Giles,"The Dark Forces are aligning against us,"
592.14,596.42,Giles,and we have a chance to beat them back.
596.5,598.88,Giles,Tonight we go into battle.
604.93,606.89,Giles,Perhaps I miscalculated.
606.89,608.27,Buffy,I'm thinking yes.
612.14,617.23,Giles,"Well, you know what they say: 90 percent"
612.14,617.23,Giles,of the vampireslaying game isis waiting.
617.32,620.26,Buffy,You couldn't have told me 90 percent ago?
620.26,623.12,Giles,We've certainly waited here long enough.
623.2,626.79,Buffy,"Besides, there aren't any fresh graves."
623.2,626.79,Buffy,Who's gonna rise?
627.7,629.87,Giles,"Apparently no one, tonight."
630.17,633.21,Buffy,Then I can bail? I can go
630.17,633.21,Buffy,to the Bronze and find Owen?
633.29,635.92,Giles,Very well. Follow your hormones if you want.
638.02,639.23,Giles,But I assume I don't have to
638.02,639.23,Giles,warn you about the...
639.23,641.94,Giles,hazards of becoming
639.23,641.94,Giles,personally involved with someone 
641.97,644.38,Giles,who's unaware of your unique condition.
644.42,646.48,Buffy,"Yeah, yeah, I read the back of the box."
646.48,648.64,Giles,"If your identity as a slayer is revealed,"
648.68,652.65,Giles,it could put you and all those
648.68,652.65,Giles,around you in grave danger.
652.68,658.02,Buffy,"Well, in that case, I won't wear my button"
652.68,658.02,Buffy,that says "I'm A Slayer. Ask Me How."
658.78,661.51,Giles,Good night.
665.12,670.29,Giles,"Five shall die, and from their ashes"
665.12,670.29,Giles,the Anointed shall rise."
670.33,673.19,Giles,I was sure it was tonight.
692.11,694.2,Collin,I went on an airplane.
694.28,697.45,Andrew,A pale horse emerged
694.28,697.45,Andrew,with Death as its rider.
697.53,700.6,Andrew,You will be judged.
700.79,703.91,Andrew,You will be judged.

764.11,766.61,Andrew,That day's gonna bring fire.
766.7,769.2,Andrew,Fire comin' down. Judgment.
770.45,772.08,Andrew,Don't think you're ready.
772.08,773.58,Driver,Ready to look upon him.
773.66,777.42,Andrew,"If there's sin in there,"
773.66,777.42,Andrew,there's sin all around. It's a liquid.
777.83,779.94,Andrew,On that day there won't be anybody
779.94,781.25,Driver,tellin' us what to do
781.34,786.02,Andrew,or why we're doin' it.
784.09,785.93,Driver,You can't prepare.
786.93,789.56,Driver,On that day...
786.93,789.56,Driver,You gotta sit down.
789.64,791.52,Driver,OK?
793.48,796.36,Andrew,Are you willing to stand
793.48,796.36,Andrew,with the righteous?
817.8,820.3,Driver,Is everyone OK?
836.03,838.11,Driver,Are you all right?
842.87,844.45,Driver,Can you move?
867.02,868.7,Xander,So you just went home?
868.7,870.69,Buffy,What was I supposed to do?
870.73,873.59,Buffy,"Say to Owen: ""Sorry, I was late."
870.73,873.59,Buffy,I was sitting in a cemetery
873.62,875.73,Buffy,with a librarian waiting
873.62,875.73,Buffy,for a vampire to rise
875.77,877.87,Buffy,so I could prevent an evil prophecy
875.77,877.87,Buffy,from coming to pass"?
877.9,880.28,Xander,Or... flat tyre?
880.37,886.02,Buffy,I can't take this any more.
880.37,886.02,Buffy,I feel like everyone is staring at me.
886.02,886.2,Buffy,"The big, hideous, dateless monster."
886.24,888.11,Buffy,"What? Yeah, that's right, I have no life."
888.11,892.91,Buffy,"C'mon, nothin' to see here, pal."
888.11,892.91,Buffy,Move it along!
893.24,896.26,Xander,"You're acting a little overly, aren't you?"
893.24,896.26,Xander,"I mean, you could have any guy in school."
896.3,899.61,Buffy,He's not "any guy". He's more... Oweny.
899.65,903.32,Xander,"Sure, he's got a certain Owenosity,"
899.65,903.32,Xander,but... that's not hard to find.
903.36,905.76,Xander,"I mean, a lot of guys read."
905.79,907.84,Xander,I can read.
909.94,912.06,Owen,"Hey, Buffy."
912.06,913.03,Buffy,Owen.
913.11,915.76,Xander,"Oh, look. It's Owen."
915.8,919.17,Xander,Buffy and Owen. And Xander. That'd be me.
919.21,922.15,Owen,Where were you last night?
922.15,922.49,Buffy,Oh.
922.53,927.42,Buffy,"Well, um, my watch broke and"
922.53,927.42,Buffy,we don't have any... clocks in our house
927.45,930.29,Buffy,so I didn't know what time it was
927.45,930.29,Buffy,or even what day it was.
930.33,932.95,Owen,I thought I was the only one
930.33,932.95,Owen,that happened to.
932.99,935.68,Owen,How about we try it again for tonight?
935.72,938.69,Owen,I'll even lend you my watch.
941.48,944.27,Buffy,Tonight? You and me?
944.36,948.45,Owen,"Well, we could invite the Chess Club"
944.36,948.45,Owen,but... they drink and start fights.
948.53,955.47,Buffy,"Oh, no, it's just... Well, I sort of heard"
948.53,955.47,Buffy,that... you and Cordelia were somewhat...
955.5,957.97,Owen,all over each other. A little.
960.02,961.98,Owen,I danced with her a couple of times.
960.02,961.98,Owen,She's... kinda grabby.
962.25,966.3,Buffy,"Well, let's see."
962.25,966.3,Buffy,If I rearrange that and I push that to
966.38,968.22,Buffy,Sure! Tonight'll work.
968.3,970.55,Owen,Great. I'll pick you up at seven?
970.55,970.89,Buffy,Um...
970.97,971.58,Buffy,Seven.
971.58,975.27,Owen,That's when the little hand's there.
975.35,977.85,Buffy,Oh. Between the six and the eight.
979.36,981.44,Owen,I'll see you then.
984.74,987.41,Buffy,Tonight. Isn't that so...
987.95,988.6,Xander,What?
988.6,990.16,Buffy,Me and Owen.
994,996.08,Xander,Yeah. "So" it is.
998.34,1000.5,Xander,It sure is "so".
1007.76,1009.13,Buffy,Hey! How's it goin'?
1009.13,1009.81,Giles,All right.
1009.89,1012.9,Buffy,That's great. I see we're still
1009.89,1012.9,Buffy,workin' on that Anointed One problem.
1012.9,1016.38,Buffy,"That'll probably take you a few days,"
1012.9,1016.38,Buffy,"right? I mean, that's one obscure prophecy."
1016.47,1020.02,Giles,"Yes. Well, there are"
1016.47,1020.02,Giles,quite a few interpretations.
1018.04,1021.42,Buffy,"So, tonight's lookin' pretty slow, right?"
1018.04,1021.42,Buffy,Probably best to relax and regroup.
1021.46,1028.28,Buffy,No big disasters coming. That is so good!
1021.46,1028.28,Buffy,"I will see you tomorrow, then. Bye!"
1029,1032.09,Giles,She is the strangest girl.
1033.13,1035.42,Master,You have done well.
1035.5,1040.02,Master,Everything is in place.
1038.09,1040.51,Master,"When this night's work is done,"
1040.59,1042.97,Master,I will have a mighty ally.
1043.05,1049.55,Master,I'll be one step closer to freeing myself
1043.05,1049.55,Master,from this... mystical prison.
1053.95,1056.43,Master,"I've been trapped down here so long,"
1053.95,1056.43,Master,I've nearly forgotten
1056.43,1058.92,Master,what it's like on the surface.
1058.95,1062.83,Master,"Well, there'll be time enough to remember"
1063.36,1066.02,Master,when I rule it.
1066.06,1069.05,Master,"If she tries to stop you,"
1069.09,1070.5,Master,kill her.
1070.54,1075.99,Master,"Give your own lives,"
1070.54,1075.99,Master,but do not fail to bring the Anointed.
1076.03,1078.79,Master,I know you won't disappoint me.
1080.59,1082.27,Master,Bug.
1084.94,1085.75,Willow,Pick.
1085.75,1086.23,Buffy,OK.
1086.31,1088.77,Buffy,"Do I want to appear shy, coy and naive"
1088.96,1092.03,Buffy,"or unrestrained, insatiable and aggressive?"
1092.11,1094.18,Xander,"You know, Owen is a little homespun."
1094.18,1097.49,Xander,He probably doesn't like
1094.18,1097.49,Xander,that overly assertive look.
1097.53,1099.99,Xander,"Oh, hey. Here's something."
1100.08,1103.41,Xander,"A nice, comfy overcoat and a ski cap."
1103.5,1106.13,Xander,The earflaps'll bring out your eyes.
1106.75,1111.64,Buffy,Maybe I should mixandmatch.
1106.75,1111.64,Buffy,"OK, guy's opinion."
1111.68,1115.21,Xander,Which do you think Owen will like better?
1115.21,1117.02,Buffy,The red or the peach?
1115.04,1118.89,Buffy,"Oh, you mean for kissing you and then"
1115.04,1118.89,Buffy,telling all his friends how easy you are
1118.97,1122.69,Buffy,so the whole school loses respect for you
1118.97,1122.69,Buffy,and then talks behind your back?
1122.77,1126.74,Buffy,The red's fine.
1122.77,1126.74,Buffy,Thanks. I'll go with the peach.
1128.11,1130.47,Willow,Here. Put this on.
1131.56,1134.12,Xander,You're not botherin' me.
1136.95,1138.59,Willow,So where is he taking you?
1138.59,1139.66,Buffy,"Oh, I don't know."
1139.75,1141.83,Buffy,Where do you suppose
1139.75,1141.83,Buffy,young kids go on dates these days?
1141.92,1146.26,Willow,"Well, I read somewhere once"
1141.92,1146.26,Willow,that sometimes they go to movies.
1146.34,1148.72,Buffy,Movies? Interesting.
1148.8,1153.51,Willow,And I saw on TV once
1148.8,1153.51,Willow,a bunch of people our age went to a party.
1153.6,1157.94,Buffy,Wow! I never knew being a teenager
1153.6,1157.94,Buffy,was so full of possibilities.
1163.23,1164.61,Buffy,That's Owen.
1166.49,1167.42,Buffy,That's Giles.
1167.42,1168.57,Giles,We need to talk.
1168.66,1170.16,Buffy,Buffy's not home.
1170.19,1172.8,Giles,My calculations may not've been
1170.19,1172.8,Giles,as far off as I thought.
1172.87,1175.8,Buffy,Five die in van accident"?
1175.83,1178.91,Giles,Out of the ashes of five
1175.83,1178.91,Giles,shall rise the one"
1178.91,1181.38,Giles,That's the prophecy. Five people have died!
1181.42,1182.78,Buffy,In a car crash.
1182.81,1186.06,Giles,"I know it doesn't quite follow,"
1182.81,1186.06,Giles,butbut it's worth investigating. Look!
1186.09,1187.48,Giles,"Among the dead was Andrew Borba,"
1187.48,1189.73,Giles,whom the police sought for questioning
1187.48,1189.73,Giles,in a double murder."
1189.97,1192.06,Buffy,He may be the Anointed One.
1192.14,1193.55,Buffy,The bodies were taken to
1193.55,1195.49,Giles,Sunnydale Funeral Home. We can...
1195.53,1197.85,Buffy,"Giles, why do you want to hurt me?"
1197.85,1199.08,Giles,I beg your pardon?
1199.12,1199.9,Owen,Hey.
1201.74,1203.82,Owen,Uh... Hi.
1203.9,1204.93,Giles,You have a date?
1204.93,1205.63,Buffy,"Yes, but..."
1205.63,1207.87,Buffy,I'll return those
1205.63,1207.87,Buffy,overdue books by tomorrow.
1207.9,1209.71,Giles,You're not getting off that easily.
1209.71,1211.63,Owen,"Man, you really care about your work!"
1211.91,1214.48,Willow,Uh... Owen?
1214.52,1217.21,Xander,"Yeah, a couple of things about tonight."
1218.46,1220.75,Giles,Another date?
1218.46,1220.75,Giles,Don't you ever do anything else?
1220.75,1222.84,Buffy,This is the first date! There's never been a date.
1222.84,1224.65,Buffy,OK? This is my maiden voyage!
1224.69,1226.64,Owen,"What, she doesn't like to dance?"
1226.72,1229.22,Xander,"Well, it's a little too late"
1226.72,1229.22,Xander,to do anything about that.
1229.31,1231.68,Xander,"Uh, you should probably know"
1229.31,1231.68,Xander,that Buffy doesn't like to be kissed.
1231.69,1233.85,Xander,Actually she doesn't like to be touched.
1233.85,1234.34,Willow,Xander...
1234.38,1236.25,Xander,"As a matter of fact,"
1234.38,1236.25,Xander,don't even look at her.
1236.28,1237.8,Buffy,We don't even know if this is anything.
1237.8,1238.31,Giles,"No, we don't."
1238.31,1240.09,Buffy,And I haven't had a day off for a while.
1240.09,1240.31,Giles,True.
1240.35,1243.12,Buffy,And a cranky slayer is a careless slayer.
1243.15,1246.7,Giles,"Buffy, maintaining"
1243.15,1246.7,Giles,a normal social life as a slayer
1246.79,1249.16,Giles,is problematic at best.
1249.25,1252.33,Buffy,This is the '90s 
1249.25,1252.33,Buffy,"the 1990s, in point of fact "
1252.36,1257.74,Buffy,and I can do both. Clark Kent
1252.36,1257.74,Buffy,has a job. I just wanna go on a date.
1257.77,1260.09,Giles,"Well, I suppose it was a fairly slim lead."
1260.28,1263.35,Buffy,"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
1260.28,1263.35,Buffy,"And I won't go far, OK?"
1263.43,1265.96,Buffy,"If the apocalypse comes, beep me."
1266.1,1267.57,Owen,Is everything cool?
1267.57,1268.19,Buffy,All set.
1268.27,1271.14,Giles,"Yes, and you'll face"
1268.27,1271.14,Giles,a pretty hefty fine in the morning.
1271.17,1273.35,Buffy,"Well, bye. Don't wait up."
1274.69,1276.78,Willow,Is something going on?
1276.86,1278.74,Giles,"Probably not, no. I..."
1278.78,1282.14,Giles,I suppose I'll just...
1278.78,1282.14,Giles,go to the funeral home in case.
1282.17,1284.74,Giles,Just see if anything comes up.
1284.77,1286.71,Willow,This is bad.
1286.79,1288.79,Xander,I wish it was just bad.
1288.88,1291.22,Willow,We should go along.
1291.26,1293.11,Xander,"Yeah, you're right."
1293.15,1294.98,Xander,I don't trust that Owen guy.
1294.98,1296.87,Willow,It's the eyes. They're crazy.
1296.91,1300.31,Willow,"Xander, we should go with Giles."
1296.91,1300.31,Willow,He could get in trouble.
1300.43,1303.61,Xander,"Oh, he's gone! He's gonna be all right."
1303.64,1305.71,Xander,"He's, like, Super Librarian. You know?"
1305.75,1310.55,Xander,"Everyone forgets, Willow,"
1305.75,1310.55,Xander,that knowledge is the ultimate weapon.

1329.63,1334.43,Owen,The thing about Emily Dickinson I love
1329.63,1334.43,Owen,is that she's just so incredibly morbid.
1334.51,1336.6,Owen,"A lot of loss, a lot of death."
1336.68,1338.47,Owen,It gets me.
1338.89,1341.44,Owen,"And a lot about bees, for some reason."
1341.52,1345.44,Buffy,Did she have a tragic
1341.52,1345.44,Buffy,and romantic life with a lot of bees?
1345.52,1348.4,Owen,Quiet. Kind of sequestered and uneventful.
1348.49,1351.15,Owen,Which I can really relate to.
1351.15,1353.07,Buffy,I don't get out much.
1353.11,1354.62,Buffy,I don't get that.
1354.62,1355.87,Owen,It's my fault.
1355.95,1358.58,Owen,I just find most girls pretty frivolous.
1358.66,1363.59,Owen,"I mean, there's a lot more important"
1358.66,1363.59,Owen,things in life than dating. You know?
1366.05,1368.22,Owen,Did I say something wrong?
1369.05,1370.97,Owen,No.

1398.63,1401.8,Owen,One minute you're right there.
1398.63,1401.8,Owen,I got you figured.
1401.88,1405.26,Owen,"The next, it's like you're two people."
1406.3,1407.89,Buffy,Really?
1407.97,1410.27,Buffy,Which one do you like better?

1441.51,1443.84,Cordelia,Oh. OK. You wanna dance?
1443.93,1446.06,Owen,"No, I'm still here with Buffy."
1446.14,1448.73,Cordelia,You are so good to help the needy.
1448.81,1453.03,Buffy,"Cordelia, Owen and I would like to be"
1448.81,1453.03,Buffy,"alone right now, and for that to happen,"
1453.06,1455.8,Buffy,you would have to go

1601.79,1603.02,Giles,What are you doing here?
1603.02,1604.82,Xander,We saw two guys going in after you.
1604.6,1605.69,Xander,Are they...?
1605.69,1606.51,Giles,They are.
1606.51,1608.81,Giles,"Listen, you should get to safety."
1608.84,1611.4,Willow,Can you get out this window?
1611.4,1612.77,Giles,I'm afraid not.
1612.8,1616.13,Xander,"Look, I hate to state the obvious,"
1612.8,1616.13,Xander,but this looks like a job for Buffy?
1616.21,1619.8,Giles,She has a beeping thing.
1619.88,1621.74,Giles,"No phone, of course."
1621.78,1624.7,Xander,"Look, we'll get her."
1621.78,1624.7,Xander,Just... hang in there.
1627.14,1629.43,Giles,Do hurry.
1634.86,1637.72,Owen,You want something to eat?
1637.72,1642.02,Buffy,Sure. Just make it something fattening.
1640.05,1641.9,Cordelia,What a disgusting display!
1641.99,1646.1,Cordelia,Is that really appropriate behaviour
1641.99,1646.1,Cordelia,in a public forum?
1646.49,1650.46,Cordelia,"I mean, I've never seen a girl"
1646.49,1650.46,Cordelia,throw herself at a guy like that.
1653.25,1659.02,Cordelia,"Oooh! Hello, salty goodness!"
1657.51,1659.8,Cordelia,Pick up that phone. Call 911.
1659.88,1664.39,Cordelia,That boy is gonna need some serious oxygen
1659.88,1664.39,Cordelia,after I'm through with him.
1668.43,1669.6,Angel,Buffy.
1669.6,1670.77,Buffy,Angel.
1671.27,1673.36,Cordelia,Why is this happening to me?
1673.44,1675.57,Angel,I was hoping I'd find you here.
1675.65,1676.23,Buffy,You were?
1676.23,1678.82,Angel,There's serious stuff happening tonight.
1678.91,1680.34,Angel,You need to be out there.
1680.34,1681.32,Buffy,"No. Not you, too?"
1681.41,1682.81,Angel,What do you know?
1682.81,1685.87,Buffy,"Prophecy, Anointed One, yadayadayada."
1685.95,1688.79,Angel,So you know. Fine.
1685.95,1688.79,Angel,I just thought I'd warn you.
1688.87,1692.54,Buffy,Warn me?
1688.87,1692.54,Buffy,See that guy over there at the bar?
1692.58,1694.56,Buffy,He came here to be with me.
1694.56,1696.17,Angel,You're here on a date?
1696.95,1700.25,Buffy,Yes! Why is it such a shock to everyone?
1700.28,1702.36,Owen,Here you go.
1702.43,1704.1,Buffy,Oh.
1706.69,1708.86,Buffy,"Owen, this is Angel."
1708.94,1711.03,Buffy,"Angel, this is Owen,"
1711.11,1712.61,Buffy,who is my date.
1713.24,1714.32,Angel,Hey.
1714.82,1716.28,Angel,Hey.
1717.32,1719.79,Owen,"So, where do you know Buffy from?"
1719.87,1721.5,Angel,Work.
1721.58,1723.16,Owen,You work?
1723.16,1724.21,Willow,Buffy!
1724.25,1727.08,Owen,Look at this. They show up everywhere.
1727.12,1728.02,Owen,Interesting.
1728.02,1730.27,Xander,You don't know the half of it.
1730.3,1733.43,Angel,What's he doing here?
1730.3,1733.43,Angel,I guess the same thing you're doing here.
1733.47,1735.51,Buffy,Excuse me. What are any of you doing here?
1735.55,1738.08,Xander,"Look, we gotta get to... Uhhhh."
1738.11,1740.6,Xander,We thought it'd be fun
1738.11,1740.6,Xander,if we made this a double date.
1740.68,1743.31,Buffy,I didn't know you guys
1740.68,1743.31,Buffy,were seeing each other.
1743.4,1746.36,Willow,"Oh, yeah. Well, We knew"
1743.4,1746.36,Willow,it would happen eventually.
1746.44,1748.53,Willow,"So we figured, hey, why fight it?"
1748.61,1751.4,Owen,And you guys are thinking double...?
1751.49,1753.53,Xander,Cause of... the fun!
1754.2,1757.65,Owen,And you're here because of work?
1757.69,1762.02,Xander,"Hey, maybe we should all"
1757.69,1762.02,Xander,go somewhere together.
1760.05,1764.15,Buffy,"Gee, that's so nice of you to ask, but Owen"
1760.05,1764.15,Buffy,"and I were, well, sort of... Owen and I."
1764.19,1767.59,Xander,You know what would be cool?
1764.19,1767.59,Xander,The Sunnydale Funeral Home.
1767.67,1770.05,Willow,I've always wanted to go there.
1770.13,1772.14,Buffy,The funeral home?
1772.14,1774.48,Owen,"Actually, that sounds kinda cool!"
1772.14,1774.48,Owen,Do you think we could all sneak in?
1774.48,1778.7,Xander,We saw some guys in there before.
1774.48,1778.7,Xander,They seemed to be having fun.
1778.86,1781.27,Buffy,Bite me.
1784.79,1786.77,Buffy,"Owen, I gotta go."
1786.81,1788.41,Owen,I thought we were going
1786.81,1788.41,Owen,to the funeral home.
1788.49,1793.23,Buffy,"No, you can't. I'll tell you what."
1788.49,1793.23,Buffy,I'll be back in a little while.
1793.27,1794.84,Owen,Buffy...
1796.76,1797.96,Owen,What's the deal?
1798,1800.4,Owen,D'you want to bail on me?
1800.4,1801.45,Buffy,"No! No, no."
1802.05,1805.05,Buffy,Remember when you said
1802.05,1805.05,Buffy,I was like two different people?
1805.13,1807.16,Buffy,"Well, one of them has to go."
1807.19,1809.72,Buffy,But the other one is having
1807.19,1809.72,Buffy,"a really, really good time"
1809.75,1813.62,Buffy,and will come back. I promise.
1826.24,1829.37,Owen,She's the strangest girl.
1836.59,1837.41,Buffy,Which way?
1837.41,1839.3,Willow,The room's around back.
1845.64,1847.64,Buffy,Damn it!
1847.72,1849.81,Owen,This is so cool!
1849.89,1852.69,Buffy,Owen! You can't be here.
1852.77,1854.69,Owen,"Oh, and you guys are allowed?"
1854.77,1856.85,Owen,Are we gonna see a dead body?
1856.85,1858.07,Buffy,Possibly several.
1858.15,1860.24,Buffy,"Guys, watch him."
1860.32,1861.86,Owen,Is she mad?
1861.95,1866.54,Willow,"Oh, she just wants to make sure there are"
1861.95,1866.54,Willow,"no guards, so we don't get in trouble."
1866.62,1869.21,Owen,Good thinkin'.
1866.62,1869.21,Owen,Good thinkin'.
1888.77,1890.65,Buffy,Giles?
1905.79,1906.48,Buffy,Giles!
1906.48,1908.79,Giles,"It is you. Oh, good."
1908.88,1910.96,Buffy,What happened?
1911.05,1913.88,Giles,Two more of the Brethren
1911.05,1913.88,Giles,came in here. They came after me.
1913.97,1916.13,Giles,But I was more than a match for them.
1916.22,1917.57,Buffy,Meaning...?
1917.57,1918.3,Giles,I hid.
1918.39,1922.85,Giles,But this chap was good enough
1918.39,1922.85,Giles,to bunk with me till they went away.
1922.93,1926.73,Buffy,"But were they here after you,"
1922.93,1926.73,Buffy,or was it that prophecy thing?
1926.81,1929.11,Giles,That's what we have to find out.
1928.99,1931.61,Giles,I don't know what these...
1928.99,1931.61,Giles,Brethren mean to do exactly.
1931.86,1934.96,Giles,Find the Anointed?
1931.86,1934.96,Giles,"Oror give him something, perhaps?"
1934.96,1938.43,Giles,It's all very vague.
1934.96,1938.43,Giles,And the Anointed may be long gone.
1938.47,1939.65,Buffy,But he may not be.
1939.65,1940.77,Giles,We must find out.
1940.8,1943.92,Buffy,OK. I just need to get Owen and
1940.8,1943.92,Buffy,the others out of harm's way first.
1943.96,1946.37,Giles,Owen? You brought a date?
1946.37,1949.07,Buffy,I didn't bring him. He came.
1949.1,1951.44,Giles,"Buffy, when I said you could"
1949.1,1951.44,Giles,"slay vampires and have a social life,"
1951.44,1953.24,Giles,I didn't mean at the same time.
1953.24,1953.65,Buffy,I know.
1953.69,1954.51,Buffy,I'll get rid of him.
1954.51,1956.06,Giles,You can't make him go out there alone.
1956.09,1958.1,Giles,We don't know where the Brethren are.
1958.18,1959.14,Giles,I'll just...
1959.14,1960.27,Buffy,"No! No, Giles."
1960.35,1963.4,Buffy,"If he sees you, he's gonna have more"
1960.35,1963.4,Buffy,questions than he already does right now.
1963.48,1965.57,Buffy,I'll... take care of it.
1970.11,1971.65,Willow,Is everything OK?
1971.65,1972.2,Buffy,It is.
1972.28,1973.14,Xander,And we'll be leaving?
1973.14,1974.53,Owen,We're not done lookin' around yet.
1974.57,1979.71,Buffy,"No, he's right. So let's find a nice,"
1974.57,1979.71,Buffy,"safe, fun room to look around in."
1983.02,1983.63,Owen,We tried the office here but it's locked.
1983.71,1986.26,Buffy,"No, it's not."
1989.51,1991.93,Owen,I don't think we'll find much in here.
1992.01,1994.93,Buffy,That's the plan.
1994.93,1995.48,Owen,OK.
1997.19,1997.66,Owen,What?
1997.66,1999.27,Buffy,I have to go now.
1999.36,2002.05,Buffy,"Um, to the bathroom."
1999.36,2002.05,Buffy,I have to go to the bathroom.
2002.08,2005.73,Buffy,"If you hear anything, like a security guard"
2002.08,2005.73,Buffy,"or something, just be really quiet."
2005.73,2008.61,Buffy,And barricade the door.
2026.09,2027.12,Buffy,Eugh. Parts.
2027.12,2028.23,Giles,Keep looking.
2028.23,2030.47,Giles,He must be here somewhere.
2038.69,2040.78,Owen,What are you guys doin'?
2040.86,2042.95,Willow,"Uh, just in case."
2055.13,2058.07,Owen,"Oh, my."
2071.73,2072.3,Buffy,Nothing.
2072.3,2074.15,Giles,The Anointed must be gone.
2075.61,2077.69,Buffy,I guess.
2077.78,2081.87,Buffy,"I mean, this is where they keep"
2077.78,2081.87,Buffy,"all the dead bodies, right?"
2083.45,2085.75,Owen,"I read a lot about death, but"
2085.83,2088.96,Owen,I've never really seen a dead body before.
2092.17,2095.38,Owen,Do they usually move?
2113.36,2115.57,Andrew,I have been judged.
2122.24,2124.96,Owen,What's goin' on?
2131.67,2133.34,Buffy,"Oh, no."
2134.97,2136.84,Andrew,He is risen in me!
2136.93,2139.01,Andrew,He fills my head with song!
2139.1,2141.14,Andrew,Pork and beans.
2141.23,2143.01,Andrew,Pork and beans!
2143.01,2144.31,Xander,Gimme that!
2144.4,2146.27,Andrew,I can smell you.
2148.07,2150.69,Andrew,"You're the chaff, unblessed."
2150.78,2154.87,Andrew,I'll suck the blood from your hearts.
2150.78,2154.87,Andrew,He says I may!
2156.03,2157.04,Xander,He's in there!
2157.04,2157.91,Buffy,Go! Get out!
2157.99,2159.75,Xander,She'll be OK. Come on.
2175.51,2177.6,Willow,I think he's coming this way.
2183.4,2185.53,Owen,"Oh, God, this is too much!"
2186.65,2188.04,Buffy,What have you got?
2188.04,2188.42,Giles,What?
2188.46,2190.23,Buffy,What did you bring? D'you've a stake?
2190.23,2190.66,Giles,"Oh, uh..."
2190.74,2192.4,Buffy,Thank you.
2192.4,2195.22,Giles,What should I do?
2198.96,2199.71,Giles,Buffy!
2200.42,2202.5,Owen,Somebody's gotta help Buffy.
2202.59,2204.76,Willow,Owen!
2204.84,2207.89,Andrew,They told me about you
2204.84,2207.89,Andrew,while I was sleeping.
2207.97,2210.14,Andrew,Why does he hurt me?
2219.36,2220.82,Owen,Buffy?
2222.11,2222.99,Owen,No!
2237.75,2239.75,Owen,Did you see that?
2239.84,2242.51,Owen,He tried to bite me! What a sissy!
2244.47,2246.14,Buffy,No!
2246.22,2247.81,Andrew,Dead!
2251.02,2253.1,Andrew,He was found wanting.
2269.63,2272.24,Buffy,You killed my date!
2281.55,2282.57,Willow,"Buffy, Owen's..."
2282.57,2283.85,Xander,Just give her a sec.
2285.97,2288.06,Buffy,You killed my date!
2291.27,2292.73,Andrew,Your turn!
2306.41,2309.67,Owen,"Does anyone have an aspirin, or sixty?"
2311.59,2313.26,Buffy,Owen.
2314.13,2318.02,Owen,What happened to that guy?
2316.09,2317.13,Buffy,Oh.
2317.86,2319.84,Buffy,We scared him away.
2319.87,2322.01,Owen,"Oh, good. 'Cause, y'know, I would've..."
2322.01,2322.39,Buffy,I know.
2323.48,2325.14,Buffy,Here.
2329.07,2333.15,Buffy,I'm sure this isn't exactly
2329.07,2333.15,Buffy,what you had in mind for our first date.
2333.24,2334.95,Owen,Yeah.
2335.03,2338.37,Owen,I was hoping maybe
2335.03,2338.37,Owen,we'd finish up at Ben & Jerry's.
2339.2,2341.05,Buffy,We still could.
2341.05,2345.01,Owen,No. I think I'll just walk home.
2348.3,2350.38,Owen,Uh... Which way is home?
2350.88,2352.84,Buffy,I'll get you there.
2352.93,2356,Owen,No. I'll go it alone.
2356.03,2358.43,Xander,We'll make sure he gets home safely.
2365.24,2367.48,Giles,"Buffy, if I might..."
2367.48,2368.15,Buffy,Don't.
2372.39,2373.82,Buffy,b><i></b></i>
2373.86,2376.79,Buffy,Did Owen say anything about me
2373.86,2376.79,Buffy,on the way home?
2376.87,2379.58,Willow,You mean specifically about you?
2379.66,2383.21,Buffy,Or generally in the area in the ballpark.
2383.29,2385.65,Buffy,Any sort of indication?
2385.65,2388.02,Xander,"Well, in that case, no."
2386.09,2389.47,Willow,But he was pretty incoherent
2386.09,2389.47,Willow,so we might have missed it.
2389.55,2391.47,Buffy,You think?
2391.47,2392.05,Xander,No.
2392.14,2394.56,Buffy,I knew it. I totally blew it last night.
2394.64,2397.94,Xander,"No, see, what you need is a guy who"
2394.64,2397.94,Xander,"already knows your deepest, darkest secrets"
2398.02,2400.27,Xander,"and still says, 'Hey! I like that girl!'"
2400.35,2401.92,Xander,Someone like...
2401.92,2402.44,Buffy,Owen.
2404.69,2407.2,Willow,"Well, this is our stop."
2410.32,2411.78,Owen,Hi.
2412.12,2413.58,Owen,Hi.
2417.17,2419.96,Buffy,This is going well.
2420.88,2424.09,Owen,I don't really know how to say this but
2424.17,2425.44,Owen,about last night...
2425.44,2426.97,Buffy,You don't even have to.
2427.05,2429.62,Buffy,I'm sure you were pretty freaked out.
2429.62,2430.18,Owen,Totally.
2430.26,2433.52,Owen,And I was wondering
2430.26,2433.52,Owen,when I could see you again.
2435.77,2439.48,Buffy,That was my hopeful ear.
2435.77,2439.48,Buffy,Could you repeat that?
2440.23,2442.74,Owen,I think you're the coolest.
2442.77,2443.44,Buffy,Really?
2443.44,2445.91,Owen,Last night was incredible.
2445.94,2450.44,Owen,I never thought nearly getting killed
2445.94,2450.44,Owen,would make me feel so... alive!
2450.58,2452.83,Buffy,So that's why you want to be with me?
2452.92,2456.88,Owen,Absolutely. When can we do
2452.92,2456.88,Owen,something like that again?
2456.96,2459.42,Buffy,Something like...?
2456.96,2459.42,Buffy,Like...
2459.45,2462.05,Owen,"Walk downtown at three in the morning,"
2459.45,2462.05,Owen,and pick a fight in a bar.
2462.08,2463.96,Owen,How about tonight?
2463.96,2466.26,Buffy,Tonight would... be...
2466.85,2469.52,Owen,not a workable thing. Did I just say that?
2469.6,2472.06,Owen,Tomorrow then?
2469.6,2472.06,Owen,I'm free any night this week.
2472.65,2474.52,Buffy,I'm not.
2474.61,2478.86,Buffy,Please don't take this personally.
2474.61,2478.86,Buffy,It's not you. It's me.
2478.94,2482.03,Owen,Right. It's you.
2482.12,2486.29,Buffy,And I was kinda hoping
2482.12,2486.29,Buffy,that maybe you and I could still be...
2486.37,2488.25,Owen,I get it.
2488.33,2490.25,Owen,You just wanna be friends.
2490.33,2492.21,Buffy,That'd be nice.
2492.29,2493.71,Owen,Friends.
2495.09,2496.92,Owen,Yeah.
2499.02,2498.5,Owen,Great.
2498.55,2502.41,Lyrics,i># The world will keep on turning</i>
2503.1,2505.62,Lyrics,i># It'll all be there</i>
2505.65,2507.79,Lyrics,i># come morning</i>
2507.79,2509.08,Buffy,Yeah. Great.

2516.16,2520.16,Lyrics,i># Let the sun fall down</i>
2521.03,2521.81,Lyrics,i># all around you</i>
2521.81,2522.88,Giles,I was ten years old when my...
2522.88,2525.98,Giles,father told me
2522.88,2525.98,Giles,I was destined to be a watcher.
2526.37,2531.09,Giles,"He was one, and his mother before him,"
2526.37,2531.09,Giles,and I was to be next.
2531.17,2533.17,Buffy,Were you thrilled beyond all measure?
2533.17,2535.28,Giles,"No, I had very definite plans"
2533.17,2535.28,Giles,about my future.
2535.31,2537.76,Giles,I was going to be a fighter pilot.
2537.85,2539.6,Giles,Or possibly a grocer.
2539.61,2543.38,Giles,But my father...
2539.61,2543.38,Giles,gave me a very tiresome speech
2543.38,2546.94,Giles,about... responsibility and sacrifice.
2547.02,2549.11,Buffy,"Sacrifice, huh?"
2549.94,2552.86,Giles,He seems like a nice lad.
2553.57,2555.24,Buffy,Yeah.
2556.24,2558.33,Buffy,But he wants to be Danger Man.
2560.33,2565.54,Buffy,"You, Xander, Willow... You guys..."
2560.33,2565.54,Buffy,You guys know the score. You're careful.
2565.63,2569.59,Buffy,Two days in my world
2565.63,2569.59,Buffy,and Owen really would get himself killed.
2569.67,2572.68,Buffy,Or I'd get him killed.
2574.3,2576.47,Giles,Or someone else.
