2.08,3.96,GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
4.08,4.79,BUFFY,Mom?
4.82,6.55,PARAMEDIC,I'm sorry. Your mother's dead.
6.68,9.15,XANDER,"Anya, you wanna marry me?"
13.02,17.07,XANDER,Advertise your product or brand here
13.02,17.07,XANDER,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
18.12,22.35,XANDER,"I've gone. Not one for long goodbyes,"
18.12,22.35,XANDER,I thought it best to slip out quietly. "
22.48,23.99,XANDER,Love to you all. Giles. "
24.44,25.51,WILLOW,There he goes.
25.64,27.71,WILLOW,"Guys, I need you on board here."
27.84,31.83,XANDER,"This is deep stuff, Willow."
27.84,31.83,XANDER,We're talking about raising the dead.
31.96,33.36,WILLOW,It's time we stopped talking.
33.48,34.99,TARA,What if something does go wrong?
35.12,38.08,WILLOW,"I can do this, I promise."
35.12,38.08,WILLOW,But not without you.
38.2,41.51,WILLOW,"Osiris, here lies the warrior of the people."
41.64,43.2,WILLOW,Let her cross over.
43.64,44.44,WILLOW,Release her.
46.92,50.47,WILLOW,"It was Buffy, right?"
46.92,50.47,WILLOW,We saw her and it was really Buffy?
50.6,52.21,ANYA,I think we screwed it up.
52.21,52.4,WILLOW,No.
52.52,57.51,WILLOW,She's just disoriented from being
52.52,57.51,WILLOW,tormented in some Hell dimension.
57.64,58.79,DAWN,She's been through a lot.
58.92,60.07,SPIKE,What did you do?
60.2,62.45,SPIKE,I haven't been to a Hell dimension
60.2,62.45,SPIKE,"just of late,"
62.49,64.59,SPIKE,but I do know a thing or two about torment.
64.72,67.55,BUFFY,Wherever I was...
69.04,70.03,BUFFY,I was happy.
70.16,71.91,BUFFY,I think I was in Heaven.
72.04,75.27,BUFFY,I was torn out of there by my friends.
78.02,81.52,BUFFY,Everything here is hard... and violent.
81.64,83.2,BUFFY,This is Hell.
106.32,109.84,BUFFY,"So... we meet at last, Mr Drippy."
117.32,119.93,DAWN,Want me to call a plumber?
119.93,120.23,BUFFY,No.
120.36,121.63,DAWN,You sure?
121.63,122.19,BUFFY,Yes.
122.32,123.76,DAWN,Got the number.
123.76,125.68,BUFFY,"Dawn, I'm on it, OK?"
140.76,143.72,BUFFY,There. All better.
196.68,199.99,DAWN,Man. How much water
196.68,199.99,DAWN,can they fit in one set of pipes?
200.84,204.39,TARA,"If I understand right,"
200.84,204.39,TARA,the entire city water supply.
204.52,206.93,WILLOW,It's like little clown cars in the circus.
206.93,209.28,DAWN,Told you we should've called the plumber.
209.4,214.24,BUFFY,You were right.
209.4,214.24,BUFFY,Plumber will make everything good.
217.44,220.08,TARA,"Dawnie, you're not eating breakfast."
221.12,224.87,BUFFY,"Dawn, breakfast is the most"
221.12,224.87,BUFFY,important meal of the day.
227.02,227.47,BUFFY,It's unbelievably important.
227.84,230.88,BUFFY,You should eat breakfast
227.84,230.88,BUFFY,at least three times a day.
238.64,241.07,DAWN,"I'll, um... grab something before school."
243.24,248.08,XANDER,And a big Sunnydale round of applause for
243.24,248.08,XANDER,"Tito the Amazing, plumber extraordinaire."
248.2,249.79,TARA,How's it look down there?
249.92,252.56,XANDER,Like we should start gathering up
249.92,252.56,XANDER,two of every animal.
252.68,257.12,TITO,"Basically, your pipes are shot. The whole"
252.68,257.12,TITO,system's gonna have to be replaced.
257.24,259.47,TITO,What you need is a full copper repipe job.
259.6,261.1,TITO,Full copper repipe?
261.1,263.56,WILLOW,That sounds potentially pricey.
263.68,267.15,TITO,"Well, if you have any questions,"
263.68,267.15,TITO,our number's on the invoice.
270.88,273.03,DAWN,That's a weird phone number.
273.6,275.35,DAWN,"Oh, wait. Is that the bill?"
275.48,279.08,XANDER,Hey. Tito cut you a good deal.
275.48,279.08,XANDER,Those are his bargain prices.
279.2,281.27,XANDER,I did a little haggling for you.
281.27,281.92,BUFFY,Thank you.
282.68,285.11,BUFFY,So we'll pay him. What's the big deal?
287.64,291.11,WILLOW,"Buffy, I know you're still"
287.64,291.11,WILLOW,getting back on your feet after...
291.24,293.63,BUFFY,Lying flat on my back?
293.76,298.71,WILLOW,Yeah. But there's some money stuff
293.76,298.71,WILLOW,we're gonna have to talk to you about.
301.84,304.91,BUFFY,OK. So you're telling me I'm broke?
305.68,306.72,WILLOW,"Not yet, but..."
306.72,309.28,TARA,Money's definitely becoming an issue.
309.4,311.76,XANDER,As in your being almost out of it.
311.88,316.03,BUFFY,But I haven't spent any money.
311.88,316.03,BUFFY,I was all dead and frugal.
316.16,321.28,WILLOW,I know this comes as a bit of a shock
316.16,321.28,WILLOW,after... a bit of a shock.
321.4,323.52,WILLOW,It took us by surprise too.
323.64,329.56,TARA,Your mother prepared everything really well.
323.64,329.56,TARA,She had insurance... life insurance.
329.68,333.31,XANDER,"Which should have left you covered,"
329.68,333.31,XANDER,but... hospital bills.
333.68,335.87,WILLOW,Pretty much sucked up all the money.
335.87,337.88,ANYA,Which you're still haemorrhaging.
339.72,341.21,BUFFY,How am I doing that?
341.21,342.92,ANYA,"No, not you. The house."
343.04,348.27,ANYA,"See, this house, just sitting here,"
343.04,348.27,ANYA,"doing nothing, by itself costs money."
349.92,351.88,DAWN,So what do we do?
352.76,356.99,BUFFY,Easy. We burn the house to the ground
352.76,356.99,BUFFY,and collect the insurance.
357.16,359.52,BUFFY,"Plus, fire  pretty."
363.6,365.75,BUFFY,"You guys, I'm kidding."
366.72,369.28,BUFFY,"OK, it's bills, it's money."
369.4,373.19,BUFFY,It's pieces of paper sent by bureaucrats
369.4,373.19,BUFFY,that we've never even met.
373.32,375.68,BUFFY,It's not like it's the end of the world.
376.44,380.72,BUFFY,"Which is too bad, you know,"
376.44,380.72,BUFFY,cos that I'm really good at.
381.96,384.52,BUFFY,I'll take care of this. I promise.
385.28,387.67,BUFFY,I... just don't know how yet.
390.36,392.79,ANYA,I know how.
394.04,398.96,ANYA,"If you wanna pay every bill here,"
394.04,398.96,ANYA,"and every bill coming,"
399.08,403.52,ANYA,and have enough to start
399.08,403.52,ANYA,"a nice college fund for Dawn,"
404.16,406.52,ANYA,start charging.
407.24,408.15,BUFFY,For what?
408.15,409.88,ANYA,Slaying vampires!
412.02,415.07,ANYA,You're providing a valuable service
412.02,415.07,ANYA,to the whole community. I say cash in.
420.36,424.56,BUFFY,"Well, that's an idea... you would have."
425.6,427.8,BUFFY,Any other suggestions?
428.32,430.99,ANYA,"Well, I mean, it's not so crazy."
431.12,435.35,DAWN,"Yes, it is! You can't charge innocent people"
431.12,435.35,DAWN,for saving their lives.
435.48,436.61,ANYA,SpiderMan does.
436.61,437.52,DAWN,He does not!
437.64,438.64,ANYA,Does too.
438.64,439.76,DAWN,Does no...
440.76,442.56,DAWN,Xander?
446.08,448.44,XANDER,Action is his reward. "
451.56,454.36,ANYA,Why don't you ever take my side?
454.48,458.55,XANDER,"What are you talking about, taking"
454.48,458.55,XANDER,"your side? Anya, I am your side!"
462.52,464.64,WILLOW,You're throwin' away a gold mine.
466.48,468.52,XANDER,Come on.
468.64,470.39,XANDER,Wait up.
470.52,472.64,XANDER,Anya! What's wrong with you?
472.76,475.72,ANYA,Ask your best friend SpiderMan.
472.76,475.72,ANYA,If you won't support me...
475.84,479.12,XANDER,I'm totally supportive!
475.84,479.12,XANDER,I'm a flying buttress of support!
479.24,481.2,ANYA,"No, you're not."
484.68,487.43,XANDER,This is because I haven't told them
484.68,487.43,XANDER,about the engagement.
487.56,490.92,ANYA,No... Maybe...
491.04,494.48,XANDER,Yes. It's painful and confusing!
494.6,496.24,,"I mean, first you give me"
496.24,497.56,ANYA,"this beautiful ring,"
497.68,499.67,ANYA,and then I can't wear it in public.
499.8,502.44,ANYA,Do you know how depressing that is?
502.56,506.44,XANDER,"Anya, I promise,"
502.56,506.44,XANDER,your waiting days are almost over.
506.56,508.6,XANDER,"I know it's frustrating,"
508.72,513.11,XANDER,but the way I understand this marriage
508.72,513.11,XANDER,"thing, it's kind of a forever deal."
514.48,516.95,ANYA,Not if you never get started.
519.72,522.39,ANYA,Don't you wanna get married?
524.48,525.44,XANDER,Yes.
525.56,528.31,ANYA,So then why won't you tell them?
530.64,535.19,XANDER,Because... I'm still getting used
530.64,535.19,XANDER,to the miracle of a steady paycheck
535.32,538.12,XANDER,and getting out of my parents' house.
538.24,540.2,XANDER,And this...
540.32,543.63,XANDER,"this husband thing, it's a big step."
543.76,546.56,XANDER,Or... a lot of little ones.
548.48,551.76,XANDER,And... I love you so much.
553.04,556.75,XANDER,I just want... every step to be just right.
558.44,560.59,ANYA,Really?
573.36,575.35,ANYA,Hey! You tricked me!
575.48,578.79,ANYA,"Just now, with your fancy talk and lips!"
578.92,582.8,ANYA,"You keep doing this, and I keep forgetting,"
578.92,582.8,ANYA,and you keep stalling!
582.92,583.27,XANDER,Anya!
583.27,585.75,ANYA,"When are you gonna grow up, Xander?"
590.24,593.47,BUFFY VOICEOVER,There's a first time for everything
590.24,593.47,BUFFY VOICEOVER,is my philosophy.
593.6,595.72,BUFFY,This is my first big loan.
596.36,598.51,BUFFY,Collateral? No problem.
598.64,600.23,BUFFY,No problem. No problem.
600.36,604.27,BUFFY,I love that tie. I'm a problem solver.
600.36,604.27,BUFFY,Let's crunch those numbers!
604.88,606.84,BUFFY,Stupid skirt.
607.8,608.18,BUFFY,Hello.
608.18,609.84,MR. SAVITSKY,Sorry to keep you waiting.
609.96,612.08,MR. SAVITSKY,"Carl Savitsky, loan officer."
612.08,614.43,BUFFY,"Buffy Summers, loan applierfor."
616.16,619.28,BUFFY,"I didn't know what you would need,"
616.16,619.28,BUFFY,so I brought everything.
619.4,621.99,BUFFY,I'm very responsible in that way.
621.99,622.23,MR. SAVITSKY,OK.
623.24,626.71,MR. SAVITSKY,I don't think I'll need this... or these.
628.52,631.24,MR. SAVITSKY,Old report cards... definitely not.
634.96,637.52,BUFFY,"So, about my getting a loan..."
638.16,642.63,MR. SAVITSKY,"Yes, well, um... it looks as if,"
638.16,642.63,MR. SAVITSKY,"financially,"
642.67,644.84,MR. SAVITSKY,we have a bit of a tangle.
647.02,650.39,BUFFY,I know. And I figured you could just
647.02,650.39,BUFFY,cut through that tangle with scissors.
650.52,653.32,BUFFY,"You know, where the loan is the scissors?"
653.44,656.48,MR. SAVITSKY,"Ms Summers, the only collateral"
653.44,656.48,MR. SAVITSKY,"you have is your house,"
656.6,659.27,MR. SAVITSKY,which was never fully leveraged
656.6,659.27,MR. SAVITSKY,and has been losing equity...
659.3,660.96,MR. SAVITSKY,over the last several years.
661.08,664.55,MR. SAVITSKY,"For some reason, Sunnydale property"
661.08,664.55,MR. SAVITSKY,values aren't competitive.
664.68,667.72,MR. SAVITSKY,Refinancing's out of the question.
670.8,673.16,BUFFY,Are you saying you won't give me my loan?
673.28,677.88,MR. SAVITSKY,"Well, the problem is"
673.28,677.88,MR. SAVITSKY,you have no income. No job.
685.88,687.84,MR. SAVITSKY,No job?
688.68,690.51,BUFFY,I wish.
695.8,698.71,BUFFY,Hey! Are you in the wrong line?
698.84,700.99,BUFFY,"That's for deposits, that's withdrawals,"
701.12,704.11,BUFFY,and this one... is for
701.12,704.11,BUFFY,getting kicked in the face.
705.48,707.44,BUFFY,Stupid skirt.
710.88,712.6,BUFFY,May I?
738.6,739.92,GUARD,Put the girl down.
743.48,745.76,BUFFY,These things? Never helpful.
757.28,759.59,BUFFY,"Now, about my loan."
759.72,763.55,BUFFY,I'm not saying I'm charging you
759.72,763.55,BUFFY,"for saving your life or anything, but..."
763.68,765.75,BUFFY,let's talk rates.
767.96,770.35,WILLOW,He still turned you down? That's crazy!
770.48,775.47,WILLOW,"Even if the bank did get robbed, which"
770.48,775.47,WILLOW,"you battling demons couldn't possibly know,"
775.6,778.4,WILLOW,you would think there would be
775.6,778.4,WILLOW,some kind of reward.
778.52,782.35,WILLOW,"They're, like, ""We won't give you money"
778.52,782.35,WILLOW,unless you prove you don't need it. "
782.48,784.76,WILLOW,What kind of system is that?
784.88,787.16,BUFFY,You're askin' the wrong gal.
794.02,794.64,WILLOW,"Buffy, you're mad."
795.08,797.36,BUFFY,You noticed. It'll pass.
798.4,803.87,WILLOW,"No. Anger is a big, powerful emotion"
798.4,803.87,WILLOW,you should feel.
804.8,806.95,BUFFY,"Well, that's good then."
809.16,810.37,BUFFY,It's gone now.
810.37,812.95,WILLOW,"OK, let me make you mad again."
813.08,814.4,WILLOW,Uh... Ready?
820.02,821.07,WILLOW,"Last semester, I slept with Riley."
821.76,824.6,BUFFY,"And, you know, I really doubt it."
824.6,826.23,WILLOW,Caught me. Big fib.
826.36,830.19,WILLOW,To cover up the sleazy affair
826.36,830.19,WILLOW,I had with Angel.
833.02,833.99,BUFFY,"Will, what the hell are you doing?"
834.84,836.38,WILLOW,Pissing you off.
836.38,837.35,BUFFY,"Yes, true."
837.64,839.47,BUFFY,Why?
839.6,843.48,WILLOW,"Well, cos... you know..."
839.6,843.48,WILLOW,"since you've been back,"
843.6,848.91,WILLOW,you haven't exactly been big with
843.6,848.91,WILLOW,the whole range of human emotions thing.
850.44,852.24,BUFFY,What do you mean?
852.36,854.35,WILLOW,"Well, you haven't..."
854.48,856.28,WILLOW,"No, I mean, it's just, um..."
858.96,863.99,WILLOW,"You know, this is really my problem."
858.96,863.99,WILLOW,I'm just... I'm all over the place.
864.12,869.24,ANYA,You should just forget
864.12,869.24,ANYA,"I even said anything, cos..."
869.36,872.59,WILLOW,"Well, cos... you know... banks, man."
883.02,883.75,ANYA,Don't be such a wiener dog. Look at them.
884.32,887.12,ANYA,Researching demons for the billionth time.
887.24,890.84,ANYA,They could use a peppy boost of happy news.
890.96,893.39,XANDER,You're right. I'll tell them.
898.28,900.08,XANDER,As soon as Buffy and Willow come in.
900.08,900.48,ANYA,Chicken.
900.68,901.5,XANDER,Will you stop?
901.5,902.03,ANYA,Dare you.
902.16,905.36,XANDER,"Anya, if I tell them we're engaged"
902.16,905.36,XANDER,"right after you dared me to,"
905.48,909.23,XANDER,wouldn't you always wonder
905.48,909.23,XANDER,if that's the only reason I did it?
911.52,913.48,XANDER,Score one for Captain Logic.
913.6,918.99,ANYA,"No, no. Captain Logic is not steering this"
913.6,918.99,ANYA,tugboat. I smell Captain Fear at the wheel.
919.12,921.96,ANYA,"God, I hate this. This tone in my voice?"
922,924.35,ANYA,"I dislike it more than you,"
922,924.35,ANYA,and I'm closer to it.
924.48,928.31,DAWN,"Oh, come on, Tara."
924.48,928.31,DAWN,I am so old enough to do research.
928.44,930.83,DAWN,Do you really think I'm not mature enough?
930.96,935.03,TARA,"I think you're very mature for your age,"
930.96,935.03,TARA,but you're still only 15.
935.16,941.16,DAWN,"Right. 15, as in teenager. You know,"
935.16,941.16,DAWN,"if you don't let me look at the pictures,"
941.32,945.44,DAWN,I'm gonna learn everything
941.32,945.44,DAWN,I know about demons on the street.
946.32,948.1,TARA,Knock yourself out.
948.1,949.04,DAWN,Thank you.
949.16,952.28,DAWN,See? No biggie. I can totally handle it.
955.88,958.31,DAWN,That's a weird place for a horn.
961.84,964.59,DAWN,That's not a horn.
965.2,969.51,XANDER,"You know, I still don't get it."
965.2,969.51,XANDER,What kind of a demon would rob a bank?
969.64,971.09,ANYA,The kind that wants money.
971.09,972.6,XANDER,What do you even call that?
972.72,974.87,DAWN,This?
976.16,979.12,DAWN,I'm guessing on how you say it.
976.16,979.12,DAWN,It's got an apostrophe.
979.24,983.76,DAWN,"I think it's M'Fashnik. Like ""Mmm, cookies."""
983.88,990.12,XANDER,Or maybe M'Fashnik. Like "Muh... Fashnik."
994.04,996,DAWN,This your guy?
997.08,1001.76,BUFFY,You do research now? Want a cappuccino
997.08,1001.76,BUFFY,and a pack of cigarettes to go with it?
1001.88,1003.53,DAWN,Would you just look at the picture?
1003.6,1004.64,DAWN,Not the profile
1004.64,1006.64,XANDER,for your typical bank robber.
1006.76,1009.35,BUFFY,Maybe they turned down his loan application.
1010.08,1013.87,BUFFY,That's him. Big bad.
1010.08,1013.87,BUFFY,"This thing was strong, guys."
1016.02,1017.28,BUFFY,"No weapons that I could see, but still..."
1017.4,1020.04,BUFFY,real... dangerous.
1036.6,1038.67,GILES,"Oh, God, Buffy!"
1040.28,1043.75,GILES,You're alive. You're here.
1044.84,1048.28,GILES,And you're still... remarkably strong.
1049.96,1051.95,BUFFY,Oh. Sorry.
1052.08,1054.75,GILES,"Willow told me,"
1052.08,1054.75,GILES,but I didn't let myself believe it.
1054.88,1058.27,BUFFY,I take a little getting used to.
1054.88,1058.27,BUFFY,I'm still getting used to me.
1058.4,1061.71,GILES,It's... You're...
1062.04,1063.73,BUFFY,A miracle.
1063.73,1064.4,GILES,Yes.
1066.6,1069.75,GILES,But then I always thought so.
1096.16,1098.12,GILES,So...
1098.76,1101.56,BUFFY,I can start. How was England?
1102.48,1104.31,BUFFY,How was... life?
1104.92,1107.8,GILES,I'm not really sure how to answer that.
1107.92,1111.91,GILES,"Well, I arrived home."
1107.92,1111.91,GILES,"I, uh, met with the Council..."
1112.04,1114.08,BUFFY,Always a good time.
1114.08,1114.51,GILES,Yes.
1115.16,1119.47,,"Otherwise, there's nothing really to report."
1115.16,1119.47,,"I, um... keep a flat in Bath."
1119.6,1122.56,,I... met with a few old friends.
1123.28,1125.85,,"Almost made a new one, which I think is..."
1125.96,1128.64,,statistically impossible
1125.96,1128.64,,for a man of my age.
1130.84,1133.11,BUFFY,And now you're back.
1133.11,1133.56,GILES,Yes.
1135.88,1137.63,BUFFY,Wow.
1137.76,1141.36,BUFFY,"Giles, are you miserable about it,"
1137.76,1141.36,BUFFY,or just really British?
1143.48,1145.84,GILES,"I can't lie to you, Buffy."
1148.16,1151.95,GILES,Leaving Sunnydale was... difficult.
1152.08,1154.55,BUFFY,"And, uh... coming back is..."
1155.24,1158.44,BUFFY,I'm guessing the word is "inconvenient"?
1159.56,1161.52,GILES,No.
1162.8,1164.95,GILES,Bewildering?
1168.56,1171.63,GILES,And how are you... really?
1172.96,1175.17,GILES,You look tired.
1175.17,1177.24,BUFFY,Me? Nah. Fine.
1179.24,1181.55,BUFFY,"I mean, you know, sleeping's hard,"
1181.68,1184.72,BUFFY,but just because of the whole
1181.68,1184.72,BUFFY,waking up in a box thing.
1185.16,1189.28,BUFFY,So maybe waking up's the problem 
1185.16,1189.28,BUFFY,but just for a second.
1189.88,1192.47,BUFFY,"I sleep OK. Great, even."
1192.6,1194.99,BUFFY,"Except, you know, for the dreams."
1198.76,1202.75,GILES,You seem to be doing remarkably well
1198.76,1202.75,GILES,under extreme circumstances.
1202.88,1204.84,GILES,I'm proud of you.
1208.02,1210.31,BUFFY,"Well, actually it wasn't me."
1208.02,1210.31,BUFFY,Willow brought me back. I just lay there.
1210.44,1211.67,GILES,"No, I meant..."
1211.67,1213.59,BUFFY,I know what you meant.
1214.08,1217.68,BUFFY,It was just a little postpostmortem comedy.
1221.92,1226.44,BUFFY,"Well, I... better start prepping. Slayage."
1226.56,1229.22,GILES,"Yes, there is always that, isn't there?"
1229.22,1230.24,BUFFY,Seems that way.
1244.72,1246.15,ANYA,Giles!
1247.16,1249.59,ANYA,We're so glad to see you. We missed you.
1249.72,1252.47,ANYA,You can't have the store back.
1252.47,1253.11,GILES,I know.
1253.24,1256.11,GILES,Do we have information on this
1253.24,1256.11,GILES,new demon that I...
1256.15,1258.11,GILES,suddenly find desperately interesting?
1258.24,1259.36,XANDER,That we do.
1259.36,1261.39,WILLOW,This one robs banks.
1261.72,1263.92,DAWN,I found him.
1266.36,1267.69,GILES,M'Fashnik. Oh.
1267.69,1270.07,DAWN,"Aha! Like ""Mm, cookies. """
1270.56,1272.39,GILES,"No, quite different, actually."
1272.39,1273.12,TARA,You know it?
1273.24,1276.28,GILES,By reputation. They come from
1273.24,1276.28,GILES,a long line of mercenary demons
1276.4,1280.71,GILES,that perform acts of slaughter
1276.4,1280.71,GILES,and mayhem for the highest bidder.
1280.84,1282.96,XANDER,"Well, it is the American way."
1283.08,1286.04,GILES,"Yes, but the question now becomes"
1286.16,1289.12,GILES,what's powerful enough
1286.16,1289.12,GILES,to control one of those things?
1292.32,1297.27,DEMON,"We had a deal. You got what you wanted,"
1292.32,1297.27,DEMON,now give me what I want 
1297.4,1299.83,DEMON,the head of the Slayer.
1301.96,1302.49,WARREN,OK.
1302.49,1303.36,JONATHAN,Sure.
1303.48,1305.55,ANDREW,We can do that.
1308.72,1313.08,DEMON,You hired me to create
1308.72,1313.08,DEMON,chaos and carnage for you.
1313.2,1315.24,DEMON,"Told me you were powerful men,"
1315.36,1320.04,DEMON,"commanding machines, magics,"
1315.36,1320.04,DEMON,the demon realms below.
1320.16,1320.74,WARREN,We are.
1320.74,1322.96,JONATHAN,"We're, like, supervillains."
1325.88,1328.36,DEMON,Which one of you is the leader?
1328.36,1328.76,ANDREW/JONATHAN/WARREN,I am.
1331.02,1331.35,DEMON,I will kill the leader.
1331.35,1331.43,ANDREW/JONATHAN/WARREN,He is.
1331.72,1333.79,DEMON,I will kill you all.
1333.79,1334.31,JONATHAN,Wait!
1334.96,1336.92,JONATHAN,No fair!
1338.12,1340.43,JONATHAN,It's not our fault the Slayer was there.
1340.56,1342.98,JONATHAN,"We said we'd pay you, and we're gonna."
1342.98,1343.23,WARREN,Yes!
1344.24,1347.71,WARREN,"Truly, Lord Jonathan"
1344.24,1347.71,WARREN,is the wisest of us all.
1347.84,1350.83,ANDREW,"Yeah, long live our noble lord and master."
1350.96,1353.19,JONATHAN,You guys suck.
1353.72,1358.27,DEMON,"You can't pay me with paper, tiny king."
1353.72,1358.27,DEMON,You pitted me against the Slayer.
1358.4,1360.83,DEMON,"For that, I must kill you."
1361.56,1367.32,DEMON,Then I will suck dry your bones
1361.56,1367.32,DEMON,and use them to beat your subjects to death.
1367.6,1370.56,WARREN,"Whoa, whoa! Big guy, hey."
1367.6,1370.56,WARREN,Let's back things up a parsec.
1370.68,1373.56,WARREN,You kill us... everybody loses.
1373.68,1376.59,WARREN,"You let us live, we give you..."
1378.72,1380.57,DEMON,Give me what?
1380.57,1381.71,JONATHAN,Name it!
1386.6,1389.83,WARREN,"Well, between the three of us,"
1386.6,1389.83,WARREN,we can pretty much do anything.
1389.96,1394.83,JONATHAN,Like if you want a spell to make you look
1389.96,1394.83,JONATHAN,supercool to the other demons?
1395.48,1397.41,JONATHAN,"I'm all over that action, my friend."
1397.46,1400.03,WARREN,"Or, just throwin' it out, robot girlfriend?"
1400.16,1403.87,WARREN,"For those long, lonely nights"
1400.16,1403.87,WARREN,after a hard day's slaughter?
1406.02,1406.07,DEMON,You could do this?
1406.2,1408.59,ANDREW,Don't trust him.
1406.2,1408.59,ANDREW,Robo pimpdaddy's all mouth.
1408.72,1412,WARREN,Shut up! You're just mad
1408.72,1412,WARREN,I wouldn't build you Christina Ricci.
1412.12,1413.11,ANDREW,"You owe me, man."
1413.11,1413.92,WARREN,Or else what?
1414.04,1418.19,WARREN,You'll train another pack of devil dogs
1414.04,1418.19,WARREN,to ruin my prom? Graduated!
1418.32,1420.71,ANDREW,That wasn't me.
1418.32,1420.71,ANDREW,How many times do I have to say it?
1420.84,1422.78,ANDREW,The prom thing was my brother Tucker.
1422.78,1424.88,JONATHAN,"Yeah, well, tell him I was at that prom."
1427.02,1428.83,ANDREW,"Hello! Screen wipe, new scene."
1427.02,1428.83,ANDREW,I had nothing to do with the devil dogs.
1428.96,1433.32,ANDREW,I trained flying demon monkeys to
1428.96,1433.32,ANDREW,"attack the school play. School play, dude!"
1435.48,1437.46,WARREN,That was cool. That was kinda cool.
1437.46,1439.39,JONATHAN,"Everyone was, like, ""Run, Juliet!"""
1443.02,1442.96,DEMON,Enough!
1444.52,1448.2,DEMON,Nothing you can offer me
1444.52,1448.2,DEMON,will satisfy your debt to me.
1448.32,1452.52,DEMON,"I don't want your toys, or your spells,"
1448.32,1452.52,DEMON,flying monkey demons...
1452.64,1454.55,DEMON,I want the Slayer dead!
1454.68,1455.05,ANDREW,OK.
1455.05,1455.67,JONATHAN,Done.
1455.8,1458.68,WARREN,One dead Slayer comin' up.
1455.8,1458.68,WARREN,Could you give us a minute?
1458.8,1460.95,DEMON,For what?
1461.08,1464.68,WARREN,"Well, we really wanna nail down"
1461.08,1464.68,WARREN,the optimum method...
1464.71,1467.08,WARREN,for us to wipe out the Slayer for you.
1468.92,1471.72,DEMON,Make sure it involves... pain.
1473.04,1477.56,BUFFY,"I know they're so cute you could die,"
1473.04,1477.56,BUFFY,but... it's all I got.
1477.68,1480.8,GILES,"Think nothing of it. It's, um... whimsical."
1481.52,1485.59,BUFFY,They were mine when I was little.
1481.52,1485.59,BUFFY,Couldn't find the guest sheets.
1485.72,1488.08,BUFFY,Mom always did this stuff.
1489.48,1491.44,BUFFY,They don't actually fit.
1492.64,1495.79,BUFFY,I blame the sofa.
1492.64,1495.79,BUFFY,We need one of those pullout kinds.
1496.56,1499.79,BUFFY,The kind with no payments
1496.56,1499.79,BUFFY,till twothousandandinfinity.
1499.92,1501.27,GILES,What?
1501.4,1504.28,BUFFY,"Oh, it's... just money stuff."
1504.92,1507.2,BUFFY,"It turns out Mom left me some,"
1507.32,1513.03,BUFFY,"and, while I was dead, it got squandered"
1507.32,1513.03,BUFFY,on luxuries like food and clothing.
1513.16,1515.36,GILES,How bad is it?
1515.48,1519.76,BUFFY,Anya says pretty bad.
1515.48,1519.76,BUFFY,I'm kinda taking her word for it.
1519.88,1522.48,BUFFY,"Actually, I'm trying to"
1519.88,1522.48,BUFFY,not think about it.
1522.48,1525.08,GILES,Sound policy. At least for tonight.
1526.56,1529.95,BUFFY,"Figured I'd put it out of my mind,"
1526.56,1529.95,BUFFY,"you know, take a break,"
1530.08,1532.23,BUFFY,get some perspective.
1532.36,1535.48,BUFFY,And then wake up at 4am terrified.
1540.04,1542.51,GILES,You're putting too much
1540.04,1542.51,GILES,pressure on yourself.
1542.64,1546.71,GILES,"I mean, to return from"
1542.64,1546.71,GILES,some unknown level of Hell...
1546.84,1550.67,GILES,It's only natural that coming back
1546.84,1550.67,GILES,will be a process.
1551.36,1553.64,BUFFY,"In the meantime, I'm scaring people."
1554.92,1557.64,GILES,"Well, that can take time too."
1560.04,1563.67,GILES,"Well, if it's any consolation,"
1560.04,1563.67,GILES,life can be pretty overwhelming
1563.8,1567.16,GILES,even for people
1563.8,1567.16,GILES,who haven't been... where you have.
1568.28,1569.95,BUFFY,I guess.
1570.08,1573.52,GILES,"Tomorrow morning, you and I will"
1570.08,1573.52,GILES,sit down and go through everything.
1573.64,1578.11,GILES,"Every bill, one by one."
1573.64,1578.11,GILES,We'll work it out together.
1579.96,1582.03,BUFFY,I'm glad you're back.
1582.16,1584.2,GILES,"Well, I'm glad you are too."
1592.44,1594.35,JONATHAN,Are we really gonna kill her?
1594.64,1595.56,JONATHAN,That's so sad.
1595.56,1596.87,WARREN,"Shut up, Whineathan."
1599.02,1599.83,ANDREW,But... I don't want to kill Buffy either.
1599.96,1603.75,JONATHAN,"Yeah, she saved my life a bunch of times."
1599.96,1603.75,JONATHAN,"Plus, she's hot."
1603.88,1605.74,WARREN,It's her or us. We have to do it.
1605.74,1607.27,ANDREW,We're talking about murder.
1607.4,1612.24,WARREN,"No, we're talking about staying alive, and"
1607.4,1612.24,WARREN,"as this is my mom's house, what I say goes."
1612.36,1617.28,ANDREW,"But aside from the moral issues, and"
1612.36,1617.28,ANDREW,"the mess, we can get in trouble for murder."
1617.4,1622.27,WARREN,"Duh! The last I checked, the authorities"
1617.4,1622.27,WARREN,"also frown on bank robbery too, you genius!"
1622.4,1625.71,JONATHAN,I don't even know if we could kill Buffy.
1622.4,1625.71,JONATHAN,She's got superstrength.
1625.84,1629.28,ANDREW,Killing people... this is not why
1625.84,1629.28,ANDREW,we got together in the first place.
1629.4,1633.31,JONATHAN,"Yeah. We teamed up with one clear,"
1629.4,1633.31,JONATHAN,supercool mission statement. Remember?
1635.76,1640.79,WARREN,So... you guys wanna team up
1635.76,1640.79,WARREN,and take over Sunnydale?
1643.12,1644.44,ANDREW/JONATHAN,OK.
1644.72,1647.11,WARREN,Of course I remember. It was last month.
1647.11,1649.03,JONATHAN,Then you know we have a mission!
1649.16,1651.99,We see what he's pointing at. It's a whiteboard labeled at the top "TO DO" and including the following items,"Shrink rays, trained gorillas."
1652.88,1655.11,We see what he's pointing at. It's a whiteboard labeled at the top "TO DO" and including the following items,"Workable prototype jetpacks,"
1655.24,1657.71,We see what he's pointing at. It's a whiteboard labeled at the top "TO DO" and including the following items,"and chicks, chicks, chicks."
1657.84,1660.51,We see what he's pointing at. It's a whiteboard labeled at the top "TO DO" and including the following items,I know that's the action I signed on for.
1660.51,1662.47,ANDREW,Me too. Ixnay on the urdermay.
1662.96,1663.41,WARREN,Vote.
1663.41,1666.32,JONATHAN,OK. Who's for not killing Buffy?
1669.72,1671.68,ANDREW,Agreed.
1672.48,1675.76,JONATHAN,So what are we gonna do
1672.48,1675.76,JONATHAN,about this M'Fashnik guy?
1677.04,1679.16,WARREN,"Ah! Wait here, OK? I got an idea."
1681.52,1685.91,WARREN,Here's the Slayer's name and address.
1681.52,1685.91,WARREN,"You wanna kill her, make it so."
1697.48,1699.55,JONATHAN,How'd you make him do that?
1699.68,1701.88,ANDREW,"What are you, some kind of... Jedi?"
1702.12,1706.88,WARREN,The Force can sometimes
1702.12,1706.88,WARREN,have great power on the weakminded.
1709.92,1712.28,WILLOW,"Hey, Giles."
1712.4,1715.36,WILLOW,You have a good talk with Buffy?
1715.48,1717.44,GILES,"Yes, now she's back."
1717.56,1719.95,WILLOW,Isn't it awesome?
1721.12,1723.68,GILES,Tell me about the spell you performed.
1723.8,1726.27,WILLOW,"Oh, OK. First of all, so scary."
1726.56,1730.19,WILLOW,"Like, the Blair Witch"
1726.56,1730.19,WILLOW,would have had to watch like this.
1730.64,1735.27,WILLOW,"And this giant snake came out of my mouth,"
1730.64,1735.27,WILLOW,"and there was all this energy crackling,"
1735.4,1739,WILLOW,"and this pack of demons interrupted,"
1735.4,1739,WILLOW,but I totally kept it together.
1739.12,1742,WILLOW,"And then, next thing you know, Buffy."
1743.68,1746.04,GILES,You're a very stupid girl.
1748.92,1751.2,WILLOW,What? Giles...
1751.32,1753.31,GILES,Do you have any idea what you've done?
1753.44,1756.51,GILES,"The forces you've harnessed,"
1753.44,1756.51,GILES,the lines you've crossed?
1756.64,1759.07,WILLOW,I thought you'd be impressed or something.
1759.2,1762.95,GILES,"Oh, don't worry, you've..."
1759.2,1762.95,GILES,made a very deep impression.
1763.76,1766.51,GILES,"Of everyone here,"
1766.64,1770.79,GILES,you were the one that I trusted most
1766.64,1770.79,GILES,to respect the forces of nature.
1771.84,1773.83,WILLOW,Are you saying you don't trust me?
1773.96,1776.47,GILES,Think what you've done to Buffy.
1776.6,1777.84,WILLOW,I brought her back.
1777.84,1779.07,GILES,At incredible risk!
1779.48,1782.15,WILLOW,Risk? Of what? Making her deader?
1782.56,1785.84,GILES,"Of killing us all, unleashing Hell on Earth."
1782.56,1785.84,GILES,Shall I go on?
1785.96,1787.63,WILLOW,No!
1787.76,1791.47,WILLOW,"Giles, I did what I had to do."
1787.76,1791.47,WILLOW,I did what nobody else could do.
1791.6,1795.39,GILES,"Oh, others in this world can do what"
1791.6,1795.39,GILES,you did. You just don't wanna meet them.
1795.72,1799.84,WILLOW,"No, probably not, but..."
1795.72,1799.84,WILLOW,"well, they're the bad guys."
1799.96,1802.08,WILLOW,I'm not a bad guy.
1802.2,1804.27,WILLOW,"I brought Buffy back into this world,"
1804.4,1808.92,WILLOW,and maybe the word you should be
1804.4,1808.92,WILLOW,looking for is "congratulations".
1809.64,1813.52,GILES,Having Buffy back in this world
1809.64,1813.52,GILES,"makes me feel indescribably wonderful,"
1813.64,1817.11,GILES,but I wouldn't congratulate you
1813.64,1817.11,GILES,if you'd jumped off a cliff and survived.
1817.24,1819.21,WILLOW,"That's not what I did, Giles."
1819.21,1820.23,GILES,You were lucky.
1820.48,1822.99,WILLOW,I wasn't lucky. I was amazing.
1823.12,1826.51,WILLOW,How would you know? You weren't there.
1823.12,1826.51,WILLOW,I'd have stopped you.
1826.64,1831.03,WILLOW,The magics you channelled are more
1826.64,1831.03,WILLOW,"ferocious than anything you can understand,"
1831.16,1834.87,GILES,"and you are lucky to be alive,"
1831.16,1834.87,GILES,"you rank, arrogant amateur!"
1835.92,1838.31,WILLOW,You're right.
1838.44,1841.91,WILLOW,The magics I used are very powerful.
1838.44,1841.91,WILLOW,I'm very powerful.
1842.04,1845.16,WILLOW,And maybe it's not such a good idea
1842.04,1845.16,WILLOW,for you to piss me off.
1848.64,1853.48,WILLOW,"Come on, Giles. I don't wanna fight."
1848.64,1853.48,WILLOW,"Let's not, OK?"
1853.6,1859.28,WILLOW,"I'll think about what you said,"
1853.6,1859.28,WILLOW,and you... try to be happy Buffy's back.
1860.48,1864.84,GILES,We still don't know where she was...
1860.48,1864.84,GILES,or what happened to her.
1865.92,1870.07,GILES,And I'm far from convinced
1865.92,1870.07,GILES,she's come out of all this undamaged.
1883.96,1885.79,BUFFY,"Hello, Spike."
1887.28,1890,SPIKE,You hear all that noise?
1891.48,1893.63,BUFFY,Just enough to make me feel crappy.
1893.96,1897.56,SPIKE,You know Watcherboy
1893.96,1897.56,SPIKE,doesn't mean anything by it.
1900.2,1902.35,BUFFY,I guess.
1903.16,1905.31,BUFFY,Everyone...
1907.48,1909.44,BUFFY,They all care.
1910.28,1913.48,BUFFY,"They all care so much, it..."
1910.28,1913.48,BUFFY,makes it all harder.
1914.36,1917.88,SPIKE,I'm not sure I followed you
1914.36,1917.88,SPIKE,"round that bend, love."
1920.02,1920.23,BUFFY,I don't know...
1921.68,1925.68,BUFFY,I just... I feel like I'm spending
1921.68,1925.68,BUFFY,"all of my time trying to be OK,"
1925.71,1928.03,BUFFY,so they don't worry.
1928.16,1930.12,BUFFY,It's exhausting.
1930.76,1932.72,BUFFY,And then I...
1934.92,1937.72,SPIKE,And that makes them worry even more.
1948.02,1948.47,SPIKE,You want me to take them out?
1948.6,1953.15,SPIKE,"Give me a hell of a headache,"
1948.6,1953.15,SPIKE,but I could probably thin the herd a little.
1955.44,1957.95,SPIKE,Knew I could get a grin.
1972.48,1975.47,BUFFY,Why are you always around
1972.48,1975.47,BUFFY,when I'm miserable?
1976.44,1979.32,SPIKE,"Cos that's when you're alone, I reckon."
1979.44,1982.59,SPIKE,I'm not one for crowds myself these days.
1984.56,1986.79,BUFFY,"Me, neither."
1986.92,1989.23,SPIKE,That works out nicely then.
1995.72,1998.03,BUFFY,So what do you know about finances?
2006.24,2008.2,GILES,Dawn?
2010.04,2011.67,GILES,Couldn't sleep?
2011.67,2013.4,DAWN,Not really. You?
2014.6,2016.56,GILES,Evidently not.
2017.44,2021.59,DAWN,You ever try mixing parts
2017.44,2021.59,DAWN,of every cereal you got in one bowl?
2022.36,2024.16,GILES,Does it work?
2024.28,2027.08,DAWN,Gonna find out.
2024.28,2027.08,DAWN,Wanna come join the experiment?
2027.56,2032.95,GILES,Why don't I be your control group? I find as
2027.56,2032.95,GILES,you get older that you lose patience with...
2033.72,2035.68,GILES,throwing up.
2036.52,2038.06,GILES,Is that locked?
2038.06,2039.4,DAWN,It should be.
2048.36,2051.8,DEMON,You're not the Slayer.
2048.36,2051.8,DEMON,But you'll do for a start.
2059.2,2061.4,BUFFY,"You're payin' for that door, buddy."
2063.76,2065.91,BUFFY,Oh! Table!
2068.48,2070.87,DEMON,"You have cost me, Slayer."
2070.87,2071.92,BUFFY,I cost you?
2072.04,2074.08,BUFFY,"That's a designer lamp, you mook!"
2092.02,2092.39,BUFFY,"Spike, no! I want him in the kitchen!"
2101.8,2103.84,BUFFY,Open the door! The basement!
2104.24,2106.2,BUFFY,I'm takin' him down.
2128.72,2129.79,BUFFY,No!
2138.24,2141.12,BUFFY,Full... copper... repipe!
2141.64,2143.63,BUFFY,No... more...
2143.76,2146.8,BUFFY,full... copper... repipe!
2164.28,2166.67,SPIKE,Did you know this place was flooded?
2169.72,2172.31,WARREN,I think we got a lot to feel good about.
2173.4,2176.47,WARREN,"We got the money, we got the lair..."
2177.76,2181.96,WARREN,And our one loose end
2177.76,2181.96,WARREN,has been taken care of... by the Slayer.
2183.76,2185.72,WARREN,Flamethrower's up.
2186.76,2189.07,ANDREW,Periscope's working.
2189.2,2192.03,ANDREW,Looks like your mom's weeding tulips again.
2192.16,2195.07,JONATHAN,Action figures... fully deployed.
2196.48,2200.55,ANDREW,I still can't believe it. We did it!
2196.48,2200.55,ANDREW,We can do anything.
2200.68,2202.7,ANDREW,We could stay up all night if we wanna.
2202.7,2203.27,WARREN,"Whoa, whoa!"
2203.4,2205.56,WARREN,"Don't get all crazy on us, Andrew."
2205.56,2206.71,ANDREW,I was only saying.
2206.84,2211.07,JONATHAN,What are we gonna do about Buffy? Sooner
2206.84,2211.07,JONATHAN,"or later, the Slayer's gotta come after us."
2211.2,2211.99,ANDREW,Bring her on.
2211.99,2213.4,WARREN,We could hypnotise her.
2213.52,2215.88,ANDREW,Make her our willing sex bunny.
2217.52,2219.88,JONATHAN,I'm putting that on the list!
2221.08,2225.28,ANDREW,"Is this the life, or what? I mean,"
2221.08,2225.28,ANDREW,"we got all the stuff we ever wanted,"
2225.4,2227.55,ANDREW,and we didn't even have to...
2228.52,2229.72,WARREN,Earn it?
2229.72,2231.51,ANDREW,Exactamundo.
2232.64,2238.48,JONATHAN,"It's true, my friends. The way I see it,"
2232.64,2238.48,JONATHAN,life is like an interstellar journey.
2238.6,2242.15,JONATHAN,Some people go into hypersleep
2238.6,2242.15,JONATHAN,"and travel at sublight speeds,"
2242.28,2247.96,JONATHAN,only to get where they're going after years
2242.28,2247.96,JONATHAN,"of struggle, toil and hard, hard work."
2248.4,2250.01,JONATHAN,"We, on the other hand..."
2250.01,2252.55,ANDREW,Blast through spacetime in a wormhole?
2252.68,2256.64,JONATHAN,"Gentlemen, crime is our wormhole."
2258.16,2261.23,ANDREW,"But everyone knows,"
2258.16,2261.23,ANDREW,if the width of a wormhole cavity
2261.36,2264.24,ANDREW,is a whole number of wavelengths
2261.36,2264.24,ANDREW,"plus a fraction of one,"
2264.36,2267.56,ANDREW,the coinciding particle activity
2264.36,2267.56,ANDREW,collapses the infrastructure.
2267.68,2269.67,WARREN,"Dude, don't be a geek."
2273.52,2276.36,BUFFY,"This is gonna take forever, isn't it?"
2276.36,2279.04,ANYA,Not forever. Just a very long time.
2279.16,2283.23,ANYA,Here it is. Your first approximation
2279.16,2283.23,ANYA,of your spanking new debt.
2285.16,2288.84,BUFFY,I've trashed this house so many times.
2285.16,2288.84,BUFFY,How did Mom pay for this?
2288.96,2292.4,XANDER,"For starters, she saved money"
2288.96,2292.4,XANDER,with this crappyass coffee table.
2292.52,2294.86,ANYA,"Well, there's always that charging option."
2294.86,2295.03,BUFFY,No!
2295.16,2299.15,BUFFY,I will definitely...
2295.16,2299.15,BUFFY,probably not be doing that.
2299.56,2303.68,GILES,"Well, I know I'm back in America"
2299.56,2303.68,GILES,now I've been knocked unconscious.
2303.8,2304.92,GILES,Thank you.
2305.04,2307.16,BUFFY,Poor lumpy Giles.
2307.28,2310.43,TARA,What do you think
2307.28,2310.43,TARA,the demon wanted anyway?
2310.56,2312.95,TARA,Aside from costing you a bundle.
2313.08,2317.2,BUFFY,Don't know. Now he's way too dead
2313.08,2317.2,BUFFY,to answer that question.
2317.32,2319.29,BUFFY,Wish I knew who hired him.
2319.29,2321.71,WILLOW,"Ooh, I could do a locator spell."
2322.84,2324.07,WILLOW,Or not.
2324.2,2325.76,XANDER,That's it.
2325.88,2328.44,XANDER,It's been four hours.
2325.88,2328.44,XANDER,"I'm calling it, people."
2328.56,2332.27,XANDER,"This coffee table, it's gone. Damn it!"
2332.76,2335.27,DAWN,"Also, this lamp's in critical condition."
2335.4,2340.55,WILLOW,"Well, let's take these things out to the"
2335.4,2340.55,WILLOW,trash and give 'em a decent throwin' out.
2354.44,2356.8,GILES,Buffy...
2361.02,2361.94,BUFFY,I don't think I can do this.
2361.94,2362.36,GILES,"Yes, you can."
2363.32,2366.76,GILES,Your mother dealt with
2363.32,2366.76,GILES,this sort of thing all the time.
2366.88,2374.02,GILES,"She took one crisis at a time,"
2366.88,2374.02,GILES,"without the aid of any superpowers,"
2373.48,2375.68,GILES,and got through it all. So can you.
2376.8,2378.35,BUFFY,You sure?
2378.35,2380.59,GILES,I'm positive.
2383.08,2385.96,BUFFY,Who's calling me?
2383.08,2385.96,BUFFY,Everybody I know lives here.
2387.08,2389.72,BUFFY,I'll be back.
2390.68,2392.64,DAWN,I bet it's creditors.
2392.76,2395.4,DAWN,The hounding's begun. I read about it.
2395.52,2397.51,DAWN,So you think we'll starve?
2397.51,2399.12,GILES,I very much doubt it.
2399.76,2404.15,DAWN,No chance I'd have to quit school to
2399.76,2404.15,DAWN,work in a poorly ventilated sweatshop?
2404.28,2405.82,DAWN,Poorly ventilated...
2405.82,2407.91,GILES,What have you been reading?
2409.36,2411.32,GILES,"Buffy, what is it?"
2412.64,2414.07,BUFFY,Angel.
2414.32,2415.61,GILES,Is he in trouble?
2415.61,2417.12,BUFFY,He knows that I'm...
2418.64,2422.19,BUFFY,He needs to see me. I have to see him.
2422.32,2424.79,GILES,Of course. You'll leave for LA tomorrow.
2425.28,2427.67,BUFFY,Not LA. And not here.
2428.36,2430.35,BUFFY,Somewhere in the middle.
2430.48,2432.42,BUFFY,There's a place.
2432.42,2433.15,GILES,I see.
2433.6,2436.19,GILES,"Well, we should get these bills"
2433.6,2436.19,GILES,out of the way...
2436.32,2438.2,BUFFY,I have to go now.
2440.68,2443.59,BUFFY,Um... Thanks for taking care of this for me.
