2.55,6.31,,So what do you think?
2.55,6.31,,It's nice.
6.35,8.7,Xander,But do you think Cordelia will like it?
8.82,13.26,Buffy,I don't know.
8.82,13.26,Buffy,Does she know what one of these is?
13.29,14.83,Xander,"OK, big yucks."
14.83,17.22,Xander,"When are you, guys, gonna"
14.83,17.22,Xander,stop making fun of me for dating Cordelia?
17.26,20.04,Buffy,I'm sorry. But never.
20.08,22.12,Xander,I just think you could find
22.12,23.93,Buffy,somebody more... Better.
23.96,26.4,Xander,"Uh. Parallel universe, maybe."
26.43,30.85,Xander,Here the only other person
26.43,30.85,Xander,"I'm interested in is, um, unavailable."
31.42,33.36,Xander,"Besides, Cordy and I"
31.42,33.36,Xander,are really gettin' along.
33.36,36.66,Xander,"We're not fighting as much, and yesterday"
33.36,36.66,Xander,"we just sat together, not even speakin'."
36.7,41.11,Xander,"You know, just, uh,"
36.7,41.11,Xander,enjoying comfortable silence.
42.09,43.97,Buffy,"Man, that was dull."
46.02,47.63,Buffy,I'm glad that you guys are getting along.
46.02,47.63,Buffy,Almost really.
47.67,49.47,Buffy,And don't stress over the gift.
49.51,51.03,Xander,"Well, this is new territory for me."
51.04,54.65,Xander,"I mean, my valentines are usually"
51.04,54.65,Xander,met with heartfelt restraining orders.
54.69,56.22,Buffy,She'll love it.
56.26,58.09,Xander,"I wish dating was like slaying, you know?"
58.09,61.84,Xander,"simple, direct, stake to the heart,"
58.09,61.84,Xander,"no muss, no fuss."
94.18,95.93,Buffy,"Sorry to say, Xand."
95.93,98.51,Buffy,Slaying is a tad
95.93,98.51,Buffy,more perilous than dating.
98.55,101.67,Xander,"Well, you're obviously"
98.55,101.67,Xander,not dating Cordelia.
153.57,159.61,Cordelia,"b>""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered""</b>"
170.43,171.96,Cordelia,Wait up!
171.99,173.59,Cordelia,"Hey, wait up!"
175.65,178.35,Cordelia,Excuse me? Where's the fire sale?
178.38,180.85,Harmony,"Oh, sorry. Didn't see you."
180.88,181.58,Harmony,"Well, why didn't you"
181.58,182.43,Cordelia,call me back last night?
182.43,184.07,Cordelia,We need to talk about
182.43,184.07,Cordelia,our outfits for the dance.
184.11,186.79,Cordelia,"I'm gonna wear red and black,"
184.11,186.79,Cordelia,so you need to switch.
186.82,188.01,Cordelia,Red and black?
188.01,190.22,Kate,Is that what Xander likes?
190.25,190.61,Kate,Xander?
190.61,192.37,Cordelia,What does he have to do with this?
192.37,195.55,Harmony,"Well, a girl wants to look good"
192.37,195.55,Harmony,for her geek.
195.78,197.31,Cordelia,Xander's just...
197.31,200.14,Harmony,When are you two gonna start wearing
197.31,200.14,Harmony,cute little matching outfits?
200.18,203.51,Harmony,Cause I'm planning to vomit.
200.18,203.51,Harmony,Let's go.
207.04,208.79,Ms. Beakman,Papers on my desk.
208.82,212.85,Ms. Beakman,Anybody tries to leave without giving me
208.82,212.85,Ms. Beakman,a paper is looking at a failing grade.
213.74,217.09,Xander,This time I'm ready for ya.
213.74,217.09,Xander,No F for Xander today.
217.12,220.96,Xander,"No, this baby's my ticket"
217.12,220.96,Xander,to a sweet D minus.
221.47,223.55,Willow,"Hey, Amy."
221.47,223.55,Willow,Hey.
223.58,226.24,Amy,"You, guys, going to the"
223.58,226.24,Amy,Valentine's Day dance at the Bronze?
226.24,227.59,Amy,I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
227.59,228.97,Buffy,"Go ahead, you know you wanna say it."
231.02,233.02,Willow,My boyfriend's in the band.
231.04,231.38,Amy,Cool!
231.38,233.73,Buffy,I think you've now told everybody.
233.76,235.88,Willow,Only in this hemisphere.
235.88,237.2,Amy,What about you?
237.24,241.88,Buffy,"Oh, Valentine's Day is just a cheap gimmick"
237.24,241.88,Buffy,to sell cards and chocolate.
242.09,244.58,Amy,"Bad breakup, huh?"
244.7,246.92,Buffy,Believe me when I say "Uhhuh".
249.72,251.93,Mrs. Beakman,Thank you. Thank you.
259.3,261.14,Mrs. Beakman,"Thank you, Amy."
266.83,270.34,Willow,I just hate to think of you solo
266.83,270.34,Willow,on Valentine's Day.
270.6,273.96,Buffy,I'll be fine. Mom and I are gonna have
270.6,273.96,Buffy,a pigout and vid fest.
273.96,276.05,Buffy,It's a timehonored tradition
273.96,276.05,Buffy,among the loveless.
276.08,277.54,Xander,"Did you, guys, see that?"
277.54,278.09,Buffy,See what?
278.13,281.12,Xander,In class. I think Amy just worked
278.13,281.12,Xander,some magic on Miss Beakman.
281.27,282.87,Buffy,You mean like witchcraft?
282.87,284.19,Willow,"You know, her mom's a witch."
284.19,285.22,Buffy,And an amateur psycho.
285.26,287.81,Buffy,Amy's the last person
285.26,287.81,Buffy,that should be messing with that stuff.
287.84,289.79,Xander,Maybe I should go talk to her.
289.79,290.64,Giles,Buffy? Buffy?
291.31,292.67,Giles,Might I have a word?
292.67,294.09,Buffy,Have a sentence even.
294.45,295.62,Giles,"Oh, good. Well..."
295.62,297.55,Jenny,Back it up before you leave.
303.24,304.49,Jenny,Rupert.
304.49,306.63,Giles,Ms Calendar.
308.78,313.36,Jenny,"I'm glad we ran into each other, actually."
308.78,313.36,Jenny,"I was hoping that we could, uh..."
313.91,316.2,Jenny,Do you have a minute?
316.2,316.85,Giles,Erm...
317.04,319.47,Giles,"Actually, not, not just now. Um..."
319.47,323.26,Giles,"I, uh, have a matter"
319.47,323.26,Giles,"to discuss with, with Buffy."
323.45,326.87,Buffy,Right. Let's go.
346.28,348.37,Buffy,Are you OK?
348.79,351.78,Giles,Me? I'll... I'll be fine.
351.81,354.98,Giles,"Um, I was more concerned about you,"
351.81,354.98,Giles,actually.
355.07,358.91,Giles,"Since Angel, erm, turned..."
358.95,363.37,Giles,"I've, um, been reading up on,"
358.95,363.37,Giles,on his earlier activities.
363.4,366.54,Giles,"Y'know, uh, feeding patterns"
363.4,366.54,Giles,aand the like.
366.99,369.07,Buffy,And?
369.5,373.33,Giles,"Around Valentine's Day, he, he,"
369.5,373.33,Giles,"he's rather prone to, uh..."
373.36,376.45,Giles,"well, erm, brutal displays of, uh..."
376.45,379.37,Giles,He would think of it
376.45,379.37,Giles,"as affection, I suppose."
379.4,380.4,Buffy,Like what?
380.4,384.18,Giles,"No... no, uh, need to go into details."
384.57,385.17,Buffy,That bad?
385.17,386.69,Giles,"Suffice it to say, I..."
386.73,389.48,Giles,"I, I think it would be best"
386.73,389.48,Giles,if you stayed off the streets...
389.48,391.62,Giles,For a few nights.
391.66,393.87,Buffy,"I, I'll, erm..."
393.87,397.08,Buffy,I'll patrol.
393.87,397.08,Buffy,"You know, keep an eye on things."
399.33,401.87,Buffy,Better safe than sorry.
403.3,406.17,Buffy,It's a little late for both.
412.56,415.26,Spike,"Fancy it, pet?"
416.32,419.32,Drusilla,It's beautiful.
421.97,424.23,Spike,Nothing but the best for my gir...
427.42,430.14,Angelus,"Happy Valentine's Day, Dru."
433.07,435.07,Drusilla,Angel!
435.15,437.4,Drusilla,It's still warm.
437.43,439.81,Angelus,I knew you'd like it.
440.18,443.71,Angelus,I found it in a quaint little shopgirl.
450.02,451.89,Angelus,Cute.
453.98,456.2,Angelus,Here.
459.43,461.64,Spike,I'll get it.
461.94,464.19,Angelus,Done.
464.65,466.87,Angelus,I know Dru gives you pity access...
467.16,470.63,Angelus,but you have to admit it's so much
467.16,470.63,Angelus,easier when I do things for her!
470.67,474.33,Spike,You would do well
470.67,474.33,Spike,to worry less about Dru...
474.37,475.95,Spike,and more about that slayer
475.95,477.96,Angelus,you've been tramping around with.
477.96,480.35,Angelus,Dear Buffy. Hm.
480.38,483.57,Angelus,I'm still trying to decide
480.38,483.57,Angelus,the best way to send my regards.
483.6,487.73,Spike,Why don't you rip her lungs out?
483.6,487.73,Spike,That might make an impression.
487.78,490.19,Angelus,Lacks... poetry.
490.22,492.36,Spike,It doesn't have to.
492.39,495.84,Spike,What rhymes with lungs?
496.46,499.26,Drusilla,"Don't worry, Spike."
499.67,502.66,Drusilla,Angel always knows...
502.69,507.13,Drusilla,what speaks to a girl's heart.

667.76,668.48,Cordelia,Perfect.
668.51,670.35,Cordelia,"Had to make this harder, didn't you?"
670.39,672.97,Xander,"OK, clearly the fact"
670.39,672.97,Xander,that I please you visually
675.02,675.24,Xander,has got us off on the wrong foot here.
675.24,675.29,Cordelia,Xander...
675.33,677.22,Cordelia,Let me finish.
677.68,680.09,Cordelia,I've been thinking a lot
677.68,680.09,Cordelia,about us lately.
680.19,682.6,Cordelia,The why and the wherefore.
682.71,687.34,Cordelia,"You know, once, twice."
682.71,687.34,Cordelia,"A kissy here, a kissy there."
688.35,690.87,Cordelia,And you can chalk it all up to hormones.
690.9,695.26,Cordelia,And maybe that's all we have here 
690.9,695.26,Cordelia,"tawdry, teen lust."
695.29,697.14,Cordelia,But maybe not.
697.18,702.12,Cordelia,Maybe something in you sees something
697.18,702.12,Cordelia,"special inside me, and vice versa."
703.42,706.11,Cordelia,"I mean, I think I do. See something."
706.88,709.28,Cordelia,So...
709.49,711.45,Cordelia,Xander.
713.89,716.15,Cordelia,Thank you.
716.4,718.69,Cordelia,It's beautiful.
720.79,723.28,Cordelia,I wanna break up.
725.81,728.68,Xander,"OK, not quite the reaction"
725.81,728.68,Xander,I was lookin' for.
728.71,731.59,Cordelia,I know. I'm sorry. It's just...
732.09,736.52,Cordelia,Who are we kidding?
732.09,736.52,Cordelia,Even if parts of us do see specialness...
737.4,739.46,Cordelia,We don't fit.
739.62,741.59,Xander,Yeah.
742.03,743.67,Xander,OK.
744.24,746.21,Xander,Do you know what's a good day
744.24,746.21,Xander,to break up with somebody?
746.21,749.04,,Any day besides Valentine's Day!
749.15,752.41,,"I mean, what?"
749.15,752.41,,Were you runnin' low on dramatic irony?
752.6,755.31,Cordelia,I know.
752.6,755.31,Cordelia,I didn't mean to do it this way. I...
755.35,757.41,Xander,"Well, you did."
770.8,774.25,Jack,Dude! Way to get dumped!
780.75,782.94,Xander,"Buffy, my bud, you would not believe..."
782.94,784.52,Buffy,Can't talk right now. Angel.
784.81,786.17,Xander,Do you need help?
786.17,787.37,Buffy,It's all right.
797.17,800.21,Harmony,"Gee, Xander, maybe"
797.17,800.21,Harmony,"you should learn a second language,"
800.21,803.6,Harmony,so that even more girls
800.21,803.6,Harmony,can reject you.
818.62,820.51,Amy,What are you doing?
821.03,823.7,Xander,Amy. Good to see ya.
824.07,826.49,Xander,You're a witch.
826.68,830.19,Amy,"No, I'm not."
826.68,830.19,Amy,"That... that was my mom, remember?"
830.22,832.11,Xander,Yeah. I'm thinkin'
830.22,832.11,Xander,that runs in the family.
832.14,834.64,Xander,I saw you working
832.14,834.64,Xander,that mojo on Miss Beakman.
834.68,836.36,Xander,Maybe I should go tell somebody.
836.36,838.19,Amy,That's not even... That is so mean!
838.71,840.58,Xander,Blackmail is such an ugly word.
840.58,841.96,Amy,I didn't say blackmail.
842,846.32,Xander,"Yeah, but I'm about to blackmail you,"
842,846.32,Xander,so I thought I'd bring it up.
846.48,848.71,Amy,What do you want?
849.82,851.97,Amy,What do I want?
854.02,853.85,Xander,I want some respect around here.
853.85,856.7,Xander,"I want, for once, to come out ahead."
856.73,859.65,Xander,I want the Hellmouth
856.73,859.65,Xander,to be workin' for me.
860.18,862.52,Xander,"You and me, Amy."
865.3,868.84,Xander,We're gonna cast a little spell.
873.26,875.09,Amy,A love spell?
875.09,875.79,Xander,Yeah.
875.82,878.16,Xander,"You know, just the basic."
875.82,878.16,Xander,"Can't eat, can't sleep,"
878.16,880.46,Xander,can't breathe anything
878.16,880.46,Xander,but little old moi.
880.5,885.02,Amy,"Well, that kind of thing"
880.5,885.02,Amy,"is the hardest, I mean..."
883.05,885.44,Amy,to make someone...
883.05,885.44,Amy,love you for all eternity?
885.47,889.52,Xander,Whoa! Whoa! Back up.
885.47,889.52,Xander,Who said anything about eternity?
889.56,892.83,Xander,A man can only talk selftanning lotion
889.56,892.83,Xander,for so long before his head explodes.
892.87,894.44,Amy,"Well then, I don't get it."
894.44,896.77,Amy,If you don't wanna be
894.44,896.77,Amy,"with her for ever, what's the point?"
896.81,898.67,Xander,"The point is, I want her to want me,"
898.67,900.73,Xander,"desperately,"
898.67,900.73,Xander,so I can break up with her...
900.77,902.44,Xander,and subject her to the same hell
902.44,904,Amy,she's been puttin' me through.
904.13,907.64,Amy,"Oh, I don't know, Xander."
907.89,912.5,Xander,Intent has to be pure with love spells.
907.89,912.5,Xander,Right. I intend revenge.
912.54,914.06,Xander,Pure as the driven snow.
914.1,916.28,Xander,"Now, are you gonna play, or"
916.28,919.97,Xander,do we need to have another chat
916.28,919.97,Xander,about invisible homework?
921.7,926.07,Amy,I'll need something of hers.
921.7,926.07,Amy,A personal object.
926.42,928.02,Xander,Right.
935.51,937.05,Buffy,"Soon"" what, Giles?"
937.05,940.59,Buffy,"You never held out on me until the big,"
937.05,940.59,Buffy,bad thing in the dark became my exhoney.
940.63,941.72,Giles,Where's this from?
941.72,943.18,Buffy,He said it with flowers.
943.21,946.18,Buffy,This isn't the time to start
943.21,946.18,Buffy,becoming Mr. Protective Guy.
946.22,949.35,Buffy,I can't just hang around and I can't
946.22,949.35,Buffy,prepare when I don't know what's coming.
949.39,952.46,Giles,No. Of course. You're right.
952.49,954.78,Xander,Ssit down.
962.5,964.46,Xander,"Oh, come on! Don't flatter yourself."
964.46,967.42,Xander,I'm not gonna make a big scene.
964.46,967.42,Xander,I just want the necklace back.
967.46,969.59,Cordelia,What? I thought it was a gift!
969.59,972.24,Xander,"No, last night it was a gift."
969.59,972.24,Xander,Today it's scrap metal.
972.28,975.48,Xander,I figure I can melt it down
972.28,975.48,Xander,and sell it for fillings or something.
975.52,976.53,Cordelia,You're pathetic!
976.53,977.03,Xander,Come on.
977.06,981.04,Xander,I'm not gonna add to
977.06,981.04,Xander,the Cordelia Chase CastOff Collection.
981.33,984.23,Cordelia,It's in my locker.
984.47,986.94,Xander,I can wait.
1012.02,1012.39,Cordelia,Here. It's a good thing we broke up.
1012.4,1015.29,Cordelia,Now I don't have to pretend I like it.
1026.32,1028.36,Amy,Diana!
1029.36,1032.44,Amy,Goddess of love and the hunt...
1032.5,1034.41,Amy,I pray to thee.
1034.44,1038.46,Amy,Let my cries bind the heart
1034.44,1038.46,Amy,of Xander's beloved.
1039.2,1043.1,Amy,May she neither rest nor sleep...
1043.17,1046.21,Amy,until she submits to his will only.
1046.24,1047.97,Amy,Diana!
1050.02,1050.47,Amy,Bring about this love and bless it!
1055.02,1055.04,Amy,Blow out the candle now!
1074.14,1077.35,Amy,Remember? I don't remember.
1078.74,1079.49,Cordelia,What?
1079.49,1081.91,Xander,"Morning, ladies."
1082.93,1084.06,Xander,Some kind of weather
1084.06,1085.35,,"we've been havin', huh?"
1085.44,1087.03,Cordelia,What do you want?
1087.03,1089.83,Cordelia,You can't be sniffing around
1087.03,1089.83,Cordelia,"for more jewellery to melt,"
1089.87,1093.76,Cordelia,cause all you ever gave me
1089.87,1093.76,Cordelia,was that Smallmartlooking thing.
1094.85,1098.65,Xander,Is this love? 'Cause maybe on you
1094.85,1098.65,Xander,it doesn't look that different.
1098.69,1102.51,Cordelia,"What are you doing? Are you going,"
1098.69,1102.51,Cordelia,"like, stalker boy on me now?"
1106.15,1107.91,Xander,"Sorry, my mistake."
1107.91,1110.07,Cordelia,"Yeah, I should say so."
1112.66,1114.35,Cordelia,What is his deal?
1115.27,1116.82,Giles,"Oh, here's another. Here."
1116.86,1122.47,Giles,"Um, 'Valentine's Day.' Yes, uh..."
1116.86,1122.47,Giles,Angel nails a puppy to the...
1122.51,1123.51,Buffy,Skip it.
1123.51,1125.14,Giles,"Uh, but it..."
1125.18,1128.04,Buffy,I don't wanna know.
1125.18,1128.04,Buffy,I don't have a puppy. Skip it.
1129.18,1132.34,Giles,Right you are. I'll get another batch.
1132.84,1134.56,Xander,I have a plan.
1134.72,1136.04,Xander,We use me as bait.
1136.04,1138.61,Buffy,You mean make Angel come after you?
1138.64,1140.47,Xander,"No, I mean chop me into little pieces"
1140.47,1142.26,Xander,and stick me on hooks
1140.47,1142.26,Xander,for fish to nibble at
1142.29,1145.04,Xander,cause it would be more fun
1142.29,1145.04,Xander,than my life.
1145.39,1149.08,Buffy,Yeah. I heard about you and Cordy.
1149.16,1151.8,Buffy,That's her loss.
1149.16,1151.8,Buffy,Yeah.
1151.84,1154.05,Xander,Not really the popular theory.
1156.06,1158.23,Buffy,You know what I'd like?
1158.26,1161.45,Buffy,Why don't you and I do something
1158.26,1161.45,Buffy,together tonight? Just the two of us.
1162.97,1163.68,Xander,Really?
1163.68,1166.91,Buffy,Yeah. We can comfort each other.
1166.95,1169.86,Xander,"Well, would lap dancing"
1166.95,1169.86,Xander,enter into that scenario at all?
1169.86,1172.4,Xander,Cause I find that very comforting.
1175.42,1177.57,Buffy,Play your cards right...
1178.66,1182.14,Xander,"OK, uh... you do know"
1178.66,1182.14,Xander,"that I'm Xander, right?"
1183.05,1185.1,Buffy,"I don't know, I just..."
1185.56,1188.2,Buffy,heard that you and Cordy
1185.56,1188.2,Buffy,"broke up, and..."
1188.7,1192,Buffy,I guess I was just surprised
1188.7,1192,Buffy,how glad I was.
1193.72,1195.64,Xander,It's funny... how you can
1195.64,1197.33,Buffy,"see someone every day,"
1197.37,1201.49,Xander,but... not really see them. You know?
1202.51,1204.95,Xander,"Yeah, it's funny."
1205.02,1207.25,Xander,And it's just gettin' funnier.
1212.25,1215.69,Amy,"Xander,"
1212.25,1215.69,Amy,can I talk to you for a minute?
1220.51,1222.14,Xander,"Yeah, OK."
1222.14,1224.35,Amy,Oh! This is interesting!
1226.36,1227.34,Amy,Xander?
1227.34,1228.04,Xander,Yeah.
1228.08,1230.02,Amy,I don't think the spell worked out right.
1230.02,1231.48,Xander,"Oh, yeah, it bombed. No biggie."
1231.52,1235.18,Amy,"Well, we can always try again."
1231.52,1235.18,Amy,I am still pretty new at this.
1235.78,1237.76,Xander,"Oh, no, no. It's OK. You know what?"
1235.78,1237.76,Xander,It was wrong
1237.8,1240.7,Xander,to meddle with the forces of darkness.
1237.8,1240.7,Xander,I see that now.
1240.73,1242.48,Xander,I think we've all grown. I gotta go.
1242.48,1244.28,Amy,"Oh, we don't have to cast any spells."
1244.56,1247.07,Amy,We can just... hang out.
1247.11,1249.25,Xander,Sure.
1249.58,1250.03,Xander,What?
1250.03,1253.32,Amy,"Well, I liked spending time with you."
1253.35,1255.8,Amy,You're so sweet.
1255.86,1258.73,Amy,"You know, it's funny how you can..."
1255.86,1258.73,Amy,you can see a person every day and...
1258.77,1261.64,Xander,Not really see them?
1261.67,1263.89,Amy,Exactly.
1265.18,1267.07,Amy,"So, anyway, I thought it may be..."
1267.07,1268.13,Cordette,"Hi, Xander."
1268.13,1268.61,Xander,What?
1268.64,1270.58,Cordette,You're in Mr. Baird's
1268.64,1270.58,Cordette,"history class, right?"
1270.62,1270.99,Xander,Yeah.
1270.99,1272.16,Cordette,"I thought, maybe"
1272.16,1274.36,Cordette,we could study together tonight.
1274.36,1276.36,Amy,Do you mind? We were talking.
1276.66,1278.74,Xander,I really gotta go.
1278.78,1280.88,Xander,Right now.
1296.99,1300.46,Willow,Sorry. I wanted to surprise you.
1300.75,1303.59,Xander,Good job! High marks.
1303.63,1307.44,Willow,Don't be so jumpy.
1303.63,1307.44,Willow,I've been in your bed before.
1307.66,1310.64,Xander,"Yeah, but, Will,"
1307.66,1310.64,Xander,we were both in footie pajamas.
1310.69,1313.14,Willow,"Xand, I've been thinking."
1313.18,1315.38,Willow,"Will, I... I think I know"
1313.18,1315.38,Willow,what you've been thinking.
1315.38,1317.26,Xander,But this is all my fault.
1317.3,1319.32,Xander,I cast a spell and it sort of backfired.
1319.32,1320.84,Willow,How long have we been friends?
1320.87,1322.87,Xander,"A long, long time."
1322.91,1325.89,Xander,Too long to do anything
1322.91,1325.89,Xander,that might change that now.
1325.93,1328.12,Willow,But friendships change all the time.
1328.37,1332.43,Willow,People grow apart. They grow closer.
1332.76,1334.62,Xander,This is good  how close we are now.
1334.62,1337.04,Xander,I feel comfortable
1334.62,1337.04,Xander,with this amount of closeness.
1337.16,1340.49,Xander,"In fact, I can even back up"
1337.16,1340.49,Xander,a few paces and still be happy.
1341.55,1343.22,Xander,See?
1344.72,1347.03,Willow,"I want you, Xander..."
1347.54,1349.24,Willow,to be my first.
1349.24,1350.15,Xander,Baseman?
1350.19,1352.41,Xander,"Please, tell me we're talking baseball."
1354.89,1357.62,Willow,We both know it's right.
1357.67,1359.97,Xander,It's not that I don't find you sexy.
1362.02,1363.31,Willow,Is it Oz? Don't worry about him.
1363.31,1366.46,Willow,"He's sweet, but... he's not you."
1366.49,1370.64,Xander,"Yes, he is! And you should go to him."
1366.49,1370.64,Xander,Cause he's me!
1373.99,1376.19,Xander,III don't wanna use force.
1377.1,1378.87,Willow,Force is OK.
1379.21,1381.86,Xander,That's it! This has gotta stop!
1382.53,1384.86,Xander,It's time for me to act like a man!
1384.89,1386.7,Xander,And hide!
1395.43,1399.58,Cordelia,"Ha, very funny. What did I do now?"
1395.43,1399.58,Cordelia,Wear red and purple together?
1399.62,1403.37,Harmony,You know what you did.
1399.62,1403.37,Harmony,Xander is wounded because of you.
1404.64,1407.48,Cordelia,Are you tripping? I thought
1404.64,1407.48,Cordelia,you wanted me to break up with him.
1407.52,1412.76,Harmony,"Only a sick pup would let Xander get away,"
1407.52,1412.76,Harmony,no matter what her friends said.
1414.06,1417.11,Cordelia,What does it take to make you people happy?

1490.66,1491.56,Giles,What is it?
1491.56,1492.88,Xander,It's... it's me.
1493.59,1495.63,Xander,Throwing myself at your mercy.
1495.63,1496.31,Giles,What? Why?
1496.31,1497.86,Xander,"I made a mess, Giles."
1497.86,1501.24,Xander,"See, I found out that Amy's into"
1497.86,1501.24,Xander,"witchcraft, and... I was hurt I guess."
1501.28,1504.86,Xander,So I... made her put the love whammy
1501.28,1504.86,Xander,"on Cordy, but it backfired."
1504.9,1507.46,Xander,And now every woman in Sunnydale
1504.9,1507.46,Xander,wants to make me her cuddle monkey.
1507.5,1509.12,Xander,"Which may sound swell on paper, but..."
1509.49,1512.63,Jenny,"Rupert, we need to talk. Hey, Xander."
1512.66,1514.35,Jenny,Nice shirt.
1514.38,1516.4,Jenny,"Look, Rupert,"
1514.38,1516.4,Jenny,"I know you're angry at me,"
1516.4,1520.05,Jenny,"and I don't blame you,"
1516.4,1520.05,Jenny,but I am not just gonna go away.
1520.16,1523.64,Giles,"I mean, I care far too much about you to..."
1523.67,1526.21,Giles,Have you been working out?
1532.09,1532.96,Giles,I cannot believe
1532.96,1534.69,,you were fool enough to do this.
1534.72,1536.79,Jenny,"Oh, no. I'm twice the fool it takes"
1536.79,1538.33,Giles,to do something like this.
1538.99,1543.42,Giles,"Has, erm..."
1538.99,1543.42,Giles,Has Amy tried to reverse the spell?
1543.45,1546.51,Xander,I get around Amy and all she wants
1543.45,1546.51,Xander,to do is talk honeymoon plans.
1546.52,1548.88,Jenny,"Rupert, maybe I need to"
1546.52,1548.88,Jenny,talk to Xander alone.
1548.92,1550.91,Giles,Do you have any idea
1548.92,1550.91,Giles,how serious this is?
1550.95,1554.36,Giles,"People under a love spell,"
1550.95,1554.36,Giles,"Xander, are deadly."
1554.38,1557.31,Giles,They lose all capacity for reason.
1557.35,1562.16,Giles,"And if what you say is true, and the"
1557.35,1562.16,Giles,entire female population is affected...
1563.9,1565.42,Giles,Don't leave the library.
1565.43,1568.93,Giles,I'll find Amy and see
1565.43,1568.93,Giles,if we can put a stop to this thing.
1576.65,1578.32,Jenny,No.
1596.75,1599.29,Buffy,Alone at last.
1600.09,1603.01,Xander,Buff! Give me a heart attack!
1603.01,1603.51,Buffy,Oh...
1603.54,1605.69,Buffy,I'm gonna give you more than that.
1605.94,1608.11,Xander,"Buff, for the love of God,"
1608.11,1610.19,Buffy,don't open that raincoat.
1610.76,1613.72,Buffy,"Come on, it's a party."
1614.1,1616.56,Buffy,Aren't you gonna open your present?
1617.24,1621.02,Xander,It's not that I don't want to.
1621.02,1621.53,Buffy,Sometimes the remote impossible
1621.02,1621.53,Buffy,possibility that you might like me...
1621.57,1624.32,Buffy,was all that sustained me. But not now.
1624.77,1626.61,Buffy,Not like this.
1626.88,1630.75,Buffy,This isn't real to you.
1626.88,1630.75,Buffy,You're only here because of a spell.
1631.13,1635.15,Buffy,"I mean, if I thought you had one clue"
1631.13,1635.15,Buffy,what it would mean to me...
1635.67,1638.28,Xander,But you don't.
1639.83,1642.17,Xander,So I can't.
1642.97,1645.56,Buffy,So you're saying this is all a game?
1645.59,1648.32,Xander,A game? I... No!
1648.35,1651.52,Buffy,You make me feel this way
1648.35,1651.52,Buffy,and then you reject me?
1651.52,1652.64,Buffy,"What am I, a toy?"
1652.64,1654.21,Xander,"Buffy, please calm down!"
1654.25,1656.75,Buffy,I'll calm down
1654.25,1656.75,Buffy,when you explain yourself!
1656.78,1659.04,Amy,Get away from him.
1659.42,1661.76,Amy,He's mine.
1663.18,1665.69,Buffy,"Oh, I don't think so."
1665.73,1667.65,Buffy,"Xander, tell her."
1667.65,1669.46,Xander,What? I... uh...
1669.49,1673.23,Amy,He doesn't have to say.
1669.49,1673.23,Amy,I know what his heart wants.
1673.26,1676.25,Buffy,Funny. I know what your face wants.
1678.87,1681.48,Buffy,What is this? You're twotiming me?!
1681.82,1685.11,Amy,"Goddess Hecate, work thy will!"
1685.44,1689.53,Amy,Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
1690.46,1692.86,Xander,Buffy!
1694.23,1696.28,Xander,"Oh, my God!"
1706.34,1708.42,Giles,Whwhat just happened?
1708.42,1709.02,Xander,Buffy.
1709.05,1712.19,Giles,Where... where is she?
1716.2,1717.66,Giles,"Oh, my God!"
1717.66,1719.78,Amy,Why is she here?
1719.81,1723.18,Xander,Can you focus for a minute?
1719.81,1723.18,Xander,You just turned Buffy into a rat!
1724.27,1726.34,Amy,Buffy can take care of herself.
1726.37,1729.31,Amy,Why don't we go someplace private?
1729.31,1730.17,Xander,Can you...
1730.2,1732.7,Xander,I'm not going anywhere
1730.2,1732.7,Xander,until you change her back.
1732.74,1736.85,Jenny,You heard him. So why don't you
1732.74,1736.85,Jenny,undo your magic trick and get lost?
1736.89,1741.02,Amy,Who made you queen of the world?
1739.04,1740.85,Amy,"Well, you're old enough to be."
1740.89,1742.7,Jenny,"Well, what can I say?"
1742.7,1746.56,Amy,I guess Xander's just too much man
1742.7,1746.56,Amy,for the pimple squad.
1748.39,1751.02,Amy,"Goddess Hecate, to you I pray..."
1751.05,1752.06,Amy,with this...
1752.06,1753.82,Xander,Quit with the Hecate!
1756.44,1759.93,Cordelia,"OK, what now?"
1756.44,1759.93,Cordelia,You don't like my locker combination?
1759.97,1765.15,Harmony,It's just not right.
1759.97,1765.15,Harmony,You never loved him. You just used him.
1765.19,1766.94,Harmony,You make me sick.
1766.94,1768.17,Cordelia,"OK, Harmony,"
1768.21,1770.45,Cordelia,"if you need to borrow my Midol,"
1770.45,1771.1,Giles,just ask.
1778.13,1780.71,Giles,"You two, sit!"
1781.19,1783.24,Giles,Be quiet.
1783.28,1785.92,Giles,We have to catch the Buffyrat.
1785.96,1787.75,Xander,"Ooh, there!"
1794.9,1797.31,Xander,"Good, Buffy."
1798.04,1799.84,Xander,Just...
1807.45,1808.98,Oz,That kinda hurt.
1808.98,1811.36,Xander,Kinda? What was that for?
1811.39,1815.05,Oz,I was on the phone all night
1811.39,1815.05,Oz,listening to Willow cry about you.
1815.08,1817.46,Oz,"Now, I don't know exactly what happened,"
1817.46,1821.38,Oz,but I was left
1817.46,1821.38,Oz,with the strong urge to... hit you.
1825.03,1827.65,Xander,"I didn't touch her, I swear."
1827.65,1828.3,Giles,Xander!
1828.34,1830.13,Giles,Where's Buffy?
1830.17,1831.89,Xander,Amy turned her into a rat.
1838.21,1843.12,Giles,I don't see her.
1838.21,1843.12,Giles,"If anything happens to her, I'll..."
1843.16,1848.02,Giles,"Oh, just go home. Lock yourself away."
1848.02,1847.89,Giles,You're only going to
1848.02,1847.89,Giles,cause more problems here.
1847.93,1851.86,Giles,"Um, Amy, Jenny and I will try"
1847.93,1851.86,Giles,and break the spell.
1852.02,1856.96,Giles,"Oz, if you could aid us in finding, erm..."
1856.96,1857.67,Oz,Buffy?
1857.7,1859.93,Oz,Sure. Absolutely.
1859.96,1863.9,Giles,If...
1859.96,1863.9,Giles,Just go. Get out of my sight.
1877.75,1879.24,Oz,Buffy?
1879.59,1882.75,Cordelia,What are you doing?
1879.59,1882.75,Cordelia,You guys are crazy!
1882.78,1885.08,Harmony,"You thought you could do better,"
1882.78,1885.08,Harmony,is that it?
1885.87,1888.87,Cordette,We'll knock that snotty attitude
1885.87,1888.87,Cordette,right out of you!
1910.35,1913.27,Giles,You must have...
1910.35,1913.27,Giles,botched the ritual so that
1913.27,1916.37,Giles,Cordelia's necklace actually
1913.27,1916.37,Giles,protected her from the spell.
1916.4,1920.27,Giles,It should be easily reversible.
1916.4,1920.27,Giles,Where did you learn animal transformation?
1920.3,1923.45,Amy,Why did you send Xander away?
1920.3,1923.45,Amy,He needs me.
1923.53,1925.05,Jenny,That's a laugh.
1925.05,1926.26,Amy,He loves me.
1926.26,1928.4,Amy,We look into each other's souls.
1928.45,1930.39,Jenny,No one can love two people at once.
1930.43,1932.09,Jenny,"What we have, is real."
1932.09,1934.23,Giles,"Instead of making me ill,"
1932.09,1934.23,Giles,why doesn't one of you try to help me?
1934.27,1936.64,Amy,You have no idea what I'm going through.
1936.64,1937.88,Giles,I know it's not love!
1937.96,1941.46,Giles,"It's obsession  selfish, banal obsession."
1941.5,1943.45,Giles,Xander has put himself
1941.5,1943.45,Giles,in very grave danger.
1943.61,1945.38,Giles,"If you cared at all about him,"
1943.61,1945.38,Giles,you'd help save him
1945.38,1948.39,Giles,rather than wittering on
1945.38,1948.39,Giles,about your feelings.
1948.63,1952,Giles,"Now, let's get on with some work."
1948.63,1952,Giles,"Now, Jenny..."
1953.03,1954.67,Xander,Great.
1955.54,1957.39,Xander,I think we...
1957.42,1958.09,Xander,lost 'em.
1958.09,1959.51,Willow,I should have known
1959.55,1961.62,Willow,I'd find you with her.
1961.65,1964.18,Xander,"Will. Come on,"
1961.65,1964.18,Xander,you don't wanna hurt me.
1964.18,1965.85,Willow,"Oh, no?"
1968.02,1970.64,Willow,You don't know how hard this is for me.
1968.02,1970.64,Willow,I love you so much.
1971.23,1974.29,Willow,I'd rather see you dead
1971.23,1974.29,Willow,than with that bitch!
2019.36,2021.38,Xander,"OK, now I really think we've lost 'em."
2021.38,2023.08,Cordelia,"Dammit, Xander, what's going on?"
2023.32,2024.65,Cordelia,Who died and made you Elvis?
2024.65,2025.32,Xander,Buffy's house.
2025.32,2027.79,Xander,Let's get inside. I'll explain later.
2031.51,2032.53,Cordelia,Come on!
2032.53,2034.7,Joyce,Xander? Cordelia?
2034.74,2039.02,Cordelia,Yeah. Hi.
2037.56,2040.6,Joyce,What happened?
2037.56,2040.6,Joyce,Why are you all scratched up?
2040.63,2042.34,Joyce,Where's Buffy?
2042.34,2043.81,Xander,"She's, um..."
2043.84,2045.29,Xander,around.
2045.33,2047.4,Joyce,"Well, sit down and tell me about it."
2047.8,2051.78,Joyce,Why don't you run upstairs and grab
2047.8,2051.78,Joyce,some bandages out of the bathroom?
2052.85,2055.03,Joyce,"Let me, uh, get you something to drink."
2055.07,2058.37,Joyce,You in the mood for cold or hot?
2058.41,2059.6,Xander,II...
2059.73,2064.03,Joyce,I think it's more of
2059.73,2064.03,Joyce,"a hot night, don't you?"
2065.38,2066.82,Xander,Whatever.
2066.82,2070.35,Joyce,You are so tense. Mmm.
2071.03,2073.52,Cordelia,What are you doing? Make me yak!
2073.53,2075.95,Joyce,"Cordelia, go back upstairs."
2073.53,2075.95,Joyce,This is between us.
2075.98,2077.84,Cordelia,Gross. I think not. Let's go.
2077.84,2079.06,Joyce,What are you doing?
2079.41,2082.26,Joyce,"Hey, get your hands off me!"
2082.98,2086.47,Cordelia,And keep your momaged mitts
2082.98,2086.47,Cordelia,off my boyfriend.
2086.51,2088.04,Cordelia,Former!
2088.07,2090.21,Xander,Why has everyone gone insane?
2090.51,2093.73,Xander,Insane? Is it so impossible
2090.51,2093.73,Xander,for you to believe
2093.73,2095.72,Xander,that other women find me attractive?
2095.75,2099.05,Cordelia,The only way you could get girls
2095.75,2099.05,Cordelia,to want you would be witchcraft.
2099.09,2101.43,Xander,That is such a...
2101.46,2103.95,Xander,"Well, yeah, OK. Good point."
2104.78,2106.79,Cordelia,"Oh, my God!"
2106.83,2109.59,Joyce,"Xander, honey, let Joycie in."
2106.83,2109.59,Joyce,"Hon, let Joycie in."
2109.97,2111.91,Xander,Upstairs! Buffy's room!
2111.91,2112.84,Joyce,Sweetheart?
2119.68,2123.23,Xander,Good. The mob still hasn't found us.
2119.68,2123.23,Xander,We should be safer up here.
2124.07,2126.23,Angelus,Works in theory.
2126.38,2128.15,Cordelia,Xander!
2147.89,2148.77,Angelus,Where's Buffy?
2148.77,2150.15,Xander,"Cordy, get outta here!"
2156.14,2157.76,Angelus,Perfect.
2158.7,2160.73,Angelus,I wanted to do
2158.7,2160.73,Angelus,something special for Buffy.
2160.77,2164.41,Angelus,"Actually, to Buffy."
2160.77,2164.41,Angelus,But this is so much better.
2169.66,2173.28,Angelus,"If it's any consolation,"
2169.66,2173.28,Angelus,I feel very close to you right now.
2176.97,2178.23,Xander,"Buffy, how...?"
2178.23,2179.94,Drusilla,"Don't fret, kitten."
2182.49,2184.64,Drusilla,Mummy's here.
2184.68,2187.78,Angelus,"I don't know what you're up to,"
2184.68,2187.78,Angelus,"Dru, but it doesn't amuse!"
2189.81,2195.47,Drusilla,If you harm one hair
2189.81,2195.47,Drusilla,on this boy's head...
2195.51,2198.53,Angelus,You've gotta be kidding. Him?
2198.57,2203.21,Drusilla,Just because
2198.57,2203.21,Drusilla,I've finally found a real man...
2203.43,2207.68,Angelus,I guess I really did drive you crazy.
2207.68,2209.98,Drusilla,Your face is a poem.
2211.26,2214.3,Xander,I can read it.
2214.33,2218.73,Xander,Really? It doesn't say
2214.33,2218.73,Xander,Spare me" by any chance?
2223.66,2228.46,Drusilla,How do you feel about eternal life?
2228.53,2232.06,Xander,We couldn't just start with a coffee?
2232.09,2234.29,Xander,A movie maybe?
2235.85,2238.28,Girl,There he is! He's mine!
2238.28,2239.12,Jenny,Get off!
2249.15,2251.3,Willow,All you had to do was love me!
2251.64,2253.17,Cordelia,No!
2253.2,2256.51,Cordelia,Get out of the way! Get off him!
2257.92,2259.99,Cordelia,Back off!
2269.45,2271.88,Angelus,"Ah, sorry, Dru."
2272.77,2275.48,Angelus,Guess you're not invited.
2277.69,2281.33,Joyce,"It's never gonna work for us, Xander."
2277.69,2281.33,Joyce,We have to end it.
2288.96,2291.45,Oz,"Here, Buffy."
2305.41,2309.02,Giles,Right.
2307.64,2310.08,Giles,Go on. You first.
2310.67,2312.93,Xander,Xander!
2310.67,2312.93,Xander,Gimme a nail.
2314.49,2317.45,Cordelia,"If we die in here,"
2314.49,2317.45,Cordelia,I'm gonna kick your ass. I mean it.
2317.49,2320.15,Xander,None of this would've happened
2317.49,2320.15,Xander,if you hadn't broken up with me.
2320.15,2322.1,Xander,"But no, you're so desperate"
2320.15,2322.1,Xander,to be popular!
2322.14,2326.27,Cordelia,Me? I'm not the one who embraced the black
2322.14,2326.27,Cordelia,arts just to get the girls to like me.
2326.31,2328.63,Cordelia,"Well, congratulations. It worked."
2328.67,2333.35,Xander,"It would've worked fine, except your hide's"
2328.67,2333.35,Xander,so thick not even magic can penetrate it!
2336.6,2339.32,Cordelia,You mean the spell was for me?
2349.39,2351.58,Girl reaching in,"Xander, let me touch you!"
2354.54,2359.19,Amy,"Goddess of creatures great and small,"
2354.54,2359.19,Amy,I conjure thee to withdraw.
2365.1,2366.63,Amy,Hecate!
2366.67,2369.79,Amy,I hereby license thee to depart.
2377.14,2378.75,Oz,Buffy?
2385.45,2386.77,Cordelia,"Oh, my God!"
2386.77,2388.57,Xander,Stay behind me.
2388.75,2390.55,Xander,Xander!
2390.64,2395.02,Giles,"I need you. Come here, please!"
2395.03,2397.6,Giles,"Erm, Diana!"
2397.63,2400.02,Giles,"Goddess of love, be gone!"
2400.06,2402.47,Giles,Hear no more thy siren's song.
2406.95,2408.96,Cordelia,Get off!
2428.92,2431.33,Cordelia,Get off me!
2435.83,2438.37,Girl,What's going on? Where am I?
2439.59,2442.01,Girl,What's going on?
2451.8,2454.1,Buffy,"Hi, Oz!"
2454.1,2455.09,Oz,Hi.
2455.91,2459.4,Buffy,I seem to be having
2455.91,2459.4,Buffy,a slight case of nudity here.
2459.44,2461.69,Oz,But you're not a rat!
2461.73,2463.71,Oz,So call it an upside.
2463.74,2465.62,Buffy,"You think, maybe"
2463.74,2465.62,Buffy,you could get me some clothing?
2465.62,2469.39,Oz,"Yes, I can. Just, uh,"
2465.62,2469.39,Oz,don't go anywhere.
2469.72,2472.62,Buffy,Really not an issue.
2474.74,2477.79,Joyce,What... What did we...?
2477.88,2481.15,Cordelia,"Boy, that was the best scavenger hunt ever!"
2484.78,2486.05,Buffy,Scavenger hunt".
2486.05,2488.11,Xander,Your mom seemed to buy it.
2488.14,2490.14,Buffy,So she says.
2490.14,2493.47,Buffy,I think she's just so wigged at hitting on
2490.14,2493.47,Buffy,one of my friends that she's repressing.
2493.51,2497.21,Buffy,She's getting pretty good at that.
2493.51,2497.21,Buffy,I should probably start worrying.
2497.25,2500.08,Xander,"Well, I'm back to"
2497.25,2500.08,Xander,being incredibly unpopular.
2500.48,2503,Buffy,It's better than everyone
2500.48,2503,Buffy,"trying to axemurder you, right?"
2503,2507.98,Xander,"Mostly, but, uh..."
2503,2507.98,Xander,Willow won't even talk to me.
2510.02,2510.93,Buffy,Any particular reason she should?
2510.93,2512,Xander,How much groveling are we talking here?
2512.03,2514.15,Buffy,"Oh, a month, at least."
2514.28,2517.76,Buffy,"Xander, come on."
2514.28,2517.76,Buffy,"I mean, this is worse for her than anyone."
2518.05,2522.19,Buffy,She loved you before you invoked
2518.05,2522.19,Buffy,the great roofie spirit. The rest of us...
2522.22,2524.1,Xander,"You remember, huh?"
2524.1,2525.04,Buffy,"Oh, yeah."
2525.58,2530.66,Buffy,I remember coming on to you.
2525.58,2530.66,Buffy,I remember begging you to undress me.
2530.69,2533.21,Buffy,And then a sudden need for cheese.
2533.25,2535.55,Buffy,I also remember that you didn't.
2535.62,2537.25,Xander,Need cheese?
2537.25,2538.74,Buffy,Undress me.
2540.02,2542.27,Buffy,"It meant a lot to me, what you said."
2542.27,2545.04,Xander,"Come on, Buffy, I couldn't"
2542.27,2545.04,Xander,take advantage of you like that.
2545.07,2546.87,Xander,"OK, for a minute it was"
2545.07,2546.87,Xander,touch and go there.
2546.87,2548.91,Buffy,You came through.
2549.43,2551.6,Buffy,There might just be hope for you yet.
2551.6,2553.25,Xander,"Well, tell that to Cordelia."
2553.83,2556.39,Buffy,You're on your own there.
2558.43,2560.59,Harmony,Cody Weinberg called me
2558.43,2560.59,Harmony,at home last night.
2560.63,2563.66,Cordelia,Cody Weinberg? The one with the 35OSL?
2563.66,2564.77,Harmony,The very one. 
2564.8,2567.51,Harmony,Said he's thinking of asking me
2564.8,2567.51,Harmony,to the pledge dance on Thursday.
2567.55,2568.84,Cordelia,That's so huge!
2568.84,2569.27,Harmony,Yeah!
2569.31,2571.41,Harmony,There's just two other girls
2569.31,2571.41,Harmony,"he's gonna ask first,"
2571.41,2574.33,Harmony,"and if they refuse, then... Watch it!"
2574.78,2576.43,Xander,Sorry.
2576.47,2578.21,Harmony,"God! You know, I'm glad"
2578.22,2581.68,Harmony,your mom stopped working at the
2578.22,2581.68,Harmony,drivethrough long enough to dress you.
2581.71,2585.88,Harmony,"Oh, that reminds me."
2581.71,2585.88,Harmony,Did you see Jennifer's backpack?
2586.05,2588.98,Cordelia,It is so trying to...
