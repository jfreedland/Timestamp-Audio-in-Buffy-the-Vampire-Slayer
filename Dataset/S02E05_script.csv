3.64,9.42,,the demons and the forces of darkness.
9.46,11.55,,She is the Slayer.
16.44,18.81,,Is she dying?
18.95,21.22,,I think she's singing.
21.26,23.85,,"To a telephone, in Hindi."
23.89,26.03,,"Now, that's entertainment."
26.06,28.23,,Why is she singing?
28.27,31.15,,She's sad because
28.27,31.15,,her lover gave her 12 gold coins.
31.15,33.44,,But then the wizard
31.15,33.44,,cut open a bag of salt...
33.47,36.8,,and now the dancing minions have
33.47,36.8,,nowhere to put their big maypole...
36.83,40.69,,fish thing.
36.83,40.69,,Uhhuh.
40.84,42.66,,Why is she singing?
42.69,44.6,,Her lover?
42.69,44.6,,I thought that was her chiropractor?
44.63,49.22,,Because of that thing he did with her feet?
44.63,49.22,,"No, that was personal."
49.6,52.45,,And we thought just because we didn't have
49.6,52.45,,"any money or any place to go,"
52.45,54.65,,this'd be a lackluster evening.
54.68,59.23,,"I know! We could go to the Bronze, sneak"
54.68,59.23,,in our own tea bags and ask for hot water.

70.97,73.83,,So how does
70.97,73.83,,the water buffalo fit in again?
151.68,153.46,,Callie! Callie.
153.49,155.86,,Where are you going?
155.89,159.28,,The party's just gettin' started.
220.5,224.2,,b>"Reptile Boy"</b>
226.19,229.15,,See? Dr Debbi says
226.19,229.15,,"when a man is speaking,"
229.15,232.7,,you make serious eye contact
229.15,232.7,,"and really, really listen."
232.73,235.79,,And you laugh at everything he says.
239.96,242.21,Willow,You dreamed about Angel again?
242.21,243.79,Buffy,Third night in a row.
243.82,246.38,Willow,What did he do in the dream?
246.41,248.82,Buffy,Stuff.
246.41,248.82,Buffy,"Oh, stuff."
248.85,250.84,Willow,Was it one of those vivid dreams
250.88,253.66,Willow,where you could feel his lips
250.88,253.66,Willow,and smell his hair?
253.69,256.22,Buffy,It had surround sound!
256.26,258.84,Buffy,I'm just thinking about him
256.26,258.84,Buffy,so much lately.
258.84,261.23,Willow,You two are so right for each other.
261.26,263.12,Willow,"Except for the, uh..."
263.12,264.36,Buffy,Vampire thing.
264.39,268.19,Willow,That doesn't make him
264.39,268.19,Willow,a bad person... necessarily.
268.23,271.81,Buffy,I'm brainsick.
268.23,271.81,Buffy,I can't have a relationship with him!
271.87,276.22,Willow,"Not during the day, but... you could"
271.87,276.22,Willow,ask him for coffee some night.
276.24,278.8,Willow,It's the nonrelationship drink of choice.
278.8,282.2,Willow,It's not a date.
278.8,282.2,Willow,It's a caffeinated beverage.
282.23,286.03,Willow,"OK, sure, it's hot and bitter,"
282.23,286.03,Willow,"like a relationship that way, but..."
286.06,287.9,Xander,What's like a relationship?
287.9,288.92,Buffy,Nothing I have.
288.95,289.75,Buffy,Coffee?
289.75,290.21,Xander,Huh?
290.24,293.7,Cordelia,There's really no comparison between
290.24,293.7,Cordelia,college men and highschool boys.
293.76,295.16,Cordelia,"I mean, look at that."
295.16,297.82,Xander,"So, Cor, you're datin' college guys now?"
297.85,300.8,Cordelia,"Well, not that it's any of your business,"
297.85,300.8,Cordelia,but I happen to be dating
300.8,302.52,Cordelia,a Delta Zeta Kappa.
302.56,304.92,Xander,"Oh, an extraterrestrial!"
304.93,307.71,Xander,So that's how you get a date
304.93,307.71,Xander,after you exhausted all the human guys.
307.75,309.87,Cordelia,"You'll go to college someday, Xander."
310.03,315.2,Cordelia,I just know your pizzadelivery career
310.03,315.2,Cordelia,will take you so many exciting places.
321.29,324.46,Buffy,Oh! I told Giles I'd meet him
321.29,324.46,Buffy,in the library ten minutes ago.
325.04,328.66,Buffy,"Aw, he won't be upset. There hasn't been"
325.04,328.66,Buffy,much paranormal activity lately.
328.69,332.73,Giles,Just because the paranormal is more
328.69,332.73,Giles,normal" and less... "para" of late...
332.77,335.66,Giles,is no excuse for tardiness
332.77,335.66,Giles,or letting your guard down.
335.68,337.5,Buffy,I haven't let my guard down.
337.5,338.21,Giles,"Oh, really?"
338.25,340.54,Giles,You yawned your way through
338.25,340.54,Giles,"weapons training last week, you, you, you,"
340.54,342.73,Giles,you skipped handtohand entirely...
342.77,346.06,Giles,Are you going to be prepared if a demon
342.77,346.06,Giles,springs up behind you and does this?
348.82,351.25,Giles,"Well, I'm, I'm not a demon."
351.32,353.83,Giles,Which is why you should let go now.
353.87,355.66,Giles,Thank you.
356.95,360.93,Giles,When you live on top of
356.95,360.93,Giles,"a... a mystical convergence,"
361.33,365.03,Giles,it's only a matter of time
361.33,365.03,Giles,before a fresh hell breaks loose.
365.08,367.21,Giles,Now is the time that
365.08,367.21,Giles,you should train more strictly.
367.24,369.36,Giles,You should...
367.24,369.36,Giles,hunt and patrol more keenly.
369.4,372,Giles,You should hone your skills
369.4,372,Giles,day and night.
372.03,374.32,Buffy,And the little slice of life
372.03,374.32,Buffy,that still belongs to me
374.32,376.97,Giles,"from, I don't know,"
374.32,376.97,Giles,"to 7.05 in the morning,"
379.02,378.97,Giles,Can I do what I want then?
379.02,378.97,Giles,"Buffy, you think I don't know"
381.02,381.84,Giles,what it's like to be 16?
381.84,382.72,Buffy,No. I think you don't know
382.72,384.52,Giles,"what it's like to be 16,"
384.52,386.55,Buffy,"and a girl, and the Slayer."
386.59,388.13,Giles,"Fair enough. No, I don't."
388.17,390.07,Buffy,Or what it's like
388.17,390.07,Buffy,to have to stake vampires
390.08,393.86,Buffy,while you're having
390.08,393.86,Buffy,fuzzy feelings towards one.
393.9,397.44,Buffy,Taking on the undead doesn't
393.9,397.44,Buffy,exactly do wonders for your social life.
397.48,401.36,Giles,That's exactly where
397.48,401.36,Giles,being different comes in handy.
401.37,403.83,Buffy,Right. Who needs a social life
401.37,403.83,Buffy,when you've got your very own Hellmouth?
403.87,405.82,Buffy,"Yes! You, you, you have"
405.82,407.6,Giles,"a duty, a, a purpose."
407.64,410.74,Giles,"You have a commitment in life. Now,"
407.64,410.74,Giles,how many people your age can say that?
410.74,413.13,Buffy,We talkin' foreign or domestic?
413.34,415.2,Buffy,How about none?
415.24,418.8,Giles,"Well, here's a hard fact of life:"
415.24,418.8,Giles,we all have to do things we don't like.
418.83,420.79,Giles,And you have handtohand this afternoon
418.83,420.79,Giles,and patrol tonight.
420.83,423.72,Giles,"So I, I suggest you come straight here"
420.83,423.72,Giles,"at the end of, of period six"
423.76,427.22,Giles,"and, and get your homework done,"
423.76,427.22,Giles,and don't dawdle with your friends.
427.26,431.82,Giles,And don't think sitting there pouting
427.26,431.82,Giles,"is gonna get to me, because it won't."
433.9,435.88,Giles,It's not getting to me.
437.11,439.62,Xander,"Boy, what a long day."
439.65,441.5,Willow,And you skipped three classes.
441.5,443.66,Xander,"Yeah. And, of course, they flew by."
443.7,445.62,Xander,Buffy.
445.87,449.25,Willow,Aren't you supposed to be doing
445.87,449.25,Willow,your homework in the library?
449.29,452.14,Buffy,I'm dawdling... with my friends.
452.18,454.58,Xander,Works for me.
458.39,459.57,Buffy,You OK?
459.57,460.42,Willow,Jeez.
464.64,465.45,Richard,Cordelia.
465.45,466.52,Cordelia,"Hi, Richard."
466.55,468.87,Cordelia,Nice car.
472.15,475.71,Richard,"So, uh, we're having a little gettogether"
472.15,475.71,Richard,tomorrow night at the house.
475.75,478.43,Richard,And... it's gonna be
475.75,478.43,Richard,a really special evening.
480.91,481.9,Richard,Excuse me?
481.9,485.45,Cordelia,"Oh. I would... I'd love, love to go."
485.49,487.45,Richard,"So, who's your friend?"
487.79,490.74,Cordelia,"Her? Oh, she's not my friend."
490.74,492.16,Tom,She's amazing.
492.2,495.64,Cordelia,"She's more like a sister, really!"
492.2,495.64,Cordelia,We're that close.
495.67,497.75,Richard,Why don't you introduce us?
499.05,500.93,Cordelia,OK.
501.29,504.26,Xander,"OK, so tonight, channel 59: Indian TV."
504.29,507.71,Xander,"Sex, lies, incomprehensible story lines."
504.29,507.71,Xander,I'll bring the betel nuts.
507.74,510.27,Cordelia,Come on. Richard and his
507.74,510.27,Cordelia,fraternity brother wanna meet you.
510.31,512.68,Buffy,"Well, I don't really wanna meet"
510.31,512.68,Buffy,any fraternity boys.
512.81,515.96,Cordelia,"If there was a God,"
512.81,515.96,Cordelia,don't you think he'd keep it that way?
515.99,518.26,Xander,"Uh, II believe we were dawdling here!"
520.95,523.87,Richard,"Hi, sweetheart. I'm Richard. And you are?"
523.87,525.15,Buffy,So not interested.
525.18,527.27,Cordelia,Oh! She's such a little comedienne.
527.27,529.42,Richard,What? She likes to play hard to get?
529.46,533.34,Tom,"No, Richard. I think"
529.46,533.34,Tom,you're playing easy to resist.
534.09,537.25,Tom,Feel free to ignore him. I do all the time.
537.84,542.64,Tom,I'm Tom Warner. I'm a senior
537.84,542.64,Tom,"at Crestwood College, and I..."
543.47,547.46,Tom,And I just feel like a complete dolt
543.47,547.46,Tom,"meeting you this way, so..."
547.85,550.02,Tom,here I stand in all my doltishness.
550.35,553.49,Xander,Right! Like she's gonna fall for that.
553.52,554.85,Buffy,I'm... Buffy Summers.
554.85,556.18,Tom,"Oh, nice to meet you."
556.22,557.94,Tom,Are you a senior here?
557.94,558.49,Buffy,Junior.
558.52,563.5,Tom,"Oh, me too. Except that"
558.52,563.5,Tom,I'm a senior and I'm in college.
563.54,567.9,Tom,So we have that in common.
563.54,567.9,Tom,And... I major in history.
567.94,570.2,Buffy,"Mm, history stumps me."
570.2,572.45,Buffy,I have a hard enough time remembering
570.2,572.45,Buffy,what happened last week.
572.48,575.75,Tom,"No, nothin' happened last week "
572.48,575.75,Tom,don't worry. I was there.
578.02,578.75,Xander,She's gonna walk away.
579.13,583.02,Xander,Now.
581.04,583.26,Tom,"So, uh..."
584.14,589.27,Tom,My friend invited your friend
584.14,589.27,Tom,to a party we're having this weekend.
589.31,591.7,Tom,"You know, actually"
589.31,591.7,Tom,he's not even really my friend.
591.73,596.06,Tom,I only joined the fraternity because
591.73,596.06,Tom,my father and grandpa were in it before me.
596.09,597.98,Tom,You know. It meant a lot to them.
598.53,601.06,Xander,"OK, boots, start awalkin'."
601.1,604,Tom,"Oh, I know, I talk too much anyway."
601.1,604,Tom,They're really dull parties
606.02,606.84,Tom,"full of really dull people, so..."
606.88,609.79,Tom,Would you like to come
606.88,609.79,Tom,and save me from a really dull fate?
609.82,612.62,Buffy,"Oh, I wish I could, but..."
612.65,614.21,Buffy,I'm sort of involved.
614.21,616.28,Tom,"Oh, sure, of course you are."
616.67,620.27,Tom,"Well, thanks for letting me ramble."
620.42,624.02,Buffy,"You know, people underestimate"
620.42,624.02,Buffy,the value of a good ramble.
624.18,626.66,Giles,Buffy!
629.81,632.48,Buffy,"Oh, I gotta go."
634.81,637.22,Buffy,It was nice to meet you.
637.22,638.62,Tom,Oh. Same here.
648.58,653.16,Xander,I hate these guys. Whatever
648.58,653.16,Xander,they want just falls into their laps.
653.19,654.82,Xander,Don't you hate these guys?
654.82,656.69,Willow,Yeah. With their charmed lives
656.72,661.19,Willow,and their moviestar good looks
656.72,661.19,Willow,and more money than you can count...
661.22,662.8,Willow,I'm hating.
666.45,668.42,Giles,I'm going to attack you.
668.43,673.07,Giles,Word of warning for your own good:
668.43,673.07,Giles,I won't be pulling any punches.
673.1,674.31,Buffy,Please don't.
683.44,686.39,Giles,"Good. So, um, you're on patrol."
686.42,689.09,Giles,"And, uh, I'll see you in the morning."
719.53,721.61,Angel,There's blood on it.
721.71,723.92,Buffy,Hi.
723.96,726.52,Buffy,It's nice to... Blood?
726.61,729.36,Angel,I can smell it.
732.24,737.02,Buffy,It's pretty thin.
732.24,737.02,Buffy,Probably belonged to a girl.
737.02,737.8,Angel,Probably.
739.75,743.14,Buffy,"II was... just... thinking,"
739.75,743.14,Buffy,wouldn't it be...
743.17,747.69,Buffy,funny some time to see each other
743.17,747.69,Buffy,when it wasn't a blood thing?
748.61,750.91,Angel,Not funny haha.
750.95,753.28,Angel,"What are you sayin',"
750.95,753.28,Angel,you wanna have a date?
753.32,753.53,Buffy,No.
753.53,755.51,Angel,You don't wanna have a date?
755.51,758.2,Buffy,Who said date? III never said date.
758.23,760.84,Angel,Right. You just wanna have
758.23,760.84,Angel,coffee or something.
760.87,761.37,Buffy,Coffee?
761.37,763.44,Angel,I knew this was gonna happen.
763.48,766.13,Buffy,What? What do you think is happening?
766.16,768.64,Angel,You're 16 years old. I'm 241.
768.64,770.27,Buffy,I've done the math.
770.31,772.61,Angel,"You don't know what you're doing,"
770.31,772.61,Angel,you don't know what you want...
772.65,776.95,Buffy,"Oh. No, I, I think I do."
772.65,776.95,Buffy,I want out of this conversation.
776.98,782.72,Angel,"Listen. If we date, you and I both know"
776.98,782.72,Angel,one thing's gonna lead to another.
782.75,785.51,Buffy,One thing already has led to another.
785.51,788.35,Buffy,You think it's a little late
785.51,788.35,Buffy,to be reading me a warning label?
788.38,791.78,Angel,I'm just trying to protect you.
788.38,791.78,Angel,This could get out of control.
791.81,794.64,Buffy,Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
797.21,800.15,Angel,This isn't some fairy tale.
800.19,803.7,Angel,"When I kiss you,"
800.19,803.7,Angel,you don't wake up from a deep sleep
803.74,806.97,Angel,and live happily ever after.
806.97,807.32,Buffy,No.
807.42,811.84,Buffy,"When you kiss me, I wanna die."
827.21,830.14,Cordelia,Buffy! Did you lose weight?
830.18,832.35,Cordelia,And your hair...
832.35,834.7,Cordelia,"All right, I respect you too much"
832.35,834.7,Cordelia,to be dishonest.
834.7,836.6,Cordelia,The hair's a little...
836.63,839.22,Cordelia,"Well, that really"
836.63,839.22,Cordelia,"isn't the point here, is it?"
839.25,842.63,Cordelia,The Zeta Kappas have to have
839.25,842.63,Cordelia,a certain balance at their party.
842.66,846.23,Cordelia,"And Richard explained it all to me,"
842.66,846.23,Cordelia,but I was so busy "really listening"
846.23,848.36,Cordelia,that I didn't hear much.
848.48,853.72,Cordelia,"Anyway, the deal is they need you to go."
848.48,853.72,Cordelia,"And if you don't go, I can't."
853.76,856.28,Cordelia,And I'm talking about
853.76,856.28,Cordelia,"Richard Anderson, OK?"
856.28,860.47,Cordelia,"as in Anderson Farms,"

860.51,863.14,Cordelia,and Anderson Cosmetics.
863.5,868.13,Cordelia,"Well, you see why I have to go?"
868.16,871.4,Cordelia,"Buffy, these men are rich,"
868.16,871.4,Cordelia,and I am not being shallow.
871.63,874.36,Cordelia,Think of the poor people
871.63,874.36,Cordelia,I could help with all my money.
874.39,875.37,Buffy,I'll go.
875.37,876.59,Cordelia,You'll go?
876.64,880.02,Cordelia,Great! I'll drive.
876.64,880.02,Cordelia,"Oh, Buffy, it's like we're sisters!"
880.05,883.71,Richard,With really different hair.
884.14,889.02,Richard,I pledge my life and my death.
884.14,889.02,Richard,I pledge my life and my death.
889.15,892.8,Richard,To the Delta Zeta Kappas
889.15,892.8,Richard,and to Machida whom we serve.
892.84,895.74,Richard,To the Delta Zeta Kappas
892.84,895.74,Richard,and to Machida whom we serve.
896.03,900.82,Richard,"On my oath, before my assembled brethren."
900.85,903.81,Richard,"On my oath, before my assembled brethren."
903.85,908.03,Richard,I promise to keep our secret
903.85,908.03,Richard,from this day until my death.
908.06,912.4,Richard,I promise to keep our secret
908.06,912.4,Richard,from this day until my death.
913.55,918.45,Richard,"In blood I was baptized,"
913.55,918.45,Richard,"in blood I shall reign, in his name."
918.49,920.26,Richard,"In blood I was baptized,"
920.26,922.26,Pledge,"and in blood I shall reign,"
922.29,924.18,Richard,in his name.
924.22,926.33,Richard,You're now one of us.
926.36,928.27,Pledge,In his name!
926.36,928.27,Pledge,In his name!
929.81,932.27,Richard,Brewski time!
929.81,932.27,Richard,Party!
939.82,942.86,Richard,"So, what's a girl like you"
939.82,942.86,Richard,doing in a place like this?
942.95,946.34,Callie,"Please, let me go."
942.95,946.34,Callie,Let you go?
946.38,948.77,Richard,"OK, let me think. Mm, no!"
951.71,954.58,Richard,"God, I love highschool girls."
965.48,970.48,Willow,You're going to the fraternity party?
965.48,970.48,Willow,What made you change your mind?
970.52,971.18,Buffy,Angel.
971.18,973.4,Willow,He's going with you?
973.43,975.9,Willow,She's got a date with Angel!
973.43,975.9,Willow,Isn't that exciting?
975.9,976.62,Xander,I'm elated.
976.62,978.47,Buffy,"I, I'm not going with Angel."
978.51,980.49,Buffy,I'm going with...
980.53,984.23,Willow,Ye gods! Cordelia.
980.53,984.23,Willow,Cordelia?!
984.24,986.47,Willow,Did I sound a little jealous just then?
986.47,988.36,Xander,Cause I'm not really... Cordelia?
988.4,991.06,Xander,Cordelia's much better for you than Angel.
991.1,993.26,Willow,What happened with Angel?
993.26,994.82,Buffy,Nothing. As usual.
994.88,996.87,Buffy,A whole lot of nothing with Angel.
996.87,997.28,Xander,Bummer.
997.32,1001.76,Willow,I don't understand.
997.32,1001.76,Willow,"I mean, he likes you. More than likes."
1001.8,1004.32,Buffy,Angel barely says two words to me.
1004.32,1005.8,Xander,Don't you hate that?
1006.14,1008.42,Buffy,"When he does,"
1006.14,1008.42,Buffy,he treats me like I'm a child.
1008.42,1009.99,Xander,That bastard!
1010.03,1012.83,Buffy,"You know, at least"
1010.03,1012.83,Buffy,Tom can carry on a conversation.
1012.86,1015.67,Xander,Yeah! Tom? Who's Tom?
1015.67,1017.41,Willow,The frat guy.
1017.44,1021.14,Xander,"Oh, Buffy, I don't think so."
1017.44,1021.14,Xander,"Frying pan, fire?"
1021.37,1023.22,Giles,You know what I'm sayin'?
1036.92,1039.96,Giles,Will you be ready
1036.92,1039.96,Giles,if a vampire's behind you?
1043.8,1047.37,Giles,Didn't see you three... creeping about.
1049.43,1052.12,Giles,"Um, how did it go last night?"
1053.19,1055.84,Buffy,I found this.
1059.44,1060.98,Giles,ENT
1060.98,1063.29,Willow,I've seen something like that before.
1063.29,1064.48,Buffy,It's broken in two.
1064.48,1066.94,Buffy,I don't know what the rest of the letters
1064.48,1066.94,Buffy,might have spelled.
1066.95,1068.88,Buffy,And there's blood on it.
1068.88,1070.57,Giles,Oh. I didn't see any.
1070.71,1074.12,Buffy,Angel showed up. He could smell it.
1074.12,1075.09,Xander,The blood?
1075.71,1078.12,Xander,There's a guy you wanna party with.
1078.21,1078.89,Giles,Blood.
1078.89,1082.31,Willow,In Sunnydale. What a surprise.
1082.59,1086.45,Xander,"OK, here's what we're gonna do. She should"
1082.59,1086.45,Xander,probably make the rounds again tonight.
1086.48,1088.41,Xander,And we should try to figure out
1086.48,1088.41,Xander,who that bracelet belongs to.
1088.41,1091.55,Giles,"Yes, good idea, yes."
1088.41,1091.55,Giles,"She'll patrol, and, and we'll reconvene..."
1091.59,1097.02,Buffy,"Uh, hello? ""She"" is standing right here!"
1095.04,1096.67,Buffy,And she's not available.
1096.67,1097.21,Giles,Why not?
1097.24,1099.06,Xander,"Buffy, this is a little more important..."
1099.06,1100.74,Buffy,"I've got a mountain of homework to do,"
1100.77,1106.16,Buffy,"And, um... my mom's not really feeling well"
1100.77,1106.16,Buffy,and she could probably use my help.
1106.19,1109.62,Buffy,"And, um, to be truthful,"
1106.19,1109.62,Buffy,I'm not feeling all that well myself.
1109.65,1112.2,Giles,"Oh, wwell, um, sorry, of course."
1109.65,1112.2,Giles,Ififif you're not well.
1112.23,1114.72,Buffy,"Oh, I'll take an early pass"
1112.23,1114.72,Buffy,"this evening, and, um..."
1114.72,1116.83,Buffy,"one later on, but"
1114.72,1116.83,Buffy,for the bulk of the evening...
1116.87,1119.53,Giles,You should stay home with your mother.
1124.31,1125.18,Buffy,"Well, say it."
1125.18,1126.59,Xander,I'm not gonna say it.
1126.62,1127.79,Willow,You lied to Giles.
1127.79,1128.76,Xander,Cause she will.
1128.8,1132.34,Buffy,"Look, I wasn't lying."
1128.8,1132.34,Buffy,I was just protecting him
1132.38,1134.96,Buffy,from information that
1132.38,1134.96,Buffy,he wouldn't be able to...
1134.99,1136.16,Buffy,digest properly.
1136.16,1137.32,Xander,Like a corn dog.
1137.36,1141.08,Willow,"Like you don't have a sick mother,"
1137.36,1141.08,Willow,but you'd rather go to a frat party...
1141.11,1145.21,Willow,where there's gonna be drinking
1141.11,1145.21,Willow,and older guys and probably an orgy.
1145.25,1148.47,Xander,"Whoa! Whoa, rewind. Since when"
1145.25,1148.47,Xander,"do they have orgies, and why aren't I"
1148.5,1149.47,Xander,on the mailing list?
1149.47,1150.34,Buffy,There's no orgies!
1150.34,1153.91,Willow,I heard a lot of wild things go on
1150.34,1153.91,Willow,at frat parties.
1153.95,1157.04,Buffy,"OK, you know what? Look, seven days a week"
1153.95,1157.04,Buffy,I am busy saving the world.
1157.08,1159.58,Buffy,Once in a great while
1157.08,1159.58,Buffy,I wanna have some fun.
1159.62,1162.15,Buffy,And that's what I'm gonna have. Fun!
1162.18,1164.75,Cordelia,This isn't about fun. This is about duty.
1164.78,1168.34,Cordelia,Your duty to help me achieve
1164.78,1168.34,Cordelia,"permanent prosperity, OK?"
1168.38,1172.02,Cordelia,Dos and don'ts:
1172.02,1173.93,Cordelia,"don't wear black, silk, chiffon or spandex."
1172.02,1173.93,Cordelia,These are my trademarks.
1173.97,1178.02,Cordelia,And don't do
1173.97,1178.02,Cordelia,that weird thing with your hair.
1176.05,1177.28,Buffy,What weird thing with my...
1177.28,1178.01,Cordelia,Don't interrupt.
1178.05,1182.07,Cordelia,Do be interested if someone should
1178.05,1182.07,Cordelia,speak to you. It may or may not happen.
1182.11,1185.61,Cordelia,But do be polite
1182.11,1185.61,Cordelia,and laugh at the appropriate intervals.
1187.7,1189.7,Cordelia,Do lie to your mom about
1187.7,1189.7,Cordelia,where we're going.
1189.7,1191.79,Cordelia,It's a fraternity
1189.7,1191.79,Cordelia,and there will be drinking.
1191.83,1194.27,Xander,"So, Cor, you printing up business cards"
1191.83,1194.27,Xander,with your pager number
1194.3,1196.49,Xander,"and hours of operation,"
1194.3,1196.49,Xander,or just going with a halter top tonight?
1196.53,1199.4,Cordelia,"Oh, are we feeling a little envious?"
1199.44,1205.25,Cordelia,You could belong to a fraternity of rich
1199.44,1205.25,Cordelia,and powerful men... in the Bizarro World.
1205.29,1207.48,Buffy,Do you guys wanna join us?
1207.48,1209.84,Xander,Nah. I gotta digest and all.
1209.88,1212.16,Cordelia,"Makeup, makeup. Well..."
1212.16,1214.75,Cordelia,Give it your all
1212.16,1214.75,Cordelia,and keep to the shadows.
1214.78,1219.02,Cordelia,We're gonna have a blast!
1218.98,1223.27,Willow,I can't believe she lied to Giles.
1218.98,1223.27,Willow,My world is all askew.
1223.36,1226.74,Xander,Buffy's lying?
1223.36,1226.74,Xander,Buffy's going to frat parties?
1226.78,1228.99,Xander,"That's not askew, that's cockeyed."
1229.02,1231.64,Willow,Askew means cockeyed.
1231.68,1233.37,Xander,Oh.
1233.7,1237.55,Willow,"Well, there's nothing we can do about it."
1233.7,1237.55,Willow,We'll help Giles.
1237.59,1239.34,Xander,I'm goin' to the party.
1239.34,1239.72,Willow,What?
1239.76,1243.26,Xander,I've got to keep an eye on Buffy.
1239.76,1243.26,Xander,Those frat guys creep me.
1243.38,1244.74,Willow,You wanna protect her?
1244.74,1245.05,Xander,Mmhm.
1245.26,1248.49,Willow,And prove that you're just as good
1245.26,1248.49,Willow,"as those rich, snotty guys?"
1248.51,1248.82,Xander,Mmhm.
1248.82,1250.3,Willow,And maybe catch an orgy?
1250.3,1252.23,Xander,If it's on early.
1260.48,1264.65,Cordelia,Why do they park
1260.48,1264.65,Cordelia,so darn close to you?
1264.68,1266.71,Cordelia,Are you ready for this?
1266.71,1267.86,Buffy,I don't know.
1267.9,1270.59,Buffy,Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
1270.59,1271.98,Cordelia,"Me, too. Let's go."
1275.39,1277.04,Cordelia,Come on!
1279.25,1281.05,Tackle,Beaucoup babes!
1281.05,1282.25,Linebacker,"Ooh, yeah!"
1290.51,1293.9,Cordelia,You know what's so cool
1290.51,1293.9,Cordelia,about college? The diversity.
1293.94,1297.83,Cordelia,You've got all the rich people
1293.94,1297.83,Cordelia,and all of the other people.
1297.87,1300.39,Richard,Richard!
1297.87,1300.39,Richard,"Welcome, ladies."
1300.52,1301.98,Cordelia,Thank you.
1302.4,1304.57,Buffy,Oh. Is there alcohol in this?
1304.57,1305.62,Richard,Just a smidge.
1305.66,1308.22,Cordelia,"Come on, Buffy. It's just a smidge."
1308.65,1309.85,Buffy,I'll just...
1309.85,1311.15,Richard,I understand.
1311.19,1313.88,Richard,When I was your age
1311.19,1313.88,Richard,I wasn't into grown up things either.
1313.92,1315.95,Richard,Have you seen our multimedia room?
1315.96,1317.72,Cordelia,"Oh, the one with the cherry walnut paneling"
1317.72,1320.54,Cordelia,and the two fortyeightinch televisions
1317.72,1320.54,Cordelia,on satellite feed?
1320.57,1321.77,Cordelia,No. Wanna show me?
1321.77,1322.71,Richard,What about...?

1451.92,1453.8,Buffy,No. It's...
1453.9,1456.37,Buffy,I shouldn't be here.
1456.4,1458.59,Tom,Because you're seeing someone.
1458.8,1460.1,Buffy,No.
1460.68,1463.26,Tom,You're not seeing someone?
1463.3,1468.02,Buffy,Someone's not seeing me.
1466.04,1468.83,Tom,So... why shouldn't you be here?
1469.64,1473.98,Buffy,Because I have obligations.
1469.64,1473.98,Buffy,People that...
1476.02,1478.73,Buffy,I'm responsible for...
1476.02,1478.73,Buffy,or to... or with...
1478.77,1481.23,Buffy,It's complicated.
1481.32,1484.96,Tom,You're big on responsibility. I like that.
1485,1487.58,Tom,But there's such a thing
1485,1487.58,Tom,as being too mature.
1487.62,1492.13,Tom,You should relax...
1487.62,1492.13,Tom,and enjoy yourself once in a while.
1493.21,1495.71,Buffy,You think I'm too mature?
1495.75,1498.88,Tom,I talk too much.
1495.75,1498.88,Tom,Have you picked up on that yet?

1582.15,1586.94,Richard,that just matured into double digits.

1608.54,1610.12,Willow,Rent.
1610.41,1613.13,Giles,"Uh, Lent. Dent."
1613.54,1616.85,Willow,Went. Kent.
1616.89,1618.17,Willow,Kent! That's it!
1618.17,1620.57,Giles,Her boyfriend's name was Kent?
1620.6,1623.55,Willow,No. Kent Preparatory School.
1620.6,1623.55,Willow,Just outside of town.
1623.59,1625.93,Willow,That's where I've seen these bracelets.
1626.05,1626.92,Giles,What are you doing?
1626.92,1628.61,Willow,Pulling up their school newsletter...
1628.64,1632.94,Willow,for the past few months
1628.64,1632.94,Willow,to see if there's anything about...
1632.97,1635.17,Giles,A missing girl.
1648.58,1652.45,Tackle,"Come on, dance, pretty boy! Keep it movin'."
1652.95,1657.33,Tackle,Come on. Shake it! Don't break it!
1652.95,1657.33,Tackle,Wrap it up and I'll take it!
1657.37,1660.46,Xander,"OK, big fun, guys. Who's next?"
1660.5,1663.72,Tackle,"You are, dollface."
1660.5,1663.72,Tackle,Keep on dancing! All right!
1664.84,1669.57,Tackle,"Keep it up, yeah! Come on, keep it goin'!"
1680.48,1682.42,Buffy,Tom?
1710.79,1713.62,Buffy,"Ooh, sorry."
1718.2,1720.06,Buffy,OK.
1720.9,1722.36,Buffy,Nice bed.
1722.77,1725.44,Buffy,Just need to stop spinning for...
1752.18,1754.18,Tom,Get away from her!
1754.68,1755.77,Richard,I wasn't doing anything.
1755.77,1756.95,Tom,I saw what you were doing.
1756.98,1758.67,Richard,I was just having a little fun.
1758.67,1760.9,Tom,"She's not here for your fun, you pervert."
1761.56,1764.98,Tom,She's here for the pleasure
1761.56,1764.98,Tom,of the one we serve.
1765.94,1770.02,Richard,In his name.
1768.04,1771.17,Tom,"And that goes for the other one, too."
1782.21,1784.17,Giles,Callie Megan Anderson.
1784.71,1786.59,Giles,Missing for over a week.
1786.62,1790.82,Giles,No one's seen her.
1786.62,1790.82,Giles,No one knows what happened to her.
1790.97,1795.26,Willow,"This being Sunnydale and all,"
1790.97,1795.26,Willow,I guess we can rule out something good.
1795.97,1798.37,Giles,I'm calling Buffy.
1798.37,1798.77,Willow,No!
1798.8,1799.58,Giles,Why not?
1799.58,1802.88,Willow,Because Buffy... and her mother...
1802.92,1805.38,Giles,Are sick. You're quite right.
1802.92,1805.38,Giles,There's no point in disturbing them
1805.41,1807.74,Giles,until we know more.
1809.15,1812.57,Willow,You mean like...
1809.15,1812.57,Willow,if there are others?
1812.6,1815.7,Willow,"Brittany Oswald, junior at St Michael's,"
1815.7,1817.49,Giles,disappeared a year ago.
1817.53,1820.93,Giles,"So did Kelley Percell, sophomore at Grant."
1820.97,1821.68,Giles,A year?
1821.68,1823.5,Willow,Almost to the day.
1823.54,1827.25,Giles,An anniversary or perhaps some other event
1823.54,1827.25,Giles,significant to the killer.
1827.29,1832.02,Willow,Killer? Now there's a killer?
1827.29,1832.02,Willow,We don't know that there's a...
1832.02,1832.88,Giles,"No, but this being Sunnydale and all..."
1832.92,1834.92,Willow,Gulp.
1834.95,1837.82,Giles,We need to know
1834.95,1837.82,Giles,where Buffy found that bracelet.
1837.89,1839.61,Giles,We can begin our search there.
1839.64,1844.05,Willow,Good idea! Call Angel.
1839.64,1844.05,Willow,He was there when Buffy found it.
1844.05,1847.95,Willow,We're gonna need
1844.05,1847.95,Willow,all the help we can get.
1855.21,1856.64,Linebacker,"Party's over, jerkwater."
1856.64,1858.54,Xander,Wait. A friend of mine was here.
1858.57,1860.83,Tackle,"You know, in that light..."
1861.04,1863.55,Tackle,with that wig on an' all...
1863.58,1866.29,Tackle,you're still butt ugly!
1896.07,1899.45,Cordelia,"Buffy, where are we?"
1899.83,1902.95,Buffy,"In the basement, as far as I can tell."
1902.99,1905.39,Cordelia,What's happening?
1902.99,1905.39,Cordelia,What did they do to us?
1905.39,1907.33,Buffy,They drugged us.
1907.37,1910.46,Cordelia,Why? What are they gonna do to us?
1910.5,1911.93,Buffy,I don't know.
1911.93,1913.69,Cordelia,I wanna go home.
1913.73,1916.8,Callie,No one's going home.
1917.67,1920.08,Callie,Ever.
1921.1,1925.25,Callie,"Look, one of them's..."
1921.1,1925.25,Callie,different than the others.
1926.1,1928.06,Callie,Nicer.
1928.61,1930.27,Buffy,Tom.
1934.24,1937.12,Callie,He's the one to watch out for.
1942.37,1944.11,Tom,She's last.
1944.11,1946.48,Cordelia,Last? For what?
1946.95,1949.23,Cordelia,Who's first?
1949.25,1951.79,Cordelia,Answer me!
1951.83,1954.77,Cordelia,Who's first?
1956.66,1959.09,Buffy,Three stones.
1959.26,1961.14,Buffy,Three of us.
1961.17,1963.44,Cordelia,Buffy...
1963.48,1967.09,Buffy,Stay calm. We'll get out of this.
1968.65,1972.17,Cordelia,Why did I ever let you
1968.65,1972.17,Cordelia,talk me into coming here?!
1983.87,1987.62,Angel,"She found the bracelet in the cemetery,"
1983.87,1987.62,Angel,near the south wall.
1987.66,1990.19,Giles,South wall.
1990.23,1992.69,Giles,What are you doing?
1992.73,1998.09,Giles,"Oh, sorry. The reflection thing"
1992.73,1998.09,Giles,that you don't have.
1998.12,2000.95,Giles,"Angel, how do you shave?"
2001.39,2002.35,Giles,"South wall,"
2002.35,2005.04,Willow,that's near the college. And...
2005.04,2007.15,Willow,the fraternity house!
2007.19,2007.97,Giles,A fraternity?
2007.97,2009.95,Angel,Could they be taking these girls?
2010.15,2012.02,Angel,Let's get out there.
2012.12,2014.03,Willow,Buffy...
2014.07,2017.33,Giles,We don't know that it's concrete.
2014.07,2017.33,Giles,Let's not disturb her until...
2017.36,2019.7,Willow,is there! With Cordelia!
2019.7,2022.07,Willow,They went to a party
2019.7,2022.07,Willow,at the Zeta Kappa House.
2022.1,2023.33,Giles,She lied to me?
2023.33,2023.91,Willow,Well...
2023.94,2027.04,Angel,Did... she have a date?
2027.04,2027.98,Willow,Well...
2028.32,2031.37,Willow,"Well, why do you think"
2028.32,2031.37,Willow,she went to that party?!
2031.37,2033.62,Willow,Because you gave her the brushoff!
2033.65,2037.72,Willow,And you never let her do anything
2033.65,2037.72,Willow,"except work and patrol, and..."
2037.75,2041.1,Willow,"I know she's the Chosen One,"
2037.75,2041.1,Willow,but you're killing her with pressure.
2041.14,2044.07,Willow,"I mean, she's 16 going on 40!"
2044.11,2046.55,Willow,"And you! I mean,"
2044.11,2046.55,Willow,you're gonna live for ever.
2046.55,2049.71,Willow,You don't have time
2046.55,2049.71,Willow,for a cup of coffee?!
2050.81,2052.48,Willow,OK.
2052.69,2056.66,Willow,"I don't feel better now,"
2052.69,2056.66,Willow,and we've gotta help Buffy.
2060.2,2065.46,Xander,"One day I'll have money, prestige, power."
2065.5,2068.31,Xander,"And on that day, they'll still have more."
2074.46,2075.41,Tom,Machida.
2075.41,2076.84,Brothers,In his name.
2078.21,2080.26,Tom,We who serve you...
2080.72,2083.94,Tom,we who receive all that you bestow...
2084.47,2087.07,Tom,call upon you in this holy hour.
2087.11,2089.18,Brothers,This holy hour.
2089.21,2091.36,Tom,We have no wealth...
2091.39,2093.3,Tom,"no possession, except that"
2093.3,2094.55,Brothers,what you give us.
2094.55,2096.53,Brothers,Except what you give us.
2096.53,2098.1,Tom,We have no power...
2098.23,2100.64,Tom,no place in the world...
2100.67,2104.62,Brothers,except that what you give us.
2100.67,2104.62,Brothers,Except that what you give us.
2104.65,2106.95,Cordelia,"What are they,"
2104.65,2106.95,Cordelia,some kind of cult or something?
2106.95,2109.49,Buffy,Yeah. Psychocult.
2109.53,2110.88,Cordelia,You've gotta do something.
2110.88,2113,Tom,It's been a year since our last offering.
2113.25,2116.12,Tom,A year in which our bounty overflowed.
2116.38,2119.91,Tom,We come before you
2116.38,2119.91,Tom,with fresh offerings.
2120.13,2122.88,Cordelia,Offerings? He's talking about us?
2123.26,2126.98,Callie,Do you see anyone else
2123.26,2126.98,Callie,chained up in here?
2128.26,2132.02,Tom,"Accept our offering, dark lord,"
2132.05,2134.29,Tom,and bless us with your power...
2134.52,2138.34,Brothers,Machida!
2134.52,2138.34,Brothers,Machida!
2139.52,2140.92,Cordelia,What's down there?
2140.92,2141.7,Tom,Come forth
2142.03,2147.66,Tom,and let your terrible countenance look upon
2142.03,2147.66,Tom,your servants and their humble offering.
2147.69,2150.08,Brothers,"We call you, Machida."
2151.41,2154.21,Brothers,"In his name, Machida!"
2154.54,2158.82,Cordelia,There's something down there
2154.54,2158.82,Cordelia,and he's gonna throw us down there with it!
2158.85,2160.14,Buffy,I don't think so.
2160.14,2162.57,Cordelia,"No? Well, that's good. That's..."
2162.61,2164.59,Buffy,I don't think we go to it.
2165.18,2167.96,Buffy,I think it comes to us.
2175.81,2178.19,Cordelia,"Oh, my God!"
2184.57,2186.95,Cordelia,"Come on, Buffy!"
2187.7,2189.45,Cordelia,"Oh, come on!"
2191.45,2195.26,Tom,For he shall rise from the depths
2191.45,2195.26,Tom,and we shall tremble before him.
2195.3,2199.34,Tom,He who is the source
2195.3,2199.34,Tom,of all we inherit and all we possess.
2199.37,2201.36,Brothers,Machida.
2199.37,2201.36,Brothers,Machida.
2201.4,2204.12,Tom,"And if he is pleased with our offerings,"
2204.12,2206.37,Brothers,then our fortunes shall increase.
2206.4,2209.5,Brothers,"Machida, let our fortunes increase."
2209.53,2212.13,Tom,"And on the tenth day of the tenth month,"
2212.17,2214.74,Tom,he shall be enhungered
2214.74,2217.31,Cordelia,and we shall feed him.
2218.98,2222.4,Cordelia,"Feed him?! Oh, no!"
2224.61,2226.82,Willow,Looks like everyone's gone.
2231.49,2233.45,Angel,Hey.
2231.49,2233.45,Angel,Hey!
2233.99,2236.12,Xander,What are you guys doing here?
2236.5,2240.78,Willow,A bunch of girls are missing.
2236.5,2240.78,Willow,The Zeta Kappas may be involved. And Buffy.
2240.81,2243.38,Willow,Are you wearing makeup?
2243.41,2247.57,Xander,No. I think Buffy's still inside
2243.41,2247.57,Xander,somewhere with Cordelia.
2247.87,2250.16,Xander,Their car's still here.
2250.19,2251.45,Giles,Why are you wearing that?
2251.45,2252.76,Xander,I found it in their trash.
2252.8,2253.8,Xander,I saw them through the window.
2253.8,2254.6,Giles,They were wearing robes.
2254.63,2257.04,Giles,They went down to the basement.
2254.63,2257.04,Giles,I was gonna sneak in.
2257.08,2258.93,Giles,They may be involved
2257.08,2258.93,Giles,in some kind of ritual.
2258.97,2262.27,Willow,With the missing girls.
2262.27,2263.85,Angel,With Buffy!
2264.65,2267.54,Xander,"OK, that is the guy you wanna party with."
2272.16,2273.6,Buffy,"Hey, Reptile Boy!"
2273.6,2275.55,Tom,No woman speaks to him.
2275.91,2278.88,Buffy,You don't want her. Look at her.
2275.91,2278.88,Buffy,She's all skin and bones.
2278.88,2281.33,Buffy,Half an hour later you'll be hungry.
2281.33,2282.82,Tom,I told you to shut up!
2284.04,2286.42,Tom,"You speak again,"
2284.04,2286.42,Tom,and I'll cut your throat.
2296.18,2298.31,Xander,Got locked out dumping the trash.
2298.68,2301.1,Xander,"Let me in. I don't wanna miss the, uh..."
2301.19,2301.97,Tackle,Come on.
2301.97,2304.89,Xander,You know what. Where are they?
2315.58,2319.16,Tom,Something's going on upstairs. Go! Go!
2326.21,2328.38,Tom,"Feed, dark lord."
2350.61,2353.55,Xander,That's for the wig! That's for the bra!
2356.24,2360.4,,Some guy's attacking Buffy with a sword!
2356.24,2360.4,,"Also, there's a really big snake!"
2361.87,2363.63,,That's for the makeup!
2363.63,2366.16,,And that's for the last
2363.63,2366.16,,sixteen and a half years!
2366.2,2368.85,,Guys! Buffy! Snake! Basement now!
2374.38,2378.03,,You bitch!
2374.38,2378.03,,I'll serve you to him in pieces.
2378.76,2380.68,,"Tom, you talk too much."
2386.9,2388.57,,Help! Help!
2392.53,2394.49,,"Let her go, Wormy!"
2408.04,2409.92,,You did it.
2409.95,2412.06,,You saved us.
2412.42,2416.23,,I've never been so happy
2412.42,2416.23,,to see anyone in my whole...
2416.27,2418.55,,"You guys, I just..."
2418.68,2421.19,,hate you guys.
2421.81,2424.51,,The weirdest things
2421.81,2424.51,,always happen when you're around.
2424.54,2429.47,,And you!
2424.54,2429.47,,"You're goin' to jail for 15,000 years."
2439.75,2443.7,,I told one lie. I had one drink.
2443.74,2448.83,,Yes. And you were very nearly
2443.74,2448.83,,devoured by a giant demon snake.
2448.86,2452.46,,The words "let that be a lesson"
2448.86,2452.46,,are a tad redundant at this juncture.
2452.5,2455.77,,I'm sorry.
2452.5,2455.77,,So am I.
2456.84,2458.97,,I...
2459.34,2464.05,,I drive you too hard
2459.34,2464.05,,because I know what you have to face.
2464.08,2468.36,,"From now on,"
2464.08,2468.36,,"no more pushing, no more prodding."
2468.4,2470.71,,"Just, um..."
2471.23,2474.61,,an inordinate amount of nudging.
2479.99,2482.6,,"Come on, come on, hurry!"
2483.12,2485.77,,There you go.
2492.02,2492.62,,"Thank you, Jonathan."
2492.65,2494.21,,Did we forget something?
2494.38,2495.67,,Um...
2496.26,2499.48,,"Cinnamon, chocolate, halfcaf, nonfat."
2500.64,2502.47,,Extra foam!
2506.89,2511.28,,Young men are the only way to go.
2513.15,2518.46,,Says here that they've all been
2513.15,2518.46,,sentenced to consecutive life sentences.
2518.5,2521.3,,Investigators found the bones
2518.5,2521.3,,of missing girls in a huge cavern
2521.3,2525.04,,beneath the frat house.
2521.3,2525.04,,And older bones dating back 50 years."
2525.07,2527.11,,A surprising number of corporations

2527.11,2529.41,,are former Delta Zeta Kappas
2529.45,2532.89,,are suffering from

2532.92,2536.56,,"Oh, ""and suicides in the boardroom."""
2532.92,2536.56,,"Starve a snake, lose a fortune."
2536.6,2539.42,,"Boy, I guess the rich"
2536.6,2539.42,,"really are different, huh?"
2539.46,2541.4,,Have you heard from Angel?
2541.44,2547.59,,When he got so mad about you being
2541.44,2547.59,,"in danger, and changed into a... grrr..."
2547.63,2550.06,,it was the most amazing thing I ever saw.
2550.1,2553.39,,"I mean, how many guys can..."
2550.1,2553.39,,"Angel, Angel, Angel."
