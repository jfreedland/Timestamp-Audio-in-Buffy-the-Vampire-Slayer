2.02,2.59,,"In every generation, there is a Chosen One."
2.67,8.05,,"She alone will stand against the vampires,"
2.67,8.05,,the demons and the forces of darkness.
8.13,9.97,,She is the Slayer.
20.85,24.11,,Zachary didn't return
20.85,24.11,,from the hunt last night.
24.19,25.69,Darla,The Slayer.
25.78,28.69,Master,Zachary was strong and he was careful.
28.78,31.4,Master,"But still the Slayer takes him,"
31.49,34.62,Master,as she has taken so many of my family.
36.24,38.33,Master,It wears thin.
39.62,42.71,Master,"Collin, what would you do about it?"
42.71,44.38,Collin,I'd annihilate her.
45.67,48.01,Master,Out of the mouths of babes...
48.01,49.71,Darla,"Let me do it, Master."
49.8,52.25,Darla,Let me kill her for you.
52.25,56.02,Master,You have a personal interest in this.
54.09,56.06,Darla,I don't get to have any fun.
56.06,57.6,Master,I will send the Three.
58.31,59.85,Darla,The Three?
67.61,69.69,Darla,Let's go.
74.03,76.36,Boy,"Get it. Come on, get it right there."
76.45,78.74,Girl,I got it.
78.83,80.7,Girl,"Free drink, please."
80.79,84.71,Willow,The Fumigation Party.
80.79,84.71,Willow,It's an annual tradition.
84.79,88.42,Willow,The closing of the Bronze for a few days
84.79,88.42,Willow,to nuke the cockroaches.
90.67,94.26,Willow,It's a lot of fun.
90.67,94.26,Willow,What's it like where you are?
95.51,97.56,Xander,I'm sorry. I was just...
97.56,99.43,,thinking about things.
99.51,101.92,Willow,"So, we're talking about a guy?"
101.92,103.37,Buffy,Not exactly a guy.
103.41,105.27,Buffy,"For us to have a conversation about a guy,"
105.27,108.33,Buffy,there'd have to be a guy for us
105.27,108.33,Buffy,to have a conversation about.
108.36,110.18,Buffy,Is that a sentence?
110.18,111.61,Willow,You lack a guy.
111.69,115.65,Buffy,I do. Which is fine with me
111.69,115.65,Buffy,"most of the time, but..."
115.74,117.86,Willow,What about Angel?
117.95,120.91,Buffy,Angel? I can just
117.95,120.91,Buffy,see him in a relationship.
120.99,124.49,Buffy,"Hi, honey, you're in grave danger."
120.99,124.49,Buffy,I'll see ya next month."
124.58,127.55,Willow,"He's not around much, it's true."
129.01,133.21,Buffy,"When he is around,"
129.01,133.21,Buffy,it's like the lights dim everywhere else.
133.24,134.87,Buffy,You know how it's like that
133.24,134.87,Buffy,with some guys?
134.9,137.12,Willow,"Oh, yeah."
139.54,141.09,Xander,"Hey, Annie!"
141.66,143.64,Xander,Dino! Just leaving.
151.39,155.15,Cordelia,Please get your extreme oafishness
151.39,155.15,Cordelia,off my $200 shoes.
155.23,156.02,Xander,"Sorry, I was just..."
156.02,157.13,Cordelia,"Getting off the dance floor,"
157.17,160.33,Cordelia,before Annie Vega's boyfriend
157.17,160.33,Cordelia,squashes you like a bug?
160.36,163.13,Xander,"Oh, so you noticed."
160.36,163.13,Xander,"Yeah, thanks for being so understanding."
163.13,163.31,Cordelia,Sure.
163.31,164.48,Xander,"You know, hey, I don't know what"
164.51,168.49,Xander,everyone's talking about. That outfit
164.51,168.49,Xander,doesn't make you look like a hooker.
169.74,173.24,Xander,"Boy, that Cordelia's"
169.74,173.24,Xander,a regular breath of vile air.
173.24,174.52,Xander,What are you vixens up to?
174.55,178.17,Willow,Just sitting here
174.55,178.17,Willow,watching our barren lives pass us by.
178.25,181.03,Willow,"Oh, look. A cockroach."
181.7,186.33,Xander,Whoa! Let's stop this
181.7,186.33,Xander,crazy whirligig of fun. I'm dizzy.
186.36,190.66,Buffy,All right. Now I'm infecting those nearest
186.36,190.66,Buffy,and dear to me. I'm gonna call it a night.
190.7,191.59,Willow,"Oh, don't go."
191.59,194.31,Xander,"Yeah, it's early. We could, um... dance."
194.39,197.96,Buffy,Rain check? Good night.
199.23,201.65,Willow,Want a free drink?
238.52,243.16,Buffy,"It's late, I'm tired"
238.52,243.16,Buffy,and I don't wanna play games.
243.2,245.24,Buffy,Show yourself.
251.04,253.57,Buffy,OK. OK. Nice.
253.66,258.25,Buffy,"OK. OK. Look, I really don't wanna"
253.66,258.25,Buffy,fight all three of you unless I have to.
323.17,326.38,Angel,b>"Angel"</b>
331.27,334.69,Angel,Good dogs don't... bite.
343.35,345.38,Buffy,Look out!
351.97,354.45,Buffy,Run!
372.68,375.06,Buffy,Get in! Come on! No!
384.57,388.47,Angel,It's all right. A vampire
384.57,388.47,Angel,can't come in unless it's invited.
388.51,391.76,Buffy,"I've heard that before,"
388.51,391.76,Buffy,but I've never put it to the test.
395.88,398.04,Buffy,I'll go get some bandages. Just...
398.13,401.12,Buffy,take your jacket and your shirt off.
418.94,421.02,Buffy,Nice tattoo.
424.02,426.39,Buffy,I was lucky you came along.
426.61,428.85,Buffy,How did you happen to come along?
428.89,432.84,Angel,I live nearby. I was just out walking.
433.55,436.25,Buffy,"So, you weren't following me?"
437,439.58,Buffy,I just had this feeling you were.
439.58,441.15,Angel,Why would I do that?
442.65,444.58,Buffy,You tell me.
444.62,447.26,Buffy,You're the mystery guy
444.62,447.26,Buffy,that appears out of nowhere.
447.29,450.67,Buffy,I'm not saying
447.29,450.67,Buffy,"I'm not happy about it tonight, but..."
450.7,453.75,Buffy,"if you are hanging around,"
450.7,453.75,Buffy,I'd like to know why.
453.78,455.92,Angel,Maybe I like you.
455.92,456.68,Buffy,Maybe?
463.15,465.67,Joyce,"Honey, what are you doing?"
465.67,468.27,Buffy,There's a lot of weird people
465.67,468.27,Buffy,outside at night. I just...
468.31,470.54,Buffy,feel better with you safe and sound inside.
470.54,472.69,Buffy,You must be beat.
472.72,475.11,Joyce,I am. We're a little gallery.
472.72,475.11,Joyce,You have no idea how much...
475.14,478.14,Buffy,Then why don't you go upstairs and get
475.14,478.14,Buffy,into bed and I can bring you some hot tea.
478.14,480.81,Joyce,That's sweet. What'd you do?
480.85,484.75,Buffy,Can't a daughter just be concerned
480.85,484.75,Buffy,about her mother?
484.84,486.88,Joyce,Hi.
484.84,486.88,Joyce,Hi.
486.92,489.21,Buffy,Oh. OK.
490.67,492.89,Joyce,"Angel, this is my mom."
492.97,494.97,Joyce,"Mom, this is Angel."
495.05,497.79,Buffy,We ran into each other on the way home.
497.79,499.87,Angel,Nice to meet you.
500.15,502.28,Joyce,"What do you do, Angel?"
502.28,503.73,Buffy,He's a student.
504.31,507.86,Buffy,"Uh, first year... community college."
504.31,507.86,Buffy,Angel's been helping me with my history.
507.94,510.14,Buffy,You know I've been toiling there.
510.14,512.28,Joyce,It's a little late for tutoring.
513.32,515.7,Joyce,I'm gonna go to bed. And Buffy?
515.78,518.12,Buffy,I'll say good night and do the same.
519.67,521.95,Joyce,It was nice to meet you.
524.57,526.17,Buffy,Good night.
526.21,530.13,Buffy,We'll hook up soon
526.21,530.13,Buffy,and do that study thing!
541.68,543.96,Angel,"Look, I don't wanna"
541.68,543.96,Angel,get you in any more trouble.
543.96,548.02,Buffy,And I don't wanna get you dead.
546.04,548.98,Buffy,They could still be out there.
549.06,551.15,Buffy,So...
551.9,555.49,Buffy,Two of us. One bed.
551.9,555.49,Buffy,That doesn't work.
556.32,558.86,Buffy,Um... Why don't you take the bed?
556.32,558.86,Buffy,"You know, you're wounded."
558.95,559.9,Angel,I'll take the floor.
559.9,560.7,Buffy,"No, that's not..."
560.78,563.32,Angel,"Believe me, I've had worse."
563.36,565.06,Buffy,OK.
565.21,568.79,Buffy,"Um, then... Why don't you check and see"
565.21,568.79,Buffy,if the Fang Gang is still loitering
568.87,573.2,Buffy,"and, um... keep your back turned"
568.87,573.2,Buffy,while I change?
577.8,579.88,Angel,I don't see them.
579.97,584.51,Buffy,"You know, I'm the Chosen One."
579.97,584.51,Buffy,It's my job to fight guys like that.
584.6,586.43,Buffy,What's your excuse?
586.43,588.35,Angel,"Uh, somebody has to."
588.52,591.92,Buffy,"Well, what does your family"
588.52,591.92,Buffy,think of your career choice?
591.95,594.11,Angel,They're dead.
598.04,600.95,Buffy,Was it vampires?
602.32,604.97,Angel,Itit was.
605.82,607.55,Buffy,I'm sorry.
607.55,610.57,Angel,It was a long while ago.
610.6,613.95,Buffy,"So, this is a vengeance gig for you?"
615.17,618.43,Angel,You even look pretty when you go to sleep.
618.45,622.88,Buffy,"Well, when I wake up,"
618.45,622.88,Buffy,it's an entirely different story.
627.33,629.51,Buffy,Here.
632.67,634.85,Buffy,Sleep tight.
648.18,650.43,Buffy,Angel?
650.47,652.25,Angel,Hmm?
654.5,656.79,Buffy,Do you snore?
657.21,659.29,Angel,I don't know.
659.38,664.46,Angel,It's been a long time since anybody's
659.38,664.46,Angel,been in a position to let me know.
670.54,673.51,Xander,He spent the night?
670.54,673.51,Xander,In your room? In your bed?
673.6,675.84,Buffy,Not in my bed. By my bed.
675.84,677.64,Willow,That is so romantic.
677.73,680.35,Willow,"Did you, uh...?"
677.73,680.35,Willow,"I mean, did he, uh...?"
680.9,682.08,Buffy,Perfect gentleman.
682.11,682.92,Buffy,Buffy! Come on.
682.92,684.66,Xander,Wake up and smell the seduction.
684.7,686.44,Xander,It's the oldest trick in the book.
686.44,686.7,Buffy,What?
686.73,689.35,Buffy,Saving my life?
686.73,689.35,Buffy,Getting slashed in the ribs?
689.38,692.07,Xander,"Duh! I mean, guys'll do anything"
689.38,692.07,Xander,to impress a girl.
692.16,695.63,Xander,II once drank an entire gallon of Gatorade
692.16,695.63,Xander,without taking a breath.
695.66,699.61,Willow,It was pretty impressive.
695.66,699.61,Willow,Although later there was an ick factor.
699.65,701.75,Giles,Can we steer this riveting conversation
701.75,704.71,Giles,back to the events that
701.75,704.71,Giles,happened earlier in the evening?
704.75,709.92,Giles,You left the Bronze and were set upon
704.75,709.92,Giles,by three unusually virile vampires.
712.02,712.76,Giles,Did they look like this?
712.76,713.71,Buffy,Yeah. What's with the uniforms?
713.75,715.93,Giles,It seems you encountered the Three.
718.02,718.61,Giles,Warrior vampires.
718.02,718.61,Giles,Very proud and very strong.
718.61,720.89,Willow,How is it you always know this stuff?
720.93,724.02,Willow,You always know what's going on.
720.93,724.02,Willow,I never know what's going on.
724.1,727.14,Giles,You weren't here from midnight
724.1,727.14,Giles,until six researching it.
727.14,728.9,Willow,No. I was sleeping.
728.93,731.61,Giles,Obviously you're hurting
728.93,731.61,Giles,the Master very much.
731.69,734.76,Giles,He wouldn't send the Three
731.69,734.76,Giles,for just anyone.
734.77,736.81,Giles,We must step up
734.77,736.81,Giles,our training with weapons.
736.85,739.62,Xander,"Buffy, you should stay at my house"
736.85,739.62,Xander,until these Samurai guys are history.
739.7,739.96,Buffy,What?
739.96,741.64,Xander,"Ahahah, don't worry about Angel."
741.68,744.5,Xander,Willow can run to your house
741.68,744.5,Xander,and tell him to get out of town fast.
744.58,747.31,Giles,"Angel and Buffy are,"
744.58,747.31,Giles,are not in any immediate jeopardy.
747.35,748.45,Vampire,Eventually the Master will send
748.45,749.69,Giles,"someone else, but, in the meantime,"
749.7,751.31,Giles,the Three having failed
751.31,753.97,Vampire,will offer their own lives in penance.
756.02,759.65,Vampire,"We failed in our duty,"
756.02,759.65,Vampire,and now our lives belong to you.
762.19,764.58,Master,"Pay attention, child."
762.19,764.58,Master,You are the Anointed
764.58,767.09,Master,and there is much you must learn.
767.12,770.23,Master,With power comes responsibility.
770.31,772.47,Master,"True, they did fail."
772.47,773.98,Collin,"But also true,"
773.99,777.97,Master,we who walk at night share a common bond.
780.02,782.74,Master,The taking of a life 
780.02,782.74,Master,"I'm not talking about humans, of course "
783.04,785.69,Collin,is a serious matter.
785.72,788.29,Collin,"So, you would spare them?"
789,791.13,Master,"I am weary,"
791.21,794.71,Master,and their deaths will bring me little joy.
800.91,804.9,Master,Of course sometimes a little is enough.
809.18,811.98,Buffy,Cool. Crossbow.
813.36,815.44,Buffy,Check out these babies.
816.82,820.15,Buffy,"Goodbye, stakes. Hello, flying fatality."
820.24,822.06,Buffy,What can I shoot?
822.06,822.91,Giles,Nothing.
822.91,824.95,Giles,The crossbow comes later.
824.98,828.91,Giles,You must first become proficient
824.98,828.91,Giles,with the basic tools of combat.
829.7,831.42,Buffy,"Now, let's begin..."
831.42,833.42,Giles,"with the quarterstaff,"
833.5,837.8,,which incidentally will require
833.5,837.8,,countless hours of vigorous training.
837.88,839.57,,I speak from experience.
839.57,840.97,Buffy,"Giles, 20th century?"
841.05,843.31,Buffy,I'm not gonna be fighting Friar Tuck.
843.31,845.92,Giles,You never know with whom or what
843.31,845.92,Giles,you'll be fighting.
845.95,848.91,Giles,These traditions have been handed down
845.95,848.91,Giles,through the ages.
848.95,852.31,Giles,"Now, you show me good, steady"
848.95,852.31,Giles,progress with the quarterstaff
852.39,856.44,Giles,and in due course we'll discuss
852.39,856.44,Giles,the crossbow. Put on your pads.
857.27,859.65,Buffy,I'm... not gonna need pads to fight you.
859.73,861.9,Giles,We'll see about that. En garde!
879.92,883.25,Giles,Good. Let's move on to the crossbow.
891.18,892.76,Buffy,Angel?
892.76,893.81,Angel,Hey.
898.67,902.94,Buffy,I brought you some dinner.
898.67,902.94,Buffy,It's a little plateless. Sorry.
907.36,909.45,Buffy,So. What did you do all day?
910.49,914.95,Angel,I read a little. And just thought about
910.49,914.95,Angel,"a lot of things. Buffy, I..."
915.04,918.25,Buffy,My diary? You read my diary?
918.33,921.87,Buffy,That is not OK. A diary is like
918.33,921.87,Buffy,a person's most private place.
921.96,923.94,Buffy,You don't even know
921.96,923.94,Buffy,what I was writing about!
923.98,926.25,Buffy,Hunk can mean a lot of things. Bad things.
926.29,929.05,Buffy,"And, and when it says that your eyes"
926.29,929.05,Buffy,"are 'penetrating', I meant to write..."
929.08,930.39,Angel,bulgy'.
929.08,930.39,Angel,Buffy...
930.43,933.25,Buffy,And 'A' doesn't even stand for
930.43,933.25,Buffy,"Angel' for that matter, it stands for..."
933.25,934.92,Buffy,"Ahmed', a charming"
933.25,934.92,Buffy,foreign exchange student
934.96,937.26,Buffy,so that whole fantasy part has nothing
934.96,937.26,Buffy,to even do with you at all...
937.29,939.65,Angel,Your mother moved your diary
937.29,939.65,Angel,when she came in to straighten up.
939.69,941.76,Angel,I watched her from the closet.
941.76,945.24,Angel,I didn't read it. I swear.
945.24,947.35,Buffy,Oh.
947.45,949.45,Buffy,Oh.
949.48,953.24,Angel,I did a lot of thinking today.
949.48,953.24,Angel,I really can't be around you.
953.32,958.37,Buffy,Because when I am...
953.32,958.37,Buffy,"Hey, no big. Water... over the bridge."
958.45,961.08,Angel,all I can think about
958.45,961.08,Angel,is how badly I wanna kiss you.
961.16,963.33,Buffy,Kiss me?
963.41,966.46,Angel,"I'm older than you, and this can't ever..."
967.42,969.59,Angel,I better go.
970.09,973.17,Buffy,How much older?
974.26,976.48,Angel,I should...
976.48,977.09,Buffy,Go.
977.18,979.26,Buffy,You said...
1002.66,1004.49,Buffy,What? What's wrong?
1017.99,1020.18,Joyce,"Buffy, what happened?"
1022.83,1025.89,Buffy,Nothing. I saw a shadow.
1030.23,1031.61,Willow,Angel's a vampire?
1031.61,1034.23,Buffy,I can't believe this is happening.
1034.32,1038.07,Buffy,One minute we were kissing
1034.32,1038.07,Buffy,and the next minute...
1038.15,1040.46,Buffy,Can a vampire ever be a good person?
1038.15,1040.46,Buffy,Couldn't it happen?
1040.5,1044.26,Giles,A vampire isn't a person at all.
1040.5,1044.26,Giles,"It may have the movements, memories,"
1044.26,1046.77,Giles,even the personality of the person
1044.26,1046.77,Giles,"that it took over, but it"
1046.8,1049.62,Giles,it's still a demon at the core.
1046.8,1049.62,Giles,There is no halfway.
1049.7,1052.04,Willow,"So that'd be a no, huh?"
1052.12,1055.29,Buffy,"Well, then what was he doing?"
1052.12,1055.29,Buffy,Why was he good to me?
1055.38,1059.67,Buffy,Was it all some part of the Master's plan?
1055.38,1059.67,Buffy,It doesn't make sense!
1059.76,1061.77,Buffy,"All right, uh, you have a problem"
1061.77,1063.3,Xander,and it's not a small one.
1063.38,1067.76,Xander,Let's take a breath
1063.38,1067.76,Xander,and look at this calmly and objectively.
1067.85,1071.77,Xander,Angel's a vampire. You're a slayer.
1071.85,1074.73,Xander,I think it's obvious what you have to do.
1076.81,1078.05,Giles,It is a slayer's duty.
1078.05,1080.19,Xander,I know you have feelings for this guy.
1080.27,1082.82,Xander,"But you're not in love with him, right?"
1083.69,1086.36,Xander,In love with a vampire?
1083.69,1086.36,Xander,Are you out of your mind?
1086.45,1088.28,Cordelia,What?
1088.37,1090.2,Xander,Not vampire.
1090.28,1093.54,Xander,How could you love an umpire?
1090.28,1093.54,Xander,Everyone hates 'em.
1093.62,1097.42,Cordelia,Where did you get that dress?
1093.62,1097.42,Cordelia,This is a oneofakind Todd Oldham.
1097.5,1100.7,Cordelia,Do you know how much this dress cost?
1097.5,1100.7,Cordelia,Is this a knockoff?
1100.7,1103.03,Cordelia,"This is a knockoff, isn't it?!"
1100.7,1103.03,Cordelia,Some cheesy knockoff!
1103.07,1106.39,Cordelia,This is exactly what happens
1103.07,1106.39,Cordelia,when you sign these free trade agreements.
1106.43,1108.68,Buffy,You think we have problems.
1134.14,1135.38,Angel,Who's here?
1135.41,1137.91,Darla,A friend.
1137.91,1141.82,Darla,Hi. It's been a while.
1143.42,1144.34,Angel,A lifetime.
1144.34,1146.59,Darla,"Or two, but who's counting?"
1146.67,1151.18,Angel,What's with the Catholic schoolgirl look?
1146.67,1151.18,Angel,"Last time I saw you, it was kimonos."
1151.26,1155.43,Darla,"And last time I saw you,"
1151.26,1155.43,Darla,it wasn't highschool girls.
1156.01,1158.1,Darla,Don't you like?
1160.06,1162.73,Darla,Remember Budapest?
1160.06,1162.73,Darla,Turn of the century?
1162.81,1165.38,Darla,You were a bad boy during that earthquake.
1165.38,1166.91,Angel,You did some damage yourself.
1166.94,1170.99,Darla,Is there anything better
1166.94,1170.99,Darla,than a natural disaster?
1171.07,1175.45,Darla,The panic. The people lost in the streets.
1175.53,1178.37,Darla,It's like picking fruit off the vine.
1180.33,1185.63,Darla,Nice. You're living above ground.
1180.33,1185.63,Darla,Like one of them.
1185.71,1188.96,Darla,You and your new friend are attacking us.
1189.05,1191.13,Darla,Like one of them.
1192.05,1195.8,Darla,"But guess what, precious?"
1192.05,1195.8,Darla,You're not one of them.
1199.81,1201.5,Darla,Are you?
1201.5,1202.14,Angel,No.
1202.22,1204.6,Angel,"But I'm not exactly one of you, either."
1205.06,1213.45,Darla,Is that what you tell yourself these days?
1213.49,1216.15,Darla,You're not exactly living off quiche.
1216.24,1221.67,Darla,"You and I both know what you hunger for,"
1216.24,1221.67,Darla,what you need.
1221.7,1223.82,Darla,It's nothing to be ashamed of.
1223.82,1224.95,Angel,It's who we are.
1225.04,1228.04,Darla,It's what makes eternal life worth living.
1229.33,1231.77,Darla,You can only suppress your real nature
1231.77,1232.54,Angel,for so long.
1232.63,1235.88,Darla,I can feel it brewing inside of you.
1235.96,1238.17,Darla,I hope I'm around when it explodes.
1238.88,1241.03,Angel,Maybe you don't wanna be.
1241.03,1242.93,Darla,I'm not afraid of you.
1243.51,1246.18,Darla,"I bet she is, though."
1246.27,1249.98,Darla,Or... maybe I'm underestimating her.
1250.06,1254.73,Darla,Talk to her. Tell her about the curse.
1250.06,1254.73,Darla,Maybe she'll come around.
1255.52,1260.15,Darla,"And if she still doesn't trust you,"
1255.52,1260.15,Darla,you know where I'll be.
1272.46,1274.54,Giles,Here's something at last.
1274.63,1276.69,Xander,"Can you, please,"
1274.63,1276.69,Xander,warn us before you do that?
1276.69,1279.83,Giles,"There's nothing about Angel in the text,"
1276.69,1279.83,Giles,but it suddenly occurred to me that
1279.87,1283.63,Giles,it's been ages since I've read the diaries
1279.87,1283.63,Giles,of any of the watchers before me.
1283.66,1285.87,Willow,That must've been so embarrassing
1283.66,1285.87,Willow,when you thought
1285.9,1288.25,Willow,"he had read your diary,"
1285.9,1288.25,Willow,but then it turned out he hadn't
1288.28,1290.92,Willow,but then he felt the same way...
1291.93,1292.84,Willow,I'm listening.
1292.84,1295.06,Giles,There's mention some 200 years ago
1295.15,1298.4,Giles,"in Ireland ofof Angelus,"
1295.15,1298.4,Giles,the one with the angelic face.
1298.48,1301.03,Buffy,They got that right.
1302.19,1304.74,Xander,I'm not saying anything.
1302.19,1304.74,Xander,I have nothing to say.
1304.82,1309.2,Giles,"Does this, uh, Angel have, um,"
1304.82,1309.2,Giles,a tattoo behind his right shoulder?
1309.28,1311.55,Buffy,Yeah. It's a bird or something.
1311.59,1314.18,Xander,Now I'm saying something.
1311.59,1314.18,Xander,You saw him naked?
1314.22,1316.39,Willow,So Angel's been around for a while.
1316.39,1318.88,Giles,Not long for a vampire. 240 years or so.
1319.63,1322.71,Buffy,"Well, he said he was older."
1322.8,1325.47,Giles,"Angelus leaves Ireland,"
1325.55,1328.97,Giles,wreaks havoc in Europe for several decades
1329.05,1333.35,Giles,and then about 80 years ago
1329.05,1333.35,Giles,the most curious thing happens.
1334.47,1339.56,Giles,"He comes to America,"
1334.47,1339.56,Giles,shuns other vampires and lives alone.
1339.65,1342.77,Giles,There'sthere's no...
1339.65,1342.77,Giles,no record of him hunting here.
1342.86,1347.32,Willow,So he is a good vampire.
1342.86,1347.32,Willow,"I mean, on a scale of one to ten."
1347.4,1350.66,Willow,Ten being someone
1347.4,1350.66,Willow,who's killing and maiming every night
1350.74,1353.37,Willow,and one being someone who's... not.
1353.45,1355.8,Giles,I say that there's no record. But...
1355.8,1357.38,Giles,Vampires hunt and kill.
1357.38,1358.61,Xander,It's what they do.
1358.64,1360.47,Xander,"Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly."
1360.47,1362.3,Buffy,He could've fed on me. He didn't.
1362.38,1365.97,Xander,Question: a hundred years or so
1362.38,1365.97,Xander,"before he came to our shores,"
1365.97,1368.07,Xander,what was he like then?
1368.71,1373.14,Giles,Like all of them.
1368.71,1373.14,Giles,"A vicious, violent animal."
1374.14,1377.22,Darla,"Don't think I'm not grateful,"
1374.14,1377.22,Darla,you letting me kill the Three.
1377.31,1380.94,Master,How can my children learn
1377.31,1380.94,Master,if I do everything for them?
1381.02,1383.48,Darla,But you've gotta let me
1381.02,1383.48,Darla,take care of the Slayer.
1383.48,1386.52,Master,You're giving me orders now.
1386.56,1390.16,Darla,OK. We'll just do nothing
1386.56,1390.16,Darla,while she takes us out one by one.
1390.2,1393.44,Master,"Do I sense a plan, Darla?"
1393.47,1396.22,Master,Share.
1396.55,1401.02,Darla,Angel kills her
1396.55,1401.02,Darla,and comes back to the fold.
1399.04,1404.46,Master,Angel. He was
1399.04,1404.46,Master,the most vicious creature I ever met.
1404.49,1406.82,Master,I miss him.
1406.82,1408.52,Darla,So do I.
1412.02,1412.61,Master,Why would he kill her
1412.02,1412.61,Master,if he feels for her?
1412.61,1415.76,Darla,To keep her from killing him.
1416.89,1420.97,Master,You see? How we all work together
1416.89,1420.97,Master,for the common good?
1421.06,1424.44,Master,That's how a family is
1421.06,1424.44,Master,supposed to function.
1424.52,1428.02,Willow,"OK, so let's review."
1424.52,1428.02,Willow,Reconstruction began when?
1429.48,1431.11,Willow,Buffy?
1432.61,1434.94,Willow,Reconstruction.
1435.03,1436.5,Willow,Reconstruction began
1436.5,1438.41,Buffy,"after the... construction,"
1438.49,1441.74,Buffy,"which was shoddy,"
1438.49,1441.74,Buffy,so they had to reconstruct.
1442.08,1444.58,Willow,After the destruction of the Civil War.
1445.7,1451.34,Buffy,Right. Civil War. During which Angel
1445.7,1451.34,Buffy,was already 100 and change.
1451.88,1456.05,Willow,Are we gonna talk about boys
1451.88,1456.05,Willow,or are we gonna help you pass history?
1458.34,1460.92,Willow,Sometimes I have this fantasy
1460.92,1464.46,Willow,that Xander's just gonna grab me
1460.92,1464.46,Willow,and kiss me right on the lips.
1464.49,1467.16,Buffy,"If you want Xander,"
1464.49,1467.16,Buffy,"you've gotta speak up, girl."
1467.2,1469.85,Willow,"No, no, no, no. No speaking up."
1469.94,1472.98,Willow,That way leads
1469.94,1472.98,Willow,to madness and sweaty palms.
1473.06,1476.23,Willow,"OK, so here's something I gotta know."
1476.32,1480.28,Willow,When Angel kissed you...
1476.32,1480.28,Willow,"I mean, before he turned into..."
1480.31,1482.73,Willow,How was it?
1482.77,1485.37,Buffy,Unbelievable.
1485.41,1490.54,Willow,Wow. And it is kinda novel how
1485.41,1490.54,Willow,he'll stay young and handsome forever.
1490.62,1493.71,Willow,Although you'll still get wrinkly
1490.62,1493.71,Willow,and die and...
1494.33,1497.38,Willow,"Oh, what about the children?"
1497.8,1499.58,Willow,I'll be quiet now.
1499.58,1500.76,Buffy,"No, it's OK."
1501.51,1504.84,Buffy,I need to hear this.
1501.51,1504.84,Buffy,"I need to get over him, so I can..."
1504.93,1509.02,Willow,So that you can...
1508.56,1514.69,Buffy,"Like Xander said, I'm the Slayer"
1508.56,1514.69,Buffy,"and he's a... vampire. God, I can't."
1514.77,1516.95,Buffy,He's never done anything to hurt me.
1516.95,1519.32,Willow,"OK, I need to stop thinking about this."
1519.4,1521.39,Buffy,"OK, let's give it another half an hour"
1521.39,1523.11,Willow,and maybe something will sink in.
1523.19,1525.53,Buffy,Then I'm going home
1523.19,1525.53,Buffy,for some major moping.
1525.61,1530.83,Willow,OK. The era of the Congressional
1525.61,1530.83,Willow,"Reconstruction, usually called Radical..."
1594.72,1595.76,Joyce,Hello?
1595.76,1598.18,Darla,"Hi, I'm Darla."
1598.27,1600.3,Darla,A friend of Buffy's.
1600.3,1602.44,Joyce,"Oh, nice to meet you."
1604.94,1608.4,Darla,She didn't mention anything about me
1604.94,1608.4,Darla,"coming over for a study date, did she?"
1608.48,1611.15,Joyce,"No, I thought she was studying"
1608.48,1611.15,Joyce,with Willow at the library.
1611.24,1613.75,Darla,She is. Willow's the Civil War expert.
1613.78,1617.17,Darla,But then I was supposed to help her
1613.78,1617.17,Darla,with the War of Independence.
1617.21,1620.2,Darla,My family kinda goes back to those days.
1620.29,1625.45,Joyce,"Well, I, I know she's supposed to be home"
1620.29,1625.45,Joyce,soon. Would you like to come in and wait?
1625.83,1629.25,Darla,It's very nice of you
1625.83,1629.25,Darla,to invite me into your home.
1629.34,1633.59,Joyce,You're welcome.
1629.34,1633.59,Joyce,I've been wrestling with the IRS all night.
1633.68,1636.67,Joyce,Would you like something to eat?
1636.67,1637.89,Darla,Yes. I would.
1637.97,1640.31,Joyce,Let's see what we have.
1640.39,1642.67,Joyce,Do you feel like something little
1642.67,1643.85,Darla,or something big?
1644.52,1646.44,Darla,Something big.
1670.9,1672.6,Angel,Let her go.
1672.64,1675.17,Darla,I just had a little. There's plenty more.
1675.21,1679.51,Darla,Aren't you hungry for something warm
1675.21,1679.51,Darla,after all this time?
1679.59,1682.93,Darla,"Come on, Angel. Just say yes."
1691.86,1694.11,Darla,Welcome home.
1701.86,1705.7,Buffy,Hey. I'm home.
1719.21,1721.55,Buffy,You're not welcome here.
1722.43,1724.97,Buffy,You come near us and I'll kill you.
1733.6,1736.36,Buffy,"Mom? Mom, can you hear me?"
1736.44,1740.53,Buffy,Yes. I need an ambulance.
1736.44,1740.53,Buffy,Revello Drive.
1740.61,1742.82,Buffy,My mother cut herself.
1740.61,1742.82,Buffy,She lost a lot of blood.
1742.82,1745.11,Buffy,"Please, please hurry."
1745.15,1745.7,Buffy,Mom?
1745.7,1747.2,Xander,"Hey, Buffy."
1748.33,1749.19,Xander,"Oh, my God!."
1749.19,1750.2,Willow,What happened?
1750.29,1751.33,Buffy,Angel.
1755.04,1757.67,Buffy,"Do you remember anything, Mom?"
1757.67,1760.29,Joyce,Just... Your friend came over.
1760.38,1762.84,Joyce,I was gonna make a snack.
1762.84,1763.82,Buffy,My friend?
1763.86,1767.22,Joyce,I guess I slipped and cut my neck on...
1767.3,1771.18,Joyce,The doctor said
1767.3,1771.18,Joyce,it looked like a barbecue fork.
1771.26,1773.72,Joyce,We don't have a barbecue fork.
1775.81,1777.89,Joyce,Are you another doctor?
1779.6,1781.82,Buffy,"No. Mom, this is Mr. Giles."
1781.9,1785.69,Joyce,The librarian from your school.
1781.9,1785.69,Joyce,What's he doing here?
1785.78,1790.2,Giles,I just came to pay my respects.
1785.78,1790.2,Giles,Wish you a speedy recovery.
1790.28,1793.91,Joyce,"Boy, the teachers"
1790.28,1793.91,Joyce,really do care in this town.
1793.99,1796.08,Buffy,Get some rest now.
1805.92,1810.51,Buffy,She's gonna be OK.
1805.92,1810.51,Buffy,They gave her some iron.
1810.59,1813.89,Buffy,Her blood count was a little...
1813.97,1817.64,Giles,A little low.
1813.97,1817.64,Giles,It presents itself like mild anemia.
1817.72,1820.6,Giles,You were lucky you got to her
1817.72,1820.6,Giles,as soon as you did.
1820.69,1822.73,Buffy,Lucky? Stupid.
1822.81,1824.9,Xander,"Buff, it's not your fault."
1824.9,1827.4,Buffy,No? I invited him into my home.
1827.48,1830.54,Buffy,"Even after I knew who he was,"
1827.48,1830.54,Buffy,what he was.
1830.54,1832.34,Buffy,And I didn't do anything about it.
1832.36,1835.93,Buffy,Because I had feelings for him.
1832.36,1835.93,Buffy,Because I cared about him.
1835.96,1839.26,Willow,"If you care about somebody,"
1835.96,1839.26,Willow,you care about them.
1839.29,1841.74,Willow,You can't change that by...
1841.74,1842.92,Buffy,Killing them?
1843,1845.96,Buffy,Maybe not. But I think it's a start.
1846.04,1848.44,Xander,We'll keep an eye on your mom.
1848.44,1848.92,Giles,Buffy!
1851.02,1851.88,Buffy,You can't stop me.
1851.02,1851.88,Buffy,The Three found me near the Bronze.
1851.88,1853.5,Buffy,And so did he. He lives nearby.
1853.5,1854.96,Giles,This is no ordinary vampire.
1854.99,1857.2,Giles,If there is such a thing.
1857.23,1859.63,Giles,"Now, he knows you."
1857.23,1859.63,Giles,He's faced the Three.
1859.63,1862.23,Giles,I think this is gonna
1859.63,1862.23,Giles,take more than a simple stake.
1862.26,1864.62,Buffy,So do I.
1869.67,1872.98,Darla,She's out hunting you right now.
1869.67,1872.98,Darla,She wants to kill you.
1873.07,1876.66,Angel,Leave me alone.
1873.07,1876.66,Angel,What did you think?
1876.74,1879.24,Angel,Did you think she would understand?
1879.32,1883.87,Angel,"That she would look at your face,"
1879.32,1883.87,Angel,"your true face,"
1883.95,1885.83,Angel,and give you a kiss?
1887.04,1889.79,Angel,For 100 years you've not had
1887.04,1889.79,Angel,a moment's peace because
1889.88,1895.38,Angel,you will not accept who you are.
1889.88,1895.38,Angel,That's all you have to do. Accept it.
1896.34,1898.49,Angel,Don't let her hunt you down.
1898.49,1901.72,Angel,Don't whimper
1898.49,1901.72,Angel,and mewl like a mangy human.
1901.76,1903.39,Angel,Kill.
1903.47,1906.14,Angel,Feed. Live.
1907.81,1909.69,Angel,All right.
1909.77,1910.93,Darla,What do you want?
1910.93,1912.23,Angel,I want it finished.
1912.31,1914.32,Darla,That's good.
1914.4,1916.69,Darla,You're hurting me.
1916.78,1919.11,Darla,"That's good, too."
1956.02,1958.18,Joyce,She talks about you all the time.
1958.18,1960.4,Joyce,It's important to have teachers
1958.18,1960.4,Joyce,who make an impression.
1960.44,1962.82,Giles,She makes quite an impression herself.
1962.9,1965.66,Joyce,I know she's having trouble with history.
1965.74,1969.42,Joyce,"Is it too difficult for her,"
1965.74,1969.42,Joyce,or is she not applying herself?
1969.45,1971.7,Giles,She lives very much in the now. Andand...
1971.79,1974.37,Giles,"history, of course, is very much"
1974.37,1976.15,Joyce,about the... the then.
1976.15,1977.54,Giles,Bbut there'sthere's no reason...
1977.58,1979.97,Joyce,She's studying with Willow.
1977.58,1979.97,Joyce,She's studying with Darla.
1979.97,1982.34,Joyce,"II mean, she's trying."
1982.37,1984.88,Giles,Darla? I don't believe I know...
1984.97,1989.02,Joyce,Her friend who came over tonight.
1987.09,1990.22,Giles,Darla came to your house tonight. She's
1987.09,1990.22,Giles,the friend that you mentioned earlier?
1990.25,1993.89,Joyce,Poor thing. I must've frightened
1990.25,1993.89,Joyce,her half to death when I fainted.
1993.97,1996.35,Giles,Someone should really check
1993.97,1996.35,Giles,and make sure she's all right.
1996.35,2000.44,Giles,"Yes, someone should."
1996.35,2000.44,Giles,Right away. I'll do it.
2000.47,2002.61,Joyce,That school is amazing.
2002.69,2004.65,Giles,We have a problem.
2023.82,2028.13,Buffy,I know you're there.
2023.82,2028.13,Buffy,And I know what you are.
2028.22,2031.38,Angel,"Do you? I'm just an animal, right?"
2031.38,2033.75,Buffy,You're not an animal.
2033.78,2036.25,Buffy,Animals I like.
2039.85,2041.98,Angel,Let's get it done.
2077.18,2080.35,Angel,Come on. Don't go soft on me now.
2084.19,2086.03,Angel,A little wide.
2086.03,2086.56,Buffy,Why?
2087.77,2091.14,Buffy,Why didn't you just attack me
2087.77,2091.14,Buffy,when you had the chance?
2091.18,2092.92,Buffy,Was it a joke?
2092.92,2096.78,Buffy,To make me feel for you and then...
2096.82,2100.63,Buffy,I've killed a lot of vampires.
2096.82,2100.63,Buffy,I've never hated one before.
2100.66,2103.37,Angel,"Feels good, doesn't it?"
2100.66,2103.37,Angel,It feels simple.
2103.45,2106.33,Buffy,I invited you into my home
2103.45,2106.33,Buffy,and then you attacked my family.
2106.41,2109.21,Angel,Why not? I killed mine.
2109.96,2112.75,Angel,I killed their friends.
2112.84,2114.92,Angel,And their friends' children.
2117.02,2118.93,Angel,"For 100 years, I offered an ugly death"
2117.02,2118.93,Angel,to everyone I met.
2121.02,2121.89,Angel,And I did it with a song in my heart.
2122.43,2123.53,Buffy,What changed?
2123.53,2126.14,Angel,I fed on a girl about your age.
2126.23,2131.56,Angel,"Beautiful. Dumb as a post,"
2126.23,2131.56,Angel,but a favorite among her clan.
2131.65,2134.53,Buffy,Her clan?
2131.65,2134.53,Buffy,The Romany.
2135.57,2139.99,Angel,Gypsies. The elders conjured
2135.57,2139.99,Angel,the perfect punishment for me.
2139.99,2141.82,Angel,They restored my soul.
2141.86,2143.88,Buffy,"What, they were all out of"
2141.86,2143.88,Buffy,boils and blinding torment?
2143.92,2145.07,Angel,"When you become a vampire,"
2145.07,2149.04,Angel,the demon takes your body
2145.07,2149.04,Angel,but it doesn't get your soul.
2149.07,2154.54,Angel,"That's gone. No conscience, no remorse."
2149.07,2154.54,Angel,It's an easy way to live.
2155.34,2160.34,Angel,You have no idea what it's like
2155.34,2160.34,Angel,"to have done the things I've done,"
2160.43,2162.64,Angel,and to care.
2162.72,2166.72,Angel,I haven't fed on a living human being
2162.72,2166.72,Angel,since that day.
2166.81,2168.77,Buffy,"So, you started with my mom?"
2168.85,2169.64,Angel,I didn't bite her.
2169.64,2171.12,Buffy,Then why didn't you say something?
2171.15,2173.9,Angel,But I wanted to.
2173.98,2178.11,Angel,"I can walk like a man,"
2173.98,2178.11,Angel,but I'm not one.
2178.19,2181.69,Angel,I wanted to kill you tonight.
2199.46,2201.26,Buffy,Go ahead.
2209.39,2211.56,Buffy,Not as easy as it looks.
2212.31,2214.39,Darla,Sure it is.
2216.35,2218.14,Willow,We're near the Bronze. What now?
2218.14,2219.31,Giles,Keep looking for her.
2219.4,2220.72,Xander,I have a question.
2220.72,2223.27,Xander,what if we find her and she's fighting
2220.72,2223.27,Xander,Angel and some of his friends?
2223.3,2225.44,Xander,What the heck
2223.3,2225.44,Xander,are we gonna do about it?
2225.53,2228.2,Darla,Do you know
2225.53,2228.2,Darla,what the saddest thing in the world is?
2228.28,2230.37,Buffy,Bad hair on top of that outfit?
2230.37,2232.87,Darla,To love someone who used to love you.
2234.37,2236.18,Buffy,You guys... were involved?
2236.22,2238.69,Darla,For several generations.
2238.73,2243.22,Buffy,"Well, you've been around since Columbus."
2238.73,2243.22,Buffy,You are bound to pile up a few ex's.
2243.25,2244.71,Buffy,"You're older than him, right?"
2244.71,2249.72,Buffy,"Just between us girls, you are"
2244.71,2249.72,Buffy,looking a little worn around the eyes.
2249.75,2251.57,Darla,I made him.
2251.57,2255.68,Darla,There was a time when we shared
2251.57,2255.68,Darla,"everything. Wasn't there, Angelus?"
2255.72,2257.62,Darla,"You had a chance to come home,"
2257.62,2260.46,Darla,to rule with me in the Master's court
2257.62,2260.46,Darla,for a thousand years.
2260.5,2265.94,Darla,But you threw that away because of her.
2260.5,2265.94,Darla,You love someone who hates us.
2266.02,2270.24,Darla,You're sick. And you'll always be sick.
2270.32,2273.91,Darla,And you'll always remember
2270.32,2273.91,Darla,what it was like to watch her die.
2276.58,2279.11,Darla,"You don't think I came alone, do you?"
2279.11,2280.2,Buffy,I know I didn't.
2283.58,2284.96,Darla,Scary.
2285.79,2286.96,Darla,Scarier.
2289.92,2294.93,Darla,Don't worry. Bullets can't kill vampires.
2289.92,2294.93,Darla,"It can hurt them like hell, but..."
2299.76,2302.64,Xander,Did you just hear...?
2302.73,2305.77,Darla,So many body parts. So few bullets.
2306.69,2310.73,Darla,Let's begin with the kneecaps.
2306.69,2310.73,Darla,No fun dancing without them.
2320.12,2322.83,Darla,"Close, but no heart."
2327.25,2329.63,Xander,We need to distract her. Fast.
2329.71,2332.42,Willow,"Buffy, it wasn't Angel who"
2329.71,2332.42,Willow,attacked your mom. It was Darla!
2370.79,2373.04,Darla,"Come on, Buffy."
2373.13,2375.5,Darla,Take it like a man.
2380.51,2382.68,Darla,Angel?
2423.34,2425.47,Collin,Forget her.
2425.55,2429.68,Master,How dare you. She was my favorite.
2429.76,2432.81,Master,For 400 years.
2432.89,2436.6,Collin,She was weak. You don't need her.
2436.69,2439.4,Collin,I'll bring you the Slayer.
2439.48,2442.15,Master,But to lose her to Angel.
2442.23,2445.86,Master,"He was to have sat at my right hand,"
2442.23,2445.86,Master,come the day.
2445.95,2446.84,Master,And now...
2446.84,2448.99,Collin,They're all against you.
2449.82,2453.04,Collin,"But soon you shall rise,"
2449.82,2453.04,Collin,"and when you do,"
2456.12,2459.29,Collin,we'll kill them all.
2468.76,2470.89,Xander,"Ah, the postfumigation party."
2470.97,2474.22,Buffy,"Okay, so what's the difference between"
2470.97,2474.22,Buffy,this and the prefumigation party?
2474.31,2476.52,Xander,Much hardier cockroaches.
2477.48,2480.76,Willow,"So, no word from Angel?"
2480.76,2483.11,Buffy,Nah.
2483.73,2488.19,Buffy,"It's weird, though. In his way"
2483.73,2488.19,Buffy,I feel like he's still watching me.
2488.23,2491.26,Willow,"Well, in a way he sort of is."
2491.26,2494.03,Willow,In the way of that he's right over there.
