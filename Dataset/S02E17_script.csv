231.76,233.4,Buffy,He was in my room.
233.4,233.76,Giles,Who?
233.79,237.9,Buffy,Angel. He was in my room last night.
237.9,239.37,Giles,Are you sure?
239.37,240.38,Buffy,Positive.
240.74,243.91,Buffy,"When I woke up, I found a picture"
240.74,243.91,Buffy,he'd left me on my pillow.
243.95,245.87,Xander,A visit from the pointedtooth fairy.
245.87,249.25,Cordelia,Wait. I thought vampires can't come in
245.87,249.25,Cordelia,unless you invited them in.
249.28,252.99,Giles,"Yes, but, uh, once you've invited them in,"
249.28,252.99,Giles,"thereafter they're, they're always welcome."
253.02,255.25,Giles,You know I think there may be
255.25,258.02,Xander,a valuable lesson for you gals here.
256.01,258.51,Xander,About inviting strange men
256.01,258.51,Xander,into your bedrooms.
258.55,262.15,Cordelia,"Oh, God! I invited him in my car once!"
262.18,265.51,Cordelia,That means he can come into my car...
262.18,265.51,Cordelia,whenever he wants.
265.55,267.55,Xander,"Yep, you're doomed to having to give"
267.55,272.02,Xander,him and his vamp pal a lift
267.55,272.02,Xander,whenever they feel like it.
270.04,272.51,Xander,And those guys never chip in for gas.
272.54,275.36,Buffy,"Giles, there has to be some sort of spell"
272.54,275.36,Buffy,"to reverse the invitation, right?"
275.39,281.02,Buffy,"Like a barrier, a ""no shoes, no pulse "
275.39,281.02,Buffy,no service" kind of thing?
279.04,280.99,Cordelia,"Yeah, that works for a car, too?"
280.99,283.25,Giles,"Yes, well, I, I, I can check on my..."
283.28,285.04,Xander,Hello?
285.16,287.85,Xander,"Excuse me, but"
285.16,287.85,Xander,have you ever heard of knocking?
287.89,290.11,Jonathon,We're supposed to get some books.
290.18,291.04,Jonathon,On Stalin.
291.04,294.05,Xander,Does this look like a Barnes&Noble?
294.09,297.27,Giles,"This is the school library, Xander."
297.27,298.27,Xander,Since when?
298.3,301.46,Giles,"Uh, yes, yes. Third row,"
298.3,301.46,Giles,historical biographies.
301.5,303.3,Jonathon,Thanks.
317.09,319.14,Giles,What?
319.14,320.91,Giles,Oh!
320.95,323.39,Jonathon,"Hey, did you say that was the...?"
324.45,326.67,Jonathon,Hello?
327.16,331.93,Giles,"So, Angel has decided"
327.16,331.93,Giles,to step up his harassment of you.
331.96,334.91,Cordelia,By sneaking in her room
331.96,334.91,Cordelia,and leaving stuff at night?
334.94,338.12,Cordelia,Why doesn't he just slit her throat
334.94,338.12,Cordelia,or strangle her while she's sleeping
338.12,341.2,Cordelia,or... cut her heart out?
341.24,343.51,Cordelia,What? I'm trying to help.
343.54,346.9,Giles,"Yes. Uh, look, it'sit's"
343.54,346.9,Giles,classic battle strategy 
346.9,350.7,Giles,to throw one's opponent off his game.
346.9,350.7,Giles,Hehehe's just trying to provoke you.
350.74,355.49,Giles,"Uh, to taunt you, to, to goad you into,"
350.74,355.49,Giles,"uh, some mishap of some sort."
355.52,358.29,Xander,The nahnahnahnahnahnah
355.52,358.29,Xander,approach to battle.
358.32,360.81,Giles,"Yes, Xander. Once more you've managed"
360.81,363.34,Giles,to boil a complex thought
360.81,363.34,Giles,down to its simplest form.
363.37,367.05,Buffy,"Giles, Angel once told me that when"
363.37,367.05,Buffy,"he was obsessed with Drusilla,"
367.08,370.42,Buffy,the first thing he did
367.08,370.42,Buffy,was to kill her family.
370.61,371.83,Xander,Your mom...
371.83,372.61,Buffy,I know.
372.61,375.22,Buffy,I'm gonna have to tell her something.
375.26,376.06,Buffy,The truth?
376.06,378.54,Giles,No. Youyouyouyou can't do that.
378.58,381.73,Xander,"Yeah! The more people who know the secret,"
378.58,381.73,Xander,the more it cheapens it for the rest of us!
381.77,384.07,Buffy,I've gotta tell her something.
381.77,384.07,Buffy,I've gotta do something!
384.07,386.57,Buffy,"Giles, Angel has"
384.07,386.57,Buffy,an allaccess pass to my house
386.58,388.89,Buffy,and I'm not always there when
386.58,388.89,Buffy,my mother is. I can't protect her.
388.92,390.68,Giles,"I told you, I will find a spell."
390.68,392.55,Buffy,What about until you find a spell?
392.59,396.76,Cordelia,"Until then, you and your mother are"
392.59,396.76,Cordelia,welcome to ride around with me in my car.
397.15,399.31,Giles,"Buffy, II understand your concern,"
399.32,402.27,Giles,but it's imperative that you keep
399.32,402.27,Giles,a level head through all this.
402.3,405.99,Buffy,That's easy for you to say. You don't have
402.3,405.99,Buffy,Angel lurking in your bedroom at night.
406.03,408.56,Giles,I know how hard this is for you.
408.87,411.34,Giles,"All right, I don't. But as the Slayer..."
411.34,415.1,Giles,you don't have the luxury
411.34,415.1,Giles,"of being a slave to your, your passions."
415.14,417.21,Giles,"You mustn't let Angel get to you,"
417.21,418.47,Giles,no matter how provocative
418.47,419.73,Buffy,his behaviour may become.
419.76,423.83,Buffy,So what you're basically saying is
419.76,423.83,Buffy,just ignore him and maybe he'll go away?
424.55,426.09,Giles,"Yes, precisely."
426.09,427.94,Xander,"Hey, how come Buffy"
426.09,427.94,Xander,doesn't get a snotty
427.97,431.8,Xander,once again you boil it down
427.97,431.8,Xander,to the simplest form" thing?
432.07,434.39,Xander,Watcher's pet!
434.43,438.19,Jenny,Don't forget I need your sample
434.43,438.19,Jenny,spreadsheets by the end of the week.
440.22,445.35,Jenny,"Ohoh, and I want both a paper printout"
440.22,445.35,Jenny,and a copy on disk. Thank you.
445.69,447.32,Jenny,Willow.
447.32,448.25,Willow,Yes?
448.29,450.27,Jenny,"Uh, I might be a little late tomorrow."
450.27,453.19,Jenny,Do you think you could
450.27,453.19,Jenny,cover my class till I show?
453.39,456.96,Willow,Really? Me? Teach the class? Sure!
457,457.58,Jenny,Cool.
457.58,458.61,Willow,"Oh, wait."
458.65,461.75,Willow,Wwhat if they
458.65,461.75,Willow,don't recognize my authority?
461.79,465.66,Willow,What if they try to convince me
461.79,465.66,Willow,that you always let them leave early?
465.7,468.27,Willow,What if there's a fire drill?
465.7,468.27,Willow,What if there's a fire?!
468.3,471.38,Jenny,Willow... you're gonna be fine.
471.41,473.94,Jenny,"And I'll try not to be too late, OK?"
473.94,475.76,Willow,"OK, good. Earlier is good."
476.61,481.09,Willow,Will I have the power to assign detention?
476.61,481.09,Willow,Or make 'em run laps?
481.13,482.71,Buffy,"Hey, Will."
482.71,485.71,Jenny,"Hey, Buffy. Rupert."
488.02,488.26,Buffy,"Willow, I thought I might take in a class."
488.26,491.53,Buffy,Figured I could use someone
488.26,491.53,Buffy,who knows where they are.
492.9,495.36,Willow,Sorry. I have to talk to her.
492.9,495.36,Willow,She's a teacher
495.36,498.59,Willow,"and teachers are to be respected, even if"
495.36,498.59,Willow,they're only filling in until the real
498.62,502,Willow,teacher shows up because
498.62,502,Willow,otherwise chaos could ensue.
506.07,508.55,Jenny,How have you been?
509.21,512,Giles,"Uh, not so good, actually. Um..."
512,515.03,Giles,"Since Angel lost his soul,"
512,515.03,Giles,he's regained his sense of whimsy.
515.18,516.37,Jenny,"Well, that sounds bad."
516.37,517.94,Giles,He's been in Buffy's bedroom.
517.99,522.19,Giles,"I, I need to... drum up a spell to, uh,"
517.99,522.19,Giles,keep him out of the house.
522.8,525.38,Jenny,This might help.
525.38,528.51,Jenny,I've been doin' a little reading
525.38,528.51,Jenny,since Angel changed.
528.54,531.03,Jenny,I don't think you have that one.
531.03,531.81,Giles,Thank you.
533.66,536.21,Jenny,So how's Buffy doing?
537.43,539.96,Giles,How do you think?
541.82,543.16,Jenny,I know you feel betrayed.
543.16,543.69,Giles,"Yes, well,"
543.69,545.94,Giles,that's one of the
543.69,545.94,Giles,unpleasant side effects of... betrayal.
545.97,547.91,Jenny,Rupert...
548.71,552.46,Jenny,I was raised by the people
548.71,552.46,Jenny,that Angel hurt the most.
553.73,557.37,Jenny,My duty to them
553.73,557.37,Jenny,was the first thing I was ever taught.
557.49,562.02,Jenny,I didn't come here to hurt anyone.
560.04,566.02,Jenny,And I lied to you because I thought
560.04,566.02,Jenny,it was the right thing to do. I...
564.04,566.83,Jenny,I didn't know what would happen.
567.53,571.33,Jenny,I didn't know I was gonna
567.53,571.33,Jenny,fall in love with you.
576.93,578.77,Jenny,"Oh, God..."
579.44,582.22,Jenny,Is it too late to take that back?
583.43,586.13,Giles,Do you want to?
586.34,589.02,Jenny,I just wanna be right with you.
590.1,592.49,Jenny,I don't expect more.
593.14,597.16,Jenny,I just want so badly
593.14,597.16,Jenny,to make all this up to you.
597.33,600.13,Giles,I understand.
600.46,604.6,Giles,But I'm not the one
600.46,604.6,Giles,you need to make it up to.
607.04,609.82,Giles,Thank you for the book.
616.57,622.02,Joyce,OK... What's wrong?
620.04,621.68,Buffy,"No, it's nothing."
621.68,623.77,Joyce,"Come on, you can tell me anything,"
623.8,628.32,Joyce,I've read all the parenting books.
623.8,628.32,Joyce,You cannot surprise me.
631.92,633.84,Buffy,"Do you remember that guy, Angel?"
634.43,636.04,Joyce,"Angel? The, um..."
636.04,638.75,Joyce,The college boy
636.04,638.75,Joyce,who was tutoring you in... history?
638.79,640.49,Buffy,Right.
640.7,643.67,Buffy,He... I...
643.83,646.2,Buffy,"Oh, God. Um..."
646.97,648.52,Joyce,We're sort of dating.
648.52,649.84,Buffy,Were dating. Um...
650.11,653.83,Joyce,Going through a serious
650.11,653.83,Joyce,off again" phase right now.
654.1,658.16,Joyce,Don't tell me. He's changed?
654.1,658.16,Joyce,He's not the same guy you fell for?
658.19,660.52,Buffy,In a nutshell.
660.77,662.36,Buffy,"Aanyway, um..."
662.36,667.03,Buffy,"Since he... changed,"
662.36,667.03,Buffy,he's been kinda following me around.
667.04,669.32,Buffy,He's having trouble letting go.
669.32,671.38,Joyce,"Buffy, has he done anything?"
671.43,673.74,Buffy,"No! No, it's not like that."
673.77,676.5,Buffy,He's just been hanging around...
673.77,676.5,Buffy,A lot.
676.5,678.85,Buffy,"Just sending me notes,"
676.5,678.85,Buffy,that kind of thing.
678.89,680.9,Buffy,I just don't wanna see him right now.
680.93,684.99,Buffy,"I mean, If he shows up,"
680.93,684.99,Buffy,I'll talk to him. Just...
685.03,687.48,Buffy,don't invite him in.
687.52,689.45,Willow,I agree with Giles.
689.45,692.54,Willow,You need to just try
689.45,692.54,Willow,and not let him get to you.
692.58,696.76,Willow,Angel's only doing this to try
692.58,696.76,Willow,to get you to do something stupid.
697.1,700.08,Willow,"I swear, men can be"
697.1,700.08,Willow,such jerks sometimes.
700.08,702.11,Willow,Dead or alive.
702.15,704.85,Buffy,I just hope Giles
702.15,704.85,Buffy,"can find a keepout spell soon,"
704.89,707.64,Buffy,I know I'll sleep easier
704.89,707.64,Buffy,when I can...
707.67,709.28,Buffy,sleep easier.
709.31,712.38,Willow,I'm sure he will.
709.31,712.38,Willow,"He's, like, Book Man."
712.41,716.71,Willow,"Until then, try"
712.41,716.71,Willow,and keep happy thoughts and...
719.27,721.64,Buffy,And what?
721.68,723.72,Buffy,Willow?
725.34,727.89,Buffy,Willow?
738.71,740.62,Willow,"Thanks for having me over, Buffy."
740.62,742.9,Willow,Especially on a school night and all.
742.94,745.23,Buffy,No problem.
746.04,748.55,Buffy,"Hey, sorry about your fish."
748.58,750.25,Willow,"Oh, it's OK."
750.25,753.33,Willow,We hadn't really had time to bond yet.
754.19,756.05,Willow,"Although, for the first time,"
756.05,759.33,Willow,I'm glad my parents
756.05,759.33,Willow,didn't let me have a puppy.
761.39,763.79,Buffy,It's so weird.
763.82,766.26,Buffy,"Every time something like this happens,"
766.26,769.47,Buffy,my first instinct is still
766.26,769.47,Buffy,to run to Angel.
769.87,772.76,Buffy,I can't believe it's the same person.
772.76,775.51,Buffy,He's completely different
772.76,775.51,Buffy,from the guy that I knew.
775.55,778.42,Willow,"Well, sort of, except..."
778.46,780.57,Buffy,Except what?
781.56,785.58,Willow,You're still the only thing
781.56,785.58,Willow,he thinks about.
788.43,791.39,Drusilla,I brought something for you.
791.57,795.26,Drusilla,Poor thing. She's an orphan.
795.96,798.47,Drusilla,Her owner died...
798.5,803.02,Drusilla,without a fight.
801.04,802.81,Drusilla,Do you like her?
802.86,804.86,Drusilla,Mm?
805.36,808.2,Drusilla,I brought her especially for you.
808.2,810.74,Drusilla,To cheer you up.
810.78,812.95,Spike,And I've named her...
813.16,815.78,Drusilla,Sunshine.
817.28,819.59,Spike,Open wide.
821.67,822.47,Drusilla,"Come on, love."
822.47,823.91,Spike,You need to eat something
823.94,826.14,Spike,to keep your strength up.
826.17,828.2,Drusilla,Now...
828.21,829.85,Drusilla,Open up for Mommy!
829.85,832.32,Spike,I won't have you feeding me
832.36,834.42,Spike,"like a child, Dru!"
834.42,835.33,Angelus,Why not?
835.37,837.13,Angelus,"She already bathes you,"
837.13,840.12,Angelus,carries you around
837.13,840.12,Angelus,and changes you like a child.
840.16,843.03,Drusilla,"Why, Angel. Where have you been?"
843.06,846.81,Drusilla,The sun is almost up
843.06,846.81,Drusilla,and it can be so hurtful.
847.38,848.93,Drusilla,We were worried.
848.93,850.38,Spike,"No, we weren't."
850.52,854.28,Drusilla,You must forgive Spike.
850.52,854.28,Drusilla,He's just a bit testy tonight.
854.31,856.7,Drusilla,Doesn't get out much any more.
856.79,859.98,Angelus,"Well, maybe next time"
856.79,859.98,Angelus,"I'll bring you with me, Spike."
860.02,863.52,Angelus,It might be handy to have you around
860.02,863.52,Angelus,if I ever need a really good parking space.
863.56,866.94,Spike,Have you forgotten
863.56,866.94,Spike,you're a bloody guest in my bloody home?
866.97,871.42,Angelus,"And as a guest, if there's"
866.97,871.42,Angelus,"anything I can do for you,"
871.84,877.32,Angelus,any... responsibility I can assume
871.84,877.32,Angelus,while you're spinning your wheels...
878.74,881.59,Angelus,"Anything I'm not already doing, that is."
881.59,882.59,Spike,That's enough!
890.02,892.65,Drusilla,You two boys...
893.16,896.52,Drusilla,fighting over me and all...
896.56,899.69,Drusilla,makes a girl feel...
904.45,906.58,Spike,"Dru, what is it, pet?"
906.58,907.6,Drusilla,The air...
907.81,909.79,Drusilla,It worries.
909.83,914.48,Shopkeeper,"Someone... an old enemy,"
909.83,914.48,Shopkeeper,is seeking help.
914.52,918.38,Shopkeeper,Help to destroy our happy home.
918.68,921.17,Shopkeeper,Oh...
949.27,953.26,Shopkeeper,Welcome. How may I serve you today?
953.29,954.39,Jenny,Uh...
954.39,957.02,Shopkeeper,Love potion?
957.02,957.32,Shopkeeper,Perhaps a voodoo doll
957.02,957.32,Shopkeeper,for that unfaithful...
957.35,959.68,Jenny,I need an orb of Thesulah.
959.93,962,Shopkeeper,"Oh, you're in the trade!"
963.84,966.45,Shopkeeper,"Sorry about the spiel,"
963.84,966.45,Shopkeeper,but around Valentine's Day
966.48,969.3,Shopkeeper,I get a lot of tourists
966.48,969.3,Shopkeeper,shopping for love potions
969.33,972.55,Shopkeeper,and... mystical revenge
969.33,972.55,Shopkeeper,of past lovers.
972.7,976.1,Shopkeeper,"Sad fact is,"
972.7,976.1,Shopkeeper,Ouija boards and rabbits' feet 
976.1,979.23,Shopkeeper,that's what pay the rent around here.
980.42,983.88,Jenny,So how'd you hear about us?
980.42,983.88,Jenny,My Uncle Enyos told me about you.
983.92,985.94,Shopkeeper,"So you're Janna, then."
985.95,988.18,Shopkeeper,I'm sorry to hear about your uncle.
988.22,989.19,Jenny,Thank you.
989.19,991.43,Shopkeeper,He was a good customer.
991.91,994.68,Shopkeeper,"Well, no, there you go"
994.75,996.67,Shopkeeper,One Thesulan orb:
996.67,999.3,Shopkeeper,spirit vault
996.67,999.3,Shopkeeper,for the rituals of the undead.
999.33,1002.27,Jenny,I don't get many calls for those lately.
1002.31,1005.71,Shopkeeper,Sold a couple as
1002.31,1005.71,Shopkeeper,New Age paperweights last year.
1005.83,1008.19,Shopkeeper,"Yeah, I just love"
1005.83,1008.19,Shopkeeper,"those New Agers, boy."
1008.19,1012.1,Shopkeeper,They helped to...
1008.19,1012.1,Shopkeeper,send my youngest to college.
1012.1,1013.66,Shopkeeper,"By the way,"
1013.66,1018.15,Shopkeeper,you do know that the transliteration annals
1013.66,1018.15,Shopkeeper,for the Ritual of the Undead were lost?
1018.18,1020.65,Shopkeeper,"Without the annals,"
1018.18,1020.65,Shopkeeper,the surviving text is gibberish.
1020.69,1022.22,Jenny,"And without a translated text,"
1022.22,1025.03,Jenny,the orbs of Thesulah
1022.22,1025.03,Jenny,are pretty much useless.
1025.07,1026.3,Jenny,I know.
1026.34,1029.37,Shopkeeper,"Well, I only mentioned it because"
1026.34,1029.37,Shopkeeper,I have a strict policy of no refunds.
1029.41,1032.46,Jenny,It's OK.
1029.41,1032.46,Jenny,I'm working on a computer program
1032.67,1035.23,Jenny,to... translate
1032.67,1035.23,Jenny,the Rumanian liturgy to English
1035.23,1037.12,Shopkeeper,based on a random sampling
1035.23,1037.12,Shopkeeper,of the text.
1037.16,1039.4,Shopkeeper,Ugh! I don't like computers.
1039.44,1041.54,Shopkeeper,They give me the willies.
1041.54,1042.88,Jenny,"Well, thank you."
1042.92,1045.17,Shopkeeper,You're welcome.
1048.05,1051.91,Shopkeeper,By the way! Not that it's
1048.05,1051.91,Shopkeeper,"any of my business, really, but, uh..."
1051.95,1055.41,Shopkeeper,What are you planning on conjuring up
1051.95,1055.41,Shopkeeper,if you can decipher the text?
1055.45,1057.42,Jenny,A present for a friend of mine.
1057.42,1060.97,Shopkeeper,Really?
1057.42,1060.97,Shopkeeper,What are you gonna give him?
1062.31,1064.61,Jenny,His soul.
1070.5,1072.4,Buffy,"We'll be in hiding, probably..."
1072.4,1073.33,Willow,Where?
1073.33,1074.57,Buffy,Siberia.
1074.61,1077.34,Xander,"Well, good morning, ladies."
1074.61,1077.34,Xander,What did you two do last night?
1077.38,1081.49,Willow,We had kind of a "pyjama party
1077.38,1081.49,Willow,sleepover with weapons" thing.
1081.53,1084.24,Xander,"Oh, and I don't suppose either of you"
1081.53,1084.24,Xander,had the presence of mind
1084.28,1086.78,Xander,to locate a camera to...
1084.28,1086.78,Xander,capture the moment?
1086.86,1089.89,Willow,I have to go. I have a class to teach
1086.86,1089.89,Willow,in about five minutes
1089.92,1094.56,Willow,and I have to arrive early to glare
1089.92,1094.56,Willow,disapprovingly at the stragglers.
1094.6,1097.24,Buffy,"Oh, darn. She's here."
1097.9,1100.21,Willow,Five hours of lesson planning
1100.21,1102.21,Buffy,yesterday down the drain.
1103.57,1106.49,Buffy,You know what? I'll see you in class.
1110.38,1112.03,Buffy,Hey.
1112.03,1113.27,Jenny,Hi.
1114.77,1119.52,Jenny,"Uh, is there something...?"
1114.77,1119.52,Jenny,Did you want something?
1120.41,1124.21,Buffy,"Look, I know you feel badly"
1120.41,1124.21,Buffy,about what happened
1124.21,1127.17,Buffy,and I just wanted to say...
1129.12,1132.66,Buffy,Good. Keep it up.
1134.34,1136.57,Jenny,"Don't worry, I will."
1136.57,1138.25,Buffy,"Oh, wait. Um..."
1139.98,1142.54,Buffy,He misses you.
1142.58,1146.52,Buffy,"He doesn't say anything to me,"
1142.58,1146.52,Buffy,but I know he does.
1146.88,1149.67,Buffy,And I don't want him to be lonely.
1150.02,1152.15,Buffy,I don't want anyone to.
1152.52,1155.48,Jenny,"Buffy, you know that"
1152.52,1155.48,Jenny,if I have a chance
1155.52,1157.07,Jenny,to make this up...
1157.07,1158.45,Buffy,We're good here.
1158.49,1161.18,Buffy,Let's just leave it.
1164.64,1165.78,Giles,I put it here somewhere.
1165.78,1166.91,Buffy,"Oh, yes, yes. That's it."
1166.91,1170.54,Buffy,"Could you, uh, hang those up?"
1166.91,1170.54,Buffy,"Thank you, it's all."
1170.71,1171.62,Giles,Buffy. So...
1171.62,1173.3,Buffy,So how was your night?
1173.34,1176.04,Buffy,"Sleepless, but no human fatalities."
1176.08,1181.32,Giles,II found a ritual to revoke...
1176.08,1181.32,Giles,"the invitation to, to vampires."
1181.37,1184.38,Cordelia,"Oh, thank goodness! I actually had to"
1181.37,1184.38,Cordelia,talk my grandmother into
1184.38,1186.82,Cordelia,switching cars with me last night.
1187.34,1190.08,Giles,"Um, thethethe, uh,"
1187.34,1190.08,Giles,"the ritual's fairly basic, actually."
1190.08,1192.23,Giles,It's just the recitation
1190.08,1192.23,Giles,of a few rhyming couplets
1192.27,1196.08,Giles,"burning of, uh, moss herbs,"
1192.27,1196.08,Giles,sprinkling of holy water...
1196.11,1197.82,Buffy,All stuff I have in my house.
1197.82,1198.88,Giles,Hanging crosses...
1202.07,1205.13,Willow,I'm gonna have a hard time
1202.07,1205.13,Willow,explaining this to my dad.
1205.16,1206.98,Buffy,You really think it'll bother him?
1207.02,1213.02,Willow,Ira Rosenberg's only daughter
1207.02,1213.02,Willow,nailing crucifixes to her bedroom wall?
1211.04,1213.3,Willow,I have to go over
1211.04,1213.3,Willow,to Xander's house just to watch
1213.34,1215.28,Willow,A Charlie Brown Christmas' every year.
1215.32,1216.35,Buffy,I see your point.
1216.35,1217.87,Willow,Although it is worthwhile
1217.9,1221.12,Willow,to see him do the Snoopy Dance!
1222.13,1226.48,Cordelia,"Willow, are you aware that"
1222.13,1226.48,Cordelia,there are no fish in your aquarium?
1227.62,1229.62,Buffy,"You know, Cordelia,"
1227.62,1229.62,Buffy,we've already done your car.
1229.66,1231.56,Buffy,"Call it a night, if you want."
1231.56,1232.48,Cordelia,Right. Thanks.
1232.96,1236.56,Cordelia,And you know I'd do the same for you
1232.96,1236.56,Cordelia,if you had a social life.
1237.16,1240.44,Cordelia,Oh! This must be for you.
1248.24,1250.9,Willow,It's for you.
1254.28,1255.83,Buffy,Mom.
1267.45,1269.92,Angelus,"Mrs. Summers, I need to talk to you."
1271.21,1273.06,Joyce,You're Angel.
1274.35,1276.27,Angelus,Did Buffy tell you about us?
1276.27,1278.74,Joyce,She told me she wants you
1276.27,1278.74,Joyce,to leave her alone.
1278.78,1281.34,Angelus,"Oh, I can't. I can't do that."
1281.34,1283.02,Joyce,You're scaring her.
1283.13,1284.97,Angelus,You have to help me.
1287.02,1289.85,Joyce,"Joyce, I need to be with her. You can"
1287.02,1289.85,Joyce,convince her. You have to convince her.
1290.03,1292.41,Joyce,"Look, I'm telling you to leave her alone."
1292.54,1296.13,Angelus,"You have to talk to her for me, Joyce."
1292.54,1296.13,Angelus,Tell her I need her.
1296.16,1299.37,Joyce,"Please, look,"
1296.16,1299.37,Joyce,"II just want to get inside, OK?"
1301.94,1304.83,Angelus,"You don't understand, Joyce."
1305.44,1309.51,Angelus,I'll die without Buffy.
1305.44,1309.51,Angelus,She'll die without me.
1309.56,1311.38,Joyce,Are you threatening her?
1311.38,1314.11,Angelus,Please! Why is she doing this to me?
1314.19,1317.02,Joyce,"I'm calling the police, now."
1325.17,1329.89,Angelus,I haven't been able to sleep
1325.17,1329.89,Angelus,since the night we made love.
1330.29,1332.48,Angelus,I need her.
1332.49,1335.43,Angelus,I know you understand.
1335.47,1338.35,Joyce,Just leave us alone.
1338.97,1344.5,Willow,His verbis consensus rescissus est.'
1338.97,1344.5,Willow,
1345.84,1349.94,Buffy,"Sorry, Angel. Changed the locks."
1358.69,1360.24,Giles,Hello?
1360.24,1361.02,Jenny,Oh!
1361.49,1363.23,Jenny,Hey.
1363.37,1366.38,Giles,You're... working late?
1366.38,1368.47,Jenny,Special project.
1370.17,1372.53,Jenny,I spoke to Buffy today.
1372.53,1372.84,Giles,Oh!
1374.03,1376.07,Giles,Yes?
1376.96,1379.14,Jenny,She said you missed me.
1379.47,1382.78,Giles,"Well, uh, she's... a meddlesome girl."
1383.24,1385.51,Jenny,Rupert...
1385.74,1387.5,Jenny,"OK, I don't want to"
1385.74,1387.5,Jenny,"say anything if I'm wrong,"
1387.5,1389.83,Jenny,but I may have some news.
1389.87,1392.56,Jenny,"You know, I need to finish up here."
1392.56,1394.25,Giles,Could I see you later?
1394.52,1397.08,Giles,"Yes, yes..."
1397.11,1399.91,Giles,You could stop by my house.
1400.17,1402.7,Jenny,OK.
1403.73,1405.77,Giles,Good.
1426.51,1430.21,Shopkeeper,"Sorry, honey. We're closed."
1434.03,1435.1,Shopkeeper,What do you want?
1435.1,1436.35,Drusilla,"Miss Sunshine, here,"
1436.35,1439.18,Drusilla,tells me you had a visitor today.
1439.21,1442.11,Drusilla,But she worries.
1442.34,1447.07,Drusilla,She wants to know what you
1442.34,1447.07,Drusilla,and the mean teacher talked about.
1454.73,1457.7,Jenny,Come on. Come on.
1461.62,1463.46,Jenny,That's it.
1465.61,1469.97,Jenny,It's gonna work! This... will work.
1488.39,1490.51,Jenny,Angel.
1491.1,1493,Jenny,How did you get in here?
1493,1494.11,Angelus,I was invited.
1496.12,1498.92,Angelus,The sign in front of the school:
1499.25,1503.48,Angelus,"Formatia trans sicere educatorum, """
1503.64,1506.53,Jenny,Enter all ye who seek knowledge."
1507.73,1511.08,Angelus,What can I say?
1507.73,1511.08,Angelus,I'm a knowledge seeker.
1511.49,1513.37,Jenny,"Angel, I've got good news."
1513.41,1517.91,Angelus,I heard. You went shopping at
1513.41,1517.91,Angelus,the local boogedyboogedy store.
1524.96,1527.38,Angelus,The orb of Thesulah.
1527.9,1535.02,Angelus,"If memory serves, this is supposed"
1527.9,1535.02,Angelus,to summon a person's soul...
1533.04,1535.8,Angelus,From the ether...
1536.05,1540.04,Angelus,Store it until it can be transferred.
1542.95,1546.04,Angelus,You know what I hate most
1542.95,1546.04,Angelus,about these things?
1549.85,1552.16,Angelus,They're so damn fragile.
1552.16,1555.8,Angelus,"Must be that shoddy,"
1552.16,1555.8,Angelus,"gypsy craftsmanship, huh?"
1559.88,1562.61,Angelus,I never seize to be amazed
1559.88,1562.61,Angelus,how much the world has changed
1562.61,1564.89,Angelus,in just two and a half centuries.
1564.9,1566.72,Angelus,It's a miracle to me.
1566.72,1571.39,Angelus,Youyou put the secrets
1566.72,1571.39,Angelus,to restoring my soul... here!
1573.91,1577.04,Angelus,It comes out here!
1580.38,1583.2,Angelus,The Ritual of Restoration."
1583.71,1586.84,Angelus,Wow. This... This brings back memories.
1586.87,1589.2,Jenny,"Wait, that's your..."
1589.2,1590.59,Angelus,"Oh, my cure?"
1590.64,1594.16,Angelus,"No, thanks. Been there, done that..."
1594.37,1597.32,Angelus,Déja vu just isn't what it used to be.
1597.54,1601.45,Angelus,"Boy, isn't this my lucky day?"
1601.7,1603.78,Angelus,The computer...
1604.11,1606.62,Angelus,and the pages.
1608.6,1611.4,Angelus,Looks like I get to kill two birds...
1611.93,1614.44,Angelus,with one stone.
1617.28,1620.54,Angelus,The teacher... makes... three.
1630.35,1634.4,Angelus,"Oh, good."
1630.35,1634.4,Angelus,I need to work up an appetite first.
1716.29,1720.15,Angelus,"Sorry, Jenny. This is where you get off."
1726.09,1729.3,Angelus,I never get tired of doing that.
1738.62,1740.52,Giles,Willow. Good evening.
1740.52,1741.87,Willow,Hi. Come on in.
1742.78,1744.34,Willow,Here's the book.
1744.34,1744.93,Giles,Right.
1744.93,1749.02,Giles,"Guess, I should"
1744.93,1749.02,Giles,do my apartment tonight.
1747.04,1748.61,Giles,The ritual go all right?
1748.61,1750.12,Willow,"Oh, yeah, it went fine."
1750.16,1752.71,Willow,"Well, it went fine"
1750.16,1752.71,Willow,until Angel showed up
1752.71,1755.87,Willow,and told Buffy's mom
1752.71,1755.87,Willow,that he and Buffy had...
1755.94,1758.03,Willow,"Well, you know."
1758.06,1761.81,Willow,That they had... you know.
1761.84,1764.29,Willow,"You do... know, right?"
1764.29,1766.51,Giles,"Oh! Yes, yes, sorry."
1766.54,1768.97,Willow,"Oh, good. 'Cause I just realized that,"
1768.98,1774.02,Willow,"being a librarian and all,"
1768.98,1774.02,Willow,you... maybe didn't know.
1772.07,1774.08,Giles,"No, thank you. I got it."
1774.12,1778.29,Willow,"You would've been proud of her, though."
1774.12,1778.29,Willow,She totally kept her cool.
1781.16,1787.02,Willow,"OK, well, I'll tell Buffy you stopped by."
1785.66,1788.25,Giles,"Would you, um... Perhaps I should, uh,"
1788.25,1791.76,Giles,"intervene on, on Buffy's behalf"
1788.25,1791.76,Giles,wwwith her mother?
1791.8,1794.2,Giles,Maybe... say something?
1794.23,1797.46,Willow,"Sure. Like, what would you say?"
1798.49,1802.29,Giles,W... Uh...
1803.78,1806.93,Giles,You will tell Buffy I dropped by?
1806.93,1807.69,Willow,You bet.
1809.64,1812.56,Buffy,That stuff with the...
1809.64,1812.56,Buffy,"Latin and the herbs, uh,"
1812.56,1815.18,Buffy,he's just real superstitious.
1815.99,1818.14,Joyce,Oh.
1819.67,1821.35,Buffy,We just thought if...
1821.35,1822.71,Joyce,Was he the first?
1822.74,1827.43,Joyce,"No, wait. I don't wanna know."
1822.74,1827.43,Joyce,I don't think I want to.
1827.62,1830.76,Buffy,"Yeah, he was the first."
1830.96,1832.88,Buffy,"I mean, the only."
1833.13,1835.72,Joyce,He's older than you.
1835.72,1836.62,Buffy,I know.
1837.03,1839.19,Joyce,"Too old, Buffy."
1839.19,1841.76,Joyce,And he's obviously not very stable.
1841.79,1843.99,Joyce,I really wish...
1846.64,1850.21,Joyce,I just thought you would
1846.64,1850.21,Joyce,show more judgment.
1852.28,1854.73,Buffy,He wasn't like this before.
1855.42,1858.98,Joyce,Are you in love with him?
1859.01,1859.71,Buffy,I was.
1859.71,1861.69,Joyce,Were you careful?
1861.72,1863.02,Buffy,"Mom, this is no time..."
1863.02,1864.27,Joyce,"Don't ""Mom"" me, Buffy!"
1864.3,1866.57,Joyce,You don't get to get out of this.
1864.3,1866.57,Joyce,You had sex with a boy
1866.57,1869.91,Joyce,you didn't even see fit
1866.57,1869.91,Joyce,to tell me you were dating.
1870.89,1871.74,Buffy,I made a mistake.
1871.74,1873.48,Joyce,"Yeah, well, don't you just say that"
1873.52,1875.43,Joyce,"to shut me up,"
1873.52,1875.43,Joyce,because I think you really did.
1875.47,1877.84,Buffy,I know that!
1879.25,1882.31,Buffy,I can't tell you everything!
1882.31,1884.39,Joyce,How about anything?
1884.43,1887.69,Joyce,"Buffy, you can shut me out of your life,"
1884.43,1887.69,Joyce,I am pretty much used to that.
1887.72,1890.38,Joyce,But don't expect me
1887.72,1890.38,Joyce,"to ever stop caring about you,"
1890.41,1892.88,Joyce,because it's never gonna happen.
1892.91,1896.85,Joyce,I love you
1892.91,1896.85,Joyce,more than anything in the world.
1900.9,1903.19,Joyce,"That would be your cue to, uh..."
1903.19,1906.48,Joyce,roll your eyes
1903.19,1906.48,Joyce,and tell me I'm grossing you out.
1908.32,1911.3,Buffy,You're not.
1915.42,1917.46,Joyce,"Oh, well..."
1918.55,1921.11,Joyce,I guess that was "the talk".
1922.32,1924.64,Buffy,So how'd it go?
1926.08,1929.14,Joyce,I don't know. It was my first.
1953.97,1956.01,Giles,Hello?
1959.52,1961.36,Giles,Jenny?
1967.67,1970.2,Giles,It's me!
1970.23,1974.04,Officer,i># Sei mia</i>
1974.08,1977.24,Officer,i># V'aspettan gli amici</i>
1977.7,1982.34,Officer,i># Già mi mandi via?</i>
1983.35,1986.65,Officer,"i># Vorrei dir, ma non oso</i>"
1987.11,1988.95,Giles,i># Di'!</i>
1994.64,1998.57,Officer,i># O soave fanciulla</i>
1999.03,2002.12,Officer,i># O dolce viso</i>

2034.77,2036.65,Officer,i># Le dolcezze estreme</i>
2036.69,2042.55,Officer,"i># Tu sol comandi, amor!</i>"
2050.45,2052.75,Officer,"Mr. Giles, I need to ask you"
2050.45,2052.75,Officer,to come with us.
2052.96,2056.37,Officer,Just to... answer a few questions.
2057.68,2060.33,Cordelia,Of course.
2060.81,2062.95,,Yes.
2063.42,2066.28,,Procedure.
2069.89,2072.4,,"I need to make a phone call,"
2072.43,2075.25,,if that's all right?
2083.06,2086.49,,Passion is the source
2083.06,2086.49,,of our finest moments:
2086.62,2088.73,,the joy of love...
2088.77,2091.3,,the clarity of hatred...
2091.34,2095.71,,and the ecstasy of grief...
2104.41,2106.25,Willow,Giles?
2119.48,2121.38,Giles,Hello?
2124.48,2127.27,Giles,Really? No...
2128.24,2130.08,Willow,No...
2131.37,2133.21,Willow,No!
2147.05,2148.51,Buffy,Where's Giles?
2148.51,2149.34,Xander,No luck.
2149.38,2150.54,Xander,"By the time we got to the station,"
2150.54,2151.6,Buffy,the cops said he'd already left
2151.61,2153.81,Xander,I guess they just wanted
2151.61,2153.81,Xander,to ask him some questions.
2153.85,2155.87,Buffy,"Cordelia, will you"
2153.85,2155.87,Buffy,drive us to Giles' house?
2155.87,2156.83,Cordelia,Of course.
2156.87,2159.31,,But don't you think
2156.87,2159.31,,he wants to be left alone?
2159.34,2161.3,,I'm not worried about what he wants.
2161.3,2164.58,,I'm worried about what he's gonna do.
2206.16,2207.93,Giles,Hello?
2209.98,2211.74,Willow,Giles?
2230.36,2231.64,Willow,I guess Giles had
2231.64,2233.75,Xander,a big night planned tonight.
2233.78,2236.08,Buffy,Giles didn't set this up.
2236.12,2237.98,Buffy,Angel did.
2238.02,2241.26,Buffy,This is the wrapping for the gift.
2241.93,2244.33,Xander,"Oh, man."
2244.89,2247.58,Xander,Poor Giles.
2249,2251.23,Willow,"Look, all his weapons are gone."
2251.23,2253.26,Cordelia,But I thought
2251.23,2253.26,Cordelia,he kept his weapons at the library.
2253.3,2255.8,Xander,"No, those are his, uh,"
2253.3,2255.8,Xander,everyday weapons.
2255.83,2259.04,Xander,These were his good weapons.
2255.83,2259.04,Xander,"The ones he, uh..."
2259.04,2261.33,Xander,breaks out when company comes to visit.
2261.91,2263.2,Willow,So he's not here?
2263.2,2264.95,Cordelia,"Well, then where is he?"
2264.98,2267.1,Buffy,He'll go to wherever Angel is.
2267.1,2269.22,Willow,"That means the factory, right?"
2269.26,2271.44,Cordelia,So Giles is gonna try to kill Angel then.
2271.44,2273.71,Xander,"Well, it's about time somebody did."
2273.71,2274.16,Willow,Xander!
2274.19,2276.06,Xander,"I'm sorry, but let's not forget"
2274.19,2276.06,Xander,that I hated Angel
2276.06,2277.88,Xander,"long before you, guys,"
2276.06,2277.88,Xander,jumped on the bandwagon.
2277.92,2279.44,Xander,So I think I deserve a little something
2279.44,2281.6,Xander,for not saying
2279.44,2281.6,Xander,I told you so' long before now.
2281.64,2285.37,Xander,"And if Giles wants to go after the, uh..."
2281.64,2285.37,Xander,"fiend that murdered his girlfriend,"
2285.41,2288.09,Xander,"I say 'Faster, pussycat. Kill, kill!'"
2288.13,2289.54,Buffy,You're right.
2289.54,2290.62,Xander,Thank you.
2290.66,2293.77,Buffy,There's only one thing wrong
2290.66,2293.77,Buffy,with Giles' little revenge scenario.
2293.81,2295.18,Xander,And what's that?
2295.18,2297.41,Buffy,It's gonna get him killed.
2297.85,2300.36,Spike,Are you insane?
2300.4,2305.88,Spike,"We're supposed to kill the bitch,"
2300.4,2305.88,Spike,not leave gag gifts in her friends' beds.
2305.91,2311.17,Drusilla,"But, Spike, the bad teacher"
2305.91,2311.17,Drusilla,was going to restore Angel's soul.
2311.2,2313.5,Spike,"What if she did? If you ask me,"
2313.53,2316.66,Spike,I find myself preferring
2313.53,2316.66,Spike,the old Buffywhipped Angelus.
2316.69,2318.96,Spike,"Cause this new, improved one"
2318.96,2321.55,Angelus,is not playing with a full sack.
2321.58,2322.97,Angelus,I love a good slaughter
2322.97,2324.55,Spike,"as much as the next bloke,"
2324.58,2329.35,Spike,but his little pranks will only leave us
2324.58,2329.35,Spike,with one incredibly brassedoff Slayer!
2329.38,2333.8,Angelus,"Don't worry, Roller Boy."
2329.38,2333.8,Angelus,I've got everything under control.
2347.45,2349.75,Angelus,"Jeez, whatever happened"
2347.45,2349.75,Angelus,to wooden stakes?
2349.78,2354.32,Spike,Uhuh. No fair going into the ring
2349.78,2354.32,Spike,unless he tags you first.
2365.8,2367.83,Angelus,All right. You've had your fun.
2367.87,2370.29,Angelus,But you know what it's time for now?
2372.37,2374.44,Buffy,My fun!
2419.33,2422.28,Angelus,Gonna let your old man just burn?
2443.46,2446.26,Giles,Why did you come here?
2443.46,2446.26,Giles,This wasn't your fight!
2448.4,2451.49,Buffy,Are you trying to get yourself killed?
2456.16,2458.09,Buffy,You can't leave me.
2458.09,2461.81,Buffy,I can't do this alone.
2466.85,2469.8,Angelus,It hurts sometimes
2466.85,2469.8,Angelus,more than we can bear.
2469.84,2475.84,Angelus,"If we could live without passion,"
2469.84,2475.84,Angelus,maybe we'd know some kind of peace...
2475.88,2478.65,Angelus,but we would be hollow:
2478.69,2480.77,Angelus,empty rooms...
2480.77,2483.59,Angelus,shuttered and dank...
2483.62,2486.14,Angelus,Without passion...
2486.57,2489.86,Angelus,we'd be truly dead.
2499.45,2503.51,Giles,In my years as... Watcher...
2504.06,2507.84,Giles,I've buried... too many people.
2508.07,2511.83,Giles,But Jenny was the first I've loved.
2512.34,2514.99,Buffy,I'm sorry.
2515.23,2519.21,Buffy,I'm sorry I couldn't kill him for you...
2519.25,2521.3,Buffy,For her...
2521.33,2524.37,Buffy,When I had the chance.
2528.77,2531.26,Buffy,I wasn't ready.
2533.05,2536.85,Buffy,But I think I finally am.
2537.38,2539.17,,Hi.
2539.51,2543.41,,Principal Snyder asked me
