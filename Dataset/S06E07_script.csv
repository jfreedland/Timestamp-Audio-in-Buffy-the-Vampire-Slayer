2.08,3.72,,Previously:
2.08,3.72,,I love you.
3.84,4.83,,"Oh, my God."
4.96,8.16,,Here lies the warrior of the people.
4.96,8.16,,Let her cross over!
9.6,11.24,,I think I was in Heaven.
11.36,15.35,,I was torn out of there by my friends.
11.36,15.35,,They can never know.
15.48,19.08,,We can't ignore this behaviour.
15.48,19.08,,Something needs to be done.
19.2,21.08,BUFFY,I'm glad you're here to take care of it.
21.2,23.08,XANDER,We're getting married.
23.2,24.95,TARA,"Willow, you're using too much magic."
25.08,26.58,TARA,Can we not do this now?
26.58,28.15,WILLOW,Forget it ever happened.
28.28,29.68,WILLOW,Forget.

129.64,132.03,BUFFY,"Every single night, the same arrangement"
132.16,134.59,BUFFY,I go out and fight the fight
134.72,137.08,BUFFY,Still I always feel the strange estrangement
137.2,139.67,BUFFY,"Nothing here is real, nothing here is right"
139.8,142,BUFFY,I've been making shows of trading blows
142.12,144.19,BUFFY,Just hoping no one knows
144.32,147.31,BUFFY,That I've been going through the motions
147.44,149.87,BUFFY,Walking through the part
152.02,155.12,BUFFY,Nothing seems to penetrate my heart
155.24,157.6,BUFFY,"I was always brave, and kind of righteous"
157.72,160.15,BUFFY,Now I find I'm wavering
160.28,162.75,BUFFY,"Crawl out of your grave,"
160.28,162.75,BUFFY,You'll find this fight just
162.88,165.87,BUFFY,Doesn't mean a thing
162.88,165.87,BUFFY,She ain't got that swing
167.28,168.4,BUFFY,Thanks for noticing
168.52,172.56,BUFFY,"She does pretty well with fiends from Hell,"
168.52,172.56,BUFFY,but lately we can tell
172.68,174.89,BUFFY,That she's just going through the motions
174.89,176.23,VAMPS AND DEMON,Going through the motions
176.36,178.48,VAMP 2,Faking it somehow
178.6,183.12,DEMON,She's not even half the girl she... Ow!
183.96,186.32,DEMON,Will I stay this way for ever?
186.44,188.95,DEMON,Sleepwalk through my life's endeavour?
189.08,191.44,DEMON,How can I repay...
189.08,191.44,DEMON,Whatever
191.56,194.52,DEMON,I don't want to be
195.44,197.91,DEMON,Going through the motions
198.04,200.43,DEMON,Losing all my drive
200.56,202.71,DEMON,I can't even see
202.84,205.31,DEMON,If this is really me
205.44,208.8,DEMON,And I just want to be
208.92,214.84,BUFFY,Alive
223.08,224.37,GILES,"Good morning, Buffy!"
224.37,226.76,WILLOW,Did Dawn get off to school all right?
226.88,229.6,BUFFY,"What? Oh, yeah. I think so."
233.02,233.39,XANDER,Respect the cruller. And tame the doughnut!
233.52,235.48,ANYA,"That's still funny, sweetie."
235.6,238.27,BUFFY,"So, uh, no research?"
238.4,241.23,BUFFY,Nothing goin' on? Monsters or whatnot?
242.36,244.32,BUFFY,Good. Good.
245.44,247.4,BUFFY,"So, did anybody..."
248.92,251.59,BUFFY,"last night, you know, did anybody..."
252.56,254.68,BUFFY,burst into song?
255.68,257.64,XANDER,Merciful Zeus!
257.76,259.09,WILLOW,We thought it was just us!
259.09,260.67,GILES,I had my guitar at the hotel...
260.8,262.71,TARA,"We were talking, then it was like..."
262.71,263.87,BUFFY,You were in a musical.
266.02,268.15,GILES,That explains the huge backing orchestra
266.02,268.15,GILES,and the dancing roomservice chaps.
268.28,271.48,WILLOW,"We argued, then it rhymed..."
268.28,271.48,WILLOW,An entire verse about couscous.
271.6,273.3,XANDER,It was very disturbing.
273.3,275.07,GILES,What did you sing about?
275.2,278.72,BUFFY,I don't remember.
275.2,278.72,BUFFY,But it seemed perfectly normal.
278.84,281.88,XANDER,But disturbing. Not natural.
278.84,281.88,XANDER,Do you think it'll happen again?
284.02,283.67,GILES,We should look into it.
283.8,284.68,WILLOW,With the books.
284.68,286.39,TARA,Do we have any books on this?
286.52,290.12,XANDER,We break it down. Look at the factors
286.52,290.12,XANDER,before it happens again. I for one...
290.24,292.6,Song,I've got a theory
290.24,292.6,Song,That it's a demon
292.72,295.11,Song,A dancing demon
292.72,295.11,Song,"No, something isn't right there"
295.24,297.71,Song,I've got a theory
295.24,297.71,Song,Some kid is dreaming
297.84,300.2,Song,And we're all stuck inside
297.84,300.2,Song,his wacky Broadway nightmare
300.32,305.24,Song,I've got a theory we should work this out
305.36,310.72,Song,It's getting eerie
305.36,310.72,Song,What's this cheery singing all about?
311.6,313.99,Song,It could be witches!
311.6,313.99,Song,Some evil witches
314.12,316.19,Song,Which is ridiculous
314.12,316.19,Song,cos witches they were persecuted
316.32,319.76,Song,Wicca good and love the Earth
316.32,319.76,Song,and women power and I'll be over here
319.88,322.39,Song,I've got a theory
319.88,322.39,Song,It could be bunnies
324.64,326.55,Song,I've got a...
324.64,326.55,Song,Bunnies aren't just cute
326.68,329.91,Song,Like everybody supposes
330.2,334.4,Song,They got them hoppy legs
330.2,334.4,Song,and twitchy little noses
334.52,336.8,Song,And what's with all the carrots?
336.92,341.87,Song,What do they need
336.92,341.87,Song,such good eyesight for anyway?
344.02,342.96,Song,Bunnies!
343.08,346.2,Song,Bunnies! It must be bunnies!
349.92,355.07,Song,Or maybe midgets
349.92,355.07,Song,I've got a theory we should work this fast
356.28,360.96,Song,Because it clearly
356.28,360.96,Song,could get serious before it's passed
362.6,364.94,Song,I've got a theory
364.94,367.28,GILES,It doesn't matter
367.96,372.4,ALL,What can't we face if we're together?
372.84,376.8,ALL,What's in this place that we can't weather?
376.92,379.28,,Apocalypse?
379.4,381.63,,We've all been there
381.76,383.72,,The same old trips
383.84,386.8,,Why should we care?
387.6,391.88,,What can't we do if we get in it?
392.32,396.11,,We'll work it through within a minute
396.24,398.31,,We have to try
398.44,400.72,,We'll pay the price
401.04,403.16,,It's do or die
403.28,406.59,,"Hey, I've died twice"
406.72,409.83,ALL,What can't we face if we're together?
409.83,411.43,GILES,What can't we face?
411.56,414.16,ALL,What's in this place that we can't weather?
414.16,415.19,GILES,If we're together
415.32,418.95,ALL,There's nothing we can't face
419.68,422.11,ANYA,Except for bunnies
425.72,427.36,XANDER,"See, OK, that was disturbing."
427.36,428.6,WILLOW,I thought it was neat.
428.72,431.95,BUFFY,So what is it? What's causing it?
432.08,434.44,GILES,I thought it didn't matter.
434.56,437.31,BUFFY,"Well, I'm not quaking"
434.56,437.31,BUFFY,"in my stylishyetaffordable boots,"
437.44,439.87,BUFFY,but there's something unnatural going on.
442.02,443.88,BUFFY,And that doesn't usually lead
442.02,443.88,BUFFY,to hugs and puppies.
446.02,447.63,ANYA,"Well, is it just us?"
446.02,447.63,ANYA,"I mean, is it only happening to us?"
447.76,449.8,ANYA,Cos that would probably mean a spell.
453.2,454.92,DAVID,They got
455.04,457.24,DAVID,the mustard
457.36,463.28,DAVID,out!
457.36,463.28,DAVID,They got the mustard out!
468.84,470.96,BUFFY,It's not just us.
472.52,476.04,DAWN,"Oh, my God. You will never believe"
472.52,476.04,DAWN,what happened at school today.
476.16,479.71,BUFFY,Everybody started singing and dancing?
479.84,481.99,DAWN,I gave birth to a pterodactyl.
482.12,484.24,ANYA,"Oh, my God. Did it sing?"
484.8,486.44,DAWN,"So you guys too, huh?"
486.44,488.4,XANDER,So what'd you sing about?
489.24,490.8,DAWN,Math.
490.92,494.12,TARA,That's right! The volume. The text.
495.32,497.28,GILES,What text?
497.4,500.07,WILLOW,The volumey... text.
497.4,500.07,WILLOW,You know.
501.12,503.71,WILLOW,The mmummrfugh report.
503.84,505.56,XANDER,The what now?
505.68,509.59,TARA,There's a few volumes at the house
505.68,509.59,TARA,"about mystical chants, bacchanals."
509.72,510.78,TARA,Might be relevant.
510.78,511.79,WILLOW,"Yeah, we could..."
511.92,515.88,GILES,I'm a hair's breadth from investigating
511.92,515.88,GILES,"bunnies, so I'm open to anything."
518.02,519.36,WILLOW,Great. We'll check it out
518.02,519.36,WILLOW,and we'll give you a call.
519.48,522.39,TARA,"Yeah, this could blow"
519.48,522.39,TARA,the whole thing wide open.
522.96,524.92,TARA,Do we have any books at all at home?
525.04,527.92,WILLOW,Who wants to be cooped up
525.04,527.92,WILLOW,on a day like this?
528.04,533.48,WILLOW,"The sun is shining, there's songs going on,"
528.04,533.48,WILLOW,those guys are checking you out...
533.6,536.32,TARA,What? What are they looking at?
536.44,538.03,WILLOW,"The hotness of you, doofus."
538.03,540.15,TARA,Those boys really thought I was hot?
540.28,541.87,WILLOW,Entirely.
544.02,544.28,TARA,"Oh, my God. I'm cured!"
544.4,546.68,TARA,I want the boys!
546.8,550.68,WILLOW,Do I have to fight to keep you?
546.8,550.68,WILLOW,Cos I'm not large with the butch.
550.8,553.36,TARA,I'm just not used to that.
553.48,555.47,TARA,They were really looking at me?
555.6,558.72,WILLOW,And you can't imagine what they see in you?
558.84,561.35,TARA,I know exactly what they see in me.
561.48,563.07,TARA,You.
563.2,566.83,TARA,I lived my life in shadow
566.96,570.11,TARA,Never the sun on my face
571.4,574.84,TARA,It didn't seem so sad though
574.96,578.08,TARA,I figured that was my place
578.88,582.24,TARA,Now I'm bathed in light
585.02,586.07,TARA,Something just isn't right
589.02,589.72,Song,I'm under your spell
590.08,591.91,Song,How else could it be
592.04,594.68,Song,Anyone would notice me?
594.8,597.79,Song,"It's magic, I can tell"
597.92,599.72,Song,How you've set me free
599.84,602.83,Song,Brought me out so easily
603.36,606.64,Song,I saw a world enchanted
606.76,609.91,Song,Spirits and charms in the air
611.32,614.68,Song,I always took for granted
614.8,618,Song,I was the only one there
618.68,621.83,Song,But your power shone
622.84,626.63,Song,Brighter than any I've known
626.76,629.56,Song,I'm under your spell
629.68,631.64,Song,Nothing I can do
631.76,634.43,Song,You just took my soul with you
634.56,637.6,Song,You worked your charms so well
637.72,639.6,Song,"Finally, I knew"
639.72,642.03,Song,Everything I dreamed was true
642.16,648.11,Song,You make me believe
658.04,661.75,Song,The moon to the tide
662.2,665.48,Song,I can feel you inside
666.16,668.75,Song,I'm under your spell
668.88,670.95,TARA,Surging like the sea
671.08,673.64,TARA,Go to you so helplessly
673.76,676.88,TARA,I break with every swell
679.02,678.75,TARA,Lost in ecstasy
678.88,681.19,XANDER,Spread beneath my willow tree
681.32,683.31,XANDER,You make me
683.44,688.59,XANDER,Complete
692.48,696.23,XANDER,You make me complete
696.36,700.04,XANDER,You make me complete
700.44,701.51,XANDER,You make me...
701.88,703.78,XANDER,I bet they're not even working.
703.78,704.27,BUFFY,Who now?
704.4,709.08,XANDER,Willow and Tara. You see the way they were
704.4,709.08,XANDER,with each other? The getaroominess?
709.2,711.35,XANDER,I bet they're...
712.08,714.51,XANDER,Singing. They're probably singing right now.
714.64,716.87,GILES,I'm sure they're making every effort.
719.02,718.69,XANDER,"Oh, yeah."
718.69,718.43,BUFFY,Xander.
718.56,721.52,DAWN,"Buffy, it's OK. I do know about this stuff."
722.6,725.26,DAWN,"Besides, it's all kinda romantic."
725.26,726.31,BUFFY/XANDER,"No, it's not."
726.44,731.31,DAWN,"Come on! Songs, dancing around."
726.44,731.31,DAWN,What's gonna be wrong with that?
756.84,758.99,SWEET,That's entertainment.
764.12,766.48,XANDER VOICEOVER,"You want some breakfast, baby?"
766.6,768.31,ANYA,You don't have to go to work?
768.31,770.56,XANDER,"Nah, I shut the crew down for the day."
770.68,774.59,XANDER,"My guys start dancing around me,"
770.68,774.59,XANDER,I don't know if I can deal.
774.72,777.68,XANDER,"It's a flab thing. So, waffles?"
779.28,782.08,ANYA,Will you still make me waffles
779.28,782.08,ANYA,when we're married?
782.2,787.56,XANDER,"No, I'll only make them for myself, but"
782.2,787.56,XANDER,by California law you will own half of them.
788.72,791.6,XANDER,"Hey, how about omelettes?"
788.72,791.6,XANDER,I could do an omelette...
791.72,795.03,XANDER,This man that I plan to entangle
795.16,797.52,Song,Isn't he fine?
798.56,801.76,XANDER,My claim to fame
798.56,801.76,XANDER,was to maim and to mangle
801.88,804.95,XANDER,Vengeance was mine
805.08,808.28,XANDER,But I'm out of the biz
808.4,811.63,XANDER,"The name I made, I'll trade for his"
811.76,814.67,XANDER,The only trouble is...
815.44,817.72,Song,I'll never tell
819.72,822.52,Song,She is the one
819.72,822.52,Song,She's such wonderful fun
822.64,824.63,Song,Such passion and grace
826.36,829,Song,Warm in the night
826.36,829,Song,when I'm right in her tight
829.12,831.68,Song,"Embrace, tight embrace"
832.56,835.68,Song,I'll never let her go
835.8,838.87,Song,The love we've known can only grow
841.02,841.36,Song,There's just one thing that...
841.48,843.84,Song,"No, I'll never tell"
845.72,849.27,Xander opens the newspaper. The headline on the front page reads,Cos there's nothing to tell
853.12,854.68,Xander opens the newspaper. The headline on the front page reads,He snores
853.12,854.68,Xander opens the newspaper. The headline on the front page reads,She wheezes
854.8,856.47,Xander opens the newspaper. The headline on the front page reads,Say "housework" and he freezes
856.6,859.8,Xander opens the newspaper. The headline on the front page reads,She eats these skeezy cheeses
856.6,859.8,Xander opens the newspaper. The headline on the front page reads,that I can't describe
859.92,863.28,Xander opens the newspaper. The headline on the front page reads,"I talk, he breezes"
859.92,863.28,Xander opens the newspaper. The headline on the front page reads,She doesn't know what pleases
863.4,866.36,ANYA,His penis got diseases
863.4,866.36,ANYA,from a Chumash tribe
866.48,872.32,ANYA,The vibe gets kind of scary
873.28,876.56,ANYA,Like she thinks I'm ordinary
873.28,876.56,ANYA,Like it's all just temporary
876.68,880.04,ANYA,Like her toes are kind of hairy
876.68,880.04,ANYA,But it's all very well
880.16,882.59,ANYA,"Cos God knows, I'll never tell"
885.48,888.63,ANYA,"When things get rough, he"
885.48,888.63,ANYA,Just hides behind his Buffy
888.76,892.23,ANYA,"Now look, he's getting huffy"
888.76,892.23,ANYA,cos he knows that I know
892.36,895.56,ANYA,"She clings, she's needy"
892.36,895.56,ANYA,She's also really greedy
895.68,897.19,ANYA,She nev...
895.68,897.19,ANYA,His eyes are beady
897.32,899.23,ANYA,This is my verse! Hello!
897.32,899.23,ANYA,She...
901.36,903.72,ANYA,Look at me! I'm dancing crazy!
928.28,930.51,BOTH,You know...
930.64,934.39,BOTH,You're quite the charmer
930.64,934.39,BOTH,My knight in armour
934.52,937.56,BOTH,You're the cutest of the Scoobies
934.52,937.56,BOTH,With your lips as red as rubies
937.68,940.64,BOTH,And your firm yet supple... tight embrace!
953.44,955.27,BOTH,He's swell
953.44,955.27,BOTH,She's sweller
955.4,956.88,BOTH,He'll always be my fella
959.02,960.2,BOTH,That's why I'll never tell her
959.02,960.2,BOTH,that I'm petrified
960.64,964.24,BOTH,I've read this tale
960.64,964.24,BOTH,"There's wedding, then betrayal"
964.36,967.51,BOTH,I know that come the day
964.36,967.51,BOTH,I'll want to run and hide
967.64,970.03,BOTH,I lied
970.16,973.36,BOTH,I said it's easy
973.88,976.55,BOTH,I've tried
976.68,980.59,BOTH,But there's these fears I can't quell
980.72,983.79,BOTH,Is she looking for a pot of gold?
983.92,987.12,BOTH,Will I look good when I've gotten old?
987.24,990.44,BOTH,Will our lives become too stressful
987.24,990.44,BOTH,if I'm never that successful?
990.56,993.55,BOTH,When I get so worn and wrinkly
990.56,993.55,BOTH,that I look like David Brinkley
993.68,995.03,BOTH,Am I crazy?
993.68,995.03,BOTH,Am I dreaming?
995.16,996.56,BOTH,Am I marrying a demon?
996.68,999.75,BOTH,We could really raise the beam in
996.68,999.75,BOTH,making marriage a hell
999.88,1002.55,BOTH,"So, thank God, I'll never tell"
1002.68,1005.43,BOTH,I swear that I'll never tell
1006.84,1008.8,BOTH,My lips are sealed
1009.92,1012.04,BOTH,I take the Fifth
1012.16,1014.59,BOTH,"Nothin' to see, move it along"
1015.68,1017.75,BOTH,I'll never tell
1021.4,1022.88,BOTH,It's a nightmare. It's a plague.
1022.88,1024.36,ANYA,It's like we were being watched.
1024.56,1026.72,XANDER,I didn't wanna say things but they came out.
1026.72,1028.84,ANYA,Like a wall was missing from our apartment.
1028.96,1029.84,ANYA,My toes are not hairy!
1029.84,1030.71,XANDER,My eyes are not beady!
1030.84,1031.78,XANDER,You gotta stop it.
1031.78,1033.4,GILES,I am looking into some leads...
1033.52,1036.49,MARTI,"Of course, our number is a retro pastiche..."
1036.53,1038.39,ANYA,that's never going to be
1036.53,1038.39,ANYA,a breakaway pop hit.
1038.52,1042.83,MARTI,Gimme an axe. Show me where to point it.
1038.52,1042.83,MARTI,"As ever, it's not quite that simple."
1042.96,1046.67,MARTI,But I have learned some disturbing things...
1042.96,1046.67,MARTI,put that pad away
1046.8,1049.44,MARTI,"I'm asking you, please no"
1049.56,1052.63,MARTI,"It isn't right, it isn't fair"
1052.76,1055.64,MARTI,There was no parking anywhere
1055.76,1059.15,MARTI,I think that hydrant wasn't there
1059.28,1061.95,MARTI,Why can't you let it go?
1062.08,1064.22,MARTI,I think I've paid more than my share...
1064.22,1066.47,XANDER,Somebody set people on fire? That's nuts!
1066.6,1070.64,ANYA,I don't know. One more verse of our ditty
1066.6,1070.64,ANYA,and I'd have been looking for a gas can.
1070.76,1074.31,GILES,"Well, clearly emotions are running high."
1070.76,1074.31,GILES,But as far as I can tell
1074.44,1078.4,GILES,"these people burnt up from the inside,"
1074.44,1078.4,GILES,spontaneously combusted.
1078.52,1082.88,GILES,I've only seen the one. I examined the body
1078.52,1082.88,GILES,while the police were taking witness arias.
1085.02,1087.07,XANDER,"But we're sure the things are related, the"
1085.02,1087.07,XANDER,singing and dancing and burning and dying.
1087.2,1092.19,GILES,We're not sure of much. Buffy's looking
1087.2,1092.19,GILES,for leads at the local demon haunts.
1092.32,1097.27,GILES,"At least, in theory she is,"
1092.32,1097.27,GILES,but she doesn't seem to...
1097.4,1102.03,XANDER,She's easing back into it. We pulled her
1097.4,1102.03,XANDER,out of an untold Hell dimension.
1102.16,1106.12,XANDER,Ergo the weirdness.
1102.16,1106.12,XANDER,The important thing is to be there for her.
1107.28,1110.03,GILES,"I'm helping her as much as I can, but..."
1120.16,1122.23,SPIKE,The sun sets and she appears.
1123.68,1125.13,SPIKE,Come to serenade me?
1125.13,1127.15,BUFFY,So you know what's going on.
1127.28,1129.95,SPIKE,I've seen some damn funny things
1127.28,1129.95,SPIKE,the last two days.
1130.08,1134.39,SPIKE,A 600pound Chirago demon making like
1130.08,1134.39,SPIKE,"Yma Sumac, that one will stay with you."
1134.52,1137.51,SPIKE,"I remain immune, happy to say."
1137.64,1139.04,SPIKE,Drink?
1139.16,1141.23,BUFFY,A world of no.
1141.92,1143.88,BUFFY,So any idea what's causing this?
1145.32,1149.84,SPIKE,Oh. So that's all. You've just come
1145.32,1149.84,SPIKE,to pump me for information.
1149.96,1152.39,BUFFY,What else would I wanna pump you for?
1152.52,1154.8,BUFFY,"I really just said that, didn't I?"
1154.92,1159.36,SPIKE,"Yeah, well, don't wanna"
1154.92,1159.36,SPIKE,bore you with the small talk.
1160.44,1163.08,SPIKE,Don't know a thing.
1163.2,1165.53,BUFFY,What's up? You're all badmoody.
1165.53,1168.32,SPIKE,It's nothing. Glad you could stop by.
1169.48,1171.39,SPIKE,It's nothing!
1171.39,1172.12,BUFFY,What?
1173.56,1176.12,SPIKE,I died
1176.24,1178.83,SPIKE,So many years ago
1179.48,1182.12,SPIKE,But you can make me feel
1182.24,1184.67,SPIKE,Like it isn't so
1184.8,1186.92,SPIKE,And why you come to be with me
1187.4,1190.04,SPIKE,I think I finally know
1193.8,1198.4,SPIKE,You're scared
1193.8,1198.4,SPIKE,Ashamed of what you feel
1199.24,1201.67,SPIKE,And you can't tell the ones you love
1201.8,1204.27,SPIKE,You know they couldn't deal
1204.4,1206.79,SPIKE,Whisper in a dead man's ear
1206.92,1210.6,SPIKE,It doesn't make it real
1213.08,1217.23,SPIKE,That's great
1213.08,1217.23,SPIKE,But I don't wanna play
1217.96,1220.19,SPIKE,Cos bein' with you touches me
1220.32,1222.68,SPIKE,More than I can say
1222.8,1225.11,SPIKE,But since I'm only dead to you
1225.24,1228.39,SPIKE,I'm saying stay away
1228.52,1232.67,SPIKE,And let me rest in peace
1232.8,1234.76,SPIKE,Let me rest in peace
1234.88,1236.92,SPIKE,Let me get some sleep
1237.04,1239.47,SPIKE,Let me take my love and bury it
1239.6,1241.67,SPIKE,In a hole six foot deep
1241.8,1247.08,SPIKE,I can lay my body down
1241.8,1247.08,SPIKE,but I can't find my sweet release
1247.2,1251.08,SPIKE,So let me rest in peace
1251.6,1253.11,SPIKE,You know
1253.24,1255.96,SPIKE,You got a willing slave
1256.08,1258.23,SPIKE,And you just love to play the thought
1258.36,1260.4,SPIKE,That you might misbehave
1260.52,1262.4,SPIKE,But till you do I'm tellin' you
1262.52,1265.8,SPIKE,Stop visitin' my grave
1265.92,1269.8,SPIKE,And let me rest in peace
1269.92,1273.63,SPIKE,I know I should go
1274.4,1278.63,SPIKE,But I follow you like a man possessed
1278.76,1283.04,SPIKE,There's a traitor here beneath my breast
1283.16,1287.44,SPIKE,And it hurts me more
1283.16,1287.44,SPIKE,than you've ever guessed
1287.56,1291.76,SPIKE,If my heart could beat
1287.56,1291.76,SPIKE,it would break my chest
1291.88,1296.16,SPIKE,But I can see you're unimpressed
1296.28,1298.16,SPIKE,So leave me be
1298.28,1300.59,SPIKE,And let me rest in peace
1300.72,1302.71,SPIKE,Let me get some sleep
1302.84,1305.2,SPIKE,Let me take my love and bury it
1305.32,1307.52,SPIKE,In a hole six foot deep
1307.64,1313.16,SPIKE,I can lay my body down
1307.64,1313.16,SPIKE,but I can't find my sweet release
1313.28,1316.08,SPIKE,Let me rest in peace.
1316.2,1317.63,SPIKE,Why won't you
1317.76,1322.55,SPIKE,Let me rest in peace?
1330.52,1333.27,SPIKE,So you're not staying then?
1338.32,1340.45,TARA,Lot of homework?
1340.45,1341.12,DAWN,Math.
1341.24,1344.15,DAWN,It seemed cool
1341.24,1344.15,DAWN,when we were singing about it.
1344.28,1347.75,TARA,Willow said they have a lead
1344.28,1347.75,TARA,on the whole musicalextravaganza evil.
1347.88,1351.63,TARA,"This demon that can be summoned,"
1347.88,1351.63,TARA,some sort of lord of the dance.
1351.76,1353.91,TARA,But not the scary one. Just a demon.
1355.68,1357.13,DAWN,Do they know who summoned it?
1357.13,1358.64,TARA,They don't even know its name.
1358.76,1362.04,TARA,But Willow will find out.
1358.76,1362.04,TARA,She's a brainy type.
1362.88,1365.23,DAWN,I'm glad you guys made up.
1365.23,1365.68,TARA,What?
1365.8,1368.6,DAWN,That fight you guys had
1365.8,1368.6,DAWN,about magic and stuff?
1368.72,1371.92,DAWN,It gives me belly rumblings
1368.72,1371.92,DAWN,when you guys fight.
1372.04,1374.24,TARA,"Dawn, Willow and I never fought about..."
1374.36,1376.64,DAWN,It's OK. It's just...
1376.76,1381.47,DAWN,You guys are so great together.
1376.76,1381.47,DAWN,I just hate it when you...
1381.6,1384.83,DAWN,But that was the only fight
1381.6,1384.83,DAWN,I've seen you guys have anyway.
1384.96,1387.24,DAWN,But I'm still glad it's over.
1389.2,1390.84,TARA,"Dawn, I..."
1390.96,1394.64,TARA,There's something I need at the shop.
1390.96,1394.64,TARA,Will you be OK for a little while?
1394.76,1398.91,DAWN,Yes. The 15yearold can spend
1394.76,1398.91,DAWN,half an hour alone in her locked house.
1399.04,1401.19,TARA,I won't be gone long.
1434.08,1438.39,DAWN,Does anybody even notice?
1441.56,1445.92,DAWN,Does anybody even care?
1536.68,1538.32,SWEET,Why'd you run away?
1538.44,1542.12,SWEET,Don't you like my style?
1544.2,1546.03,SWEET,Why don't you come and play?
1546.16,1547.91,SWEET,I guarantee a
1548.04,1551.56,SWEET,Great big smile
1551.68,1555.04,SWEET,I come from the imagination
1555.16,1559.44,SWEET,And I'm here strictly by your invocation
1559.56,1561.39,SWEET,So whaddaya say?
1561.52,1564.27,SWEET,Why don't we dance awhile?
1567.24,1569.15,SWEET,I'm the heart of swing
1569.28,1572.83,SWEET,I'm the twist and shout
1574.84,1576.67,SWEET,When you gotta sing
1576.8,1579.19,SWEET,When you gotta
1579.32,1581.88,SWEET,Let it out
1584.02,1585.68,SWEET,You call me and I come arunnin'
1585.8,1588.23,SWEET,I turn the music on
1588.36,1590.08,SWEET,I bring the fun in
1590.2,1591.87,SWEET,Now we're partyin'
1594.02,1595.96,SWEET,That's what it's all about
1596.84,1598.88,SWEET,Cos I know
1601.02,1602.63,SWEET,"What you feel, girl"
1604.24,1605.96,SWEET,I know
1606.08,1611.63,SWEET,"Just what you feel, girl"
1611.96,1616.32,DAWN,"So you're, like, a good demon?"
1611.96,1616.32,DAWN,Bringin' the fun in?
1616.44,1617.95,DAWN,All these melodies
1618.08,1621.83,DAWN,They go on too long
1623.88,1625.76,DAWN,Then that energy
1625.88,1628.19,DAWN,Starts to come on
1628.32,1631.07,DAWN,Way too strong
1631.2,1635.27,DAWN,"All those hearts laid open, that must sting"
1635.4,1639,DAWN,Plus some customers just start combusting
1639.4,1641.23,DAWN,That's the penalty
1641.36,1644.56,DAWN,When life is but a song
1646.76,1650.23,DAWN,You brought me down
1646.76,1650.23,DAWN,and doomed this town
1650.36,1653.72,DAWN,So when we blow this scene
1654.44,1658.51,DAWN,Back we will go to my kingdom below
1658.64,1662.27,DAWN,And you will be my queen
1662.4,1665.52,DAWN,"Cos I know what you feel, girl"
1665.64,1669.08,DAWN,"No, you see, you and me"
1665.64,1669.08,DAWN,wouldn't be very regal
1669.2,1673.08,DAWN,"I'll make it real, girl"
1673.2,1677.27,DAWN,"What I mean, I'm fifteen"
1673.2,1677.27,DAWN,So this queen thing's illegal
1677.4,1681.03,DAWN,I can bring whole cities to ruin
1681.16,1684.68,DAWN,And still have time to get a softshoe in
1684.8,1688.79,DAWN,"Well, that's great, but I'm late"
1684.8,1688.79,DAWN,and I'd hate to delay her
1688.92,1692.44,DAWN,"Something's cookin', I'm at the griddle"
1692.8,1696.11,DAWN,I bought Nero his very first fiddle
1696.24,1700.28,DAWN,She'll get pissed if I'm missed
1696.24,1700.28,DAWN,"See, my sister's the Slayer"
1701.4,1703.79,SWEET,The Slayer?
1705.52,1708.83,SWEET,Find her. Tell her... tell her everything.
1708.96,1713.59,SWEET,Just get her here.
1708.96,1713.59,SWEET,I wanna see the Slayer burn.
1717.02,1717.15,SWEET,Now we're partyin'
1717.28,1721.24,SWEET,That's what it's all about
1724.08,1725.75,GILES,Good. Good.
1725.88,1729.32,BUFFY,"I feel like I should bow, or..."
1725.88,1729.32,BUFFY,"have honour, or something."
1729.44,1733.51,GILES,It may seem hokey but we need precision
1729.44,1733.51,GILES,and concentration as much as power.
1733.64,1735.37,GILES,We're not sure what we're facing.
1735.37,1736.68,BUFFY,"Oh, you'll figure it out."
1736.8,1741.08,BUFFY,I'm worried this session's gonna turn into
1736.8,1741.08,BUFFY,some training montage from an '80s movie.
1741.2,1744.2,GILES,"Well, if we hear any"
1741.2,1744.2,GILES,"inspirational power chords,"
1744.24,1746.72,GILES,we'll just lie down until they go away.
1746.84,1750.75,GILES,"Anyway, I don't think we need"
1746.84,1750.75,GILES,to work that much on your strength.
1750.88,1753.63,BUFFY,"Yeah, I'm pretty spry for a corpse."
1755.96,1759.64,GILES,Have you spoken to Dawn
1755.96,1759.64,GILES,about that incident at Hallowe'en?
1762.4,1764.44,BUFFY,I thought you took care of that.
1765.28,1765.77,GILES,Right.
1765.77,1768.08,BUFFY,What would I do without you?
1770.08,1772.55,BUFFY,OK. I'm ready.
1773.8,1778.24,GILES,You're not ready for the world outside
1779.44,1784.2,GILES,"You keep pretending, but you just can't hide"
1785.08,1789.84,GILES,I know I said that I'd be
1785.08,1789.84,GILES,standing by your side
1789.96,1792.32,GILES,But I...
1796.32,1800.6,GILES,Your path's unbeaten and it's all uphill
1802.16,1806.71,GILES,"And you can meet it, but you never will"
1807.92,1811.91,GILES,And I'm the reason
1807.92,1811.91,GILES,that you're standing still
1812.88,1815.24,GILES,But I...
1817.36,1821.19,GILES,I wish I could say the right words
1821.32,1822.96,GILES,To lead you through this land
1823.08,1826.87,GILES,Wish I could play the father
1829.02,1828.83,GILES,And take you by the hand
1828.96,1831.76,GILES,Wish I could stay here
1832.52,1835.27,GILES,But now I understand
1835.4,1837.83,GILES,I'm standing
1837.96,1840.27,GILES,In the way
1842.08,1846.47,GILES,"The cries around you, you don't hear at all"
1847.64,1852.32,GILES,Cos you know I'm here to take that call
1853.4,1858.27,GILES,So you just lie there
1853.4,1858.27,GILES,when you should be standing tall
1858.4,1860.71,GILES,But I...
1862.84,1866.75,GILES,I wish I could lay your arms down
1866.88,1868.71,GILES,And let you rest at last
1868.84,1872.39,GILES,Wish I could slay your demons
1872.52,1874.4,GILES,But now that time has passed

1998.76,2001.19,SPIKE,"Come on, then. Sing."
2005.64,2007.72,SPIKE,My master has the Slayer's sister at the

2009.52,2012.83,MINION,At midnight he's going to take her
2009.52,2012.83,MINION,to the underworld to be his queen.
2012.96,2014.76,GILES,What does he want?

2028.2,2029.18,BUFFY,Must be Tuesday.
2029.18,2031.27,TARA,I just left her for a few minutes.
2031.4,2034.63,BUFFY,It's not your fault. So what's the plan?
2034.76,2036.96,XANDER,"Plan, schman. Let's mount up."
2036.96,2037.19,GILES,No.
2038.56,2041.44,ANYA,Dawn had the wrong idea

2041.56,2045.71,ANYA,I've seen some of these underworld
2041.56,2045.71,ANYA,childbride deals and they never end well.
2045.84,2047.07,ANYA,"Well, maybe once."
2047.07,2049.31,WILLOW,We're not just gonna stay here?

2065.27,2065.51,TARA,No!
2065.64,2068.39,TARA,"I mean, I don't think it'll help."
2068.52,2071.08,SPIKE,"Forget them, Slayer. I got your back."
2071.2,2075.8,BUFFY,I thought you wanted me to stay away
2071.2,2075.8,BUFFY,from you. Isn't that what you sang?
2075.92,2077.88,XANDER,Spike sing a wittle song?
2080.02,2081.11,ANYA,Was it a pop hit or more of a book number?
2081.11,2081.6,XANDER,"Let it go, sweetie."
2082.08,2085.79,SPIKE,Fine. I hope you dance till you burn.
2085.92,2088.07,SPIKE,You and the little bit.
2094.2,2097.11,BUFFY,You're really not coming?

2143.72,2145.23,Song,To save the day
2145.6,2147.75,Song,Or maybe melt away
2148.64,2151.39,Song,I guess it's all the same

2157.44,2160.24,Song,Cos where else can I turn?
2161.16,2165.28,Song,I will walk through the fire
2165.4,2166.99,BUFFY,And let it...

2176.52,2178.16,ANYA,I hope she fries
2178.28,2181.16,ANYA,I'm free if that bitch dies!
2181.28,2183.92,ANYA,I'd better help her out
2184.04,2188.72,ANYA,Cos she is drawn to the fire
2189.84,2193.07,ANYA,Some people never learn
2189.84,2193.07,ANYA,She will never learn
2193.2,2197.64,ANYA,And she will walk through the fire
2197.76,2198.99,ANYA,And let it...
2199.12,2203.59,ANYA,Will this do a thing to change her?
2199.12,2203.59,ANYA,Am I leaving Dawn in danger?
2203.72,2207.16,ANYA,Is my slayer too far gone to care?
2208.24,2210.39,ANYA,What if Buffy can't defeat it?
2210.52,2212.72,ANYA,"BeadyEyes is right, we're needed!"
2212.84,2216.12,ANYA,Or we could just sit around and glare
2217.56,2220.71,ANYA,We'll see it through
2217.56,2220.71,ANYA,It's what we're always here to do
2220.84,2225.2,ANYA,So we will walk through the fire
2226.48,2230.92,ANYA,"So one by one, they turn from me"
2231.04,2235.48,ANYA,I guess my friends can't face the cold
2231.04,2235.48,ANYA,What can't we face
2235.6,2240.04,ANYA,"Why I froze, not one among them knows"
2235.6,2240.04,ANYA,If we're together?
2240.16,2243.12,ANYA,And never can be told
2244.24,2246.55,ANYA,She came from the grave much graver
2244.24,2246.55,ANYA,So one by one
2246.68,2248.88,SPIKE,"First he'll kill her, then I'll save her"
2246.68,2248.88,SPIKE,They come to me
2251.02,2252.13,TARA,Everything is turning out so dark
2252.13,2253.28,SPIKE,The distant redness as their guide
2253.4,2254.91,SPIKE,"No, I'll save her, then I'll kill her"
2254.91,2255.6,WILLOW,That single flame
2255.72,2256.86,WILLOW,I think this line's mostly filler
2256.86,2257.79,GILES,Ain't what they had in mind
2257.92,2262.6,GILES,What's it going to take to strike a spark?
2257.92,2262.6,GILES,It's what they have inside

2313.52,2316.43,BUFFY,"I ought to know, if you're"
2313.52,2316.43,BUFFY,gonna be my brotherinlaw.
2316.56,2318.63,DAWN,"Buffy, I swear I didn't do it."
2318.76,2321.19,BUFFY,Don't worry. You're not going anywhere.
2322.36,2323.24,BUFFY,I am.
2323.24,2324.11,DAWN,What?
2324.52,2330.12,BUFFY,"Deal's this. I can't kill you,"
2324.52,2330.12,BUFFY,you take me to Hellsville in her place.
2333.02,2333.99,SWEET,What if I kill you?
2333.99,2335.07,BUFFY,Trust me. Won't help.
2335.52,2337.04,SWEET,That's gloomy.
2337.04,2338.35,BUFFY,That's life.
2338.96,2341.87,SWEET,"Come, now, is that really what you feel?"
2344.02,2344.83,SWEET,Isn't life a miraculous thing?

2348.2,2349.86,Song,Life's a show
2349.86,2353.04,BUFFY,And we all play our parts
2353.16,2356.99,BUFFY,And when the music starts
2357.12,2360.35,BUFFY,We open up our hearts
2361.64,2366.56,BUFFY,It's all right
2361.64,2366.56,BUFFY,if some things come out wrong
2366.68,2370.15,BUFFY,We'll sing a happy song

2393.6,2395.67,BUFFY,Don't give me songs
2395.8,2398.5,GILES,"She needs backup. Anya, Tara."
2398.5,2400.27,BUFFY,Don't give me songs
2402.08,2407.07,DAWN,Give me something to sing about
2412.36,2416.56,DAWN,I need something to sing about
2427.52,2432.67,DAWN,Life's a song
2427.52,2432.67,DAWN,you don't get to rehearse
2432.8,2436.11,DAWN,And every single verse
2436.56,2439.95,DAWN,Can make it that much worse
2441.12,2446.11,DAWN,Still my friends
2441.12,2446.11,DAWN,don't know why I ignore
2446.24,2449.63,DAWN,The million things or more
2449.76,2453.83,DAWN,I should be dancing for
2453.96,2455.95,DAWN,All the joy life sends
2456.08,2457.75,DAWN,Family and friends
2457.88,2459.71,DAWN,All the twists and bends
2459.84,2461.51,DAWN,Knowing that it ends
2461.64,2462.91,DAWN,Well that depends
2463.04,2465.51,DAWN,On if they let you go
2467.08,2471.92,DAWN,On if they know enough to know
2475.02,2475.96,DAWN,That when you've bowed
2476.88,2480.32,DAWN,You leave the crowd
2491.8,2493.95,DAWN,There was no pain
2495.24,2497.12,DAWN,"No fear, no doubt"
2497.24,2499.6,DAWN,Till they pulled me out
2499.72,2502.08,DAWN,Of Heaven
2505.28,2507.64,DAWN,So that's my refrain
2508.8,2510.39,DAWN,I live in Hell
2510.52,2512.88,DAWN,Cos I've been expelled
2515.02,2515.23,DAWN,From Heaven
2516.36,2519.75,DAWN,I think I was in Heaven
2521.76,2526.55,DAWN,So give me something to sing about
2530.32,2533.79,DAWN,Please give me something...
2562.2,2564.63,DAWN,Life's not a song
2565.88,2567.92,DAWN,Life isn't bliss
2568.04,2570.6,DAWN,Life is just this
2570.72,2573.52,DAWN,It's living
2576.96,2579.43,DAWN,You'll get along
2580.44,2582.64,DAWN,The pain that you feel
2582.76,2585.15,DAWN,You only can heal
2585.28,2588.11,DAWN,By living
2589.44,2592.88,DAWN,You have to go on living
2594.16,2597.71,DAWN,So one of us is living
2601.08,2605.15,DAWN,The hardest thing in this world
2601.08,2605.15,DAWN,is to live in it.
2612.64,2614.91,SWEET,Now that was a showstopping number.
2614.96,2617.27,SWEET,Not quite the fireworks
2614.96,2617.27,SWEET,that I was looking for...
2617.4,2619.15,WILLOW,Get out of here.
2619.28,2621.95,SWEET,"Mm, I smell power."
2622.08,2624.99,SWEET,I guess the little missus and I
2622.08,2624.99,SWEET,should be on our way.
2625.12,2627.08,GILES,That's never gonna happen.
2627.2,2630.72,SWEET,I don't make the rules. She summoned me.
2630.84,2633.59,DAWN,I so did not. He keeps saying that.
2634.36,2636.95,SWEET,"You have my talisman on, sweet thing."
2637.08,2640.04,DAWN,"Oh, but, no, I..."
2640.16,2645.31,DAWN,"This... at the Magic Box, on the floor."
2640.16,2645.31,DAWN,"I was cleaning, and I forgot..."
2645.44,2647.49,DAWN,But I didn't summon anything.
2647.49,2649.32,SWEET,"Well, now, that's a twist."
2652.02,2654.68,GILES,"If it was in the shop,"
2652.02,2654.68,GILES,then one of us probably...
2659.8,2660.25,ANYA,Xander?
2660.25,2662.92,XANDER,"Well, I didn't know what was gonna happen."
2663.04,2665.92,XANDER,I just thought there were
2663.04,2665.92,XANDER,gonna be dances and songs.
2666.04,2668.76,XANDER,I just wanted to make sure we'd work out.
2669.64,2671.87,XANDER,Get a happy ending.
2674.02,2674.56,SWEET,I think everything worked out just fine.
2677.04,2679.79,XANDER,Does this mean that I have to...
2680.88,2682.47,XANDER,be your queen?
2682.6,2684.8,SWEET,It's tempting.
2684.92,2688.23,SWEET,But I think we'll waive
2684.92,2688.23,SWEET,that clause just this once.
2688.92,2691.43,SWEET,"Big smiles, everyone!"
2691.56,2693.55,SWEET,You beat the bad guy.
2694.56,2696.36,SWEET,What a lot of fun
2696.48,2700.68,SWEET,You guys have been real swell
2703.08,2704.99,SWEET,And there's not a one
2705.12,2707.63,SWEET,Who can say this
2710.02,2710.67,SWEET,Ended well
2711.16,2714.68,SWEET,All those secrets you've been concealing
2715.04,2717.32,SWEET,Say you're happy now
2717.44,2719.56,SWEET,"Once more, with feeling"
2719.68,2721.56,SWEET,Now I gotta run
2721.68,2723.64,Song,See you all
2724.52,2730.28,Song,In Hell!
2746.08,2748.31,SWEET,Where do we go
2748.44,2750.4,SWEET,From here?
2753.68,2755.75,SWEET,Where do we go
2755.88,2758.84,SWEET,From here?
2760.24,2763.55,Song,The battle's done and we kind of won
2763.68,2767.04,Song,So we sound our victory cheer
2768.8,2770.92,Song,Where do we go
2771.04,2773.4,Song,From here?
2776.28,2778.16,Song,Why is the path
2778.28,2780.43,Song,Unclear?
2783.24,2785.12,Song,When we know home

2792.52,2795.51,Song,But we'll walk alone in fear
2795.64,2796.99,Song,Tell me

2812.02,2813.03,SPIKE,Bugger this.
2813.03,2815.31,ALL,When do the trumpets cheer?
2817.04,2820.11,ALL,"The curtains close on a kiss, God knows"
2820.24,2823.2,ALL,We can tell the end is near...
