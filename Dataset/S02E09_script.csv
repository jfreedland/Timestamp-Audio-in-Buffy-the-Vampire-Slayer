14.57,18.26,,Are you a people person or do you
14.57,18.26,,prefer keeping your own company?"
18.72,23.05,,"Well, what if I'm a people person"
18.72,23.05,,who keeps his own company by default?
23.1,25.92,Buffy,"So, mark ""none of the above""."
23.1,25.92,Buffy,"Well, there are no boxes for"
25.92,26.78,Buffy,none of the above".
26.78,28.56,Xander,That would introduce too many variables
28.56,31.76,Xander,into their mushroomhead
28.56,31.76,Xander,numbercrunching little world.
31.79,33.74,Willow,I'm sensing bitterness.
33.77,36.84,Xander,"No, it's just these people can't tell"
33.77,36.84,Xander,from one multiple choice test
36.84,39.93,Xander,what we're gonna be doing
36.84,39.93,Xander,for the rest of our lives. It's ridiculous!
39.96,41.73,Willow,I'm kinda curious to find out
41.73,43.75,Xander,what sort of career I could have.
43.78,46.57,Xander,And suck the spontaneity out of being
43.78,46.57,Xander,young and stupid?
46.6,48.01,Xander,I'd rather live in the dark.
48.01,49.73,Willow,We're not gonna be young for ever.
49.73,52.89,Xander,"Yes, but I'll always be stupid."
53.33,56.51,Xander,"OK, let's not all rush to disagree."
56.56,58.16,Buffy,You're not stupid.
58.2,62.05,Cordelia,I aspire to help my fellow man." Check.
62.31,66.43,Cordelia,"As long as he's not smelly,"
62.31,66.43,Cordelia,dirty or... something gross.
66.46,70.78,Xander,Cordelia Chase  always ready to give
66.46,70.78,Xander,a helping hand to the rich and the pretty.
70.81,74.86,Cordelia,"Which, lucky me, excludes you. Twice."
75.88,78.42,Xander,Is murder always a crime?
78.45,79.56,Buffy,Do I like shrubs?
79.56,81.66,Xander,That's between you and your God.
81.7,82.84,Buffy,What did you put?
82.84,85.13,Willow,I came down on the side of shrubs.
85.17,87.14,Willow,Go shrubs! OK. Oh...
87.17,90.59,Buffy,I shouldn't even be bothering with this.
87.17,90.59,Buffy,It's all mootville for me.
90.63,93.5,Buffy,"No matter what my aptitude test says,"
90.63,93.5,Buffy,we already know my deal.
93.53,96.13,Xander,Yep! Highrisk. Subminimum wage.
96.13,97.89,Buffy,Pointy wooden things?
97.93,99.91,Willow,Then why are you even taking the test?
99.91,102.05,Buffy,It's Principal Snyder's hoop of the week.
102.09,105.5,Buffy,He's not happy unless I'm jumping.
102.09,105.5,Buffy,"Believe me, I would not be here otherwise."
105.54,109.76,Willow,You're not even a teensy weensy bit curious
105.54,109.76,Willow,about what kinda career you could've had?
109.8,112.69,Willow,"I mean, if you"
109.8,112.69,Willow,weren't already the Slayer 'n' all.
112.72,115.46,Buffy,Do the words "sealed" and "fate"
112.72,115.46,Buffy,"ring any bells for you, Will?"
115.46,116.35,Buffy,Why go there?
116.35,118.89,Xander,"You know, with that kind of attitude,"
118.93,122.73,Xander,you could've had a bright future
118.93,122.73,Xander,as an employee at the DMV.
123.53,125.4,Buffy,I'm sorry. It's just...
125.5,129.42,Buffy,Unless Hell freezes over and every vamp
125.5,129.42,Buffy,"in Sunnydale puts in for early retirement,"
129.78,132.91,Buffy,I'd say my future is
129.78,132.91,Buffy,pretty much a nonissue.
137.91,139.02,Spike,Read it again.
139.02,141.56,Dalton,"I'm not sure. It could be, uh..."

162.35,167.06,Spike,"Give us some peace, would you?"
162.35,167.06,Spike,Can't you see I'm workin'?
169.82,172.59,Spike,"I'm sorry, kitten."
173.58,177.3,Spike,It's just this manuscript.
173.58,177.3,Spike,"It's supposed to hold your cure,"
177.3,179.83,Drusilla,but it reads like gibberish.
179.87,181.39,Drusilla,"Even Dalton here, the big brain,"
181.39,183.06,Spike,he can't make heads or tails of it.
183.1,188.23,Drusilla,I... I need to change Miss Edith.
196.1,198.59,Spike,"Oh, forgive me."
199.75,203.96,Spike,You know I can't stand
199.75,203.96,Spike,to see you like this.
205.28,207.69,Spike,We're runnin' out of time.
208.28,213.03,Spike,It's that bloody Slayer. Whenever
208.28,213.03,Spike,"I turn around, she's muckin' up the works."
213.38,218.84,Drusilla,Shh... You'll make it right. I know.
233.64,235.47,Spike,Well...
236.56,239.32,Spike,Come on now...
240.94,243.23,Spike,Enlighten me.
243.26,248.51,Dalton,"Well... it looks like Latin, but it's not."
243.26,248.51,Dalton,I'm not even sure it's a language. I...
248.55,254.02,Spike,Then make it a language!
248.55,254.02,Spike,Isn't that what a transcriber does?
252.04,254.21,Dalton,"Well, not exactly..."
254.21,256.27,Spike,I want... the cure.
256.31,257.32,Drusilla,Don't...
257.32,258.32,Spike,Why not?
258.35,263.08,Spike,Some people find pain...
258.35,263.08,Spike,very inspirational.
263.12,265.3,Drusilla,He can't help you.
265.3,268.51,Drusilla,Not without... the key.
268.54,271.94,Spike,The key? You mean this book
268.54,271.94,Spike,is in some kind of code?
271.98,274.26,Drusilla,Yeah.
280.98,284.47,Spike,Is that where we'll find this key?
284.47,285.19,Drusilla,Yeah...
285.22,288.12,Spike,I'll send the boys pronto.
288.49,290.99,Drusilla,Now will you dance?
291.03,294.78,Spike,"I'll dance with you, pet..."

433.71,437.07,Buffy,no sanctity to you people?
437.14,439.92,Buffy,Oh. I forgot. You're not a people.
451.53,453.91,Buffy,One down...
454.66,457.62,Buffy,One... gone.
478.43,481.46,Angel,Buffy... You scared me.
481.49,484.35,Buffy,Now you know
481.49,484.35,Buffy,"what it feels like, Stealth Guy."
484.69,488.52,Buffy,Just droppin' by for some
484.69,488.52,Buffy,quality time with Mr. Gordo?
489.07,491.09,Angel,Excuse me?
491.09,492.7,Buffy,The pig.
494.07,495.91,Angel,"Oh! I, uh..."
495.95,498.16,Buffy,What's up?
499.08,500.91,Angel,Nothing.
502.83,504.94,Angel,"Well, you don't have a ""nothing"" face."
504.94,506.5,Buffy,You have a "something" face.
506.58,508.33,Buffy,And you don't have to whisper.
508.33,509.85,Angel,Mom's in LA till Thursday 
509.85,511.9,Buffy,art buying or something.
511.94,515.09,Angel,Then... why'd you come in
511.94,515.09,Angel,through the window?
515.97,518.3,Buffy,Habit.
518.47,521.5,Angel,I wanted to make sure you're OK.
518.47,521.5,Angel,I had a bad feeling.
521.53,525.42,Buffy,There's a surprise.
521.53,525.42,Buffy,Angel comes with bad news.
528.48,530.98,Buffy,"Oh, God! I'm sorry. Look..."
531.02,532.74,Buffy,I've been Cranky Miss all day.
532.74,533.49,Angel,It's not you.
533.52,535.25,Angel,"What is it, then?"
535.25,536.57,Buffy,It's nothing.
538.49,541.81,Buffy,We're having this thing at school...
541.81,542.92,Angel,Career week?
542.96,544.99,Buffy,How did you know?
544.99,545.83,Angel,I lurk.
545.87,548.15,Buffy,"Right. Well, then you know"
548.18,553.37,Buffy,"it's a whole week of What's My Line,"
548.18,553.37,Buffy,only... I don't get to play.
554.13,556.76,Buffy,Sometimes I just want...
556.76,558.29,Angel,You want what?
560.39,562.6,Angel,It's OK.
562.89,565.14,Buffy,The Cliffs Notes version?
565.39,571.02,Buffy,"I want a normal life, like I had before."
569.15,571.33,Angel,Before me.
571.36,573.96,Buffy,"No, Angel, it's not you."
575.4,581.03,Buffy,You're the one freaky thing in my freaky
575.4,581.03,Buffy,world that still makes sense to me.
582.28,585.38,Buffy,I just get messed sometimes.
585.41,587.91,Buffy,I wish we could be regular kids.
587.95,591.3,Angel,Yeah. I'll never be a kid.
591.33,593.48,Buffy,"OK, then. A regular kid and her"

603.56,606.22,Angel,Was this part of your normal life?
606.68,613.34,Buffy,"Oh, my gosh! My Dorothy Hamill phase."
606.68,613.34,Buffy,My room in LA was pretty much a shrine.
613.38,617.24,Buffy,"Dorothy dolls, Dorothy posters."
613.38,617.24,Buffy,I even got the Dorothy haircut.
617.32,620.45,Buffy,Thereby securing a place for myself
617.32,620.45,Buffy,in the geek hall of fame.
620.48,624.11,Angel,And you wanted to be like her.
620.48,624.11,Angel,I wanted to be her.
624.2,628.58,Buffy,My parents were fighting all the time
624.2,628.58,Buffy,and... skating was an escape.
628.62,630.94,Buffy,I felt safe.
631.71,634.73,Angel,When was the last time
631.71,634.73,Angel,you put on your skates?
634.84,636.67,Buffy,About a couple of hundred demons ago.
636.71,639.9,Angel,There's a rink out past Route 17
639.9,642.49,Buffy,that's closed on Tuesdays.
643.6,646.98,Buffy,Tomorrow's Tuesday.
646.98,648.23,Angel,I know.
653.98,656.88,Cordelia,"Oh, here I am. Personal shopper"
656.88,659.78,Xander,or motivational speaker. Neato.
659.81,664.31,Xander,Motivational speaker on what?
659.81,664.31,Xander,Ten ways to a more annoying you?
665.87,669.29,Cordelia,Um... What about you? You're...
669.92,671.46,Xander,What?
672.75,675.07,Xander,What!
675.25,677.71,Willow,You and Angel are going skating? Alone?
677.75,681.89,Buffy,Unless some unforeseen evil pops up.
677.75,681.89,Buffy,But I'm in full seenoevil mode.
682.13,683.55,Willow,Angel iceskating?
683.55,685.8,Buffy,I know. Two worlds collide.
685.89,688.49,Xander,Wouldn't you two say you know me
685.89,688.49,Xander,about as well as anyone else?
688.53,690.44,Xander,Maybe better than I know myself?
690.44,691.51,Willow,What's this about?
691.52,695.27,Xander,"When you look at me,"
691.52,695.27,Xander,do you think prison guard?
695.31,698.4,Buffy,"Um... Crossing guard maybe,"
695.31,698.4,Buffy,but prison guard?
698.44,700.49,Xander,They just put up the assignments
698.44,700.49,Xander,for the career fair
700.49,703.66,Xander,and according to my test results I can
700.49,703.66,Xander,look forward to being gainfully employed
703.69,707.06,Xander,in the growing field of corrections.
707.09,710.29,Buffy,"Well, at least you'll be"
707.09,710.29,Buffy,on the right side of the bars.
710.32,712.34,Xander,"Laugh now, missy."
710.32,712.34,Xander,They assigned you to the booth for
712.34,714.67,Xander,law enforcement professionals.
714.7,715.86,Buffy,As in police?
715.86,719.53,Xander,"As in polyester, doughnuts and brutality."
720.3,723.14,Willow,But... doughnuts!
723.43,726.88,Buffy,"Well, I'll just jump off that bridge"
723.43,726.88,Buffy,when I come to it.
726.98,729.04,Buffy,First I have to deal with Giles.
729.04,731.9,Buffy,He's on this Tony Robbins
729.04,731.9,Buffy,hyperefficiency kick.
731.93,735.3,Buffy,Expects me to check in every day
731.93,735.3,Buffy,after homeroom.
735.33,737.01,Willow,Police?
737.19,740.52,Willow,You... didn't check to see which seminar
737.19,740.52,Willow,"I was assigned to, did you?"
740.55,742.24,Xander,I did and you weren't.
742.24,743.32,Willow,I wasn't what?
743.45,744.32,Xander,On the list.
744.32,746.06,Willow,But I handed in my test.
746.06,747.4,Willow,I used a No.2 pencil!
747.4,749.56,Xander,Then I guess you must have passed.
749.59,752.72,Willow,It's not the kind of test you pass or fail.
752.83,755.54,Xander,"Your name wasn't up there, Will."
766.64,769.6,Giles,Buffy. Thank you.
769.7,774.28,Giles,I've been indexing the Watcher diaries
769.7,774.28,Giles,covering the last couple of centuries.
774.31,776.29,Giles,You'd be amazed at how numbingly pompous
776.29,778.56,Giles,and longwinded
776.29,778.56,Giles,some of these Watchers were.
778.59,780.22,Buffy,Color me stunned.
780.22,781.09,Giles,"So, uh..."
781.13,783.3,Giles,I trust last night's patrol was fruitful?
783.33,785.7,Buffy,Semi. I caught one out of two vamps
785.7,788.57,Buffy,after they stole something
785.7,788.57,Buffy,from this jumbo mausoleum.
788.6,789.78,Giles,They were stealing?
789.78,791.53,Buffy,"They had tools, flashlights,"
791.57,794.66,Buffy,whole nine yards.
791.57,794.66,Buffy,What does that mean anyway?
794.66,798.54,Buffy,Whole nine yards. Nine yards of what?
798.58,801.85,Buffy,Now it's gonna bug me all day.
801.88,804.91,Buffy,"Giles, you're in pace mode. What gives?"
806.05,809.8,Giles,"Um... This vampire who escaped,"
806.05,809.8,Giles,did you see what he took?
809.84,812.26,Buffy,"No, but I can guess"
809.84,812.26,Buffy,and say it was something old.
812.93,815.09,Giles,You made no effort
812.93,815.09,Giles,to find out what was taken?
815.12,820.71,Buffy,"Have a cow, Giles. I just figured it was"
815.12,820.71,Buffy,your everyday vamp high jinks.
820.75,823.4,Giles,What if it wasn't?
820.75,823.4,Giles,This could be very serious.
823.44,826.42,Giles,"I mean, if you'd made an effort to be"
823.44,826.42,Giles,more thorough in your observations...
826.46,829.86,Buffy,"If you don't like the way I'm doing my job,"
826.46,829.86,Buffy,why don't you find somebody else?
829.9,834.85,Buffy,Oh! That's right. There can only be one.
829.9,834.85,Buffy,As long as I'm alive there is no one else.
835.45,840.06,Buffy,"Well, there you go. I don't have"
835.45,840.06,Buffy,to be the Slayer. I could be dead.
840.46,843.16,Giles,That wasn't terribly funny.
840.46,843.16,Giles,You notice I don't laugh.
843.2,847.18,Buffy,Wouldn't be much of a change.
843.2,847.18,Buffy,"Either way I'm bored, constricted."
847.21,851,Giles,"I never get to shop, and my hair"
847.21,851,Giles,and fingernails still continue to grow.
851.03,854.52,Buffy,"So, really, when you think about it,"
851.03,854.52,Buffy,what's the diff?
854.85,857.91,Giles,Do we have to be introspective now?
857.95,862.53,Giles,Our only concern is to discover what
857.95,862.53,Giles,was stolen from that mausoleum last night.
869.24,870.95,Spike,"This is it, then."
870.95,875.36,Drusilla,It hums. I can hear it.
875.49,883.02,Spike,"Once you're well again,"
875.49,883.02,Spike,we'll have a coronation down main street.
881.12,883.83,Spike,And invite everyone.
881.12,883.83,Spike,And drink
883.83,887.12,Dalton,for seven days and seven nights.
883.83,887.12,Dalton,What about the Slayer?
887.15,889.88,Dalton,She almost blew the whole thing for us.
887.15,889.88,Dalton,She's trouble.
889.92,892.76,Spike,You don't say!
894.89,899.2,Spike,Trouble? She's the gnat in my ear.
899.89,902.51,Spike,The gristle in my teeth.
902.55,906.17,Spike,She's the bloody thorn
902.55,906.17,Spike,in my bloody side!
906.21,907.11,Drusilla,Spike?
907.11,910.85,Spike,We've gotta do something.
911.15,915.91,Spike,We'll never complete your cure
911.15,915.91,Spike,with that bitch breathing down our necks.
919.87,922.98,Spike,I need to bring in the big guns.
923.02,925.32,Spike,They'll take care of her once and for all.
925.36,926.13,Dalton,Big guns?
926.13,927.83,Spike,The Order of Taraka.
927.86,930.52,Dalton,The bounty hunters?
931.13,934.06,Drusilla,They're coming to my party.
934.26,936.61,Drusilla,Three of them.
936.76,941.44,Dalton,"Yes, but... The Order of Taraka, I mean..."
941.47,944.9,Dalton,Isn't that overkill?
944.9,945.41,Spike,No.
945.52,949.85,Spike,I think it's just enough kill.
962.37,964.68,Xander,Willow? What are you doing here?
964.68,967.38,Xander,"Fly. Be free, little bird."
964.68,967.38,Xander,You defy category.
967.41,969.33,Willow,I'm looking for Buffy.
969.33,972.72,Xander,"Oh, she went with Giles about an hour ago."
969.33,972.72,Xander,Some kind of field trip deal.
972.76,975.29,Willow,"If she doesn't get back soon,"
972.76,975.29,Willow,Snyder's really...
975.51,978.11,Willow,"done a great job with the fair this year,"
975.51,978.11,Willow,"hasn't he, Xander?"
978.15,981.92,Xander,"Principal Snyder, great career fair, sir."
978.15,981.92,Xander,"Really. In fact,"
981.95,985.25,Xander,"I'm so inspired by your leadership,"
981.95,985.25,Xander,I'm thinkin' principal school.
985.28,988.76,Xander,I wanna walk in your shoes.
985.28,988.76,Xander,"Not your actual shoes, of course,"
988.76,992.7,Xander,because you're a tiny person.
988.76,992.7,Xander,"Not tiny in the small sense, of course."
992.73,994.91,Xander,"OK, I'm done now."
994.94,996.35,Snyder,Where is she?
996.35,996.78,Willow,Who?
996.98,998.37,Snyder,You know who.
998.37,999.98,Willow,You mean Buffy?
999.98,1000.9,Willow,I just saw her...
1000.9,1002.1,Snyder,And don't feed me that
1002.13,1004.93,Snyder,"I just saw her a minute ago,"
1002.13,1004.93,Snyder,she's around here somewhere" story.
1004.97,1010.58,Willow,But I did... just see her a minute ago
1004.97,1010.58,Willow,and she is around here somewhere.
1010.62,1012.29,Xander,For what it's worth...
1012.29,1014.35,Snyder,"It's worth nothing, Harris."
1014.38,1017.52,Snyder,Whatever comes out of your mouth
1014.38,1017.52,Snyder,"is meaningless waste of breath,"
1017.52,1019.62,Snyder,an airborne toxic event.
1019.65,1023.05,Xander,"Well, I'm glad you feel comfortable enough"
1019.65,1023.05,Xander,to be so honest with me.
1023.06,1026.97,Xander,And I can only hope that one day I'm
1023.06,1026.97,Xander,in the position to be that honest with you.
1029.02,1029.26,Snyder,Fascinating.
1029.94,1032.65,Xander,"Well, love to chat, but I got"
1029.94,1032.65,Xander,an appointment with the warden
1032.65,1036.04,Xander,on standard riot procedure. Ciao.
1036.04,1037.17,Willow,OK. See ya.
1037.2,1040.61,Recruiter,"Willow Rosenberg? Come with us, please."
1040.64,1042.13,Willow,Excuse me?
1042.13,1043.76,Recruiter,Let's walk.
1057.47,1060.54,Recruiter,Try the canapé. It's excellent.
1062.37,1063.44,Willow,What is all this?
1063.44,1064.7,Recruiter,You've been selected
1064.74,1068.73,Recruiter,"to meet with Mr. McCarthy, head recruiter"
1064.74,1068.73,Recruiter,for the world's leading software concern.
1068.76,1072.24,Recruiter,"The jet was delayed by fog at SeaTac,"
1068.76,1072.24,Recruiter,but he should be here any minute.
1072.27,1074.26,Recruiter,"Please, make yourself comfortable."
1074.29,1076.76,Willow,But I didn't even get my test back.
1076.8,1079.99,Recruiter,That was irrelevant.
1076.8,1079.99,Recruiter,We've been tracking you for some time.
1080.03,1081.74,Willow,Is that a good thing?
1081.74,1083.12,Recruiter,I would think so.
1083.15,1085.57,Recruiter,"We're extremely selective. In fact,"
1085.57,1089.51,Recruiter,only one other Sunnydale student
1085.57,1089.51,Recruiter,met our criteria.
1103.76,1105.6,Oz,Canapé?
1106.93,1109.94,Giles,"Buffy! Slow down, please!"
1109.98,1112.89,Buffy,"Giles, we have work to do, remember?"
1109.98,1112.89,Buffy,Get with the program.
1112.92,1114.93,Giles,You're behaving remarkably immaturely.
1114.97,1118.59,Buffy,You know why? I am immature.
1114.97,1118.59,Buffy,I'm a teen. I've yet to mature.
1118.62,1122.54,Giles,I was simply offering
1118.62,1122.54,Giles,some... constructive criticism.
1122.57,1127.02,Buffy,No. You were harsh.
1125.04,1127.94,Buffy,"God, you act like I picked this gig,"
1125.04,1127.94,Buffy,but remember I'm the picked.
1128.21,1133.07,Giles,What you have... is more than a gig.
1128.21,1133.07,Giles,It's a sacred duty.
1133.84,1138.77,Giles,Which shouldn't prevent you from
1133.84,1138.77,Giles,eventually procuring some...
1138.77,1143.22,Giles,more... gainful form of employment.
1138.77,1143.22,Giles,Such as I did.
1143.26,1146.35,Buffy,"Giles, it's one thing to be"
1143.26,1146.35,Buffy,a watcher and a librarian.
1146.38,1150.85,Buffy,"They go together,"
1146.38,1150.85,Buffy,like chicken and... another chicken...
1150.89,1154.89,Buffy,"or... two... chickens, or something."
1150.89,1154.89,Buffy,You know what I'm saying!
1155.11,1158.72,Buffy,"The point is, no one blinks an eye if you"
1155.11,1158.72,Buffy,want to spend all your days with books.
1158.76,1161.15,Buffy,What am I supposed to do?
1158.76,1161.15,Buffy,Carve stakes for a nursery?
1161.19,1165.11,Giles,Point taken.
1161.19,1165.11,Giles,I must admit I've never really...
1165.12,1169.16,Giles,"Now, there's a thought!"
1165.12,1169.16,Giles,Have you ever considered law enforcement?
1172,1173.87,Giles,What?
1173.91,1176.12,Giles,Oh!
1190.14,1190.88,Giles,May I?
1190.88,1192.35,Buffy,Be my guest.
1197.65,1200.13,Giles,It's a reliquary...
1200.15,1204.11,Giles,used to house items
1200.15,1204.11,Giles,of religious significance.
1204.14,1205.36,Buffy,Most commonly a finger
1205.36,1207.4,Giles,or some other body part from a saint.
1207.44,1209.9,Buffy,Note to self: religion  freaky.
1213.83,1215.67,Giles,Du Lac.
1215.71,1217.31,Giles,"Oh dear, oh dear."
1217.31,1219.66,Buffy,I hate when you say that.
1219.69,1221.86,Giles,Josephus du Lac was buried here.
1221.9,1224.34,Giles,He belonged to a religious sect
1221.9,1224.34,Giles,that was excommunicated
1224.34,1226.19,Giles,by the Vatican at the turn of the century.
1226.22,1230.58,Buffy,Excommunicated and sent to Sunnydale.
1226.22,1230.58,Buffy,There's a guy big with the sinning.
1231.35,1235.1,Giles,You remember the book that was stolen from
1231.35,1235.1,Giles,the library by a vampire a few weeks ago?
1235.14,1235.63,Buffy,Yeah.
1235.63,1239,Giles,It was written by du Lac. Damn it!
1239.03,1241.88,Giles,I let it slip my mind
1239.03,1241.88,Giles,with all the excitement.
1241.91,1244.74,Buffy,I'm guessing it wasn't
1241.91,1244.74,Buffy,a Taste of the Vatican cookbook.
1244.78,1247.09,Buffy,"No, the book was said to contain rituals"
1247.09,1249.28,Giles,and spells that reap unspeakable evil.
1249.32,1254.33,Giles,"However, it was written in archaic Latin so"
1249.32,1254.33,Giles,that only sect members could understand it.
1255.12,1256.93,Buffy,So everything's cool then.
1256.93,1257.56,Giles,It's not.
1257.56,1260.21,Giles,First the book was taken
1257.56,1260.21,Giles,"from the library, and now the"
1260.21,1263.3,Giles,vampires have stolen something
1260.21,1263.3,Giles,from Du Lac's tomb.
1263.34,1266.13,Buffy,Do you think they figured out
1263.34,1266.13,Buffy,how to read the book?
1266.17,1270.67,Giles,"Something's coming, Buffy. Whatever it is,"
1266.17,1270.67,Giles,I can guarantee it's not good.
1271.39,1275.4,Announcement,"i>Bus 219, continuing service to Los Angeles,</i>"
1275.4,1280.74,Announcement,i>now arriving in Sunnydale
1275.4,1280.74,Announcement,at the west gate.</i>
1328.32,1329.8,Norman,Mrs. Kalish?
1329.8,1330.3,Mrs. Kalish,Yes.
1330.33,1333.56,Norman,Hello. I'm Norman Pfister
1330.33,1333.56,Norman,with Blush Beautiful Skincare.
1333.6,1336.56,Norman,"I'm not selling anything,"
1333.6,1336.56,Norman,"so I'm not asking you to buy,"
1336.56,1339.48,Norman,just to accept a few free samples.
1339.58,1340.51,Mrs. Kalish,Free?
1340.51,1342.55,Norman,Absolutely.
1369.61,1371.74,Handler,What the hell...?
1374.62,1377.44,Handler,"Hey, you're not supposed to be in here!"
1378.37,1380.69,Handler,"Hey, come on!"
1409.23,1410.94,Giles,So Giles is sure the vampire
1410.94,1412.23,Willow,who stole his book...
1412.27,1414.32,Willow,is connected to the one
1412.27,1414.32,Willow,you slayed last night?
1414.66,1416.49,Willow,Or... is it "slew"?
1416.49,1418.13,Giles,Both are correct.
1418.16,1420.82,Giles,And yes. I'm sure.
1420.85,1424.14,Giles,Du Lac was both a theologian
1420.85,1424.14,Giles,and a mathematician.
1424.18,1428.99,Giles,This article describes an invention of his
1424.18,1428.99,Giles,which he called the du Lac Cross.
1429.05,1431.68,Giles,"So, why go to all the trouble"
1429.05,1431.68,Giles,of inventing something
1431.72,1433.94,Giles,and then giving it a weak name like that?
1433.97,1440.83,Giles,"I mean, I'd have gone with the"
1433.97,1440.83,Giles,Crossomatic or the Amazing Mr. Cross.
1440.87,1442.93,Giles,The Cross was more than a mere symbol.
1442.93,1445.35,Giles,It was used to understand
1442.93,1445.35,Giles,certain mystical texts.
1445.38,1447.92,Giles,To decipher hidden meanings and so forth.
1447.95,1450.01,Giles,So you're saying these vampires went to
1450.01,1452.17,Buffy,all this hassle for a basic decoder ring?
1452.2,1454.7,Giles,"Actually, yes. I suppose I am."
1454.73,1460.13,Willow,"According to this, du Lac destroyed"
1454.73,1460.13,Willow,every Cross except the one buried with him.
1460.17,1461.41,Buffy,Why destroy your own work?
1461.41,1463.07,Giles,Perhaps he feared what might happen
1463.07,1464.81,Giles,if it fell into the wrong hands.
1464.85,1468.22,Xander,A fear we'll soon get to experience
1464.85,1468.22,Xander,for ourselves up close and personal.
1468.26,1470.74,Giles,Unless we can preempt their plans.
1470.77,1471.27,Willow,How?
1471.27,1473.14,Giles,"Uh, by learning"
1473.17,1475.62,Giles,what's in the book before they do.
1475.66,1478.53,Giles,Which means we can expect
1475.66,1478.53,Giles,to be here later tonight.
1478.56,1480.87,Willow,Goody! Research party!
1480.9,1482.85,Xander,"Will, you need a life in the worst way."
1482.89,1485.59,Buffy,"Speaking of... I really have to bail,"
1482.89,1485.59,Buffy,but I promise
1485.59,1488.63,Buffy,I'll be back bright and early
1485.59,1488.63,Buffy,tomorrow and ready to slay.
1488.71,1491.31,Giles,"This is a matter of some urgency, Buffy."
1491.31,1492.28,Buffy,I realize that.
1492.31,1495.35,Buffy,"Well, you have to admit"
1492.31,1495.35,Buffy,I kinda lack in the book area.
1495.36,1498.24,Buffy,"I mean, you guys are the brains,"
1495.36,1498.24,Buffy,I'd only be here for moral support anyway.
1498.49,1500.69,Xander,"That's untrue, Buff."
1498.49,1500.69,Xander,You totally contribute.
1500.69,1503.11,Xander,You go for snacks!
1504.12,1508.22,Willow,She should go... you know...
1504.12,1508.22,Willow,gather her strength.
1508.26,1511.68,Giles,Perhaps you're right.
1508.26,1511.68,Giles,There may be fierce battles ahead.
1511.71,1515.25,Xander,But HoHos are a vital part
1511.71,1515.25,Xander,of my cognitive process!
1515.38,1518.65,Buffy,"Sorry, Xand. Someplace I have to be."
1601.67,1603.49,Angel,Buffy!
1631.03,1633.79,Drusilla,He is passing
1631.03,1633.79,Drusilla,under our feet right now.
1635.38,1638.79,Spike,No worries.
1635.38,1638.79,Spike,We're close to decoding the manuscript.
1638.83,1640.89,Spike,We just need a bit more time.
1640.92,1643.09,Drusilla,Time is ours.
1643.09,1648.11,Drusilla,It brings the Slayer closer to them.
1650.39,1653.49,Buffy,The Hellmouth presents...
1650.39,1653.49,Buffy,"Dead Guys on Ice,"
1653.49,1655.85,Buffy,Not exactly the evening we were aiming for.
1655.88,1659.08,Angel,You're in danger.
1655.88,1659.08,Angel,You know what the ring means?
1659.15,1661.44,Buffy,I just killed a Super Bowl champ?
1661.44,1662.27,Angel,I'm serious!
1662.31,1665.52,Angel,Just go home and wait
1662.31,1665.52,Angel,till you hear from me.
1666.03,1668.04,Angel,Are you OK?
1669.16,1670.68,Buffy,What about you? That cut...
1670.68,1672.71,Angel,"Forget about me. This is bad, Buffy."
1672.71,1673.88,Angel,We gotta get you out of here.
1673.88,1674.69,Buffy,What? You mean hide?
1674.73,1677.19,Angel,Let's just get you someplace safe!
1677.19,1678.28,Buffy,No! Your eye...
1678.55,1680.49,Buffy,Hey!
1680.53,1682.81,Buffy,Don't be a baby. I'm not gonna hurt you.
1682.85,1685.54,Angel,It's not that. I...
1685.54,1686.25,Buffy,What?
1686.28,1689.47,Angel,You shouldn't have to touch me
1686.28,1689.47,Angel,when I'm like this.
1689.92,1692.25,Buffy,Oh...
1702.86,1708.02,Buffy,I didn't even notice.
1734.23,1739.27,Buffy,"This guy was hardcore, Giles."
1734.23,1739.27,Buffy,And Angel was powerfreaked by that ring.
1739.3,1741.46,Giles,"I'm afraid, he was not overreacting."
1741.46,1746.48,Giles,This ring is worn only by
1741.46,1746.48,Giles,members of the Order of Taraka.
1746.74,1751.32,Giles,It's a society of deadly assassins
1746.74,1751.32,Giles,dating back to King Solomon.
1751.35,1753.2,Xander,And didn't they beat the Elks
1751.35,1753.2,Xander,this year in the Sunnydale
1753.2,1754.8,Xander,adult bowling league championships?
1754.84,1758.78,Giles,Their credo is to sow discord
1754.84,1758.78,Giles,and kill the unwary.
1758.81,1760.48,Xander,Bowling is a vicious game.
1760.48,1761.89,Giles,"That's enough, Xander!"
1764.26,1769.8,Giles,Sorry. It's just not the time for jokes.
1764.26,1769.8,Giles,I need to think.
1769.84,1771.85,Buffy,These assassins 
1769.84,1771.85,Buffy,why are they after me?
1771.85,1773.96,Willow,Cause you're the scourge
1771.85,1773.96,Willow,of the underworld?
1773.99,1776.04,Buffy,I haven't been that scourgey lately.
1776.08,1778.69,Giles,"I don't know, I don't know."
1778.72,1782.68,Giles,I think the best thing we can do
1778.72,1782.68,Giles,is to find a secure location.
1782.71,1787.99,Giles,Somewhere out of the way you can go until
1782.71,1787.99,Giles,we decide on the best course of action.
1788.66,1793.32,Buffy,OK. Now you and Angel
1788.66,1793.32,Buffy,have both said to head for the hills.
1793.36,1795.43,Buffy,Are you saying I can't handle this? That...
1795.43,1797.55,Buffy,I'm not strong enough
1795.43,1797.55,Buffy,to fight these people?
1797.58,1800.26,Giles,"They're a breed apart, Buffy."
1800.3,1804.29,Giles,"Unlike vampires,"
1800.3,1804.29,Giles,they have no earthly desires...
1804.29,1807.92,Giles,but to collect their bounty.
1807.95,1810.74,Giles,"They find a target and, uh..."
1810.78,1812.84,Giles,they eliminate it.
1812.88,1816.42,Giles,You can kill as many of them as you like.
1812.88,1816.42,Giles,It'll make no difference.
1816.45,1820.91,Giles,"Where there's one,"
1816.45,1820.91,Giles,there will be another and another.
1822.44,1825.95,Giles,They won't stop coming
1822.44,1825.95,Giles,until the job is done.
1826.82,1831.31,Giles,"Each one of them works alone, his own way,"
1831.34,1838.08,Giles,"Some are human, Some... are not,"
1839.96,1844.08,Giles,You won't know who they are
1839.96,1844.08,Giles,"until they strike,"
1895.47,1897.51,Buffy,Try it!
1898.6,1899.68,Oz,Try what?
1899.68,1901.6,Buffy,Uh... I'm sorry.
1902.35,1905.48,Oz,I'm still not clear
1902.35,1905.48,Oz,what I'm supposed to try.
1905.52,1909.85,Buffy,"Nothing. God, I'm sorry. I..."
1912.36,1914.99,Oz,That is a tense person.
1950.53,1952.86,Willow,I wish there was more we could do.
1952.9,1955.2,Giles,We're doing all that we can.
1955.53,1961.3,Giles,The only course of action is to try
1955.53,1961.3,Giles,and find out what was in that stolen book.
1961.34,1965.57,Willow,I've never seen Buffy like that.
1961.34,1965.57,Willow,She just took off.
1965.97,1968.56,Xander,"Well, she didn't go home."
1965.97,1968.56,Xander,I let the phone ring
1968.6,1971.2,Xander,a few hundred times before
1968.6,1971.2,Xander,I remembered her mom is out of town.
1971.23,1973.34,Giles,"Well, maybe Buffy unplugged the phone."
1973.37,1979.18,Xander,"No, it's a statistical impossibility"
1973.37,1979.18,Xander,for a 16yearold girl to unplug her phone.
1979.53,1982.7,Giles,"Well, perhaps"
1979.53,1982.7,Giles,my words of caution were...
1982.73,1984.47,Giles,a little too alarming.
1984.47,1985.26,Xander,You think?
1985.26,1988.39,Willow,It's good that
1985.26,1988.39,Willow,"she took you seriously, Giles."
1988.43,1990.94,Willow,I just wish we knew where she was.
2007.78,2009.62,Buffy,Angel?
2103.63,2107.85,Willy,We're closed! Can't you read the sign?
2110.43,2113.83,Willy,"Oh. Hey, Angel."
2114.59,2117.67,Willy,I didn't recognize you
2114.59,2117.67,Willy,in the dark there.
2118.02,2121.77,Willy,"What, uh... What can I do for you tonight?"
2121.91,2124.06,Angel,I need some information.
2124.06,2124.51,Willy,Yeah?
2124.55,2129.6,Willy,"Man, that's too bad 'cause..."
2124.55,2129.6,Willy,I'm stayin' away from that whole scene.
2129.91,2132.07,Willy,"I'm livin' right, Angel."
2132.07,2133.87,Angel,"Sure you are, Willy."
2134.29,2137.64,Angel,And I'm takin' up sunbathing.
2138.04,2141.24,Willy,"Come on, man... Don't be that way."
2141.28,2146.82,Willy,I treat you vamps good.
2141.28,2146.82,Willy,I don't hassle you. You don't hassle me.
2146.85,2149.75,Willy,We all enjoy the patronage
2146.85,2149.75,Willy,of this establishment.
2149.79,2151.96,Willy,"Everybody's happy, right?"
2151.96,2153.18,Angel,Who sent them?
2154.31,2155.62,Willy,Who sent who?
2155.62,2157.64,Angel,The Order of Taraka.
2158.06,2161.94,Willy,I... I tell ya...
2158.06,2161.94,Willy,I haven't been in the loop.
2161.98,2166.85,Angel,Let's try again. The Order of Taraka.
2161.98,2166.85,Angel,They're after the Slayer.
2166.88,2169.55,Willy,"Come on, man..."
2170.57,2173.05,Angel,Was it Spike?
2173.09,2175.73,Willy,"Look, Angel. I got some good pig's"
2173.09,2175.73,Willy,"blood in. Good stuff, my friend said..."
2178.08,2181.74,Angel,You know... I'm a little rusty
2178.08,2181.74,Angel,when it comes to killing humans.
2181.74,2183.19,Angel,It could take a while.
2183.19,2185.55,Willy,"Spike will draw and quarter me, man!"
2185.59,2187.57,Angel,I'll take care of Spike.
2187.61,2189.62,Willy,You know he ordered those guys!
2189.62,2192.28,Willy,Spike's sick of your girl
2189.62,2192.28,Willy,getting in his way! Ow!
2192.31,2193.58,Angel,Where can I find him?
2193.58,2194.55,Willy,"I tell you that,"
2194.58,2196.79,Willy,I'm gonna need relocating expenses.
2196.79,2197.67,Angel,It'll cost ya!
2197.71,2199.6,Angel,It'll cost who?
2199.6,2200.48,Willy,"OK, OK."
2200.48,2202.8,Willy,He and that freaky chick of his are...
2243.77,2245.61,Angel,Who are you?
2245.61,2248.68,Angel,"If you tell me what I need to know,"
2245.61,2248.68,Angel,I won't hurt you.
2248.71,2251.16,Angel,You think this is funny?
2256.91,2259.11,Kendra,I tink it is funny now.
2259.41,2262.69,Kendra,Dat girl. De one I saw you wit before...
2262.69,2264.57,Angel,You stay away from her.
2264.61,2268.17,Kendra,I'm afraid you are not
2264.61,2268.17,Kendra,in a position to treaten.
2268.2,2270.24,Angel,"When I get outta here,"
2268.2,2270.24,Angel,I'll do more than threaten.
2270.24,2273.17,Kendra,Den I suggest you move quickly.
2275.05,2277.44,Kendra,Eastern exposure.
2277.44,2280.75,Giles,De sun will be comin' in a few hours.
2283.81,2285.35,Kendra,More dan enough time
2285.35,2287.73,Giles,for me to find your girlfriend.
2295.7,2297.37,Giles,Xander?
2297.57,2300.08,Giles,"No, no, II haven't heard from Buffy yet."
2297.57,2300.08,Giles,"Look, look,"
2300.08,2304.43,Giles,III think you should
2300.08,2304.43,Giles,go to her house and check on her.
2304.46,2308.98,Giles,"Well, right a, right away."
2309.01,2312.19,Giles,I don't know! Get Cordelia to drive you.
2326.16,2327.11,Giles,Willow...
2327.11,2329.66,Willow,Don't warn the tadpoles!
2329.7,2330.64,Giles,Are you all right?
2330.64,2332.25,Willow,"Giles, what are you doing here?"
2332.28,2335.7,Giles,"It's the library, Willow. You fell asleep."
2336.07,2337.25,Willow,"Oh, I..."
2337.25,2340.78,Giles,Don't warn the tadpoles?
2340.81,2345.15,Willow,I... I have frog fear.
2345.18,2347.57,Willow,I'm sorry. I conked out.
2347.6,2352.25,Giles,What? Please. You've gone
2347.6,2352.25,Giles,quite beyond the call of duty.
2352.29,2356.93,Giles,"But... fortunately, I think"
2352.29,2356.93,Giles,I may have found something finally.
2356.97,2357.53,Willow,You did?
2357.53,2358.99,Giles,I found a description
2358.99,2363.48,Giles,of the missing du Lac manuscript.
2358.99,2363.48,Giles,"It's a ritual, Willow."
2363.51,2369.06,Giles,"Now, II haven't managed to..."
2363.51,2369.06,Giles,"decipher the exact details, but II..."
2369.09,2371.7,Giles,I believe the purpose is to restore
2371.7,2374.68,Giles,a weak and sick vampire
2371.7,2374.68,Giles,back to full health.
2374.72,2377.5,Willow,A vampire like Drusilla?
2377.5,2378.43,Giles,Exactly.
2387.37,2391.63,Spike,"By George, I think he's got it!"
2392.96,2395.67,Spike,"The key to your cure, ducks."
2395.7,2398.51,Spike,The missing bloody link. It was...
2398.54,2402.52,Drusilla,Right... right in front of us...
2402.52,2405.98,Drusilla,the whole time.
2410.09,2413.57,Cordelia,I can't even believe you. You got me out of
2410.09,2413.57,Cordelia,bed for a ride?
2413.57,2415.27,Cordelia,What am I? Mass transportation?
2415.27,2416.92,Xander,"That's what a lot of guys say,"
2416.95,2418.95,Xander,but it's just lockerroom talk.
2416.95,2418.95,Xander,I wouldn't pay any mind.
2418.99,2421.54,Cordelia,"Oh, great. So now, I'm your taxi"
2418.99,2421.54,Cordelia,and your punching bag.
2421.57,2424.89,Xander,I like to think of you more as
2421.57,2424.89,Xander,"my witless foil, but have it your way."
2426.16,2429.1,Xander,Buffy!
2429.13,2431.81,Xander,"Come on, Cordelia. You wanna be"
2429.13,2431.81,Xander,a member of the Scooby Gang
2431.82,2434.09,Xander,you gotta be willing to be
2431.82,2434.09,Xander,inconvenienced every now and then.
2434.12,2438.23,Cordelia,"Oh, right. 'Cause I lie awake at night"
2434.12,2438.23,Cordelia,hoping you tweekos will be my best friends.
2438.27,2442.02,Cordelia,And that my first husband will be
2438.27,2442.02,Cordelia,"a balding, demented homeless man."
2442.06,2443.47,Xander,Buffy could be in trouble.
2443.47,2444.94,Cordelia,And what if she is exactly?
2444.94,2446.31,Cordelia,What are you gonna do about it?
2446.31,2447.54,Xander,"In case you haven't noticed,"
2447.58,2450.38,Xander,you're the lameness and
2447.58,2450.38,Xander,"she's the superchick, or whatever."
2450.41,2453.53,Xander,"At least I'm the lameness who cares,"
2450.41,2453.53,Xander,which is more than I can say about you.
2453.57,2455.23,Xander,Buffy!
2455.27,2457.7,Xander,I'm gonna check upstairs.
2460.24,2462.6,Xander,Buffy!
2480.26,2484.33,Norman,Good day. I'm Norman Pfister with
2480.26,2484.33,Norman,Blush Beautiful Skincare and Cosmetics.
2484.36,2488.09,Norman,I was wondering if I might
2484.36,2488.09,Norman,interest you in some free samples?
2488.12,2490.27,Cordelia,Free?
2530.94,2532.78,Buffy,You must be number two.
2538.45,2541.37,,"Thanks for the wakeup,"
2538.45,2541.37,,but I'll stick with my clock radio.
2550.33,2552.42,,Come on. Don't make me
2550.33,2552.42,,do the chickfight thing.
2552.84,2555.66,,Chick fight?
2552.84,2555.66,,You know...
2576.61,2578.49,,Who are you?
2576.61,2578.49,,Who am I?
2578.59,2580.56,,You attacked me!
2578.59,2580.56,,Who the hell are you?
2580.56,2585.49,,I am Kendra.
