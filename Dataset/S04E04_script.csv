2.93,5.45,,Parker Abrams. I'm at Kresky Hall.
5.53,7.81,,"Buffy Summers, Stevenson."
7.89,11.04,,Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
11.13,13.81,,What are you doing?
11.13,13.81,,Making a choice.
17.65,20.09,Buffy ,"Parker, did I do something wrong?"
20.09,21.57,Parker ,Didn't you have fun?
21.65,22.84,Buffy ,Is that all it was?
22.84,24.85,Parker ,What else was it supposed to be?
24.93,29.69,Buffy ,He's manipulative and shallow.
24.93,29.69,Buffy ,And why doesn't he want me?
29.77,33.45,Willow ,I think you're missing something
29.77,33.45,Willow ,about the whole poophead principle.
33.69,38.02,Xander ,Anya. Hi again.
37.97,40.89,Xander(voice ,"So, college not so scary after all?"
41.37,45.73,Buffy ,"It's turning out to be a lot like high school,"
41.37,45.73,Buffy ,which I can handle.
52.05,58.69,Xander ,"I don't know. I was going for ferociousscary,"
52.05,58.69,Xander ,but it's coming out more dryly sardonic.
58.77,61.65,Willow ,It does appear to be mocking you
58.77,61.65,Willow ,with its eyeholes.
61.73,65.12,Oz ,Yet its nosehole seems sad
61.73,65.12,Oz ,and full of selfIoathing.
65.85,67.84,Buffy ,"What do you think, Buff?"
68.77,72.08,Buffy ,I was just thinking about
68.77,72.08,Buffy ,the life of a pumpkin.
72.17,78.02,Buffy ,"Grow up in the sun,"
72.17,78.02,Buffy ,"happily entwined with others,"
76.09,81.93,Buffy ,"and then someone comes along,"
76.09,81.93,Buffy ,cuts you open and rips your guts out.
83.49,86.17,Buffy ,"OK. And on that happy note,"
86.73,91.09,Xander ,got a treat for tomorrow night's
86.73,91.09,Xander ,second annual Halloween screening.
91.17,96.96,Xander ,"People, prepare to have your spines tingled"
91.17,96.96,Xander ,and your gooses bumped by the terrifying...
97.05,98.41,Xander ,Fantasia.
98.65,99.85,Xander ,Fantasia?
100.29,102.57,Oz ,"Maybe it's the horrific things we've seen,"
102.65,106.25,Oz ,but hippos wearing tutus don't
102.65,106.25,Oz ,unnerve me the way they used to.
106.33,107.65,Xander ,Phantasm.
107.73,112.02,Xander ,It was supposed to be Phantasm.
110.09,111.89,Xander ,Stupid video store.
112.05,115.13,Willow ,I thought we were doing the AlphaDelt thing.
115.21,116.12,Xander ,What thing?
116.12,117.44,Buffy ,The scary house?
117.93,120.45,Buffy ,Sounds kinda lame.
117.93,120.45,Buffy ,But it borders on fun.
120.53,124.73,Oz ,You go through the scaryhouse maze
120.53,124.73,Oz ,"to get to the party, which is worth getting to."
124.81,127.25,Oz ,Those guys go all out.
127.25,130.02,Willow ,As witnessed last Friday.
128.09,129.69,Xander ,There's a party?
129.77,131.6,Willow ,We didn't tell you?
132.69,133.72,Willow ,"No, that's cool."
133.72,136.24,Xander ,You guys got your little college thing.
136.41,137.77,Xander ,I'm fine.
137.85,141.4,Xander ,"I mean, I got better things to do"
137.85,141.4,Xander ,than tag along to some fraternity.
141.49,142.95,Willow ,You can come.
142.95,143.29,Xander ,OK.
143.37,146.21,Xander ,Only because I lied about
143.37,146.21,Xander ,having better things to do.
146.29,148.68,Oz ,Blast will be had by all.
149.17,150.73,Buffy ,I'm gonna get going.
150.73,152.69,Xander ,Now? The night's still...
153.33,155.56,Xander ,"OK, it's a little mature, but still..."
155.73,158.73,Buffy ,I'm sleepy. You guys have fun.
158.81,160.73,Willow ,You want me to come with?
160.73,161.73,Buffy ,"No, I'm fine."
166.41,168.4,Xander ,Sad Buffy.
168.93,171.49,Willow ,She didn't even touch her pumpkin.
171.57,173.4,Willow ,It's a freak with no face.
173.49,176.13,Oz ,She's suffering postParker depression.
176.21,178.12,Xander ,Bailing on the Buff.
178.21,181.09,Xander ,Does anyone else wanna smack that guy?
185.02,187.07,Xander ,Advertise your product or brand here
187.07,189.07,Kid ,contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today
201.37,203.36,Kid ,"Jeez, that hurt."
203.73,206.41,Kid ,"What the hell's wrong with you, lady?"
209.37,211.36,Buffy ,That's what I'd like to know.
267.05,270.84,Willow ,I've got the basics down:
267.05,270.84,Willow ,"levitation, charms, glamours."
270.93,274.13,Willow ,"I just feel like I've plateaued, Wiccawise."
274.21,275.77,Buffy ,What's the next level?
275.85,280.48,Willow ,Transmutation. Conjuring.
275.85,280.48,Willow ,Bringing forth something from nothing.
280.57,284.89,Willow ,It gets you pretty close to
280.57,284.89,Willow ,the primal forces. A little scary.
284.97,287.97,Buffy ,"Well, no one's pushing."
284.97,287.97,Buffy ,"If it's too much, don't do it."
288.05,288.9,Buffy ,Don't do it?
288.9,291.36,Willow ,What kind of encouragement is that?
291.45,295.45,Buffy ,This is an encouragement talk?
291.45,295.45,Buffy ,I thought it was "share my pain".
296.05,297.73,Willow ,I don't know.
297.81,301.28,Willow ,"Then again, what is college for"
297.81,301.28,Willow ,if not experimenting?
301.37,305.65,Willow ,You know? Maybe I can handle it.
301.37,305.65,Willow ,I'll know when I've reached my limit.
305.73,307.37,Oz ,Wine coolers?
307.37,308.12,Buffy ,Magic.
308.21,310.06,Oz ,"Didn't encourage her, did you?"
310.06,312.09,Willow ,Where's Supportive Boyfriend Guy?
312.17,313.85,Oz ,Picking up your dry cleaning.
313.93,316.97,Oz ,He told me to tell you
313.93,316.97,Oz ,he's afraid you're gonna get hurt.
317.05,318.53,Oz ,"OK, Brutus."
320.05,321.61,Willow ,Brutus.
321.69,324.81,Willow ,Caesar? Betrayal? Trusted friend?
324.89,326.17,Willow ,Backstabby?
326.25,331.09,Oz ,"I'm with you on the reference,"
326.25,331.09,Oz ,but I won't lie about the fact that I'm worried.
331.17,334.48,Oz ,I know what it's like to have power
331.17,334.48,Oz ,you can't control.
334.57,340.21,Oz ,And every time I start to wolf out
334.57,340.21,Oz ,"I touch something deep, dark."
340.29,342.68,Oz ,It's not fun.
344.09,346.87,Oz ,"Butjust know that, whatever you decide,"
346.87,348.29,Buffy ,I'll back your play.
349.85,352.21,Buffy ,See? Concerned Boy. Sweet Boy.
352.29,356.17,Willow ,"I know. I kinda like him worrying, anyway."
361.33,363.37,Buffy ,"You know,"
363.45,366.81,Buffy ,I forgot to... be hungry.
367.45,369.25,Oz ,"Wait, Buffy."
370.33,371.69,Oz ,Buffy.
372.17,374.45,Willow ,Don't letjerky Parker chase you away.
374.53,376.21,Buffy ,He didn't.
376.29,378.89,Buffy ,I just don't wanna deal with this right now.
379.09,384.09,Buffy ,Taking a holiday from dealing. Happily
379.09,384.09,Buffy ,vacationing in the land of Not Coping.
384.49,388.73,Willow ,You'll feel better at the party tonight.
384.49,388.73,Willow ,Maybe you'll even meet someone.
388.81,390.72,Willow ,I don't wanna meet someone.
390.72,393.13,Buffy ,I've reached my quota on someones.
393.21,395.49,Buffy ,I'm gonna have to patrol anyway.
395.57,397.69,Willow ,Tonight? But it's Halloween.
397.77,402.4,Buffy ,"I'll doublecheck with Giles, but I'm sure"
397.77,402.4,Buffy ,he'll think I should be on slayer duty.
402.49,404.09,Buffy ,He doesn't care about Halloween.
404.61,405.73,Giles ,Happy Hal...
406.01,408.24,Giles ,"Hello, Buffy."
408.65,410.93,Buffy ,"Oh, my God."
411.45,412.66,Giles ,It's a sombrero.
412.66,414.33,Buffy ,And it's on your head.
414.45,416.49,Giles ,It seemed festive. Come in.
417.85,419.57,Giles ,Candy?
421.69,423.65,Buffy ,What's going on here?
423.73,425.77,Buffy ,You hate Halloween.
425.85,428.13,Buffy ,I've never said any such thing.
428.21,430.41,Giles ,"As my watcher's duties took precedence,"
430.49,434.85,Giles ,I simply hadn't taken time
430.49,434.85,Giles ,to embrace its inherent charms.
434.93,436.92,Giles ,Until now. Look.
437.81,439.61,Giles ,It's alive.
441.49,443.69,Giles ,See how he... shakes.
443.77,445.46,Giles ,Is there something you wanted?
445.46,447.37,Buffy ,I was thinking I'd patrol tonight.
447.45,450.33,Buffy ,Possibly the cemetery.
447.45,450.33,Buffy ,Or if you had a better...
451.49,453.97,Buffy ,Could you please take that off?
453.97,455.17,Giles ,Yes. Of course.
455.25,458.77,Giles ,I see. Is there some specific danger
455.25,458.77,Giles ,you were sensing?
458.85,463.17,Buffy ,No. But we were caught offguard when
458.85,463.17,Buffy ,Ethan turned everyone into their costumes.
463.25,465.37,Giles ,What happened then was anomalous.
465.45,469.13,Giles ,Creatures of the night shy away from
465.45,469.13,Giles ,Halloween. They find it too crass.
469.21,471.2,Buffy ,Hard to believe.
471.77,473.84,Giles ,Well... I promise you...
473.93,477.32,Giles ,Little likelihood of any
473.93,477.32,Giles ,supernatural activity tonight.
477.53,479.49,Giles ,Sure you don't want one?
495.77,497.76,Guy ,I come bearing spiders.
498.77,501.53,Guy ,Sound system's not gonna cut it.
498.77,501.53,Guy ,Nothin' but lame.
501.69,504.41,Guy ,You want me to call Oz?
501.69,504.41,Guy ,He could probably hook us up.
504.49,505.85,Guy ,Do it.
505.93,510.21,Guy ,"If we're not scaring the young women,"
505.93,510.21,Guy ,they will not fall into our arms.
510.29,511.93,Guy ,We'll have womanless arms.
512.13,517.41,Guy ,"Halloween's not about thrills, chills and"
512.13,517.41,Guy ,funny costumes. It's about getting laid.
517.57,520.17,Guy ,Is there a holiday that's
517.57,520.17,Guy ,not about getting laid?
520.25,524.02,Guy ,Arbor Day.
522.09,524.08,Guy ,"Call Oz, dude."
522.09,524.08,Guy ,Done.
524.17,528.88,Guy ,And you wanted a symbol to paint upstairs.
524.17,528.88,Guy ,Something mystical.
528.97,531.04,Guy ,Check this out.
539.97,543.2,Xander ,"Anya, you really have to get"
539.97,543.2,Xander ,this knocking thing down.
544.37,545.64,Xander ,How did you...?
545.64,547.84,Anya ,Your uncle Rory let me in.
547.93,550.56,Anya ,Does he always smell like peppermint?
550.56,552.48,Xander ,The man likes his schnapps.
552.57,554.42,Xander ,What are you doing here?
554.42,555.88,Anya ,You haven't called.
555.97,557.77,Anya ,Not once.
557.85,559.3,Xander ,You said you were over me.
559.3,560.81,Anya ,And you just accepted that?
560.89,563.57,Anya ,I said what I thought you wanted to hear.
563.65,568.49,Xander ,"Well, I tend to hear the actual words"
563.65,568.49,Xander ,people say and accept them at face value.
568.57,569.77,Anya ,That's stupid.
569.77,570.96,Xander ,I accept that.
573.25,577.33,Xander ,I can't say seeing you falls
573.25,577.33,Xander ,into the realm of a bad thing.
579.13,581.12,Anya ,Really?
582.61,586.93,Anya ,I thought maybe we could go out
582.61,586.93,Anya ,"tonight, for our anniversary."
587.01,590.02,Xander ,Anniversary?
588.09,590.85,Anya ,It's been exactly one week
588.09,590.85,Anya ,since we copulated.
590.93,592.13,Anya ,Did you forget?
592.21,597.21,Xander ,No. Of course not. It's just I already
592.21,597.21,Xander ,"have plans with Buffy, Willow and Oz."
597.29,598.95,Xander ,"It's Halloween, you know."
598.95,600.21,Anya ,I don't understand.
600.29,602.36,Xander ,"Every October 31st, we mortals dress up..."
602.45,605.84,Anya ,"No, no, I understand that inane ritual."
602.45,605.84,Anya ,It's those people.
605.93,608.97,Anya ,"You associate with them,"
605.93,608.97,Anya ,though you share little in common.
609.05,610.57,Xander ,What are you talkin' about?
610.65,613.21,Anya ,"I mean, they go to college. You don't."
613.49,616.09,Anya ,They no longer live at home. You do.
616.17,618.29,Anya ,"Well, those things..."
619.25,624.25,Xander ,The bonds of true friendships transcend...
619.25,624.25,Xander ,Could we change the subject?
624.33,627.17,Anya ,OK. Don't get upset with me. I just wondered.
627.89,631.17,Xander ,"If you want, you can come"
627.89,631.17,Xander ,with me tonight to this party.
632.09,634.08,Anya ,You mean like a date?
635.17,637.16,Anya ,Is that what this is?
639.37,641.44,Anya ,Are we dating?
642.29,646.17,Xander ,There are definitely datelike
642.29,646.17,Xander ,qualities at work here.
647.05,648.53,Xander ,You'll need a costume.
648.53,649.2,Anya ,A costume?
649.29,654.02,Xander ,"Dress up. You know, something scary."
652.09,654.16,Anya ,Scary? Scary how?
654.37,658.73,Xander ,"Anya, you, exdemon,"
654.37,658.73,Xander ,terrorised mankind for centuries.
658.81,661.81,Xander ,I'm sure you'll come up with something.
664.61,666.6,Buffy ,"Excuse me, Professor Walsh."
668.17,670.81,Buffy ,I came to get today's assignments.
670.89,674.77,Buffy ,"I couldn't make it to class,"
670.89,674.77,Buffy ,for personal reasons.
674.85,679.88,Walsh ,"Right. I count four limbs,"
674.85,679.88,Walsh ,"a head, no visible scarring,"
679.97,683.36,Walsh ,so I assume your personal issue
679.97,683.36,Walsh ,"wasn't lifethreatening,"
683.45,685.49,Walsh ,and am therefore uninterested.
685.57,690.57,Walsh ,"You got problems, solve 'em on your own"
685.57,690.57,Walsh ,time. Miss another class and you're out.
693.09,695.08,Riley ,"She means it, you know."
695.53,699.32,Buffy ,Yeah. I got the impression
695.53,699.32,Buffy ,she wasn't saying it to make me laugh.
699.41,704.49,Riley ,Your work's taken a downturn lately. I can't
699.41,704.49,Riley ,remember the last time I saw your hand up.
704.57,706.37,Buffy ,Does stretching count?
706.45,710.33,Riley ,"Look, things get pretty intense"
706.45,710.33,Riley ,"freshman year, as I dimly recall."
710.41,712.09,Riley ,Too much fun or not enough?
713.45,715.57,Buffy ,"Both, actually."
716.17,720.09,Riley ,You gotta keep your priorities.
716.17,720.09,Riley ,Professor Walsh is worth your time.
720.17,722.4,Buffy ,Thanks. I'll get this done tonight.
722.49,723.77,Buffy ,Tonight.
723.85,726.53,Riley ,It's Halloween.
723.85,726.53,Riley ,You're not gonna dress up and party?
726.61,728.6,Buffy ,I have a lot of work to do.
729.21,731.44,Riley ,"It's not really my business,"
731.53,735.32,Riley ,but you seem like a person who makes
731.53,735.32,Riley ,things really hard on themselves.
735.41,739.69,Riley ,Halloween isn't a night for responsibility.
735.41,739.69,Riley ,It's when the ghosts and goblins come out.
739.77,741.57,Buffy ,That's actually a misnomer.
742.13,743.77,Riley ,I didn't mean real ones.
746.25,748.64,Riley ,But there is good scary fun
746.25,748.64,Riley ,on campus tonight.
748.73,750.21,Buffy ,What are you doing?
750.21,753.09,Riley ,I am gonna sit here and grade papers.
753.17,754.4,Buffy ,Scary.
754.49,755.64,Riley ,Very.
755.73,758.04,Buffy ,"Well, thanks for the pep talk, coach."
758.13,760.77,Riley ,Don't make fun.
758.13,760.77,Riley ,I worked hard to get this pompous.
760.93,762.33,Buffy ,"No, I mean it."
764.09,766.13,Riley ,You're welcome.
779.13,782.81,Guy ,"OK, watch your step, boys."
779.13,782.81,Guy ,Paint's still wet in a few spots.
782.89,785.45,Guy ,"Thanks for the loan, man."
782.89,785.45,Guy ,Our sound system sucks.
785.53,787.29,Oz ,Mi Casio es su Casio.
789.13,792.92,Xander ,"Well, that's an interesting little design."
789.13,792.92,Xander ,What does it mean?
793.01,794.21,Guy ,No clue.
794.29,796.73,Guy ,I got it out of this book...
796.81,798.41,Xander ,Grapes!
800.17,803.21,Xander ,"Wow, peeled. You guys know"
800.17,803.21,Xander ,how to spoil your guests.
803.29,804.77,Guy ,"Eyeballs, man."
804.85,808.93,Guy ,"Blindfold chicks, put their hands in"
804.85,808.93,Guy ,"the bowl, then tell them it's eyeballs."
809.01,810.73,Guy ,They love that.
810.81,813.2,Guy ,And I was wasting time buying them flowers
813.2,815.36,Xander ,and complimenting them on their shoes.
815.45,819.77,Xander ,"So, you go through the whole house of"
815.45,819.77,Xander ,horrors downstairs and it ends up here.
819.85,821.21,Xander ,Sweet.
821.29,823.25,Xander ,You fratly guys have a nice setup.
823.33,826.33,Guy ,Mighty Alpha Delts.
823.33,826.33,Guy ,You should think about pledging.
826.41,828.77,Oz ,Xander's a civilian.
828.85,832.08,Guy ,A townie? I didn't know. You look so normal.
832.33,835.26,Guy ,Sure we should let him come to the party?
835.26,836.69,Xander ,Standing right here.
839.37,840.36,Guy ,Cranking!
842.57,846.81,Oz ,"Sensing a disturbance in the Force, master?"
842.57,846.81,Oz ,Left speaker's crackling.
846.89,849.33,Xander ,And stabbing it is the proper solution?
849.41,852.29,Oz ,I'm just gonna trim the wire.
849.41,852.29,Oz ,It might be a short.
853.41,854.4,Xander ,Oz?
855.25,856.97,Oz ,Cut myself.
857.05,858.57,Oz ,It's OK.
858.73,861.45,Xander ,Playing with knives? Fun. Yes. But not safe.
861.53,865.13,Xander ,And when you bleed to death
861.53,865.13,Xander ,I got dibs on your equipment.
878.77,880.64,Buffy ,Thanks again for doing this.
880.64,882.65,Joyce ,I'm just glad I could find it.
882.73,884.88,Joyce ,There. Try it now.
884.97,888.28,Joyce ,I let down the hem and loosened it
884.97,888.28,Joyce ,a little around the hood.
888.37,890.36,Buffy ,That feels better.
892.73,896.44,Buffy ,"Oh, no. Someone's getting Nostalgic Face."
896.53,900.45,Joyce ,I'm sorry. I'm thinking about
896.53,900.45,Joyce ,that little girl who wore that.
900.85,903.16,Joyce ,What is it? Five? Six years ago?
903.49,909.02,Buffy ,When Little Red Riding Hood
903.49,909.02,Buffy ,was the cutting edge in costumes.
907.09,909.93,Joyce ,Your father loved to take you out.
910.01,913.8,Buffy ,He was such a pain. 12 years old
910.01,913.8,Buffy ,and no trickortreating by myself?
913.89,915.71,Joyce ,He just wanted to keep you safe.
915.71,918.09,Buffy ,He wanted the candy. I was just the beard.
918.17,921.61,Joyce ,"That's not true, actually."
918.17,921.61,Joyce ,The candy was for me.
922.29,924.73,Joyce ,Your father loved spending time with you.
926.05,927.88,Buffy ,"Not enough, I guess."
928.97,930.12,Joyce ,Buffy.
932.45,934.97,Buffy ,Thatjust paved right over Memory Lane.
935.05,936.16,Buffy ,You know the divorce
936.16,937.65,Joyce ,had nothing to do with you.
938.25,940.24,Buffy ,I don't know.
941.05,943.81,Buffy ,I'm starting to feel like there's a pattern here.
943.89,947.33,Buffy ,Open your heart to someone
943.89,947.33,Buffy ,and he bails on you.
948.21,951.49,Buffy ,Maybe it's easier to just not let anyone in.
953.05,955.44,Joyce ,I thought it might be easier.
955.65,958.53,Joyce ,You must've noticed
955.65,958.53,Joyce ,I'm not the social butterfly
958.61,961.08,Joyce ,that I was when I was with your dad.
961.17,965.61,Joyce ,I don't think I made a single new friend
961.17,965.61,Joyce ,the year we moved to Sunnydale.
966.41,967.64,Buffy ,Why not?
968.89,970.88,Joyce ,Fear.
971.77,974.92,Joyce ,I didn't believe I could trust anyone again.
975.01,979.8,Joyce ,"It's taken time and a lot of effort,"
975.01,979.8,Joyce ,but I've got a nice circle of friends now.
980.81,984.69,Joyce ,"I mean, don't get me wrong,"
980.81,984.69,Joyce ,I'm still a little gunshy.
984.77,989.37,Joyce ,It certainly didn't help that my last boyfriend
984.77,989.37,Joyce ,turned out to be a homicidal robot.
990.85,993.85,Joyce ,I will always be here for you.
994.49,996.93,Willow ,And you've got Mr Giles and your friends.
999.05,1002.33,Willow ,"Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of."
1018.53,1023.02,Willow ,"No, I'll just meet you at your place."
1021.09,1024.13,Willow ,"Buffy said she was coming,"
1021.09,1024.13,Willow ,but I haven't seen her.
1024.21,1028.21,Willow ,We have to make sure she has fun.
1024.21,1028.21,Willow ,We have to force fun upon her.
1028.97,1032.33,Willow ,"And if Parker shows up,"
1028.97,1032.33,Willow ,we'll just axemurder him.
1032.41,1034.24,Willow ,That's Halloweeny.
1034.33,1035.93,Tall ,OK. See you in a bit.
1043.69,1045.49,Tall ,You gonna stop by the room?
1045.57,1048.72,Willow ,I'm late for battle or I would.
1045.57,1048.72,Willow ,"I love your outfit, though."
1052.65,1054.37,Lobster ,There is nothing going on here.
1054.37,1055.93,Present ,I saw you flirting with her.
1056.05,1059.81,Lobster ,Do we have to do this every time?
1056.05,1059.81,Lobster ,I love you. You know that.
1067.97,1070.53,Guy ,"OK, Rach, what's in the next one?"
1070.61,1071.86,Rachel ,You guys are sick.
1071.86,1073.53,Guy ,"Here, give me your hand."
1074.89,1078.02,Rachel ,This is gross.
1076.09,1078.81,Guy ,"Eyeballs, Rachel. They're eyeballs."
1089.69,1091.49,Xander ,"Hey, Red."
1091.57,1093.69,Xander ,"What you got in the basket, little girl?"
1093.77,1095.17,Buffy ,Weapons.
1097.01,1098.81,Buffy ,Just in case.
1099.25,1103.41,Buffy ,"Like the tux, Xander."
1099.25,1103.41,Buffy ,Bond. James Bond.
1103.49,1104.64,Buffy ,In case we get turned
1104.64,1105.96,Xander ,"into our costumes again,"
1106.05,1108.36,Xander ,I'm going for Cool SecretAgent Guy.
1108.45,1112.16,Buffy ,"I hate to break it to you, but you'll"
1108.45,1112.16,Buffy ,probably end up Cool Headwaiter Guy.
1112.25,1115.37,Xander ,As long as I'm cool
1112.25,1115.37,Xander ,and wield some kind of power.
1115.45,1117.33,Buffy ,Will. Medieval Will.
1117.41,1120.33,Xander ,"Hail, ye old varletty, thou."
1120.41,1126.02,Willow ,I'm Joan of Arc.
1120.41,1126.02,Willow ,"I figured we had a lot in common,"
1124.09,1126.85,Willow ,seeing as how I was almost
1124.09,1126.85,Willow ,burned at the stake.
1126.93,1130.16,Willow ,And plus she had that close
1126.93,1130.16,Willow ,relationship with God.
1130.85,1132.92,Oz ,And you are?
1134.77,1139.05,Xander ,Of course. I wish I'd thought of that
1134.77,1139.05,Xander ,before I put down my deposit.
1139.73,1141.37,Xander ,I could've been God.
1141.45,1143.05,Oz ,Blasphemer.
1151.73,1154.73,Buffy ,Nice costumes. Very stealthy.
1155.13,1157.09,Willow ,What are they supposed to be?
1157.17,1159.05,Oz ,NATO?
1159.13,1165.21,Xander ,"I invited Anya to join us, but she's having"
1159.13,1165.21,Xander ,"some trouble finding a scary costume,"
1165.29,1167.52,Xander ,so she's just gonna meet us there.
1167.61,1171.21,Buffy ,Perfect. Everybody's got a date
1167.61,1171.21,Buffy ,but thirdwheel Buffy.
1171.29,1172.9,Willow ,You're not a third wheel.
1172.9,1175.68,Xander ,"Technically speaking, you're a fifth wheel."
1176.81,1181.02,Buffy ,We're gonna have the best time.
1214.17,1216.4,Oz ,Let the horrors begin.
1220.05,1221.69,Guy ,God help me.
1227.97,1231.6,Voice ,Release me.
1242.73,1245.93,Xander ,The joint's notjumpin'. Where is everybody?
1246.89,1248.88,Oz ,Follow the signs.
1251.13,1256.25,Buffy ,"Terrifying. If I were Abbott and Costello,"
1251.13,1256.25,Buffy ,this would be fairly traumatic.
1264.05,1265.49,Willow ,Cobweb.
1265.57,1268.13,Willow ,"OK, that part was realistic."
1268.21,1272.97,Oz ,Frat boys aren't too obsessive with their
1268.21,1272.97,Oz ,cleaning. It might not be decoration per se.
1277.49,1279.88,Xander ,I wasn't scared. I was in the spirit.
1280.13,1283.92,Willow ,And we'll back you up on that.
1280.13,1283.92,Willow ,Even if they question us separately.
1287.29,1288.73,Willow ,Get it off.
1289.97,1290.93,Oz ,It's gone.
1290.93,1293.33,Willow ,"OK, that is not sanitary."
1294.01,1299.02,Buffy ,Let's get to the party part of the party.
1297.09,1298.41,Buffy ,Yeah.
1298.49,1300.62,Oz ,Are you sure it's off me?
1300.62,1301.05,Buffy ,Yeah.
1308.05,1309.69,Oz ,I thought this led to...
1309.77,1311.57,Buffy ,What is it?
1312.29,1314.05,Buffy ,Blood.
1314.61,1315.76,Buffy ,Real blood.
1315.89,1320.09,Xander ,"OK, actual creeps have been given."
1315.89,1320.09,Xander ,"Bravo, frat boys."
1321.41,1324.96,Buffy ,Do you hear something?
1321.41,1324.96,Buffy ,Like a squeaking noise?
1325.37,1327.76,Xander ,It's these rented shoes. Patent leather.
1327.85,1329.61,Willow ,"No, no, no. Wait."
1329.69,1333.29,Willow ,"It's something else. I hear it, too."
1329.69,1333.29,Willow ,It's something like...
1350.21,1352.13,Willow ,"Oz, don't. It might be..."
1352.13,1354.29,Oz ,Rubber. It's made of rubber.
1355.33,1357.4,Buffy ,What the hell is going on here?
1357.49,1361.33,Xander ,"Look, maybe it's nothing."
1357.49,1361.33,Xander ,Maybe it's just a neat trick.
1361.85,1364.16,Xander ,Something done with wires or...
1364.25,1367.37,Rumbling ,Release me!
1367.45,1369.68,Xander ,Or it might be something else.
1385.97,1387.96,Anya ,Where's the door?
1396.65,1398.25,Anya ,Hello.
1416.13,1418.69,Girl ,"Help me! Help me, please!"
1424.01,1425.53,Anya ,Xander.
1429.13,1431.12,Xander ,Where's the stairs?
1431.29,1433.05,Willow ,Where's the door?
1433.13,1437.33,Buffy ,"This is the way we came in, right?"
1433.13,1437.33,Buffy ,We just went in a circle.
1437.77,1439.09,Buffy ,Thank the Lord.
1439.17,1440.29,Oz ,You're welcome.
1440.37,1442.76,Willow ,I have a neat idea. Let's get out of here.
1442.85,1444.81,Buffy ,You were so anxious for me to come.
1444.81,1446.93,Willow ,We don't know what we're dealing with.
1447.01,1449.85,Xander ,"OK, my turn. Does anyone hear that?"
1450.57,1454.57,Buffy ,"Well, as soon as we start dealing with it..."
1450.57,1454.57,Buffy ,Do you hear something?
1454.65,1457.61,Xander ,"Like I said, it sounds like a hissing."
1458.61,1460.76,Buffy ,It's like a "ssss" noise.
1461.57,1465.28,Xander ,I thought the word "hissing"
1461.57,1465.28,Xander ,kind of covered that nicely.
1472.41,1475.41,Chaz ,I'm sorry. I didn't know. Sorry.
1475.49,1476.3,Oz ,Chaz?
1476.3,1478.25,Chaz ,Didn't know.
1478.33,1479.89,Oz ,What's happening?
1479.97,1481.37,Chaz ,It...
1482.65,1483.77,Buffy ,What is it?
1483.77,1484.88,Chaz ,It's alive.
1504.69,1506.68,Buffy ,What's alive?
1509.05,1510.06,Xander ,He's in shock.
1510.06,1511.85,Buffy ,"Chaz, what happened here?"
1521.77,1523.49,Buffy ,I think the cape took most of it.
1523.49,1524.69,Oz ,It could need stitches.
1524.77,1526.45,Oz ,At least get a bandage.
1534.21,1537.52,Oz ,Cowering in a closet
1534.21,1537.52,Oz ,seems like a reasonable plan.
1539.57,1541.56,Buffy ,What closet?
1543.33,1546.21,Willow ,I'm gonna go upstairs and
1543.33,1546.21,Willow ,see if there are people up there.
1546.29,1548.73,Willow ,If you guys find a way
1546.29,1548.73,Willow ,"out of the house, use it."
1548.81,1552.25,Willow ,You're telling us to run away
1548.81,1552.25,Willow ,and leave you behind?
1552.93,1557.17,Buffy ,We need help. We need the only person
1552.93,1557.17,Buffy ,that can make sense of what's happening.
1564.49,1566.17,Giles ,Just a minute.
1566.25,1567.85,Giles ,Coming.
1569.81,1570.77,Giles ,Happy Ha...
1570.85,1573.97,Anya ,Xander's in trouble.
1570.85,1573.97,Anya ,You've gotta do something now.
1574.05,1576.17,Anya ,Are you listening? Xander's trapped.
1576.25,1578.21,Giles ,Where's Buffy and the others?
1578.21,1580.72,Anya ,"Trapped, but we've gotta save Xander."
1580.81,1583.41,Giles ,Slow down. I need you to be more specific.
1583.81,1586.41,Anya ,We were supposed to meet at this house.
1586.49,1589.13,Anya ,I got there and there was no door
1586.49,1589.13,Anya ,where a door should be.
1589.21,1592.29,Anya ,"I see a girl standing in a window,"
1589.21,1592.29,Anya ,and then "poof!" She's gone.
1592.37,1594.02,Giles ,She vanished from the window?
1594.02,1596.25,Anya ,"No, the window vanished from the house."
1596.33,1600.8,Giles ,Matterandreality distortion.
1596.33,1600.8,Giles ,Like a summoning spell's temporal flux.
1600.89,1602.33,Anya ,What?
1603.09,1606.32,Giles ,Never mind.
1603.09,1606.32,Giles ,I just need to get some supplies together.
1610.01,1616.02,Giles ,I wouldn't worry about Xander.
1610.01,1616.02,Giles ,At least he's amongst friends.
1614.09,1615.21,Buffy ,I'm telling you...
1615.21,1616.32,Willow ,You're telling me?
1616.41,1618.64,Buffy ,I can't do my job if I'm worrying about you.
1618.64,1619.8,Willow ,It's not your decision.
1619.89,1621.4,Buffy ,Gotta disagree with you there.
1621.4,1622.25,Willow ,Of course you do.
1622.33,1626.02,Xander ,Let's all take a breath. Buffy...
1624.09,1626.77,Willow ,Being the Slayer doesn't make you the boss.
1626.85,1628.61,Willow ,You're as lost as the rest of us.
1628.69,1630.49,Oz ,What are we talking about?
1630.57,1636.09,Willow ,It's a simple incantation. A guiding spell for
1630.57,1636.09,Willow ,travellers when they get lost or disoriented.
1636.17,1637.32,Buffy ,How's it work?
1637.41,1643.02,Willow ,It conjures an emissary from the beyond
1637.41,1643.02,Willow ,that lights the way.
1641.21,1643.77,Buffy ,"Conjuring. Will, let's be realistic here."
1643.85,1646.61,Buffy ,Your basic spells are usually only fiftyfifty.
1647.49,1648.81,Willow ,Yeah?
1648.89,1651.28,Willow ,"Well, so's your face."
1653.25,1654.65,Buffy ,What?
1655.33,1656.73,Buffy ,What does that mean?
1656.81,1658.53,Willow ,I'm not your sidekick.
1658.61,1660.09,Xander ,"Will, hang on."
1663.21,1665.28,Xander ,"Well, that was a bunch of laughs."
1666.45,1671.61,Xander ,"Look, Buffy, we're all tired and a little edgy."
1666.45,1671.61,Xander ,Maybe Willow's overreacting.
1671.69,1674.73,Xander ,Part of it's because you've been
1671.69,1674.73,Xander ,Pushing Away Girl lately.
1674.81,1678.33,Xander ,But now's not the time
1674.81,1678.33,Xander ,to let that stuff tear us apart.
1678.41,1681.96,Xander ,"What I'm saying is, I'm right with ya."
1678.41,1681.96,Xander ,Right by your side.
1682.05,1686.02,Buffy ,Xander?
1684.09,1687.8,Xander ,Funny how you still haven't lost
1684.09,1687.8,Xander ,your sense of inappropriate humour.
1687.89,1689.85,Buffy ,"Xander, where did you go?"
1689.93,1692.69,Xander ,"Buffy, knock it off."
1689.93,1692.69,Xander ,The skit's over. I'm right here.
1692.77,1694.41,Buffy ,This is so typical of him.
1694.73,1695.88,Xander ,Typical?
1696.09,1697.21,Buffy ,Xander?
1697.61,1701.02,Xander ,Buffy!
1709.77,1711.17,Xander ,Buff?
1725.93,1728.65,Willow ,She thinks I'm not ready
1725.93,1728.65,Willow ,to be a fullblown witch.
1728.73,1731.69,Willow ,I can handle the dark forces
1728.73,1731.69,Willow ,as good as anyone else.
1731.77,1734.64,Willow ,"It's not that hard. It's just a guiding spell,"
1734.64,1736.13,Oz ,and I'm careful an' all.
1736.93,1739.24,Oz ,This floor used to have windows.
1739.33,1741.85,Willow ,Look. We found the stairs.
1744.17,1746.73,Willow ,"Buffy didn't find stairs. No, sir."
1747.49,1750.33,Willow ,I don't think you guys are thinking clearly.
1757.41,1759.77,Willow ,We just need to get up to the goat room and...
1759.85,1762.25,Oz ,"Willow, something's happening."
1762.25,1763.45,Willow ,Something good?
1766.41,1768.64,Willow ,"Oh, no. Not good."
1769.89,1771.25,Oz ,I'm changing.
1771.41,1774.17,Willow ,But you can't. There's no moon tonight.
1774.53,1775.89,Oz ,I have to get away.
1776.49,1780.96,Willow ,No. We need to find something to restrain
1776.49,1780.96,Willow ,"you, like a rope or chains or something."
1781.05,1783.04,Oz ,There's no time.
1783.37,1786.21,Willow ,I can do the guiding spell.
1783.37,1786.21,Willow ,I know I can make it work.
1786.29,1787.49,Oz ,"Will, please."
1787.49,1787.77,Willow ,No!
1787.85,1789.37,Willow ,No!
1792.13,1793.53,Willow ,Oz!
1794.41,1796.32,Willow ,"Oz, don't leave me."
1807.45,1810.13,Xander ,There I am. I didn't go anywhere.
1810.21,1814.05,Xander ,Great. Now I just got to live with the fact
1810.21,1814.05,Xander ,that no one else can see me.
1814.13,1816.33,Head ,I can see you.
1821.41,1824.41,Oz ,You're not gonna change.
1821.41,1824.41,Oz ,You're not gonna change...
1856.05,1858.12,Oz ,OK. OK.
1858.21,1861.49,Willow ,"Aradia, Goddess of the Lost,"
1861.57,1865.04,Willow ,"the path is murky, the woods are dense."
1865.13,1867.49,Willow ,Darkness pervades.
1867.57,1870.13,Willow ,"I beseech thee, bring the light."
1874.25,1876.05,Willow ,I did it.
1876.13,1878.12,Willow ,I did you. Hi.
1880.01,1883.09,Willow ,Right. You're waiting for instructions.
1883.17,1885.16,Willow ,Lead me to Oz.
1887.05,1891.09,Willow ,Wait. I should try to find the people
1887.05,1891.09,Willow ,trapped upstairs first.
1892.09,1894.97,Willow ,But we still have to find a way
1892.09,1894.97,Willow ,out of the house.
1895.05,1899.02,Willow ,"OK, here's what we should do."
1898.49,1900.48,Willow ,What's going on? Stop.
1901.73,1903.56,Willow ,Stop it.
1905.37,1906.65,Willow ,Get off.
1909.45,1911.57,Willow ,Oz! Help!
1920.49,1922.88,Willow ,Help! Help me! Oz!
1924.05,1926.04,Willow ,Someone help!
1934.25,1936.24,Buffy ,Willow.
1963.21,1965.2,Buffy ,Basement.
1965.73,1968.25,Buffy ,I must be in the basement?
1969.25,1971.24,Hollow ,All alone.
1971.69,1973.68,Buffy ,Who said that?
1977.25,1979.24,Guy ,They all ran away from you.
1980.49,1982.48,Guy ,They always will.
1982.73,1985.12,Guy ,Open your heart to someone and...
1988.37,1991.89,Guy ,"Don't fret, little girl. You're not alone."
1996.45,1998.25,Guy ,Any more.
2020.25,2021.85,Anya ,Well?
2023.61,2028.02,Giles ,We're gonna have to create a door.
2029.13,2031.12,Anya ,Create a door? You can do that?
2031.21,2032.12,Giles ,I can.
2044.81,2048.25,Broken ,"No matter how hard you fight,"
2044.81,2048.25,Broken ,you just end up in the same place.
2058.45,2060.68,Broken ,I don't see why you bother.
2076.97,2078.57,Buffy ,I'm upstairs.
2079.93,2081.92,Buffy ,The goat room.
2106.33,2107.4,Buffy ,Oz?
2107.57,2109.85,Willow ,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off!
2112.05,2113.81,Oz ,Willow.
2113.89,2114.8,Oz ,What's wrong?
2114.8,2116.41,Willow ,Couldn't get 'em off...
2116.49,2117.72,Oz ,It's OK.
2119.93,2121.73,Oz ,We're OK.
2121.81,2124.09,Buffy ,We're not OK. We need to get out of here.
2124.17,2127.32,Xander ,"I'd offer my opinion,"
2124.17,2127.32,Xander ,but you jerks aren't gonna hear it.
2127.41,2130.85,Xander ,Not that Didn't Go To College Boy
2127.41,2130.85,Xander ,has anything important to say.
2130.93,2133.93,Xander ,I might as well hang out with
2130.93,2133.93,Xander ,Bleeding Dummy Head...
2134.01,2135.53,Buffy ,What is wrong with you?
2135.61,2141.02,Xander ,You heard that? You can see me?
2141.25,2143.53,Xander ,"Good. Oh, God, good!"
2143.73,2147.44,Oz ,The house separated us.
2143.73,2147.44,Oz ,Like it wanted to scare us.
2147.53,2149.25,Willow ,But we got away.
2149.33,2151.8,Buffy ,No. We were brought here.
2153.09,2156.17,Buffy ,We all got so scared that we ended up here.
2157.97,2159.96,Buffy ,Why?
2162.33,2164.69,Xander ,I saw them painting that.
2165.93,2168.69,Xander ,They were copying out of...
2169.13,2171.09,Xander ,that.
2172.17,2173.94,Willow ,I think it's Gaelic.
2173.94,2175.53,Buffy ,Can you translate?
2175.61,2178.61,Rumbling ,Release me.
2181.89,2184.09,Buffy ,"Will, give me something."
2184.09,2184.36,Willow ,OK.
2184.45,2186.65,Willow ,The icon's called the Mark of Gachnar.
2186.85,2193.02,Willow ,I think this is a summoning spell
2186.85,2193.02,Willow ,for something called...
2191.17,2192.08,Xander ,Gachnar?
2192.17,2196.93,Willow ,"Well, yes. Somehow the beginning"
2192.17,2196.93,Willow ,of the spell must've been triggered.
2197.13,2200.81,Willow ,Gachnar's trying to manifest itself
2197.13,2200.81,Willow ,to come into being.
2200.89,2201.37,Buffy ,How?
2201.37,2203.41,Willow ,It feeds on fear.
2204.49,2208.09,Buffy ,Our fears are manifesting. We're feeding it.
2204.49,2208.09,Buffy ,We need to stop.
2208.17,2211.09,Xander ,"If we close our eyes and say it's a dream,"
2211.17,2214.25,Xander ,it'll stab us to death. These things are real.
2214.33,2218.12,Buffy ,"OK, so our fears are feeding it."
2214.33,2218.12,Buffy ,If we get everyone out of here...
2221.85,2224.16,Xander ,Good plan. Let's go.
2230.13,2233.05,Xander ,"Giles? Everyone, it's Giles."
2233.13,2235.17,Xander ,With a chain saw.
2235.25,2236.75,Xander ,Glad you could make it.
2236.75,2238.77,Giles ,The wall's closed up behind us.
2241.69,2243.68,Giles ,Gachnar. Of course.
2243.97,2248.36,Giles ,"Its presence infects the reality of the house,"
2243.97,2248.36,Giles ,but it's not achieved full manifestation.
2248.45,2250.6,Giles ,We cannot allow this to come into being.
2250.69,2252.65,Buffy ,"But if it does, I can fight it, right?"
2252.73,2253.88,Giles ,Buffy...
2255.49,2256.66,Giles ,This is Gachnar.
2256.66,2258.49,Buffy ,I don't wanna fight that.
2258.97,2260.41,Buffy ,So we break the spell.
2260.41,2261.53,Xander ,Let's do it fast.
2261.61,2263.13,Giles ,I have it.
2263.21,2266.73,Giles ,The summoning spell for Gachnar
2263.21,2266.73,Giles ,can be shut down in one of two ways."
2266.81,2269.04,Giles ,Destroying the Mark of Gachnar...
2276.85,2281.32,Giles ,"is not one of them, and will immediately"
2276.85,2281.32,Giles ,bring forth the fear demon itself."
2285.73,2287.13,Willow ,Look.
2319.01,2323.02,Buffy ,This is Gachnar?
2321.09,2324.09,Xander ,Big overture. Little show.
2324.45,2328.89,Gachnar ,I am the Dark Lord of Nightmares.
2329.21,2331.44,Gachnar ,The bringer of terror.
2331.53,2334.89,Gachnar ,Tremble before me.
2334.97,2337.69,Gachnar ,Fear me.
2339.69,2340.84,Willow ,He's so cute.
2341.53,2346.02,Xander ,Who's a little fear demon? Come on.
2346.01,2348.13,Giles ,Don't taunt the fear demon.
2348.21,2349.83,Xander ,"Why, can he hurt me?"
2349.83,2351.44,Giles ,"No, it's just tacky."
2351.77,2354.53,Giles ,"Be that as it may, Buffy,"
2351.77,2354.53,Giles ,when it comes to slaying...
2354.61,2355.88,Buffy ,Size doesn't matter?
2355.88,2358.61,Gachnar ,"They're all going to abandon you, you know."
2358.89,2360.61,Buffy ,"Yeah, yeah."
2364.21,2366.17,Oz ,"Some quality treats here, Giles."
2366.25,2367.65,Giles ,"Please, finish them."
2367.73,2372.12,Buffy ,This is much better. There is no problem
2367.73,2372.12,Buffy ,that cannot be solved by chocolate.
2372.21,2375.37,Willow ,I think I'm gonna barf.
2375.37,2377.02,Buffy ,Except that.
2380.73,2382.33,Anya ,What?
2383.57,2385.69,Xander ,That's your scary costume?
2386.53,2388.41,Anya ,Bunnies frighten me.
2388.49,2391.9,Giles ,Bloody hell. The inscription.
2391.9,2394.02,Buffy ,What's the matter?
2392.09,2400.02,Giles ,I should've translated the Gaelic inscription
2392.09,2400.02,Giles ,under the illustration of Gachnar.
2398.69,2400.22,Buffy ,What's it say?
2400.22,2401.65,Giles ,Actual size."
