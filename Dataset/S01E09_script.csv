59.63,63.41,Giles,"Thank you, Cordelia."
59.63,63.41,Giles,Thathat's going to be lovely.
63.45,66.65,Cordelia,But I didn't do
63.45,66.65,Cordelia,the part with the sparklers.
66.77,71.53,Giles,"We'll, um, save that"
66.77,71.53,Giles,for the dress rehearsal. Lisa?
72.36,75.07,Giles,Please!
83.96,85.87,Buffy,If it isn't the great producer.
85.87,87.71,Xander,Had to see this to believe it.
90.02,90.39,Giles,"Oh, you three."
90.39,90.99,Buffy,The school talent show.
91.02,93.72,Buffy,How ever did you finagle
91.02,93.72,Buffy,such a primo assignment?
93.76,95.79,Giles,"Our new FÃ¼hrer, Mr. Snyder."
95.83,99.55,Willow,I think they call them principals now.
99.58,102.76,Giles,He thought it would behove me
99.58,102.76,Giles,to have more contact with the students.
102.79,106.6,Giles,I did try to explain that
102.79,106.6,Giles,my vocational choice of librarian
106.63,108.56,Giles,was a deliberate attempt to...
108.56,109.98,Buffy,"minimise that contact,"
109.98,112.09,Buffy,but... he would have none of it.
112.12,117.72,Buffy,"Giles, into every generation is born one"
112.12,117.72,Buffy,who must run the annual talentless show.
117.76,119.89,Buffy,You cannot escape your destiny.
119.93,122.16,Giles,"If you had any... shred of decency,"
119.93,122.16,Giles,you would have...
122.16,125.1,Giles,"participated. Or at least... um, helped."
125.14,129.1,Buffy,Nah. I think I'll take on
125.14,129.1,Buffy,"your traditional role, and watch."
129.19,130.53,Xander,And mock.
130.53,132.02,Willow,And laugh.
133.65,136.62,Buffy,OK. I think maybe we better
136.62,141.27,Buffy,leave our Mr. Giles
136.62,141.27,Buffy,to this business he calls show.
143.74,145.33,Buffy,Principal Snyder.
145.47,148.05,Snyder,"So, we think school events are stupid"
148.15,153.02,Snyder,and we think authority figures
148.15,153.02,Snyder,are to be made fun of?
151.04,153.47,Buffy,"No, no, we don't. Unless you do."
153.55,158.18,Snyder,And we think
153.55,158.18,Snyder,our afternoon classes are optional?
158.31,160.58,Snyder,All three of you left campus yesterday.
160.58,162.73,Buffy,"Yeah, but we were fighting a demon..."
162.82,163.55,Snyder,Fighting?
163.55,164.61,Buffy,Not fighting.
164.65,166.86,Xander,"No, we left to avoid fighting."
166.95,169.67,Snyder,Real antisocial types.
169.67,172.95,Snyder,You need to integrate
169.67,172.95,Snyder,"into this school, people."
172.98,177.59,Snyder,I think I just found three eager
172.98,177.59,Snyder,new participants for the talent show.
177.62,178.51,Buffy,What?
178.51,179.05,Xander,No.
179.13,180.17,Willow,Please?
180.26,183.76,Snyder,I've been watching you three.
180.26,183.76,Snyder,Always getting into one scrape.
183.84,186.17,Buffy,"Well, we're really, really sorry,"
186.21,187.31,Buffy,"but about the talent show,"
187.31,188.4,Willow,"please, you can't make us!"
188.43,193.02,Snyder,"My predecessor, Mr. Flutie,"
188.43,193.02,Snyder,may have gone in for all that
191.04,194.98,Snyder,touchyfeely relating nonsense.
191.04,194.98,Snyder,But he was eaten.
195.07,197.36,Xander,You're in my world now.
197.45,201.62,Xander,And Sunnydale has touched and felt
197.45,201.62,Xander,for the last time.
203.66,207.92,Xander,Can I just mention that detention
203.66,207.92,Xander,is a timehonored form of punishment?
210.02,211.84,Snyder,I know the three of you will come up with
210.02,211.84,Snyder,a wonderful act for the school to watch
211.92,213.59,Snyder,"and mock,"
213.68,215.76,Snyder,and laugh...
216.3,218.18,Xander,at.
222.81,224.69,Xander,No! No.
233.95,235.41,Giles,Thank you.
238.63,240.09,Buffy,Ew! Dummy!
241.09,243.17,Xander,Yeow! Mime?!
244.88,247.31,Willow,I think dummies are cute. You don't?
247.39,250.64,Buffy,They give me the wig.
247.39,250.64,Buffy,Ever since I was little.
250.73,252.39,Willow,What happened?
252.48,256.4,Buffy,I saw a dummy. It gave me the wig.
252.48,256.4,Buffy,There really wasn't a story there.
256.48,258.7,Morgan,"Hi, I'm Morgan."
258.78,260.95,Morgan,And I'm Sid.
261.74,265.54,Morgan,"Hey, Morgan,"
261.74,265.54,Morgan,would you like to tell some jokes?
265.62,267.5,Morgan,Would I?
267.58,272.02,Morgan,"As a matter of fact, it is!"
270.17,273.09,Morgan,It's also a wood nose
270.17,273.09,Morgan,and a wood mouth.
280.02,282.33,Morgan,I didn't sleep at all last night.
282.33,284.48,Sid,"All right, time out."
284.52,287.02,Sid,Let's stop this before someone gets hurt.
288.32,290.24,Morgan,"Kid, you are the worst."
290.24,292.74,Sid,Even I can see your lips move.
294.91,297.66,Morgan,"Come on, Sid, you're spoiling my act."
297.75,299.83,Morgan,I worked on these jokes for weeks.
299.92,304.84,Sid,You call those jokes? My jockey shorts
299.92,304.84,Sid,are made out of better material.
309.02,310.47,Sid,And they're edible!
314.65,317.09,Giles,You see? I'm sure
314.65,317.09,Giles,you three can come up
317.09,321.96,Giles,with something... equally exciting.
337.43,339.72,Emily,Is anybody there?
344.98,346.44,Emily,Hello?
363.67,365.76,Emily,Hello?
370.39,373.52,Demon,I will be flesh!
423.68,428.97,Marc,b>"The Puppet Show"</b>
431.02,432.43,Marc,I reach into the hat and out comes...
433.22,435.89,Marc,"Uh, has anybody seen a rabbit?"
444.82,446.03,Xander,I can't do this.
446.03,447.24,Buffy,"Xander, come on."
447.32,449.83,Xander,II can't! I have my pride.
449.91,454.08,Xander,"OK, I don't have a lot of my pride,"
449.91,454.08,Xander,but I have enough so that I can't do this.
454.17,458.3,Willow,A dramatic scene is the easiest way
454.17,458.3,Willow,to get through the talent show
458.38,461.09,Willow,because it doesn't require
458.38,461.09,Willow,an actual talent.
461.18,463.68,Xander,But we have talent. We can do stuff.
463.76,464.72,Xander,"Buffy, uh..."
464.72,466.24,Buffy,What am I gonna do?
466.24,468.1,Buffy,Slay vampires on stage?
468.1,469.79,Willow,Maybe in a funny way.
470.02,472.48,Xander,"Willow, you can do stuff..."
470.02,472.48,Xander,"Uh, the piano."
472.57,473.61,Buffy,You play?
473.61,474.65,Willow,A little.
474.74,478.05,Buffy,That's cool. You can accompany us
474.74,478.05,Buffy,and we can attempt to sing.
478.08,480.37,Willow,"Oh, in front of other people?"
480.45,483.21,Willow,"Then, no, I don't play."
483.29,486.5,Xander,Whatever happened to
483.29,486.5,Xander,corporal punishment?
487.46,490.75,Sid,Mmmmmm. Look at the goodies.
490.79,496.02,Willow,"Morgan, you're really getting good."
494.1,496.47,Willow,Where did you come up with that voice?
496.51,499.46,Morgan,It's... kind of an imitation of my dad.
499.5,501.61,Buffy,Sounds real.
499.5,501.61,Buffy,It is real.
501.9,505.57,Sid,I'm the one with the talent here.
501.9,505.57,Sid,The kid's dead weight.
506.15,509.87,Sid,How about you and I do a little
506.15,509.87,Sid,"rehearsing on our own, honey?"
509.95,511.12,Xander,Hey!
511.2,515.17,Sid,You know what they say:
511.2,515.17,Sid,"once you go wood, nothing's as good."
515.25,517.04,Sid,"OK, Morgan, we get the joke."
517.04,519.27,Buffy,"Horny dummy, haha, it's very funny,"
519.31,521.82,Buffy,but... you might wanna consider
519.31,521.82,Buffy,"getting some new shtick,"
521.86,525.76,Buffy,unless you want your prop
521.86,525.76,Buffy,ending up as a Duraflame log!
527.17,530.06,Snyder,Kids today need discipline.
530.14,532.86,Snyder,It's an unpopular word
530.14,532.86,Snyder,these days: discipline.
532.94,536.64,Snyder,I know Principal Flutie would have said:
532.94,536.64,Snyder,"Kids need understanding,"""
536.64,539.53,Snyder,kids are human beings."
539.57,543.58,Snyder,"That's the kind of woollyheaded,"
539.57,543.58,Snyder,liberal thinking that leads to being eaten.
543.61,546.9,Giles,"II think, perhaps, it was"
543.61,546.9,Giles,a little more complex than that.
546.94,549.92,Snyder,This place has quite a reputation.
552.02,552.97,Snyder,"Suicide, missing persons,"
553.05,556.35,Snyder,spontaneous cheerleader combustion.
556.43,558.72,Snyder,You can't put up with that.
558.75,562.08,Snyder,You gotta keep an eye on the bad element.
562.35,564.23,Snyder,Like those three.
566.69,568.65,Snyder,Kids!
568.74,570.82,Snyder,I don't like them.
571.66,574.7,Snyder,From now on you're going to see
571.66,574.7,Snyder,a very different Sunnydale High.
574.73,580.46,Snyder,"A tight ship. Clean, orderly, and quiet."
602.91,604.75,Giles,It was Emily.
604.75,607.58,Willow,Emily? Dancer Emily?
607.62,610.59,Xander,"Oh, man. I hate this school."
610.67,613.3,Giles,It must've happened just after...
610.67,613.3,Giles,dress rehearsals.
613.38,616.51,Giles,There was a crosscountry meet at Melville.
613.38,616.51,Giles,Shshshe never showed up for it.
616.59,617.76,Buffy,Vampire?
617.76,619.52,Giles,I think not.
619.56,621.77,Buffy,"Giles, share. What happened?"
621.85,623.85,Giles,Her heart was removed.
623.85,624.4,Willow,Yikes.
624.9,628.32,Buffy,Does that mean anything to you?
624.9,628.32,Buffy,Besides "oooh!"
629.19,633.16,Giles,There are various demons
629.19,633.16,Giles,"which feed off human hearts, but..."
635.08,637.91,Buffy,But demons have claws and teeth.
638,640.23,Xander,They got no use for a big old knife.
640.26,642.29,Giles,Which more than likely
640.26,642.29,Giles,makes our murderer...
642.32,642.75,Buffy,Human.
642.75,645.47,Xander,Did I mention that I hate this school?
645.55,649.05,Willow,So Emily was killed
645.55,649.05,Willow,by a regular human person?
649.09,651.77,Giles,The evidence certainly points that way.
652.48,656.19,Buffy,"No, wait. I'm not buying, you guys."
656.98,660.82,Buffy,Remember the Hellmouth?
656.98,660.82,Buffy,Mystical activity is totally rife here.
660.82,662.23,Buffy,"This, to me, says demon."
662.23,664.06,Giles,I'd like to think you're right.
664.1,667.35,Giles,A demon is a creature of... evil 
664.1,667.35,Giles,pure and very simple.
667.39,670.88,Giles,"A person driven to kill isis, um..."
667.39,670.88,Giles,It's more complex.
670.96,673.63,Willow,And the creep factor is also heightened.
673.71,677.38,Willow,It could be anyone. It could be me.
678.47,680.14,Willow,"It's not, though."
680.51,683.02,Giles,"Demon or no, we have investigating to do."
683.1,686.19,Giles,I suggest we start with your...
683.1,686.19,Giles,talent show compatriots.
686.27,688.87,Giles,One of them may've been
686.27,688.87,Giles,the last to see her alive.
688.91,692.45,Lisa,I didn't know her too well. There's
688.91,692.45,Lisa,"a whole dancerband rivalry, you know?"
692.53,693.82,Buffy,Heard about that.
693.83,696.28,Lisa,But I did speak to her
693.83,696.28,Lisa,a little the day that...
696.32,697.21,Lisa,Yesterday.
697.21,698.72,Buffy,How did she seem?
698.76,701.54,Marc,"She was happy, I guess."
698.76,701.54,Marc,She was psyched to be in the show.
701.62,705.09,Marc,She was a really good dancer.
701.62,705.09,Marc,"Here, pick a card."
706.71,710.22,Marc,"No, wait, wait, wait!"
706.71,710.22,Marc,Not that one. Pick this one.
710.43,712.88,Giles,D'you remember
710.43,712.88,Giles,the last time you saw her?
712.92,714.63,Marc,She was talking to someone.
714.63,714.88,Giles,Who?
714.91,718.31,Elliot,"That smart guy, the one with the dummy?"
714.91,718.31,Elliot,What's his name?
718.4,719.12,Willow,Morgan?
719.12,720.78,Elliot,"Yeah, that's it."
720.86,723.18,Elliot,He was acting kinda strange.
723.18,724.26,Willow,"Strange, how?"
724.29,727.6,Cordelia,It's just such a tragedy for me.
727.64,731.02,Cordelia,Emma was like my best friend.
731.02,731.72,Xander,Emily.
731.76,736.96,Lisa,"Well, Morgan's just strange. He's always"
731.76,736.96,Lisa,rubbing his head a lot and moaning.
737.05,738.53,Lisa,Especially the other day.
738.53,740,Marc,"He seemed kinda paranoid,"
740.03,741.75,Marc,looking around at everyone.
741.76,745.54,Elliot,And I think I saw him arguing...
741.76,745.54,Elliot,with his dummy.
745.58,748.35,Cordelia,All I can think is...
745.58,748.35,Cordelia,it could have been me!
748.94,750.73,Xander,We can dream.
759.83,762.53,Sid,"Right now, you and me"
759.83,762.53,Sid,gotta be on the lookout.
762.56,765.03,Sid,Figure out who's gonna be next.
765.06,767.3,Morgan,How are we supposed to...
769.38,770.93,Morgan,Hi.
772.39,774.26,Buffy,Hello.
774.35,777.69,Morgan,I was just working on throwing my voice.
778.06,782.53,Buffy,"Uh, Morgan, did you notice anything weird"
778.06,782.53,Buffy,going on around here yesterday?
782.61,785.47,Morgan,Weird? What do you mean?
785.51,787.32,Buffy,With Emily.
787.36,791.33,Buffy,Did she... say anything to you?
787.36,791.33,Buffy,Was she arguing with anyone?
791.41,794.46,Morgan,No. She was dancing.
794.54,796.83,Morgan,Sid and I were talking.
796.83,797.63,Buffy,Talking?
797.71,799.8,Morgan,Rehearsing.
799.88,802.39,Buffy,So you didn't notice anything weird at...
803.64,805.56,Buffy,"Morgan, are you OK?"
806.18,810.31,Sid,"Look, sweetheart, he answered"
806.18,810.31,Sid,your question. Now leave him alone.
810.4,813.15,Buffy,"OK, Morgan."
810.4,813.15,Buffy,How about talking to me yourself now?
813.23,815.53,Sid,He's said all he's gonna say.
816.4,819.41,Morgan,"It's OK, Sid. We're done."
827.04,829.84,Buffy,"I'm sorry. Look,"
827.04,829.84,Buffy,I didn't mean to make you mad.
830.38,832.47,Morgan,"No, I'm..."
833.47,835.56,Morgan,It's him!
835.85,837.93,Morgan,He's...
842.39,845.09,Morgan,We have to go.
847.53,849.41,Buffy,Cute couple.
851.16,854.33,Xander,"OK, next time we split up,"
851.16,854.33,Xander,someone else is on Cordy detail.
854.41,855.49,Xander,Five more minutes with her and
855.49,856.79,Willow,we would've had another organ donor.
856.88,858.2,Willow,I think I had a bit more luck.
858.2,861.55,Willow,Everyone I talked to seemed to
858.2,861.55,Willow,point their fingers at the same person.
861.58,865.02,Buffy,Morgan?
861.58,865.02,Buffy,Morgan.
863.09,864.26,Xander,We have a winner.
864.26,867.01,Giles,I fear I was led to the same conclusion.
867.05,870.89,Xander,"Well, what do we do? We don't slay him,"
867.05,870.89,Xander,right? We wanna bring him to justice.
870.98,874.57,Willow,We could set up a complex sting operation
870.98,874.57,Willow,where we get him to confess.
874.65,875.77,Xander,I should wear a wire!
875.77,876.83,Buffy,"Whoa, hey, you guys."
876.87,879.91,Buffy,All we know is that
876.87,879.91,Buffy,Morgan is a Grade A large weirdo.
879.91,882.02,Buffy,That doesn't lead directly to murderer.
882.06,884.66,Xander,The guy talks to his puppet.
884.66,886.42,Willow,And for his puppet.
886.55,889.53,Buffy,"Yeah, but what about"
886.55,889.53,Buffy,the whole "it's a demon" theory?
889.56,892.6,Giles,"I'm looking into that, but..."
889.56,892.6,Giles,my investigation is somewhat...
892.6,895.34,Giles,hampered by life in the theatre.
895.38,897.6,Buffy,"Uh, priority check, Giles?"
897.68,899.77,Xander,Talent show. Murder.
900.02,903.65,Xander,"Yeah, we can't do the talent show."
900.02,903.65,Xander,It's unthinkable. I'm not able to think it.
903.73,906.78,Giles,Principal Snyder is
903.73,906.78,Giles,watching us all very closely.
906.86,909.59,Giles,"If he chooses, he can make"
906.86,909.59,Giles,all our lives extremely difficult.
909.59,913.06,Giles,A slayer cannot afford that.
909.59,913.06,Giles,"We will find this murderer, but..."
913.1,917.42,Giles,in the meantime...
913.1,917.42,Giles,the show must go on.
917.45,918.99,Buffy,This is so unfair.
918.99,921.05,Giles,"Buffy, you watch Morgan."
921.13,923.16,Giles,"Check his locker,"
921.13,923.16,Giles,see if there's anything there.
923.2,925.26,Willow,Like a heart?
925.26,927.32,Giles,Or something.
927.8,928.7,Buffy,All right.
928.7,931.48,Willow,I'll pull up his locker number.
931.56,934.13,Xander,Can I still wear a wire?
954.65,958.51,Buffy,"OK. Two to the left,"
958.6,960.68,Buffy,three to the right.
974.24,976.1,Buffy,Principal Snyder!
976.1,978.18,Snyder,What are you doing?
978.22,979.85,Buffy,"Uh, looking for something."
979.85,981.22,Snyder,School hours are over.
981.25,983.21,Snyder,"You, therefore, should be gone."
983.3,986.21,Buffy,And I'm going any minute now.
986.22,988.3,Snyder,There are things I will not tolerate.
988.39,990.87,Snyder,"Students loitering on campus after school,"
990.87,993.89,Snyder,horrible murders
990.87,993.89,Snyder,with hearts being removed.
993.93,995.98,Snyder,And also smoking.
996.61,1000.26,Buffy,"Well, I don't do any of those things."
996.61,1000.26,Buffy,Not ever.
1000.61,1003.49,Snyder,There's something going on with you.
1003.57,1006.08,Snyder,I'll figure it out sooner or later.
1008.04,1009.87,Snyder,Do you need something here?
1010.58,1013.04,Buffy,"Oh, yeah. Right."
1013.13,1017.34,Buffy,"Um, a friend wanted me"
1013.13,1017.34,Buffy,to get something out of his case.
1027.36,1030.11,Buffy,He must have taken it
1027.36,1030.11,Buffy,and forgotten to tell me.
1036.28,1038.79,Snyder,Get along home now. It's late.
1045.55,1047.63,Morgan,"No, I can't do it!"
1047.72,1049.8,Sid,It's the only way.
1050.26,1052.09,Morgan,I don't want...
1052.09,1053.8,Sid,She's the one!
1054.14,1054.66,Morgan,But...
1054.66,1058.1,Sid,You saw what she did. How strong she is.
1058.19,1059.46,Morgan,"I know, but..."
1059.46,1060.82,Sid,She's the last.
1060.9,1063.74,Sid,Just this one more and I'll be free.
1064.7,1066.21,Morgan,I won't.
1066.21,1067.53,Sid,I will!
1072.15,1075.05,Joyce,"Hi, hon. How's it, uh,"
1072.15,1075.05,Joyce,going with the talent show?
1075.09,1077.42,Buffy,It'll be over soon.
1077.51,1081.59,Joyce,"It can't be that bad. l, for one,"
1077.51,1081.59,Joyce,am looking forward to seeing your act.
1082.89,1083.4,Joyce,Seeing?
1083.4,1085.93,Buffy,In the sense of actually attending?
1086.02,1086.76,Joyce,Of course!
1086.76,1088.25,Buffy,"Uhuh, no, Mom. Yy..."
1088.29,1090.92,Buffy,"You can't. I mean, if I know"
1088.29,1090.92,Buffy,"you're out there watching,"
1090.92,1092.66,Buffy,I'll freeze up. Stage fright.
1092.66,1094.95,Joyce,But I wanna support what you're doing.
1094.99,1098.96,Buffy,"Look, Mom, if you really love me"
1094.99,1098.96,Buffy,"and wanna show your support,"
1099,1103.65,Buffy,you'll stay away.
1099,1103.65,Buffy,Far away!
1103.68,1107.76,Joyce,"Honey, is there..."
1103.68,1107.76,Joyce,Is there something bothering you?
1107.8,1110.47,Buffy,"I mean, besides your fabulous debut."
1111.47,1114.05,Buffy,Nothing.
1114.67,1118.78,Buffy,There's just a lot going on right now.
1120.36,1123.15,Joyce,"Well, get some sleep."
1123.65,1126.07,Joyce,You'll feel better in the morning.
1126.07,1126.78,Buffy,Good plan.
1164.4,1165.92,Joyce,"Honey, what is it?"
1165.92,1168.23,Buffy,"In the bed, in the covers,"
1165.92,1168.23,Buffy,there's something!
1168.26,1170.51,Joyce,Where?
1171.54,1173.63,Buffy,There's something there.
1174.17,1175.74,Buffy,"Well, there's nothing there now."
1175.74,1177.76,Joyce,Are you sure you didn't have a nightmare?
1177.84,1183.14,Buffy,"No, there's some... There is..."
1183.18,1184.68,Buffy,Yeah.
1184.77,1186.97,Buffy,You're probably right.
1186.97,1189.28,Joyce,I'm sorry I got you up.
1189.32,1193.66,Joyce,Don't worry about it.
1189.32,1193.66,Joyce,I was dreaming about bills.
1195.62,1200.6,Joyce,"Sweetheart, you shouldn't go to sleep"
1195.62,1200.6,Joyce,with the window open.
1204.13,1206.08,Buffy,I didn't.
1206.9,1212.4,Marc,And my lovely... assistant...
1206.9,1212.4,Marc,steps into... the box.
1218.11,1221.53,Marc,And... Behold!
1222.7,1225.52,Marc,You were supposed to leave.
1226.42,1228.44,Cordelia,I don't understand why I ha...
1228.44,1231.65,Cordelia,Why I have to follow Brett
1228.44,1231.65,Cordelia,and his stupid band?
1231.69,1237.02,Giles,Because we have to clear their equipment
1231.69,1237.02,Giles,before the finale. I've told you!
1235.09,1238.27,Cordelia,But the mood. It'll be all wrong.
1238.35,1242.48,Cordelia,My song is about dignity
1238.35,1242.48,Cordelia,and human feelings
1242.56,1246.58,Cordelia,and personal hygiene or something.
1246.61,1250.03,Cordelia,"Anyway it's sappy, and"
1246.61,1250.03,Cordelia,no one is gonna be feeling sappy
1250.03,1252.9,Cordelia,after all that rock'n'roll.
1256.33,1256.9,Cordelia,What?
1256.9,1258.5,Giles,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1258.58,1261.05,Giles,"Um, your hair..."
1261.13,1263.63,Cordelia,There's something wrong with my hair?
1265.47,1267.55,Cordelia,"Oh, my God."
1268.22,1271.63,Giles,Xander was right.
1268.22,1271.63,Giles,It worked like a charm.
1274.52,1276.19,Giles,Hello.
1276.47,1278.56,Giles,"You look a bit worse for, uh..."
1279.1,1281.48,Giles,What exactly are you the worse for?
1281.56,1282.86,Buffy,Where's Morgan?
1282.86,1285.36,Giles,"I've, II... haven't seen him."
1285.44,1287.59,Xander,Did he do something to you?
1287.59,1288.95,Buffy,"No, it was his..."
1289.03,1291.54,Buffy,"Sid, the dummy."
1292.37,1294.3,Buffy,"OK, everyone look at me"
1292.37,1294.3,Buffy,"like I'm in a bunny suit,"
1294.3,1297.61,Buffy,cause that's how stupid I feel
1294.3,1297.61,Buffy,saying this...
1297.65,1300.03,Buffy,I think Sid was in my room last night.
1300.07,1301.62,Willow,With Morgan?
1301.65,1305.83,Buffy,No. He was alone... and alive.
1306.72,1307.83,Xander,Did you see him?
1307.83,1308.94,Buffy,I saw something.
1309.02,1311.5,Buffy,"Iit ran across my floor, under my bed"
1309.02,1311.5,Buffy,and then it attacked me.
1311.53,1312.86,Giles,Attacked you? How?
1312.86,1315.38,Buffy,It was like it pounced on my face.
1315.42,1316.23,Xander,Like a cat?
1316.23,1317.25,Buffy,"Yeah, exactly!"
1317.29,1318.86,Buffy,But when I turned the lights on
1317.29,1318.86,Buffy,it was already gone.
1318.9,1320.9,Buffy,I think it went out my window.
1320.9,1321.64,Xander,Like a cat?
1321.64,1324.73,Buffy,"Yeah. No! It was Sid, the dummy."
1324.77,1328.92,Giles,Or possibly the nightmare of somebody
1324.77,1328.92,Giles,who had... dummies on her mind.
1331.02,1331.24,Willow,You did say they creep you out.
1331.27,1333.81,Buffy,"Excuse me, can I have"
1331.27,1333.81,Buffy,"a little support here, please?"
1333.85,1336.89,Buffy,I'm not just some crazy person.
1333.85,1336.89,Buffy,I'm the Slayer.
1336.97,1339.14,Xander,The Dummy Slayer?
1339.23,1341.77,Xander,There's nothing funny about that.
1341.85,1346.24,Willow,"Well, on the side of the"
1341.85,1346.24,Willow,"Morgan's just crazy"" theory, there is..."
1346.32,1348.4,Willow,"Well, Morgan."
1350.96,1353.82,Buffy,I'd like to see Morgan
1350.96,1353.82,Buffy,without his better half for a few minutes.
1353.82,1356.26,Buffy,Bet he could tell me something.
1357.71,1359.63,Buffy,"Oh, if it's any consolation,"
1359.63,1362.51,Giles,I may have found a possible demon culprit.
1362.59,1366.6,Giles,There's this reference in here
1362.59,1366.6,Giles,to a brotherhood of seven demons
1366.68,1368.81,Giles,who take the form of the unhumans.
1368.89,1372.98,Giles,Every seven years these demons
1368.89,1372.98,Giles,"need human organs, a brain and a heart,"
1373.06,1375.05,Giles,to maintain their humanity.
1375.05,1377.81,Giles,Otherwise theythey revert back
1375.05,1377.81,Giles,to their original form
1377.84,1380.82,Willow,"which is... uh, slightly less appealing."
1381.45,1384.36,Willow,"So... Morgan could still be the guy,"
1384.39,1388.45,Willow,"only Demon Morgan,"
1384.39,1388.45,Willow,instead of Crazy Morgan.
1389.87,1391.17,Willow,Except that these demons
1391.17,1391.66,Giles,areareare
1391.66,1395.65,Giles,"preternaturally strong,"
1391.66,1395.65,Giles,andand Morgan isis...
1395.69,1399.63,Giles,"Well, he seems to be"
1395.69,1399.63,Giles,getting weaker every day.
1399.67,1403.99,Mrs. Jackson,It was as a result of this that
1399.67,1403.99,Mrs. Jackson,President Monroe put forth the eponymous 
1404.07,1407.28,Mrs. Jackson,meaning "named after oneself" 
1404.07,1407.28,Mrs. Jackson,"Monroe Doctrine,"
1407.37,1412.17,Mrs. Jackson,"which, in one sense, established"
1407.37,1412.17,Mrs. Jackson,the US as a local peacekeeper...
1441.12,1443.71,Cordelia,Looks like someone digs you.
1441.12,1443.71,Cordelia,That's adorable.
1443.79,1446.75,Cordelia,You and the dummy
1443.79,1446.75,Cordelia,could tour in the freak show.
1448.76,1453.05,Mrs. Jackson,"OK, who can tell me"
1448.76,1453.05,Mrs. Jackson,how Spain responded to this policy?
1454.18,1455.93,Mrs. Jackson,Morgan?
1456.02,1457.52,Mrs. Jackson,Morgan?
1458.73,1460.19,Morgan,What?
1460.27,1462.61,Sid,Morgan has other things on his mind.
1465.49,1466.87,Mrs. Jackson,Give me your puppet.
1466.87,1468.12,Morgan,I'll put him away.
1469.41,1471.5,Mrs. Jackson,You'll get it back after school.
1477.59,1480.67,Mrs. Jackson,"OK, then, in the first part"
1477.59,1480.67,Mrs. Jackson,of the 19th century...
1480.76,1482.89,Sid,I'm still watching you.
1482.97,1486.82,Mrs. Jackson,"Morgan, that is enough!"
1498.45,1499.8,Morgan,Mrs. Jackson?
1499.8,1500.53,Mrs. Jackson,Morgan.
1501.33,1503.28,Morgan,You said you'd give me...
1503.28,1504.37,Mrs. Jackson,"Oh, of course."
1510.09,1513.97,Mrs. Jackson,"You know, I wanted to ask you."
1510.09,1513.97,Mrs. Jackson,Is everything OK?
1514.05,1516.17,Mrs. Jackson,At home? Here at school?
1516.17,1517.68,Morgan,"Yeah, it's great."
1517.77,1520.98,Mrs. Jackson,I feel like you've become...
1517.77,1520.98,Mrs. Jackson,a little detached.
1521.06,1523.33,Mrs. Jackson,You're one of the brightest kids
1521.06,1523.33,Mrs. Jackson,"I've seen in a long time,"
1523.34,1528.2,Mrs. Jackson,but... lately it seems
1523.34,1528.2,Mrs. Jackson,like you're not all there.
1528.23,1530.28,Mrs. Jackson,Try not to let other things
1528.23,1530.28,Mrs. Jackson,get in the way.
1530.31,1534.02,Morgan,OK! Can I get Sid now?
1534.37,1536.29,Mrs. Jackson,Sure.
1541.38,1543.68,Mrs. Jackson,It's gone.
1541.38,1543.68,Mrs. Jackson,Gone?
1545.22,1547.31,Morgan,What do you mean gone?
1547.77,1549.41,Morgan,Where could he have gone?
1549.41,1550.72,Mrs. Jackson,I put it right here.
1550.76,1554.39,Morgan,He knew to wait for me.
1550.76,1554.39,Morgan,He knew I'd be back.
1554.43,1556.19,Mrs. Jackson,What do you mean "he"?
1556.19,1558.2,Morgan,What did you do with him?
1558.28,1560.95,Morgan,Where is he?
1573.56,1574.86,Buffy,Where did you get that?
1574.86,1576.24,Buffy,"Oh, I... took that out of"
1576.24,1577.84,Xander,Mrs. Jackson's cupboard. I...
1577.87,1580.21,Xander,"thought, you said you wanted to"
1577.87,1580.21,Xander,be able to speak to Morgan alone.
1580.21,1582.29,Xander,"And, uh, well, Morgan's alone..."
1582.4,1585.32,Xander,"and, uh... Sid's with me."
1586.07,1590.58,Xander,"Hi, Buffy. Hi, Willow. Would you"
1586.07,1590.58,Xander,like to hear some offcolor jokes?
1590.61,1592.73,Buffy,I really don't think
1590.61,1592.73,Buffy,you should be doing that.
1592.73,1596.45,Xander,What? Come on!
1592.73,1596.45,Xander,I'm not real.
1596.49,1599.57,Buffy,"Xander, quit it!"
1599.6,1603.36,Xander,He's not real.
1607.02,1610.84,Xander,I think our demonstration
1607.02,1610.84,Xander,proves that Sid is wood.
1610.88,1615.17,Xander,"Now, why don't you go find Morgan"
1610.88,1615.17,Xander,and prove he is... whatever he is?
1615.21,1617.28,Giles,I imagine he's looking for his puppet.
1617.32,1620.6,Buffy,I'll go find Morgan.
1620.6,1623.18,Xander,You watch the dummy.
1623.21,1626.69,Xander,Byebye now.
1623.21,1626.69,Xander,I'm completely inanimate.
1627.87,1631.09,Xander,Redrum! Redrum!
1632.09,1634.03,Willow,What do we do with him?
1634.03,1636.3,Xander,Hey! I'll keep him company.
1636.38,1639.05,Giles,"Willow, we have some hunting"
1636.38,1639.05,Giles,of our own to do.
1639.09,1644.32,Willow,Once again I'm banished to
1639.09,1644.32,Willow,the demon section of the card catalogue.
1647.61,1651.49,Giles,You concentrate on reanimation theory.
1647.61,1651.49,Giles,I'll peck about in organ harvesting.
1651.57,1653.3,Giles,"Unless, of course, you'd prefer..."
1653.3,1655.08,Willow,That's OK. You can have the organs.
1655.16,1659.12,Xander,"So I guess it's just you and me, huh?"
1664.26,1666.34,Xander,That looks more comfortable.
1672.6,1674.69,Buffy,Morgan?!
1686.87,1688.54,Buffy,Morgan?
1719.25,1721.04,Buffy,Principal Snyder.
1721.83,1723.34,Snyder,Looking for something?
1723.34,1725.13,Buffy,Have you seen Morgan Shay?
1725.5,1729.97,Snyder,"You know, with everything"
1725.5,1729.97,Snyder,"that's been going on recently,"
1730.76,1733.29,Snyder,I'm not sure how safe it is...
1733.29,1736.6,Snyder,for a girl like yourself to be here...
1736.64,1738.27,Snyder,Alone.
1738.65,1740.73,Buffy,"Well, I was just leaving."
1740.75,1744.5,Buffy,And I know how to take care of myself.
1747.76,1751.21,Snyder,"All right, then."
1765.69,1768.7,Willow,Look what I found in the section of
1765.69,1768.7,Willow,Toys and Magic".
1768.73,1771.89,Willow,On rare occasions inanimate objects
1768.73,1771.89,Willow,"of human quality,"
1771.93,1776.1,Willow,"such as dolls and mannequins, already"
1771.93,1776.1,Willow,"mystically possessed of consciousness,"
1776.13,1782.08,Willow,have acted upon their desire
1776.13,1782.08,Willow,to become human by harvesting organs."
1782.12,1783.21,Giles,Emily's heart.
1783.21,1784.38,Willow,Morgan's dummy.
1814.21,1815.27,Giles,What is it?
1815.27,1817.38,Xander,He's gone! Sid's gone!
1817.46,1819.55,Giles,What? Oh!
1839.14,1841.12,Buffy,Morgan?
1869.31,1871.49,Buffy,Morgan.
1877.8,1880.09,Buffy,The demon's got himself a brain.
1919.76,1924.21,Buffy,"Who's ever out there,"
1919.76,1924.21,Buffy,I'm gonna hurt you! Badly!
1924.25,1927.51,Buffy,If you'll just give me a minute.
1949.42,1951.42,Sid,You win.
1951.45,1955.24,Sid,Now you can take your heart and your brain
1951.45,1955.24,Sid,and move on.
1955.28,1958.12,Buffy,I'm sure they would have made
1955.28,1958.12,Buffy,great trophies for your case.
1958.16,1960.28,Sid,That would have been justice.
1960.28,1962.25,Buffy,"Yeah, except for one thing."
1962.29,1965.25,Buffy,You lost and now you'll never be human.
1965.29,1968.11,Sid,"Yeah, well, neither will you."
1970.83,1972.55,Buffy and Sid,What?
1970.83,1972.55,Buffy and Sid,What?
1972.58,1976.59,Buffy and Sid,This is what I do. I hunt demons.
1976.62,1979.93,Sid,Yeah. You wouldn't know it to look at me.
1979.96,1985.14,Sid,"Let's just say there was me, there was"
1979.96,1985.14,Sid,"a really mean demon, there was a curse,"
1985.22,1988.89,Sid,and the next thing I know
1985.22,1988.89,Sid,I'm not me any more.
1988.92,1993.56,Sid,I'm sitting on some guy's knee
1988.92,1993.56,Sid,with his hand up my shirt.
1993.6,1996.95,Willow,And ever since then
1993.6,1996.95,Willow,you've been a living dummy?
1996.99,2000.79,Sid,The kid here was right.
1996.99,2000.79,Sid,I should have picked you to team up with.
2000.82,2002.85,Sid,But I didn't because...
2002.85,2006.02,Buffy,Because you thought I was the demon.
2004.05,2006.92,Sid,Who can blame me for thinking?
2004.05,2006.92,Sid,Look at you.
2006.96,2010,Sid,"You're strong, athletic,"
2010.03,2012.42,Sid,"limber,"
2012.45,2015.69,Sid,nubile...
2017.86,2022.4,Sid,"I'm back. In any case, now that"
2017.86,2022.4,Sid,"this demon's got the heart and brain,"
2022.43,2026.32,Sid,he gets to keep the human form
2022.43,2026.32,Sid,he's in for another seven years.
2026.36,2029.6,Giles,"I must say, it's a welcome change to have"
2026.36,2029.6,Giles,someone else explain all these things.
2029.64,2032.87,Sid,There were seven of these guys.
2029.64,2032.87,Sid,I've killed six.
2032.91,2036.72,Sid,"If I can get the last one,"
2032.91,2036.72,Sid,the curse will be lifted and I'll be free.
2036.75,2039.52,Sid,I'm sure it's someone
2036.75,2039.52,Sid,in that stupid talent show.
2039.56,2042.18,Buffy,"Yeah, but now that demon has"
2039.56,2042.18,Buffy,"what he wants, he'll be moving on."
2042.21,2044.78,Sid,So once we know
2042.21,2044.78,Sid,who's missing from the show...
2044.78,2046.73,Buffy,We'll know who our demon is!
2046.77,2047.84,Giles,The show!
2047.84,2048.43,Buffy,What?
2048.46,2051.11,Giles,It's going to start!
2048.46,2051.11,Giles,I'm supposed to be there!
2051.15,2051.99,Giles,"OK, um, start pulling"
2051.99,2053.59,Buffy,everyone's addresses in the talent show.
2053.59,2055.66,Buffy,"Iif they're not there, maybe"
2053.59,2055.66,Buffy,we can catch them at home.
2055.7,2059.18,Sid,"And you, get 'em all on stage."
2055.7,2059.18,Sid,Form the power circle.
2059.18,2061.29,Sid,Then we can see who's a noshow.
2061.33,2062.45,Giles,"Um, the what?"
2062.45,2063.92,Sid,The power circle.
2063.95,2067.12,Sid,"You get everyone together,"
2063.95,2067.12,Sid,"you get 'em, you know, revved up."
2067.16,2069.31,Giles,Right.
2070.67,2073.88,Sid,How'd he ever get that gig?
2073.92,2079.02,Giles,"minutes to curtain, everyone."
2077.39,2079.51,Giles,minutes.
2079.54,2081.67,Cordelia,I... I can't go out there.
2081.7,2086.64,Cordelia,All those people staring at me and
2081.7,2086.64,Cordelia,judging me like I'm some kind of...
2086.64,2089.75,Cordelia,Buffy!
2086.64,2089.75,Cordelia,What if I mess up?
2089.78,2092.05,Cordelia,"Cordelia, there's an adage"
2092.05,2094.67,Giles,that if you're feeling nervous
2094.71,2097.63,Giles,"then, uh, you should imagine the entire"
2094.71,2097.63,Giles,audience wearing their underwear.
2097.66,2101.11,Cordelia,Ew! Even Mrs. Franklin?
2101.15,2103.75,Giles,Oh.
2101.15,2103.75,Giles,Perhaps not.
2104.37,2110.08,Giles,"All right, we'll assemble on the stage"
2104.37,2110.08,Giles,"in five minutes for the... uh, power thing."
2111.01,2113.08,Sid,"So what's your deal, kid?"
2113.11,2115.9,Sid,I don't figure you for a demon hunter.
2115.9,2117.44,Buffy,I'm a vampire slayer.
2117.48,2120.86,Sid,You? You're the Slayer?
2120.89,2122.51,Sid,Damn.
2122.55,2125.13,Sid,I knew a slayer in the thirties.
2125.17,2128.98,Buffy,Korean chick. Very hot.
2129.01,2134.89,Sid,We're talking muscle tone.
2129.01,2134.89,Sid,"Man, we had some times."
2135.45,2138.64,Buffy,"Hey, that was predummy, all right?"
2138.68,2141.94,Sid,I was a guy.
2142.85,2145.74,Buffy,"So, you kill the demon..."
2145.77,2147.58,Buffy,"And the curse is lifted, right?"
2147.58,2148.58,Sid,That's the drill.
2148.58,2151.28,Buffy,You don't actually
2148.58,2151.28,Buffy,"turn into a prince, do you?"
2151.31,2153.59,Buffy,"I mean, your body..."
2153.59,2155.65,Sid,Is dust and bones.
2155.69,2157.34,Sid,When I say free...
2157.34,2158.62,Buffy,You mean dead.
2158.65,2160.99,Sid,"Don't get sniffly on me, sis."
2161.02,2164.42,Sid,I've lived a lot longer
2161.02,2164.42,Sid,than most demon hunters.
2164.46,2166.6,Sid,"Or slayers, for that matter."
2166.64,2170.7,Sid,"Of course, if you want"
2166.64,2170.7,Sid,to snuggle up and comfort me...
2170.74,2174.46,Buffy,So that hornydummy thing
2170.74,2174.46,Buffy,"really isn't an act, is it?"
2174.5,2175.33,Sid,Nope.
2175.33,2176.16,Buffy,Yuck.
2176.2,2178.24,Giles,Is everybody here?
2178.24,2179.49,Sid,I think so.
2180.47,2182.59,Sid,"OK, here's our lineup."
2182.62,2184.64,Giles,"Quickly, everyone."
2184.68,2187.34,Giles,"Um, power circle."
2196.86,2200.82,Giles,"Well, that's that, then."
2196.86,2200.82,Giles,"Everybody, uh, get ready."
2200.86,2202.59,Giles,That's it?
2202.62,2205.36,Giles,All right.
2209.89,2212.11,Buffy,Hold on.
2215.85,2216.71,Giles,No one's missing.
2216.71,2218.27,Buffy,So the demon isn't in the show?
2218.31,2221.03,Giles,It seems not. Tell the others.
2218.31,2221.03,Giles,It's nearly curtain.
2221.03,2222.3,Giles,I must get the show running.
2222.34,2225.4,Buffy,Right.
2222.34,2225.4,Buffy,Right.
2227.27,2230.45,Buffy,Sid?
2254.17,2256.92,Buffy,Sid?
2273.25,2275.78,Buffy,I'm never gonna stop washing my hands.
2275.81,2277.95,Xander,So the dummy tells us
2275.81,2277.95,Xander,that he's a demon hunter
2277.95,2280.1,Xander,"and we're like ""Fine, lalalala""."
2280.14,2282.79,Xander,He takes off and now there's a brain.
2283.3,2285.48,Xander,Does anybody else feel like
2283.3,2285.48,Xander,they've been Keyser Soze'd?
2285.51,2287.57,Buffy,"Sid's on the level, I'm sure of that."
2287.57,2289.89,Buffy,But why would the demon've
2287.57,2289.89,Buffy,rejected the brain?
2289.92,2294.02,Buffy,"II mean, I thought Morgan was"
2289.92,2294.02,Buffy,the smartest kid in school.
2292.04,2295.16,Willow,He was. Look at his grades. All A's.
2295.2,2297.28,Willow,He was even taking college classes.
2297.31,2298.71,Willow,Wait a second.
2298.71,2299.21,Buffy,What?
2299.24,2300.48,Willow,All these sick days.
2300.48,2302.72,Xander,"He was out for, like, half the year."
2302.76,2305.67,Buffy,Check the school nurse's file.
2307.43,2311.73,Willow,"Look at this. ""In case of emergency,"
2307.43,2311.73,Willow,"contact Dr Dale Leggett,"
2311.77,2314.68,Willow,"California Institute of Neurosurgery,"
2314.68,2315.7,Xander,Cancer Ward."
2315.74,2316.61,Xander,Brain cancer?
2316.61,2319.03,Willow,That's why he had all the headaches.
2319.06,2322.16,Buffy,This means that whatever's out there
2319.06,2322.16,Buffy,"still needs a healthy, intelligent brain."
2322.2,2323.97,Xander,"In other words, I'm safe."
2326.02,2328.46,Buffy,And it's gonna be looking for
2326.02,2328.46,Buffy,the smartest person around.
2329.39,2330.4,Willow,What?
2330.44,2333.91,Giles,"Yes, if you, you calibrated the units"
2330.44,2333.91,Giles,"of weight, then you could calculate the,"
2333.95,2337.12,Giles,"uh, specific maximum velocity"
2333.95,2337.12,Giles,achieved before the point of impact.
2337.15,2340.69,Marc,"Gee, Mr. Giles! You're really smart."
2337.15,2340.69,Marc,Could you do me a favor?
2340.72,2343.13,Willow,What could a demon possibly want from me?
2343.17,2345.44,Xander,What's the square root of 841?
2345.47,2348.87,Willow,"Oh, yeah."
2348.9,2351.59,Buffy,"Don't worry, Willow. As long as you're"
2348.9,2351.59,Buffy,with us there's absolutely no way
2351.62,2353.88,Buffy,that demon is gonna get what he wants.
2357.29,2358.01,Giles,"Oh, my."
2358.01,2359.77,Marc,"Pretty cool, huh?"
2363.27,2365.86,Giles,Are you sure there's no one else
2363.27,2365.86,Giles,who could help you out?
2365.87,2368.2,Marc,My assistant got sick.
2365.87,2368.2,Marc,You won't have to say anything.
2368.23,2370.41,Marc,I'll show you. Lie down.
2370.41,2372.69,Giles,How exactly does it work?
2372.73,2376.48,Marc,A good magician never tells his secrets.
2381.02,2380.88,Marc,Come on. We haven't got much time.
2380.92,2384.89,Buffy,This is ridiculous. We can't just sit here
2380.92,2384.89,Buffy,and wait for him to come to us.
2384.93,2386.74,Buffy,We have to figure out
2384.93,2386.74,Buffy,who we're dealing with.
2386.77,2388.84,Xander,I still vote dummy.
2388.84,2389.17,Buffy,No!
2389.2,2392.13,Buffy,"OK, so we ruled out"
2389.2,2392.13,Buffy,all the people in the talent show.
2392.17,2396.41,Willow,"That's because they were all there,"
2392.17,2396.41,Willow,but that's before we found the brain.
2396.44,2400.35,Buffy,Right. So it probably is one of them.
2400.38,2403.19,Buffy,And Giles doesn't know it.
2400.38,2403.19,Buffy,He's with them all right now!
2403.23,2408.75,Xander,"Ugh, Giles can handle himself."
2403.23,2408.75,Xander,"I mean, he is really..."
2408.78,2410.99,Xander,smart.
2411.03,2413.1,Buffy,Giles!
2418.27,2420.71,Giles,Shouldn't it be aimed at my neck?
2420.71,2420.93,Marc,No!
2421.17,2424.7,Marc,"No, this way your scalp gets sliced off"
2424.74,2428.48,Marc,and your brains just...
2424.74,2428.48,Marc,come pouring out.
2429.57,2432.64,Giles,What exactly is the trick?
2432.64,2433.35,Marc,Trick?
2433.38,2435.64,Giles,Mark?
2442.59,2444.59,Giles,MaMark?
2477.46,2479.15,Willow,Where are the keys?
2479.15,2480.39,Giles,Mark's got it.
2480.43,2482.92,Xander,Willow!
2485.14,2486.83,Giles,Hurry!
2498.5,2500.42,Buffy,How do you lock this thing?
2507.38,2509.9,Giles,What's happening?
2519.52,2521.97,Sid,I found you!
2533.29,2535.35,Buffy,Let go!
2546.65,2548.42,Giles,"I must say, all of you,"
2551.02,2551.93,Giles,your ttiming is impeccable.
2551.97,2554.83,Sid,And now for the big finish.
2554.87,2557.2,,What are you doing?
2557.23,2559.69,,It's not enough.
2559.72,2562.15,,He'll come back.
2562.19,2567.48,,"You have to get the heart,"
2562.19,2567.48,,then all of this will be over.
2567.51,2571.39,,Let me.
2567.51,2571.39,,I got it.
2571.43,2573.85,,Thanks.
2604.08,2607.34,,It's over.
2622.97,2625.61,,I don't get it.
2625.65,2629.69,,What is it? Avantgarde?
2629.72,2633.71,,"O ruler of my country, Oedipus,"
2629.72,2633.71,,"you see our company around the altar,"
2633.74,2636.22,,"and l, the priest of Zeus."
2633.74,2636.22,,Haha.
2636.25,2638.32,,They prophesied that
2636.25,2638.32,,"I should kill my father,"
2638.32,2640.99,,but he is dead
2638.32,2640.99,,and hidden deep in the soil.
2641.03,2643.53,,But surely I must fear my mother's bed.
2643.56,2646.22,,"Oh, Oedipus, Oedipus, unhappy Oedipus."
2646.26,2649.6,,That is all I can call you
2646.26,2649.6,,and all that I ever shall call you.
2650.23,2652.74,,Darkness! And horror of darkness.
2652.83,2657.24,,"Unfolding, restless, visitant,"
2652.83,2657.24,,sped by an ill wind in haste.
2657.27,2662.34,,Madness and... madness
2657.27,2662.34,,aaand... stabbing pain and
2662.43,2664.72,,"and... um, oh..."
2666.64,2668.52,,Oh...
