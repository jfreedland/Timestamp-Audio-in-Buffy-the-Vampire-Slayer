17.2,22.39,BUFFY (V.O.),i>Xander. This isn't the place for either of you.''</i>
22.48,25.71,WOMAN,A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you.
25.8,27.99,BUFFY,Does this mean l can win?
28.08,31.29,CALEB,i> l was kinda hoping it'd go this way.</i>
31.29,32.11,MAN (O.S.),i></i> Hey!
33.96,37.27,ANGEL,At least you could tell me
33.96,37.27,ANGEL,you're glad to see me.
37.36,39.23,BUFFY/FIRST,That bitch.
46,49.78,ANGEL,"Well, l guess that qualifies"
46,49.78,ANGEL,as happy to see me.
50.2,52.39,ANGEL,"Angel, what are you doing here?"
52.48,55.51,ANGEL,Don't even. l just wanna bask.
58.48,60.63,ANGEL,"OK, l'm basked. What are you doing here?"
60.72,63.47,ANGEL,"Not savin' a damsel in distress,"
60.72,63.47,ANGEL,that's for sure.
63.56,67.15,BUFFY,"Oh, you know me."
63.56,67.15,BUFFY,Not much with the damselling.
67.24,69.72,ANGEL,"Got your share of distress, though."
69.72,70.43,BUFFY,You heard?
70.52,73.75,ANGEL,l got coverage on the whole thing.
70.52,73.75,ANGEL,lt's very gripping.
73.84,75.1,ANGEL,lt needs a third act.
75.1,76.35,BUFFY,You have to leave LA.
76.44,78.59,ANGEL,"lt's the First, right?"
78.68,82.75,ANGEL,The First Evil. The power that tried
78.68,82.75,ANGEL,to convince me to kill myself.
82.84,86.46,BUFFY,Yeah. lt's gotten more ambitious
82.84,86.46,BUFFY,since then. lt's raising an army.
86.56,89.87,ANGEL,"Yeah, well, it failed once,"
86.56,89.87,ANGEL,and l'm here to tell you...
90.88,94.23,CALEB,"Are you ready to finish this, bitch?"
98.02,100.07,BUFFY,Advertise your product or brand here

155.64,156.62,BUFFY,OK.
156.72,159.91,BUFFY,How many times do l have to kill you?
156.72,159.91,BUFFY,Ballpark figure.
160,162.43,CALEB,You understand nothing.
167,169.43,CALEB,Aah!
173,175.59,CALEB,You think you have power over me?
178.72,182.71,CALEB,Stupid girl. You'll never stop me.

185.8,188.36,BUFFY,Who does nowadays?
189.92,192.11,ANGEL,i></i>
189.92,192.11,ANGEL,OK.
192.2,194.76,ANGEL,Now l'm pissed. Where is he?
198.36,200.63,BUFFY,He had to split.
201.6,204.63,BUFFY/FIRST,"Yeah, she needs you real bad."
204.72,209.03,BUFFY,l'll have the guys go through that.
204.72,209.03,BUFFY,See if there's anything new. Reliable source?
209.12,210.1,ANGEL,Not remotely.
210.1,212.51,BUFFY,"Well, any port in an apocalypse."
212.6,215.39,ANGEL,"l, uh, brought somethin' else as well."
215.48,218.59,BUFFY,"l can already tell you,"
215.48,218.59,BUFFY,l have nothing that goes with that.
218.68,220.47,ANGEL,lt's not for you.
220.47,221.31,BUFFY,Splainy?
221.4,225.43,ANGEL,l don't know everything. lt's very powerful
221.4,225.43,ANGEL,and probably very dangerous.
225.52,228.75,ANGEL,"lt has a purifying power, a cleansing power..."
229.44,232.87,ANGEL,possibly scrubbing bubbles.
229.44,232.87,ANGEL,"The translation is, uh..."
232.96,235.71,ANGEL,lt bestows strength
232.96,235.71,ANGEL,to the right person who wears it.
235.8,237.39,BUFFY,And the right person is?
237.39,238.51,ANGEL,"Someone ensouled,"
238.6,242.07,ANGEL,but stronger than human.
238.6,242.07,ANGEL,A champion. As in me.
242.16,242.95,BUFFY,Or me.
242.95,243.35,ANGEL,No.
243.44,246.19,ANGEL,l don't know enough about this
243.44,246.19,ANGEL,to risk you wearing it.
246.28,251.75,ANGEL,"Besides, you got that"
246.28,251.75,ANGEL,real cool axe thing going for you.
253.2,255.63,BUFFY,So you're gonna be with me in this?
255.72,258.95,ANGEL,Shoulder to shoulder. l'm yours.
260.12,261.43,BUFFY,No.
261.52,262.89,ANGEL,"No, what?"
262.89,263.35,BUFFY,No.
263.44,266.11,BUFFY,You're not gonna be in this fight.
266.2,267.18,ANGEL,Why the hell not?
267.18,268.63,BUFFY,Because l can't risk you.
268.72,270.18,ANGEL,You need me in this.
270.18,271.63,BUFFY,"No, l need you gone."
271.72,273.31,ANGEL,Why?
275.16,278.03,BUFFY,"lf l lose, if this thing gets past Sunnydale,"
278.12,281.95,BUFFY,then it's days  maybe hours 
278.12,281.95,BUFFY,before the rest of the world goes.
282.04,285.27,BUFFY,"l need a second front, and you to run it."
285.27,285.51,ANGEL,OK.
286.72,289.75,ANGEL,That's one reason. What's the other?
291.44,294,BUFFY,There is no other.
295.44,297.43,BUFFY,ls it Spike?
298.96,300.99,ANGEL,You're not tellin' me something.
301.08,304.07,ANGEL,His scent  l remember it pretty well.
304.16,308.15,BUFFY,Vampires. Anybody ever tell you
304.16,308.15,BUFFY,the smellingpeople thing's a little gross?
308.24,309.84,ANGEL,ls he your boyfriend?
309.84,311.51,BUFFY,ls that your business?
312.6,318.23,ANGEL,Are you in love with him? OK. Maybe l'm out
312.6,318.23,ANGEL,"of line, but this is a curve ball for me."
318.32,320.95,ANGEL,"l mean, we are talking about Spike here."
321.04,323.83,BUFFY,lt's different. He's different.
323.92,326.14,BUFFY,He has a soul now.
326.14,326.51,ANGEL,Oh.
327.88,328.94,ANGEL,Well.
328.94,329.99,BUFFY,What?
330.08,333,ANGEL,That's great. Everyone's got a soul now.
333,334.75,BUFFY,He'll make a difference.
334.84,338.03,ANGEL,l started it. The whole having a soul.
338.88,341.67,ANGEL,Before it was all the cool new thing.
341.67,342.5,BUFFY,"Oh, my God."
342.6,343.24,BUFFY,Are you 12?
343.24,345.59,ANGEL,l get the brushoff for Captain Peroxide.
345.68,347.81,ANGEL,lt doesn't bring out the champion in me.
347.81,349.51,BUFFY,You're not getting the brushoff.
349.6,353.38,BUFFY,Are you gonna go all Dawson on me
349.6,353.38,BUFFY,every time l have a boyfriend?
353.48,355.59,ANGEL,Aha! Boyfriend.
355.68,357.98,BUFFY,He's not.
359.12,360.71,BUFFY,But...
362.92,365.95,BUFFY,he is in my heart.
366.04,368.47,ANGEL,That'll end well.
368.56,371.02,BUFFY,What was the highlight of <i>our</i> relationship?
371.12,374.31,BUFFY,When you broke up with me
371.12,374.31,BUFFY,or when l killed you?
375.32,378.67,BUFFY,l'm well aware of my stellar history with guys.
379.8,380.78,BUFFY,i></i>
380.88,385.47,BUFFY,"And, no, l don't see fat grandchildren"
380.88,385.47,BUFFY,in the offing with Spike.
386.92,390.31,BUFFY,But l don't think that really matters right now.
391.68,398.55,BUFFY,"ln the midst of all this insanity, a couple"
391.68,398.55,BUFFY,of things are actually starting to make sense.
399.28,401.87,BUFFY,And the guy thing...
401.96,403.55,BUFFY,i></i>
405,410.55,BUFFY,l always feared there was something wrong
405,410.55,BUFFY,"with me, because l couldn't make it work."
410.64,414.63,ANGEL,But maybe l'm not supposed to.
410.64,414.63,ANGEL,Because you're the Slayer?
415.52,417.47,ANGEL,Because...
417.56,419.03,BUFFY,OK.
419.12,421.68,BUFFY,l'm cookie dough.
422.68,424.43,BUFFY,l'm not done baking.
424.52,430.27,BUFFY,l'm not finished becoming whoever
424.52,430.27,BUFFY,the hell it is l'm gonna turn out to be.
431.48,436.34,BUFFY,"l make it through this,"
431.48,436.34,BUFFY,"and the next thing, and the next thing,"
436.44,440.99,BUFFY,"and... maybe one day,"
436.44,440.99,BUFFY,l turn around and realise l'm ready.
441.8,443.83,BUFFY,l'm cookies.
443.92,447.59,BUFFY,"And then, you know,"
443.92,447.59,BUFFY,if l want someone to eat m...
447.68,452.83,BUFFY,"or... enjoy warm... delicious cookie me,"
453.48,456.35,BUFFY,then... that's fine.
457.6,460.03,BUFFY,That'll be then.
460.12,462.27,ANGEL,When l'm done.
462.36,465.83,ANGEL,Any thoughts on who might enjoy...
468.28,470.91,ANGEL,Do l have to go with the cookie analogy?
471.48,474.87,BUFFY,l'm not really thinking that far ahead.
474.96,477.63,BUFFY,That's kind of the point.
487.48,493.03,ANGEL,l'll go start workin' on the second front.
487.48,493.03,ANGEL,Make sure l don't have to use it.
496.64,497.83,BUFFY,Angel.
501.88,504.39,BUFFY,l do...
504.48,506.91,BUFFY,sometimes think that far ahead.
507.88,510.11,ANGEL,Sometimes is something.
510.2,513.27,BUFFY,Be a long time coming.
513.36,515.66,BUFFY,"Years, if ever."
515.76,518.35,ANGEL,l ain't gettin' any older.
532.72,534.07,BUFFY,Ow.
534.16,535.51,DAWN,Dumbass.
536.76,541.31,XANDER,Don't look at me. This is a Summers thing.
536.76,541.31,XANDER,lt's all very violent.
542.56,544.99,BUFFY,"lf you get killed, l'm telling."
546.52,548.9,WILLOW,Did you find out anything about the scythe?
549,552.15,BUFFY,"lt slices, dices, and makes julienne preacher."
552.24,553.59,GILES,Caleb?
553.68,554.96,BUFFY,l cut him in half.
554.96,555.67,WILLOW,All right!
555.76,557.53,ANYA,i></i> He had that coming.
557.53,560.47,XANDER,Party in my eye socket. Everyone's invited!
562.48,564.78,XANDER,Sometimes l shouldn't say words.
568.72,571.79,SPIKE,"So, where's Tall, Dark and Forehead?"
571.88,574.71,BUFFY,Let me guess. You can smell him?
574.8,580.23,SPIKE,"Yeah, that and l also used my enhanced"
574.8,580.23,SPIKE,vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing him.
582.4,584.78,BUFFY,lt was... a hello.
584.88,587.44,SPIKE,Most people don't use
584.88,587.44,SPIKE,their tongues to say hello.
588.16,590.15,SPIKE,"Or l guess they do, but..."
590.15,591.83,BUFFY,There were no tongues.
591.92,593.42,BUFFY,"Besides, he's gone."
593.42,596.51,SPIKE,"Oh, just popped by for a quickie, then?"
596.6,599.87,BUFFY,Good. l haven't had enough
596.6,599.87,BUFFY,jealousvampire crap for one night.
599.96,602.55,SPIKE,"He wears lifts, you know."
603.64,607.42,BUFFY,One of these days l'm gonna put you two
603.64,607.42,BUFFY,in a room and let you wrestle it out.
607.52,609.63,SPIKE,No problem at this end.
609.63,609.9,BUFFY,Hm.
610,612.41,BUFFY,There could be oil of some kind involved.
612.41,613.59,SPIKE,Where's the trinket?
613.68,614.31,BUFFY,The whoket?
614.31,616.31,SPIKE,The necklace your sweetie gave you.
616.4,619.59,SPIKE,The one with all the power.
616.4,619.59,SPIKE,l believe it's mine now.
621.48,622.9,BUFFY,How do you figure?
622.9,626.07,SPIKE,Someone with a soul but more than human?
626.16,630.75,SPIKE,Angel meant to wear it.
626.16,630.75,SPIKE,That means l'm the qualified party.
630.84,632.48,BUFFY,lt's volatile. We don't know...
632.48,634.59,SPIKE,You need someone strong to bear it then.
634.68,637.47,SPIKE,You were planning on givin' it to Andrew?
640.48,644.02,BUFFY,Angel said the amulet was meant
640.48,644.02,BUFFY,to be worn by a champion.
661.44,664.67,SPIKE,Been called a lot of things in my time.
665.8,668.51,BUFFY,Faith still has my room.
668.6,670.83,SPIKE,"Well, you're not stayin' here."
670.92,674.03,SPIKE,You can't buy me off
670.92,674.03,SPIKE,with shiny beads and sweet talk.
674.12,678.87,SPIKE,You got Angel breath. l'm not gonna let you
674.12,678.87,SPIKE,whack me back and forth like a rubber ball.
678.96,681.31,SPIKE,"l've got my pride, you know."
681.4,683.35,BUFFY,l understand.
683.72,688.07,SPIKE,"Clearly you don't, cos the whole ''having"
683.72,688.07,SPIKE,my pride'' thing was just a smoke screen.
688.16,690.07,BUFFY,"Oh, thank God."
693.16,697.95,SPIKE,l don't know what l would have done
693.16,697.95,SPIKE,if you'd have gone up those stairs.
733.52,735.51,CALEB/FIRST,"Pretty, ain't it?"
736.44,737.59,BUFFY,You're not him.
737.59,740.35,CALEB/FIRST,"No, you killed him right and proper."
740.44,744.22,CALEB/FIRST,Terrible loss.
740.44,744.22,CALEB/FIRST,This man was my good right arm.
744.96,750.23,CALEB/FIRST,"Course, it don't pain me too much."
744.96,750.23,CALEB/FIRST,Don't need an arm. Got an army.
750.32,753.3,BUFFY,An army of vampires. However will l fight...?
753.3,755.15,CALEB/FIRST,Every day our numbers swell.
755.24,757.43,CALEB/FIRST,But then you do have an army of your own.
757.52,761.06,CALEB/FIRST,"odd pimply faced girls,"
757.52,761.06,CALEB/FIRST,don't know the pointy end of a stake.
761.16,762.64,CALEB/FIRST,Maybe l should call this off.
762.64,764.07,BUFFY,Ever considered a cool name?
764.16,768.39,BUFFY,Since you're incorporeal and basically
764.16,768.39,BUFFY,powerless. How about ''The Taunter''?
768.48,770.13,BUFFY,Strikes fear in the heart...
770.13,771.67,CALEB/FIRST,l will overrun this earth.
771.76,776.19,CALEB/FIRST,When my army outnumbers the humans
771.76,776.19,CALEB/FIRST,"on this earth, the scales will tip..."
776.28,778.91,CALEB/FIRST,and l will be made flesh.
779,782.39,BUFFY,Talk on. l'm not afraid of you.
782.48,786.26,CALEB/FIRST,Then why aren't you asleep
782.48,786.26,CALEB/FIRST,in your dead lover's arms?
789.8,792.83,CALEB/FIRST,Cos he can't help you.
794,799.63,CALEB/FIRST,"Nor Faith, nor your friends,"
794,799.63,CALEB/FIRST,certainly not your wannaslay brigade.
799.72,805.47,CALEB/FIRST,None of those girlies will ever know real
799.72,805.47,CALEB/FIRST,power unless you're dead. You know the drill.
805.56,808.15,BUFFY/FIRST,"lnto every generation, a slayer is born.''"
808.6,814.27,BUFFY/FIRST,One girl in all the world. She alone
808.6,814.27,BUFFY/FIRST,will have the strength and skill to...''
814.36,816.47,BUFFY/FIRST,There's that word again.
816.56,819.07,BUFFY/FIRST,What you are. How you'll die.
820.08,822.03,BUFFY/FIRST,Alone.
824.52,826.59,BUFFY/FIRST,Where's your snappy comeback?
829.08,830.18,BUFFY,You're right.
830.18,831.71,BUFFY/FIRST,Hm. Not your best.
832.6,834.55,SPIKE,l'm drowning in footwear!
838.32,840.31,SPIKE,Weird dream.
841.76,843.35,SPIKE,Buffy?
846.12,849.23,BUFFY,ls there something wrong?
846.12,849.23,BUFFY,No. Yeah.
850.56,853.02,BUFFY,l just realised something.
853.12,856.9,BUFFY,Something that really never
853.12,856.9,BUFFY,occurred to me before.
859.32,862.27,BUFFY,We're gonna win.
871.56,873.55,BUFFY,What do you think?
873.64,877.79,XANDER,That depends. Are you in any way... kidding?
878.6,880.57,BUFFY,You don't think it's a good idea?
880.57,881.95,FAITH,"lt's pretty radical, B."
882.04,884.03,FAITH,lt's a lot more than that.
884.12,888.51,GILES,"Buffy, what you said,"
884.12,888.51,GILES,it flies in the face of everything we've ever...
888.6,892.55,GILES,every generation has ever done
888.6,892.55,GILES,in the fight against evil.
893.36,896.07,GILES,l think it's bloody brilliant.
896.6,897.61,BUFFY,You mean that?
897.61,899.27,GILES,lf you want my opinion.
899.36,900.73,BUFFY,l really do.
900.73,901.87,WILLOW,"Whoa, hey."
901.96,906.11,WILLOW,"Not to poop on the party, but l'm the guy"
901.96,906.11,WILLOW,that's gonna have to pull this thing off.
906.2,907.75,FAITH,lt is beaucoup de mojo.
907.75,910.51,WILLOW,This goes beyond anything l've ever done.
910.6,912.95,WILLOW,"lt's a total loss of control,"
913.04,917.79,WILLOW,"and not in a nice, wholesome, ''my girlfriend"
913.04,917.79,WILLOW,has a pierced tongue'' kind of way.
917.88,920.44,BUFFY,l wouldn't ask if l didn't think you could do it.
920.52,923.2,WILLOW,l'm not sure that l'm stable enough.
923.2,924.99,GILES,"You can do this, Willow."
925.08,928.86,GILES,"We'll get the coven on the line,"
925.08,928.86,GILES,and we'll find out how they can help.
928.96,930.47,GILES,l'll...
930.47,931.11,DAWN,Oh!
931.68,932.66,DAWN,Pierced tongue.
932.66,934.35,BUFFY,Dawn needs to do research.
934.44,935.43,GILES,"Yes, you do."
935.43,938.71,DAWN,lt's cool. Watcherjunior to the library.
938.8,941.59,GILES,l'll go dig up my sources. Quite literally.
941.68,944.79,ANYA,Some of them are dead.
941.68,944.79,ANYA,Let's assemble the cannon fodder.
944.88,948.16,XANDER,"That's not what we're calling 'em, sweetie."
948.16,951.43,ANYA,"Not to their faces. What am l, insensitive?"
956.48,961.03,ANYA,i></i> l hate this. l hate being here.
961.12,964.19,ANYA,l hate that you have to be here.
964.28,969.11,ANYA,"l hate that there's evil,"
964.28,969.11,ANYA,and that l was chosen to fight it.
969.2,972.27,ANYA,"l wish, a whole lot of the time,"
969.2,972.27,ANYA,that l hadn't been.
972.36,975.35,ANYA,l know a lot of you wish l hadn't been either.
976.56,979.15,BUFFY,But this isn't about wishes.
979.24,981.54,BUFFY,This is about choices.
981.64,983.91,BUFFY,l believe we can beat this evil.
984,987.59,BUFFY,"Not when it comes,"
984,987.59,BUFFY,not when its army is ready.
987.68,989.03,BUFFY,Now.
989.12,992.19,BUFFY,Tomorrow morning l'm opening the seal.
993.76,998.11,BUFFY,"l'm going down into the Hellmouth,"
993.76,998.11,BUFFY,and l'm finishing this once and for all.
998.2,1002.27,BUFFY,Right now you're asking yourself
998.2,1002.27,BUFFY,What makes this different?''
1002.36,1007.15,BUFFY,What makes us anything more than a bunch
1002.36,1007.15,BUFFY,of girls being picked off one by one?''
1007.6,1011.38,BUFFY,lt's true none of you have
1007.6,1011.38,BUFFY,the power that Faith and l do.
1012.88,1015.47,BUFFY,So here's the part where you make a choice.
1017.68,1019.71,ROBIN,lt's one hell of a risky idea.
1019.71,1021.27,FAITH,Buffy's wacky that way.
1021.36,1026.91,ROBIN,Yeah. There's one more vent by the stairs.
1021.36,1026.91,ROBIN,"We block that, they got no sewer access."
1027,1029.08,ROBIN,Should drive them up into the school.
1029.08,1030.54,FAITH,Assuming they get past us.
1030.64,1032.4,ROBIN,"Which, no offence, l am."
1032.4,1035.27,FAITH,"Come on, you gotta have a little faith."
1035.36,1037.55,ROBIN,"l think l've had my share, thanks."
1037.55,1040.19,FAITH,"l trundled right into that one, didn't l?"
1040.84,1042.65,ROBIN,"Look, l'm sorry if it seemed like"
1042.65,1044.62,FAITH,l was blowing you off the other day.
1044.72,1047.43,FAITH,"l was just trying to, you know, blow you off."
1047.52,1051.95,ROBIN,"Yeah, l figured that one out all by myself."
1047.52,1051.95,ROBIN,lt's nothing personal.
1052.04,1056.95,FAITH,"lt's just after l get bouncy with a guy, there's"
1052.04,1056.95,FAITH,not much more l need to know about him.
1057.04,1057.94,ROBIN,That's bleak.
1057.94,1059.11,FAITH,Way of the world.
1059.2,1063.99,ROBIN,That's good to know cos l thought it was
1059.2,1063.99,ROBIN,"a more defensive, isolationist slayer crap."
1064.08,1066.07,FAITH,And he comes out swingin'.
1066.16,1070.11,ROBIN,"Faith, there's a whole world out there"
1066.16,1070.11,ROBIN,"that you don't even know about,"
1070.2,1075.22,ROBIN,and a lot of the men in it are pretty
1070.2,1075.22,ROBIN,decent guys. They'd surprise you.
1075.32,1079.31,FAITH,"A guy looks at me,"
1075.32,1079.31,FAITH,let's just say his priorities shift.
1079.4,1081.13,ROBIN,"Why, because you're so hot?"
1081.13,1082.47,FAITH,"lt is what it is, yo."
1082.56,1085.75,ROBIN,"Oh, please."
1082.56,1085.75,ROBIN,l am so much prettier than you are.
1085.84,1088.55,ROBIN,"Oh, and, uh... for the record,"
1088.64,1092.95,ROBIN,our little encounter didn't
1088.64,1092.95,ROBIN,exactly change my world.
1093.04,1095.75,FAITH,"You're trippin'. That was rock 'em, sock 'em."
1095.84,1098.12,FAITH,"No, no, no, no. lt was nice enough,"
1098.12,1099.62,ROBIN,"you know, and you're..."
1099.72,1105.59,ROBIN,"you're very, um... enthused,"
1099.72,1105.59,ROBIN,and l think with a little more experience...
1105.68,1108.03,FAITH,"Dude, l got mad skills."
1108.12,1110.16,ROBIN,"Yeah, of course. Let's finish up."
1110.16,1112.87,FAITH,"No, hell with that. We're goin' again, baby."
1112.96,1115.54,FAITH,"You're gonna learn a little respect here, pal."
1115.54,1117.51,ROBIN,"Faith... make me a deal, all right?"
1117.6,1122.07,ROBIN,"We live through this,"
1117.6,1122.07,ROBIN,you give me the chance to surprise you.
1122.96,1125.15,FAITH,What would be the surprise?
1125.24,1128.83,ROBIN,"You do know the meaning of the word, right?"
1130.6,1131.92,FAITH,Fine. Deal.
1131.92,1133.35,ROBIN,Good enough.
1136.04,1137.79,FAITH,No way you're prettier than me.
1137.79,1138.87,ROBIN,"A little bit, yeah."
1140.76,1143.39,WILLOW,l really wish she hadn't said that about me.
1143.48,1145.67,KENNEDY,"What, the thing Buffy said?"
1145.76,1147.73,KENNEDY,l think it's true.
1147.73,1148.39,WILLOW,i></i>
1149.28,1152.35,KENNEDY,l'll be with you. To keep you grounded.

1152.44,1157.43,WILLOW,"stabded, if l go to the bad place."

1174.24,1176.47,WILLOW,This is too important for me to...
1176.47,1177.91,KENNEDY,Buffy believes in you.
1178,1181.31,WILLOW,"You know, Buffy  sweet girl, not that bright."
1181.4,1183.65,WILLOW,"Hey, l'm the first one to call her out"
1183.65,1185.31,KENNEDY,when she's not making sense.
1185.4,1191.74,KENNEDY,"ln fact, this may have escaped"
