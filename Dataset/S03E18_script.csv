15.85,18.41,,You demons can't resist
15.85,18.41,,"a runandstumble, can you?"
37.31,40.47,BUFFY,One down... one gone.
106.88,108.75,WILLOW,So scabby demon
106.88,108.75,WILLOW,got away?
108.82,110.34,WILLOW,Scabby demon number 2
108.82,110.34,WILLOW,got away.
110.42,111.62,BUFFY,Scabby demon number one...
111.69,113.49,BUFFY,Big check
111.69,113.49,BUFFY,in the "slay" column.
113.56,115.19,WILLOW,I don't like this
113.56,115.19,WILLOW,little "no mouth" thing.
115.26,116.69,WILLOW,It's disquieting.
116.76,119.56,BUFFY,"Well, no mouth"
116.76,119.56,BUFFY,means no teeth.
119.63,121.43,BUFFY,Unless they have them
119.63,121.43,BUFFY,somewhere else.
121.5,122.83,GILES,Giles:
121.5,122.83,GILES,"Good morning, girls."
122.9,127.34,GILES,We've been researching
122.9,127.34,GILES,the mayor's forthcoming ascension.
127.41,128.6,OZ,It's pretty riveting stuff.
128.67,132.02,BUFFY,What do we know?
130.07,132.17,BUFFY,What don't we know?
132.24,133.68,XANDER,"Tell her, Giles."
133.75,134.35,XANDER,"Well, based"
134.35,135.61,GILES,on the supposed date...
135.68,138.11,GILES,Graduation day... and the mayor
135.68,138.11,GILES,being impervious to harm...
138.18,139.62,XANDER,I've crossreferenced...
139.68,142.24,XANDER,He's a crossreferencing fool.
142.32,144.81,GILES,And I've eliminated
142.32,144.81,GILES,several possibilities.
144.89,147.62,GILES,It's not the ritual flaying
144.89,147.62,GILES,of the demon Azorath...
147.69,148.78,GILES,"nor the, um..."
153.43,155.16,GILES,I don't know
153.43,155.16,GILES,what's going to happen.
156.3,157.89,OZ,That was kind of
156.3,157.89,OZ,an anticlimax.
157.97,159.33,BUFFY,Buffy: We don't know anything?
159.4,161.2,BUFFY,The whole FaithAngel thing
159.4,161.2,BUFFY,was for nothing?
161.27,162.74,BUFFY,"No, no, no. Um..."
162.81,164.4,GILES,"if nothing else,"
162.81,164.4,GILES,Angel's charade
164.48,167.17,GILES,has brought Faith's treachery
164.48,167.17,GILES,into the open...
167.25,169.51,GILES,and this information about
167.25,169.51,GILES,the ascension will prove...
169.58,171.07,GILES,useful.
171.15,173.88,GILES,"Eventually, I just need"
171.15,173.88,GILES,to put it together.
173.95,176.08,WESLEY,Terribly sorry.
173.95,176.08,WESLEY,I was detained.
176.15,178.02,WESLEY,Official Council business.
178.09,179.78,WESLEY,"Mr. Giles, you were speaking?"
179.86,182.52,GILES,I was just filling Buffy in
179.86,182.52,GILES,on my progress
182.59,183.75,GILES,regarding the research
183.75,184.65,WESLEY,of the ascension.
184.73,187.49,WESLEY,Oh. And what took up
184.73,187.49,WESLEY,the rest of the minute?
190.03,194.02,WESLEY,Touch√©.
192.07,193.47,GILES,"Of course, my work"
192.07,193.47,GILES,is unofficial.
193.54,195.63,GILES,"I'm sure, however..."
195.71,199.16,GILES,with the resources of the Council
195.71,199.16,GILES,at your disposal...
199.24,200.71,GILES,you will have something to add.
204.18,205.77,WESLEY,Well...
205.85,207.41,WESLEY,I am pleased to state
207.49,209.18,WESLEY,with certainty
209.25,211.59,WESLEY,that the demon Azorath
209.25,211.59,WESLEY,will not in any way be...
211.66,212.88,WESLEY,involved in...
215.09,216.75,WESLEY,I'm sure we'll
215.09,216.75,WESLEY,find out more soon.
223.57,225.76,GILES,The demon Azorath?
225.84,229.03,WILLOW,"So, have you talked"
225.84,229.03,WILLOW,to Angel lately?
229.11,230.77,BUFFY,Not really.
230.84,233.74,BUFFY,"Seeing him bad,"
230.84,233.74,BUFFY,even pretendbad...
233.81,235.21,BUFFY,and with Faith...
235.28,237.61,WILLOW,he only kissed her
235.28,237.61,WILLOW,for the greater good.
239.32,240.25,BUFFY,I don't know.
240.32,242.34,BUFFY,"To the naked eye,"
240.32,242.34,BUFFY,it looked like fun.
242.42,243.75,BUFFY,Or maybe it wasn't.
243.82,246.81,BUFFY,Maybe... he
243.82,246.81,BUFFY,wasn't even tempted.
246.89,248.45,BUFFY,I just wish
246.89,248.45,BUFFY,I could be sure.
248.53,251.02,WILLOW,"As always,"
248.53,251.02,WILLOW,I advise you to ask.
251.1,252.12,BUFFY,Like he'd tell me?
253.3,255.46,RANDOM,Student: Hogan!
255.53,257.13,RANDOM,"Great game, man!"
257.2,258.13,RANDOM,Thanks.
258.2,261.17,XANDER,Hogan Martin thinks
258.2,261.17,XANDER,he's soooo hot!
261.24,262.73,XANDER,Like we should
261.24,262.73,XANDER,all be awed by him
262.81,263.93,XANDER,cause he can put
262.81,263.93,XANDER,a ball in the net.
266.02,265.24,HOGAN,"Hey, Xander."
265.31,267.33,XANDER,He said my name!
265.31,267.33,XANDER,He knows my name!
268.45,270.07,PERCY,"Hey, Willow."
270.15,270.66,WILLOW,Hi.
270.66,271.51,PERCY,Um...
271.58,274.45,PERCY,"Look, I can't make the study session"
271.58,274.45,PERCY,after school today.
274.52,275.82,PERCY,Um... can we do it
274.52,275.82,PERCY,fifth period?
275.89,277.05,PERCY,OK.
277.12,278.32,WILLOW,Did you finish
277.12,278.32,WILLOW,the reading?
278.39,279.65,PERCY,Most of it.
279.72,280.66,WILLOW,Percy...
280.73,281.99,PERCY,I'll finish it at lunch.
282.06,284.32,WILLOW,That's my little trooper.
284.4,285.56,HOGAN,I don't know
284.4,285.56,HOGAN,what you're doing to him.
285.63,287.79,HOGAN,I actually heard him
285.63,287.79,HOGAN,complete a sentence.
287.87,289.42,HOGAN,Had a clause
287.87,289.42,HOGAN,and everything.
290.5,292.13,PERCY,Going to watch
290.5,292.13,PERCY,"the game, right?"
292.2,293.14,WILLOW,Wouldn't miss it.
293.2,294.14,BUFFY,"See you, Hogan!"
294.21,296.07,WILLOW,Ladies.
296.14,297.37,BUFFY,You're going
296.14,297.37,BUFFY,to the game?
297.44,299,BUFFY,I didn't know
297.44,299,BUFFY,you liked basketball.
299.08,300.1,WILLOW,"I didn't, either..."
300.18,301.98,WILLOW,but I've really started
300.18,301.98,WILLOW,getting into it.
302.05,303.81,WILLOW,Especially now that
302.05,303.81,WILLOW,we're in the championships...
303.88,304.94,WILLOW,it's so exciting.
305.02,306.24,WILLOW,Too bad you're patrolling...
306.32,309.62,WILLOW,cause we're all going.
306.32,309.62,WILLOW,"Oz, Xander, everybody."
309.69,310.98,BUFFY,Right.
311.06,313.39,BUFFY,Everybody who isn't
311.06,313.39,BUFFY,currently Buffy.
316.43,318.69,GILES,You touched
316.43,318.69,GILES,one of the demons.
318.76,320.23,BUFFY,A good touch.
320.3,322.32,BUFFY,Not a bad touch.
322.4,325.16,BUFFY,"Anyway, it's been"
322.4,325.16,BUFFY,itching like crazy.
325.24,326.2,BUFFY,No big.
326.27,327.24,BUFFY,Just another problem
327.31,329.33,BUFFY,for the good people
327.31,329.33,BUFFY,"at Lubriderm, right?"
329.41,330.81,GILES,This the demon
329.41,330.81,GILES,in question?
331.94,333.54,BUFFY,In the disgusting flesh.
333.61,334.74,GILES,Hmm...
336.21,337.15,BUFFY,What?
337.22,339.98,GILES,It says they
337.22,339.98,GILES,can infect a host.
340.05,341.88,BUFFY,Infect?
341.95,343.48,BUFFY,Infect?
343.55,344.49,BUFFY,Giles!
344.56,346.46,BUFFY,Hmm?
344.56,346.46,BUFFY,Infect?!
346.52,348.46,GILES,Oh. Uh...
346.52,348.46,GILES,infect the host
348.53,350.79,GILES,with an aspect
348.53,350.79,GILES,of the demon."
350.86,351.79,GILES,That's all it says.
351.86,353.83,GILES,An aspect
351.86,353.83,GILES,of the demon?
353.9,355.02,GILES,"That's rather terse, isn't it?"
355.1,356.5,BUFFY,You mean
355.1,356.5,BUFFY,like a part of it?
356.57,359.13,GILES,There could be
356.57,359.13,GILES,any number of explanations
359.2,361.47,GILES,"for your hand. I mean,"
359.2,361.47,GILES,a new fabric softener
361.54,363.06,GILES,can cause irritation.
363.14,367.02,GILES,"In any case,"
363.14,367.02,GILES,I... I would advise
365.08,368.1,GILES,not to attempt to track
365.08,368.1,GILES,the one that got away.
368.18,370.41,GILES,Let's minimize
368.18,370.41,GILES,your exposure.
370.48,373.08,BUFFY,A part of the demon.
373.15,375.58,BUFFY,I hope it's not
373.15,375.58,BUFFY,the outside part.
375.65,381.15,CHEERLEADERS,HOGAN. It's Hogan!
381.23,383.99,BUFFY,Go Hogan!
390.77,393.43,BUFFY,"Is it me, or is this"
390.77,393.43,BUFFY,really lame?
393.5,395.6,OZ,I don't know. I usually
393.5,395.6,OZ,enjoy lameness...
395.67,397.44,OZ,and this is leaving me
395.67,397.44,OZ,kinda cold.
397.51,399.1,WILLOW,"Well, according to"
397.51,399.1,WILLOW,Freddy's latest editorial...
399.18,401.11,WILLOW,The pep rally is a place for
401.18,402.91,WILLOW,pseudoprostitutes
401.18,402.91,WILLOW,to provoke men
402.98,404.41,WILLOW,into a sexual frenzy...
404.48,408.25,WILLOW,"which, when thwarted, results"
404.48,408.25,WILLOW,in pointless athletic competition."
408.32,410.75,XANDER,And the downside being?
410.82,413.76,WILLOW,The school paper is edging
410.82,413.76,WILLOW,on depressing lately.
413.82,415.62,WILLOW,Have you guys noticed that?
415.69,418.29,OZ,I don't know. I always
415.69,418.29,OZ,go straight to the obits.
420.33,422.27,WILLOW,"What are you doing, Buffy?"
422.33,423.39,WILLOW,Nothing.
423.47,425.37,WILLOW,Checking for horns.
426.77,430.57,WILLOW,"Ah, you know, Buffy,"
426.77,430.57,WILLOW,I don't even think Giles is right
430.64,433.2,WILLOW,about you becoming
430.64,433.2,WILLOW,like a demon.
433.28,435.18,WILLOW,"I mean, he's totally burnt,"
433.28,435.18,WILLOW,you know...
435.25,437.27,WILLOW,dealing with Faith
435.25,437.27,WILLOW,and this ascension thing.
437.35,440.61,WILLOW,"Between you and me,"
437.35,440.61,WILLOW,he's not doing his best work.
440.69,442.15,BUFFY,But what if he is right?
442.22,443.41,,I'm suddenly gonna grow
443.41,444.35,BUFFY,this demon part...
444.42,446.58,BUFFY,and we don't even know
444.42,446.58,BUFFY,what it is.
446.66,448.25,BUFFY,It could be claws
446.66,448.25,BUFFY,or scales...
449.33,450.26,BUFFY,What?
450.33,451.89,WILLOW,Was it a boy demon?
453.13,456.26,CHEERLEADERS,TOM.
456.33,457.27,CHEERLEADERS,It's Tom!
457.34,458.77,CHEERLEADERS,Go Tom!
458.84,461.74,XANDER,They really are very good.
461.81,463.24,OZ,Their spelling's improved.
463.31,466.11,XANDER,"You know, Oz, I look"
463.31,466.11,XANDER,at all this beauty...
466.18,468.11,XANDER,all these healthy
466.18,468.11,XANDER,young women...
468.18,470.91,XANDER,and I wonder why I ever
468.18,470.91,XANDER,wasted my time on Cordelia.
470.98,472.78,XANDER,"I mean, look at her."
472.85,474.68,XANDER,She's no betterlooking
472.85,474.68,XANDER,than the rest of'em.
474.75,476.12,XANDER,None of'em
474.75,476.12,XANDER,are really my...
476.19,477.48,XANDER,"Oh, my God,"
476.19,477.48,XANDER,he's looking at her!
478.89,480.41,XANDER,He's got his filthy...
480.49,483.22,XANDER,adult Pierce Brosnany
480.49,483.22,XANDER,eyes all over my Cordy.
485.06,487.16,OZ,"You're a very complex man,"
485.06,487.16,OZ,aren't you?
488.6,490.53,BUFFY,"It's just I'm scared, Wil."
490.6,495.97,BUFFY,"There's this thing in me,"
490.6,495.97,BUFFY,and I can't find it. I can't stop it.
496.04,498.3,BUFFY,What if it changes me?
498.38,500.64,BUFFY,I mean not just
498.38,500.64,BUFFY,the way I look.
500.71,503.31,BUFFY,"All of a sudden, I... I could be"
500.71,503.31,BUFFY,something that's not me anymore.
503.38,504.25,CHEERLEADERS,"Yeah, whoohoo!"
505.52,507.45,ANGEL,"Oh, sorry."
505.52,507.45,ANGEL,They spelled Percy...
507.52,513.02,ANGEL,and... and I have
507.52,513.02,ANGEL,to show support. He's needy.
511.09,513.15,ANGEL,But... But I heard what you
511.09,513.15,ANGEL,"were saying, really..."
513.22,514.98,ANGEL,and... and I would be
513.22,514.98,ANGEL,"frightened, too..."
515.12,517.21,ANGEL,but I'm sure
515.12,517.21,ANGEL,you're gonna be OK.
533.27,536.73,ANGEL,Still got a mouth.
538.58,540.41,ANGEL,Sorry.
540.48,541.41,BUFFY,It's OK.
541.48,542.47,BUFFY,I didn't see you...
542.55,545.07,BUFFY,so I should've known
542.55,545.07,BUFFY,you were there.
546.72,548.18,BUFFY,What are you doing here?
548.25,551.45,NGEL,"It's a dangerous time,"
548.25,551.45,NGEL,"you know, with Faith."
553.12,555.18,BUFFY,"Yeah, Faith."
556.26,557.49,BUFFY,"She, well..."
557.56,560.69,BUFFY,"Faith, what can"
557.56,560.69,BUFFY,you say about her?
560.76,565.5,ANGEL,"I just want to make sure that you're,"
560.76,565.5,ANGEL,"you know, OK, that you're safe."
565.57,566.78,ANGEL,"Well, the fact that"
566.78,568.06,BUFFY,you're right here...
568.14,571.04,BUFFY,Does that mean
568.14,571.04,BUFFY,Faith's around?
571.11,573.37,BUFFY,Are you keeping me safe
573.44,575.78,BUFFY,"by tracking me,"
573.44,575.78,BUFFY,or are you tracking her?
575.85,577.51,ANGEL,I'm tracking you.
577.58,579.74,ANGEL,Something's bothering you.
579.82,581.88,BUFFY,A lot of things...
584.15,588.96,BUFFY,the most recent
584.15,588.96,BUFFY,"being this demon... actually, 2."
589.03,590.46,BUFFY,I touched one of them...
590.53,593,BUFFY,and now I'm gonna get
590.53,593,BUFFY,a big case of the bumpies
593.06,594.86,BUFFY,or a tail or something.
594.93,596.36,ANGEL,Aspect of the demon.
596.43,597.52,BUFFY,You know the drill.
597.6,600.03,ANGEL,By rumor. But that
597.6,600.03,ANGEL,doesn't mean anything.
600.1,603.1,ANGEL,"I mean, sometimes demons..."
600.1,603.1,ANGEL,they just exaggerate their power.
603.17,606.3,BUFFY,Demon hype...
603.17,606.3,BUFFY,or maybe not.
606.38,609.54,BUFFY,I spend all my time
606.38,609.54,BUFFY,in the dark here anyway.
609.61,613.05,BUFFY,"It's not like I'd be at a game,"
609.61,613.05,BUFFY,"you know, with my friends"
613.12,615.17,BUFFY,where someone could see me
615.17,616.98,,in my new monster part.
617.05,618.45,ANGEL,Hey.
618.52,621.55,ANGEL,I won't let anything happen
618.52,621.55,ANGEL,to you if I can help it.
624.23,627.13,ANGEL,"And no matter what,"
624.23,627.13,ANGEL,I'll always be with you.
629.37,633.86,ANGEL,"Hey, I'll love you even"
629.37,633.86,ANGEL,if you're covered with slime.
636.97,639,BUFFY,I liked everything
636.97,639,BUFFY,until that part.
643.78,647.02,WILLOW,Could you believe it?
645.08,648.02,WILLOW,"Right at the buzzer,"
645.08,648.02,WILLOW,points for the win.
648.08,649.07,OZ,It was intense.
649.15,650.38,XANDER,"Yeah, for a minute there..."
650.45,652.22,XANDER,I thought you were gonna
650.45,652.22,XANDER,make an expression.
652.29,653.85,XANDER,I felt one coming on.
652.29,653.85,XANDER,I won't lie.
653.92,656.45,WILLOW,"Man, I've never seen anyone"
653.92,656.45,WILLOW,jump like Hogan Martin.
656.53,658.15,WILLOW,They should call him
656.53,658.15,WILLOW,TheJumper."
658.23,661.49,XANDER,Or a name that isn't an article
658.23,661.49,XANDER,"of women's clothing. Hey, remember..."
661.56,663.46,WILLOW,Shh.
666.57,669.33,BUFFY,Hmm. Quietness.
669.41,670.6,BUFFY,We either lost...
670.67,672.97,BUFFY,"or we won, and you don't"
670.67,672.97,BUFFY,want me to feel bad.
673.04,676.03,WILLOW,"Ooh, yeah, it wasn't"
673.04,676.03,WILLOW,really a good game.
676.11,677.55,XANDER,"Yeah, tall hoops,"
676.11,677.55,XANDER,but then tall guys.
677.61,678.84,XANDER,What's the point?
678.92,679.88,OZ,Pretty dull.
679.95,681.14,CORDELIA,Are you guys crazy?
681.22,682.51,CORDELIA,It was an incredible game.
682.59,684.52,CORDELIA,I've never cheered so hard
682.59,684.52,CORDELIA,in my life.
684.59,687.35,CORDELIA,I still have knee marks
684.59,687.35,CORDELIA,on my back.
689.06,690.62,CORDELIA,From the pyramid.
693.26,696.99,WILLOW,"Yeah, well, I still bet"
693.26,696.99,WILLOW,patrolling was way better...
697.07,698.5,WILLOW,"cause, wow, important."
698.57,702.2,BUFFY,"Well, I thought I saw"
698.57,702.2,BUFFY,a 4legged demon...
702.27,704.21,BUFFY,but it was just a dog.
704.27,705.21,OZ,Weredog?
705.28,706.4,BUFFY,Regular.
706.48,707.41,XANDER,Tough luck.
707.48,708.57,XANDER,Yeah.
711.51,713.85,XANDER,Thinking: I wonder if she and
711.51,713.85,XANDER,Wesley have kissed.
713.92,715.04,BUFFY,"It really bugs you, huh?"
715.12,716.85,XANDER,What?
716.92,719.18,XANDER,Cordelia and Wesley
716.92,719.18,XANDER,smooching.
719.26,721.72,XANDER,"Man, you read my mind."
736.47,737.53,MR,Ooh!
737.61,739.47,MR,Whoa there. You watch
737.61,739.47,MR,where you're going now.
739.54,741.7,BUFFY,"I'm sorry, Mr. Beach. I will."
741.78,745.91,MR,Thinking: Students. If we could just
741.78,745.91,MR,get rid of all the students.
745.98,747.18,GEEKY,Boy: When I'm a software jillionaire...
747.25,748.34,GEEKY,and you're all
747.25,748.34,GEEKY,flippin'burgers...
748.42,750.35,GEEKY,who's the loser then?
750.42,753.65,FEMALE,"Girl: Maybe I'll take French,"
750.42,753.65,FEMALE,I said. How hard can it be?
753.72,756.06,FEMALE,"French babies learn it, idiot."
756.13,757.35,SOME,"Boy: I swear,"
756.13,757.35,SOME,someday my pants
757.43,758.89,SOME,are gonna fall right off.
760.26,761.68,SOME,"Boy: God, Buffy"
761.68,763.2,ANOTHER,is so beautiful.
763.27,766.86,ANOTHER,"I mean,"
763.27,766.86,ANOTHER,look at that body.
766.94,768.87,ANOTHER,God...
768.94,772.87,ANOTHER,I'd love to shove her against
768.94,772.87,ANOTHER,that locker right now and just... Ooh!
775.18,777.77,BUFFY,"Is this the thing,"
775.18,777.77,BUFFY,the aspect thing?
777.85,780.61,BUFFY,"Because I gotta say, if it is,"
777.85,780.61,BUFFY,it is way better than a tail.
780.68,782.62,BUFFY,"I mean, I have a hard"
780.68,782.62,BUFFY,enough time as it is
782.69,784.12,BUFFY,finding jeans
782.69,784.12,BUFFY,that fit right.
784.19,785.62,GILES,"Buffy, slow down."
785.69,791.13,GILES,I'm... I'm not even convinced
785.69,791.13,GILES,that this is genuine mind reading.
791.19,793.63,GILES,YYYou're most likely
791.19,793.63,GILES,projecting your...
793.7,796.06,BUFFY,When I walked in
793.7,796.06,BUFFY,a few minutes ago...
796.13,798.07,BUFFY,"you thought,"
796.13,798.07,BUFFY,Look at her shoes.
798.13,799.86,BUFFY,If a fashion magazine
798.13,799.86,BUFFY,told her to...
799.94,801.9,BUFFY,she'd wear cats strapped
799.94,801.9,BUFFY,to her feet."
801.97,802.94,GILES,"I, um..."
805.02,805.41,GILES,the demons are telepathic.
805.48,807.24,GILES,I should have known.
805.48,807.24,GILES,That's why they don't need mouths.
807.31,810.07,GILES,Of course. The demons
807.31,810.07,GILES,are telepathic.
810.15,811.94,BUFFY,I know. You just told me.
812.01,813.71,BUFFY,That's why they don't
812.01,813.71,BUFFY,need mouths.
813.78,815.88,BUFFY,And you should have known.
815.95,818.08,GILES,I... This is astounding.
818.15,820.25,GILES,It was happening out
818.15,820.25,GILES,in the hallway.
820.32,823.12,GILES,Principal Snyder has Walk Like
820.32,823.12,GILES,an Egyptian stuck in his head.
823.19,826.16,GILES,And the boys of the school
823.19,826.16,GILES,are seriously disturbed.
826.23,829.56,GILES,"It's weird, but, Giles,"
826.23,829.56,GILES,think about it.
829.63,830.16,GILES,"I mean, think"
830.16,831.07,BUFFY,about what I could do.
831.13,833.07,GILES,It could be very useful.
833.14,836.07,GILES,You could anticipate
833.14,836.07,GILES,your opponent's every move...
836.14,837.27,GILES,turn his plans
836.14,837.27,GILES,against him.
837.34,839.77,BUFFY,"Oh, way better than that."
839.84,840.77,BUFFY,Jealousy.
840.84,844.9,TEACHER,Buffy! Right. Very good.
844.98,846.35,TEACHER,Ms. Murray: Jealousy...
846.42,847.82,NANCY,I knew that.
847.88,850.61,TEACHER,Clearly is the tool that
847.88,850.61,TEACHER,Iago uses to undo Othello.
850.69,852.31,TEACHER,But what's his motivation?
852.39,856.62,TEACHER,What reason does Iago give for
852.39,856.62,TEACHER,destroying his superior officer?
856.69,859.42,NANCY,Cassio has my place.
859.5,861.49,NANCY,"Twixt my sheets,"
859.5,861.49,NANCY,he's done my office. "
861.56,863.76,BUFFY,"Well, he was passed over"
861.56,863.76,BUFFY,for promotion.
863.83,865.32,BUFFY,Cassio was picked instead...
865.4,870.36,BUFFY,and people were saying
865.4,870.36,BUFFY,that Othello slept with his wife.
870.44,872.07,WILLOW,Buffy did the reading?
872.14,873.17,WILLOW,Buffy understood
872.14,873.17,WILLOW,the reading?
873.24,877.02,XANDER,Xander: When did she study?
875.08,879.02,XANDER,Was I supposed to study?
877.08,878.67,XANDER,Ms. Murray's kinda hot.
878.75,880.94,NANCY,I was gonna say Cassio.
881.02,883.25,NANCY,Ugh! I hate her.
883.32,885.29,TEACHER,Any other reason?
885.35,886.65,NANCY,Race!
886.72,889.99,TEACHER,"Um, good, Nancy."
886.72,889.99,TEACHER,Can't overlook that.
890.06,891.59,TEACHER,"Boy: Look at them, scrambling"
891.59,892.86,FREDDY,for the teacher's praise
892.93,895.09,FREDDY,like pigeons
892.93,895.09,FREDDY,for old bread crusts.
895.16,897.46,BUFFY,"Wil, who's that guy?"
898.7,900.79,WILLOW,That's Freddy Iverson.
900.87,905.57,WILLOW,He writes those editorials
900.87,905.57,WILLOW,for the school paper. He's sardonic.
905.64,907.33,WILLOW,Freddy: Bread crusts.
907.33,908.3,FREDDY,That's deep.
908.38,910.5,FREDDY,I should write that down.
910.58,912.55,TEACHER,Ms. Murray: Cites race
910.58,912.55,TEACHER,as a motive.
912.62,913.98,TEACHER,Is there something else
912.62,913.98,TEACHER,at work here?
914.05,915.38,BUFFY,"Well, he, um..."
915.45,920.91,BUFFY,he sort of admits himself
915.45,920.91,BUFFY,that his motives are... spurious.
920.99,926.72,BUFFY,He... He does things
920.99,926.72,BUFFY,because he enjoys them.
926.8,930.53,BUFFY,It's like he's not...
926.8,930.53,BUFFY,he's not really a person.
930.6,935.33,BUFFY,He's a... the dark half
930.6,935.33,BUFFY,of Othello himself.
935.4,937.87,TEACHER,
935.4,937.87,TEACHER,Wow! Whoa!
937.94,942.78,TEACHER,Buffy. Really. Very astute.
942.91,945.81,TEACHER,I said something quite
942.91,945.81,TEACHER,like that in my dissertation.
945.88,950.55,BUFFY,"I know. I mean,"
945.88,950.55,BUFFY,I agree... with that.
950.62,955.56,TEACHER,"Yes, and doesn't that also explain"
950.62,955.56,TEACHER,Othello's readiness to believe Iago?
955.63,958.29,TEACHER,"Within seconds,"
955.63,958.29,TEACHER,he turns on Desdemona.
958.36,960.8,TEACHER,He believes that
958.36,960.8,TEACHER,she's been unfaithful...
960.86,962.8,TEACHER,and we're all like that.
962.87,965.84,TEACHER,We all have
962.87,965.84,TEACHER,our little internal Iagos
965.9,969.96,TEACHER,that tell us our husbands
965.9,969.96,TEACHER,or our girlfriends or whatever
970.04,971.56,TEACHER,don't really love us.
971.64,975.7,TEACHER,We can never really see
971.64,975.7,TEACHER,what's in someone's heart.
979.72,980.65,BUFFY,Oh!
980.72,981.91,BUFFY,"Oh, sorry!"
981.99,983.92,BUFFY,Sorry about the daytime.
983.99,988.19,BUFFY,"I just ducked out of school,"
983.99,988.19,BUFFY,and that's when they have it.
990.49,992.43,BUFFY,Um... you look good.
992.5,995.93,BUFFY,"I mean, I... I know"
992.5,995.93,BUFFY,I saw you last night...
996,999.94,BUFFY,but sometimes things
996,999.94,BUFFY,can change real quick.
1002.02,1001.44,BUFFY,"I mean, really quickly."
1001.51,1003.97,BUFFY,Listen to me.
1001.51,1003.97,BUFFY,I'm talking like Faith.
1006.41,1012.54,BUFFY,"Not that she was so bad to have around,"
1006.41,1012.54,BUFFY,"you know, before the evil."
1013.88,1016.98,BUFFY,"You know, I think"
1013.88,1016.98,BUFFY,she was hurting a lot.
1017.05,1020.96,BUFFY,And some people...
1017.05,1020.96,BUFFY,protectivetype people...
1021.02,1022.99,BUFFY,Might be drawn
1021.02,1022.99,BUFFY,"to that, I guess."
1024.53,1026.12,BUFFY,"Well, the thing about Faith..."
1026.2,1028.03,ANGEL,You can't get
1026.2,1028.03,ANGEL,into my mind.
1028.1,1029.96,BUFFY,How did you...
1030.03,1031.83,BUFFY,Why not?
1031.9,1032.96,ANGEL,It's like the mirror.
1033.04,1033.97,ANGEL,The thoughts are there...
1034.04,1036.63,ANGEL,but they create
1034.04,1036.63,ANGEL,no reflection in you.
1038.61,1042.1,ANGEL,You got your aspect
1038.61,1042.1,ANGEL,of the demon.
1042.18,1043.48,BUFFY,Yeah.
1043.55,1048.35,BUFFY,Giles doesn't know how long
1043.55,1048.35,BUFFY,"it's gonna last, but it's OK."
1048.42,1050.44,BUFFY,"A little headachy, but..."
1050.52,1053.58,ANGEL,You don't have to play games
1050.52,1053.58,ANGEL,"with me, Buffy... ever."
1053.66,1056.99,BUFFY,"Well, you're not exactly"
1053.66,1056.99,BUFFY,"Joe, here's what I'm thinking."""
1057.06,1058.43,ANGEL,So ask me.
1058.5,1060.93,BUFFY,"Oh, but that would've"
1058.5,1060.93,BUFFY,made sense.
1061,1064.26,ANGEL,What do you wanna
1061,1064.26,ANGEL,know about? Faith?
1064.33,1067.24,ANGEL,How I felt kissing her?
1064.33,1067.24,ANGEL,Pretending to have no soul?
1067.3,1068.83,ANGEL,Watching you suffer?
1068.91,1071.03,BUFFY,"Well, since you bring it up."
1071.11,1075.57,ANGEL,I hated hurting you...
1071.11,1075.57,ANGEL,more than I could stand.
1077.55,1081.57,BUFFY,"Look, the thing"
1077.55,1081.57,BUFFY,about Faith... I'd understand.
1081.65,1086.18,BUFFY,"You know, she has that whole"
1081.65,1086.18,BUFFY,bad girl" thing working for her.
1086.26,1087.69,ANGEL,Kissing her meant nothing.
1087.76,1090.92,ANGEL,I don't want a bad girl.
1087.76,1090.92,ANGEL,I've done that before.
1092.8,1097.76,ANGEL,"I've lived a long time, Buffy,"
1092.8,1097.76,ANGEL,and I'm past that.
1097.83,1101.86,ANGEL,I've been with dozens
1097.83,1101.86,ANGEL,of girls like her. More.
1101.94,1104.7,BUFFY,"Oh, this honesty stuff is fun."
1104.78,1107.61,ANGEL,"I mean,"
1104.78,1107.61,ANGEL,there's no comparison.
1107.68,1112.91,ANGEL,"In 243 years, I've loved"
1107.68,1112.91,ANGEL,exactly one person.
1114.48,1116.42,BUFFY,Who?
1116.49,1118.72,BUFFY,"It is me, right?"
1120.09,1124.53,ANGEL,Next time just ask.
1124.59,1126.82,BUFFY,OK.
1126.9,1129.96,ANGEL,"And, Buffy, be careful"
1126.9,1129.96,ANGEL,with this gift.
1130.03,1133.94,ANGEL,A lot of things that seem strong
1130.03,1133.94,ANGEL,and good and powerful...
1136.02,1135.06,ANGEL,they can be painful.
1135.14,1138.8,BUFFY,"Like, say, immortality?"
1138.88,1142.31,ANGEL,Exactly. I'm dying
1138.88,1142.31,ANGEL,to get rid of that.
1142.38,1144.11,BUFFY,Funny.
1144.18,1145.94,ANGEL,I'm a funny guy.
1147.82,1149.45,XANDER,She can read our minds?
1149.52,1150.85,XANDER,Our every impulse
1149.52,1150.85,XANDER,and fantasy?
1150.92,1152.18,BUFFY,Every one.
1152.26,1153.45,XANDER,"Oh, God."
1153.52,1155.49,CORDELIA,I don't see what
1153.52,1155.49,CORDELIA,this has to do with me.
1155.56,1157.29,CORDELIA,I don't see what this
1155.56,1157.29,CORDELIA,has to do with me.
1157.36,1159.09,WILLOW,"Willow: Well, I think"
1157.36,1159.09,WILLOW,"it's great, right?"
1159.16,1162.03,WILLOW,"I mean, you enjoy your"
1159.16,1162.03,WILLOW,other slayer powers.
1162.1,1163.46,BUFFY,"Yeah, it'll be fun."
1163.53,1164.59,BUFFY,And did you see Nancy Doyle's face
1163.53,1164.59,BUFFY,in English class today?
1164.67,1165.76,BUFFY,Yeah.
1165.84,1167.46,WILLOW,She's hardly even
1165.84,1167.46,WILLOW,human anymore.
1167.54,1169.47,WILLOW,How can I be
1167.54,1169.47,WILLOW,her friend now?
1169.54,1170.84,WILLOW,She doesn't need me.
1170.91,1172,BUFFY,"No, I do need you."
1172.08,1173.98,CORDY,"Cordelia: OK, what are"
1172.08,1173.98,CORDY,you talking about?
1174.04,1176.88,CORDY,Because you are
1174.04,1176.88,CORDY,so creepy right now.
1176.95,1178,CORDY,Giles: I think
1178,1178.97,GILES,there must be
1179.05,1181.98,GILES,some precedence
1179.05,1181.98,GILES,for occurrences such as this.
1182.05,1183.61,GILES,I'll... I'll
1182.05,1183.61,GILES,research it.
1183.69,1185.48,GILES,"Wesley, can you"
1183.69,1185.48,GILES,give me a hand?
1185.56,1187.35,WESLEY,Of course. Where do you think
1185.56,1187.35,WESLEY,we should start?
1187.42,1188.6,WESLEY,Oz: I am my thoughts.
1188.6,1189.89,OZ,If they exist in her...
1189.96,1192.95,OZ,"Buffy contains everything that is me,"
1189.96,1192.95,OZ,and she becomes me.
1193.03,1194.46,OZ,I cease to exist.
1194.53,1195.46,OZ,Hmm.
1195.53,1197.06,BUFFY,Xander: What am I gonna do?
1197.13,1200.66,BUFFY,I think about sex
1197.13,1200.66,BUFFY,all the time. Sex. Help!
1200.74,1205.83,BUFFY,X 5 is 30. 5 X 6 is 32.
1200.74,1205.83,BUFFY,Naked girls. Naked women.
1205.91,1208.74,BUFFY,"Naked Buffy! Oh, stop me!"
1208.81,1212.18,BUFFY,"God, Xander! Is that"
1208.81,1212.18,BUFFY,all you think about?
1212.25,1214.44,XANDER,Actually? Bye!
1216.82,1219.15,WESLEY,Xander has just
1216.82,1219.15,WESLEY,illustrated something.
1219.22,1221.42,WESLEY,The chances are you're
1219.22,1221.42,WESLEY,all going to be thinking
1221.49,1223.58,WESLEY,whatever you least
1221.49,1223.58,WESLEY,want Buffy to hear.
1223.66,1226.6,WESLEY,"It's a question, of course,"
1223.66,1226.6,WESLEY,of mental discipline.
1226.66,1227.6,GILES,He's right.
1227.66,1228.82,WESLEY,Look at Cordelia.
1228.9,1230.83,WESLEY,"No, don't look"
1228.9,1230.83,WESLEY,at Cordelia.
1230.9,1232.63,WESLEY,She's a student.
1234.5,1237.7,WESLEY,"Oh, I am bad."
1234.5,1237.7,WESLEY,"I'm a bad, bad man."
1237.77,1239.26,WESLEY,Excuse me.
1240.61,1242.51,WILLOW,"What's it like, Buffy?"
1242.58,1246.02,BUFFY,I don't know.
1244.08,1247.21,BUFFY,"It's a little weird, but, look,"
1244.08,1247.21,BUFFY,please don't for a second think
1247.28,1249.55,BUFFY,"that don't need you,"
1247.28,1249.55,BUFFY,because I do...
1249.62,1251.35,BUFFY,and I wanna share this
1249.62,1251.35,BUFFY,with you.
1251.42,1253.98,BUFFY,It's like all
1251.42,1253.98,BUFFY,these doors are opening
1254.06,1255.49,BUFFY,to all these little worlds...
1255.56,1257.99,BUFFY,and I can just walk
1255.56,1257.99,BUFFY,right inside.
1258.06,1259.09,OZ,"Oz: No one else exists, either."
1259.16,1260.69,OZ,Buffy is all of us.
1260.76,1263.1,OZ,"We think, therefore she is."
1263.17,1266.14,WILLOW,She knows so much.
1263.17,1266.14,WILLOW,She knows what Oz is thinking.
1266.2,1268.64,WILLOW,"Before long, she'll know him"
1266.2,1268.64,WILLOW,better than I do.
1268.71,1269.73,BUFFY,"No, don't think that."
1269.81,1271.87,WILLOW,"I can't help it, Buffy."
1272.94,1275.57,WILLOW,I'm sorry.
1272.94,1275.57,WILLOW,I... I just can't.
1277.45,1280.68,OZ,"If you don't need me,"
1277.45,1280.68,OZ,I'm gonna follow the redhead.
1282.82,1285.45,BUFFY,I guess I won't be
1282.82,1285.45,BUFFY,writing that book
1285.52,1286.96,BUFFY,winning friends
1285.52,1286.96,BUFFY,through telepathy.
1287.02,1289.46,CORDELIA,Whatever. I wonder
1287.02,1289.46,CORDELIA,when I can go.
1289.53,1291.76,CORDELIA,Whatever. Can I go?
1291.83,1293.49,WESLEY,Excuse me. Can you hear me
1291.83,1293.49,WESLEY,thinking in here?
1293.56,1295.12,WESLEY,I could go out
1293.56,1295.12,WESLEY,into the hall.
1295.2,1296.96,BUFFY,You know what? You stay.
1297.03,1298.93,BUFFY,I'm getting a headache.
1297.03,1298.93,BUFFY,I'll go.
1303.61,1305.87,THOUGHTS,She is so hot.
1305.94,1307.47,THOUGHTS,I hate my body.
1307.54,1309.17,THOUGHTS,"I swear, I will scream"
1307.54,1309.17,THOUGHTS,from boredom.
1309.25,1310.71,THOUGHTS,No one's ever
1309.25,1310.71,THOUGHTS,gonna love me.
1310.78,1312.48,THOUGHTS,What if I never
1310.78,1312.48,THOUGHTS,get breasts?
1312.55,1314.74,THOUGHTS,I can't believe
1312.55,1314.74,THOUGHTS,the test is today.
1314.82,1318.52,THOUGHTS,Get rid of the students.
1314.82,1318.52,THOUGHTS,It's that easy.
1318.59,1320.42,THOUGHTS,What if I'm the last virgin
1318.59,1320.42,THOUGHTS,in the world?
1320.49,1321.98,THOUGHTS,He has the cutest butt.
1322.06,1322.99,NANCY,I hate her.
1326.43,1328.49,GILES,Here. It's happened before.
1328.57,1331.5,GILES,"A man in Ecuador,"
1328.57,1331.5,GILES,quite recently.
1331.57,1335.02,WESLEY,Can we contact him?
1333.07,1335.94,GILES,I'd say not. He can't
1333.07,1335.94,GILES,communicate with anyone.
1338.02,1336.94,WESLEY,Dead?
1339.02,1340.44,GILES,No. He's in complete
1339.02,1340.44,GILES,isolation.
1340.51,1341.94,GILES,The power...
1343.01,1344.95,GILES,he can't shut it off.
1347.68,1349.95,THOUGHTS,It's gotta get better.
1350.02,1351.85,THOUGHTS,Tell me it gets better.
1351.92,1352.93,THOUGHTS,I hate school.
1352.93,1353.79,JONATHAN,Am I normal?
1353.86,1357.16,JONATHAN,When am I ever gonna
1353.86,1357.16,JONATHAN,to need to know algebra?
1357.23,1360.69,JONATHAN,Are you through with
1357.23,1360.69,JONATHAN,the mashed potatoes?
1360.76,1362.39,JONATHAN,She doesn't even
1360.76,1362.39,JONATHAN,know I'm here.
1362.47,1365.23,JONATHAN,I want a car so bad.
1365.3,1368.7,THOUGHTS,Come on. Come on.
1368.77,1370.3,THOUGHTS,Didn't she wear
1368.77,1370.3,THOUGHTS,that skirt yesterday?
1370.37,1371.57,THOUGHTS,She's OK.
1371.64,1373.97,THOUGHTS,She has the sweetest face
1371.64,1373.97,THOUGHTS,I ever saw.
1374.04,1375.74,THOUGHTS,If I stand in just
1374.04,1375.74,THOUGHTS,the right place...
1375.81,1378.98,THOUGHTS,I can sorta see
1375.81,1378.98,THOUGHTS,into the arm hole of her top.
1379.05,1382.04,,The test is today.
1382.12,1385.28,,Buffy Hearing A Pandemonium

1396.07,1397.73,EVIL,This time tomorrow...
1397.8,1399.83,EVIL,I'll kill you all.
1417.05,1418.67,ONATHAN,She's going nuts!
1418.75,1421.83,STUDENT,Buffy Hearing Pandemonium
1421.83,1423.19,ONATHAN,OfThoughts]
1427.49,1428.98,ONATHAN,She touched me!
1451.48,1452.41,WILLOW,I think she's waking up.
1452.48,1453.41,OZ,She's OK.
1453.48,1454.81,GILES,"Oh, thank goodness."
1454.88,1455.82,XANDER,Xander: Her eyes are opening.
1455.89,1456.82,CORDELIA,Cordelia: I'm cold.
1456.89,1457.91,GILES,Are you all right?
1457.99,1459.82,CORDELIA,I told them not
1457.99,1459.82,CORDELIA,to move you.
1459.89,1462.59,CORDELIA,They probably severed
1459.89,1462.59,CORDELIA,your spinal cord.
1462.66,1463.59,BUFFY,I'm OK.
1463.66,1464.59,BUFFY,Buffy?
1464.66,1465.79,BUFFY,"No, really, I'm OK."
1465.86,1468.42,BUFFY,"Listen, there's a killer"
1465.86,1468.42,BUFFY,in the cafeteria.
1468.5,1470.49,XANDER,See? I've been saying for years
1470.57,1473.93,XANDER,that the lunch lady's gonna do
1470.57,1473.93,XANDER,us all in with that mulligan stew.
1476.02,1475.27,XANDER,"I mean, what the hell's"
1476.02,1475.27,XANDER,a mulligan?
1475.34,1476.6,XANDER,Someone was thinking it.
1476.67,1479.51,BUFFY,"They thought, ""This time tomorrow,"
1476.67,1479.51,BUFFY,I'll kill you all."
1479.58,1481.51,BUFFY,I have to find them.
1481.58,1483.07,BUFFY,Did you recognize
1481.58,1483.07,BUFFY,a voice?
1483.15,1484.08,BUFFY,No.
1484.15,1485.94,BUFFY,Willow:
1484.15,1485.94,BUFFY,Boy or girl?
1486.02,1489.02,BUFFY,I don't know.
1487.08,1488.52,BUFFY,It was hardly human.
1488.59,1491.49,BUFFY,It was so full of anger
1488.59,1491.49,BUFFY,and pain.
1493.29,1494.62,BUFFY,
1494.69,1496.12,BUFFY,"Buffy, you can't."
1496.19,1498.63,BUFFY,"No, I have to find them."
1498.7,1500.09,BUFFY,Are you sure
1498.7,1500.09,BUFFY,they meant it?
1500.16,1501.46,XANDER,"Xander: Yeah, who hasn't"
1500.16,1501.46,XANDER,just idly thought
1501.53,1503.8,XANDER,about taking out the whole place
1501.53,1503.8,XANDER,with a semiautomatic?
1506.47,1507.49,XANDER,I said idly.
1507.57,1509.2,BUFFY,I know the difference.
1509.27,1512.4,BUFFY,He... She... Whoever...
1509.27,1512.4,BUFFY,They meant it...
1512.48,1514.27,BUFFY,and they're gonna do it.
1514.34,1515.78,GILES,She looks so tired.
1515.85,1517.11,WILLOW,How horrible.
1517.18,1518.17,CORDELIA,Xander: I'll bet it was Hogan.
1518.25,1519.22,CORDELIA,I'm not getting
1518.25,1519.22,CORDELIA,any warmer.
1519.28,1521.11,BUFFY,Shut up!
1521.18,1527.32,BUFFY,I'm sorry. Just... Could
1521.18,1527.32,BUFFY,you guys not think so loud?
1527.39,1528.48,BUFFY,Or so much?
1528.56,1530.72,GILES,"Buffy, you should go home."
1528.56,1530.72,GILES,I'll take you home.
1530.79,1531.92,GILES,Yeah. OK. No.
1532,1533.69,BUFFY,I need you guys to go back
1532,1533.69,BUFFY,to the cafeteria.
1533.76,1535.92,BUFFY,Make a list of everyone
1533.76,1535.92,BUFFY,who's there.
1536,1538.47,BUFFY,We have to find the killer
1536,1538.47,BUFFY,before lunch tomorrow.
1538.54,1540.06,WILLOW,"We'll do it, Buffy."
1538.54,1540.06,WILLOW,A list of all the students.
1540.14,1543.07,WILLOW,"Yeah, Nancy was there."
1540.14,1543.07,WILLOW,She's scary.
1543.14,1544.87,WILLOW,"And, oh, teachers, too."
1544.94,1547.64,WILLOW,Mr. Beach... he thought
1544.94,1547.64,WILLOW,something
1547.71,1549.94,WILLOW,about getting rid
1547.71,1549.94,WILLOW,of all the students.
1550.01,1551.95,BUFFY,"I can't shut it out, Giles."
1552.02,1554.54,BUFFY,It's like this invasion
1552.02,1554.54,BUFFY,of my head.
1554.62,1557.75,BUFFY,It's like there are these strangers
1554.62,1557.75,BUFFY,walking around in there.
1557.82,1561.76,BUFFY,Look at this. I can't even be
1557.82,1561.76,BUFFY,around people anymore...
1561.83,1565.76,BUFFY,not that they're really clamoring
1561.83,1565.76,BUFFY,"to be near me anyway, even you."
1565.83,1566.89,GILES,"Well, I'm sorry, Buffy."
1566.96,1568.9,GILES,It's hard for all of us.
1568.97,1572.66,GILES,But Wesley and I are looking
1568.97,1572.66,GILES,for a way to help.
1572.74,1573.9,BUFFY,"I'll be OK, right?"
1573.97,1575.94,BUFFY,"I mean, even if you"
1573.97,1575.94,BUFFY,can't get rid of it?
1578.02,1577.91,GILES,You'll be fine.
1578.02,1577.91,GILES,I promise.
1577.97,1580.7,GILES,"If it doesn't go away,"
1577.97,1580.7,GILES,she'll go insane.
1584.02,1585.5,WILLOW,I think we have everyone
1584.02,1585.5,WILLOW,that was in the cafeteria.
1585.58,1587.41,WILLOW,I'll do some computer work;
1587.48,1589.47,WILLOW,match it against the FBI
1587.48,1589.47,WILLOW,mass murderer profiles...
1589.55,1591.88,WILLOW,see if maybe we can rule
1589.55,1591.88,WILLOW,some people out.
1591.96,1593.35,XANDER,I'm still having trouble
1591.96,1593.35,XANDER,with the fact
1593.42,1595.05,XANDER,that one of us
1593.42,1595.05,XANDER,is just gonna
1595.12,1596.92,XANDER,gun everybody down
1595.12,1596.92,XANDER,for no reason.
1596.99,1599.89,CORDY,"Yeah, because that never happens"
1596.99,1599.89,CORDY,in American high schools.
1599.96,1600.93,OZ,It's bordering on trendy
1599.96,1600.93,OZ,at this point.
1601,1603.33,WILLOW,"Besides which,"
1601,1603.33,WILLOW,Sunnydale High...
1603.4,1605.59,WILLOW,center of evil
1603.4,1605.59,WILLOW,and all that.
1605.67,1607.1,WILLOW,Let's get to work.
1607.17,1608.93,WILLOW,We have till
1607.17,1608.93,WILLOW,lunchtime tomorrow...
1611.02,1610.44,WILLOW,we hope.
1612.28,1614.94,JOYCE,There. You look better already.
1617.02,1616.44,BUFFY,"Thanks, Mom."
1616.51,1619.64,JOYCE,"I'm, uh, I'm just gonna"
1616.51,1619.64,JOYCE,get you another pillow.
1619.72,1620.68,BUFFY,I really don't need one.
1620.75,1623.78,JOYCE,But you need
1620.75,1623.78,JOYCE,another blanket.
1623.85,1626.82,BUFFY,"Mom, I'm fine."
1629.06,1631.89,JOYCE,"How, uh..."
1629.06,1631.89,JOYCE,about some soup?
1631.96,1633.39,JOYCE,Chicken and stars?
1633.46,1636.19,BUFFY,"Mom, please,"
1633.46,1636.19,BUFFY,just come sit with me.
1636.27,1638.89,OYCE,"Um... I've, uh..."
1638.97,1640.73,OYCE,I've got laundry.
1640.8,1642.93,BUFFY,Why are you...
1644.37,1646.14,BUFFY,You had sex with Giles?
1647.38,1649.5,BUFFY,You had sex with Giles?
1649.58,1651.91,JOYCE,It was the candy.
1649.58,1651.91,JOYCE,We were teenagers.
1651.98,1654.31,BUFFY,On the hood
1651.98,1654.31,BUFFY,of a police car?
1654.38,1655.72,JOYCE,I'll be downstairs.
1655.79,1657.78,JOYCE,You feel better.
1657.85,1659.91,BUFFY,Twice?!
1659.99,1661.08,WILLOW,"OK, I've taken our list"
1661.16,1663.42,WILLOW,and narrowed it down
1661.16,1663.42,WILLOW,to a dozen strong suspects.
1663.49,1664.15,WILLOW,Here are your
1664.15,1665.43,XANDER,personalized assignments.
1665.5,1667.43,XANDER,Ooh! I was hoping
1665.5,1667.43,XANDER,there'd be assignments.
1667.5,1669.93,CORDY,I think I should
1667.5,1669.93,CORDY,work with Wesley.
1670,1671.43,XANDER,You have no shame.
1671.5,1674.53,CORDY,"Oh, please. Like shame"
1671.5,1674.53,CORDY,is something to be proud of?
1674.6,1676.4,CORDY,Be quiet!
1676.47,1677.02,WILLOW,"Sorry,"
1677.02,1679.03,CORDY,but this is important.
1679.11,1680.77,WILLOW,Talk to everyone
1679.11,1680.77,WILLOW,on your list
1680.84,1683.87,CORDY,and... and use
1680.84,1683.87,CORDY,the sample questions.
1686.45,1687.85,WILLOW,"Today, people!"
1689.99,1694.12,WILLOW,Oh! Write neatly and
1689.99,1694.12,WILLOW,label your work sheets.
1699.46,1703.9,WILLOW,"Fantasies are fun,"
1699.46,1703.9,WILLOW,"aren't they, Jonathan?"
1703.97,1706.4,JONATHAN,I guess.
1706.47,1712.41,WILLOW,We all have fantasies
1706.47,1712.41,WILLOW,where we're powerful and respected...
1712.48,1717.02,WILLOW,where people
1712.48,1717.02,WILLOW,pay attention to us.
1715.08,1717.14,JONATHAN,Maybe.
1717.21,1719.91,WILLOW,But sometimes the fantasy
1717.21,1719.91,WILLOW,isn't enough...
1719.98,1721.92,WILLOW,"is it, Jonathan?"
1721.99,1725.72,WILLOW,Sometimes we have to make it
1721.99,1725.72,WILLOW,so people don't ignore us...
1725.79,1728.42,WILLOW,make them pay attention.
1728.49,1732.09,WILLOW,You know what
1728.49,1732.09,WILLOW,"I'm talking about, don't you?"
1732.16,1735.89,JONATHAN,You wwwant me
1732.16,1735.89,JONATHAN,to pay attention?
1742.02,1741.44,HOGAN,This is
1742.02,1741.44,HOGAN,for the yearbook?
1741.5,1742.94,OZ,Yeah.
1741.5,1742.94,OZ,Personality profiles.
1745.02,1744.53,HOGAN,Can you ask it again?
1744.61,1747.94,OZ,Sure. Do you ever feel that you've
1744.61,1747.94,OZ,created a false persona for yourself
1750.02,1749.44,OZ,of the guy who does
1750.02,1749.44,OZ,everything right...
1749.51,1751.81,OZ,and how much of a strain does it
1749.51,1751.81,OZ,put on you to maintain it?
1751.88,1754.94,HOGAN,Huh. Wow. I guess...
1755.02,1756.45,HOGAN,moderate strain?
1756.52,1758.99,HOGAN,Is that a good answer?
1756.52,1758.99,HOGAN,I wanna get this right.
1760.52,1761.96,OZ,"Yeah, that's good."
1763.03,1765.15,CORDELIA,"Hi, Mr. Beach."
1763.03,1765.15,CORDELIA,I was just wondering...
1765.23,1767.46,CORDELIA,were you planning on killing
1765.23,1767.46,CORDELIA,a bunch of people tomorrow?
1767.53,1769.46,CORDELIA,"Oh, it's for the yearbook."
1769.53,1773.47,XANDER,"OK, so turnoffs include"
1769.53,1773.47,XANDER,"smoking, insensitive men..."
1773.54,1774.83,XANDER,and Birkenstocks.
1774.9,1777.96,XANDER,"Now, your idea of the perfect"
1774.9,1777.96,XANDER,romantic evening.
1778.04,1779.98,XANDER,"Kay, let's start with you."
1781.04,1781.98,OZ,Freddy?
1805.7,1807.13,THOUGHTS,I should've just quit.
1807.2,1808.93,THOUGHTS,Look at him smiling...
1811.02,1810.6,THOUGHTS,like he thinks
1811.02,1810.6,THOUGHTS,I don't know about her.
1810.67,1811.94,THOUGHTS,She doesn't know a thing.
1814.02,1814.94,THOUGHTS,I can't believe
1814.02,1814.94,THOUGHTS,I'm getting away with this.
1817.02,1816.93,THOUGHTS,One more drink.
1816.93,1816.84,,That'll do it.
1819.52,1820.95,,years with that company.
1821.02,1822.35,,You think I can't
1821.02,1822.35,,smell her perfume?
1822.42,1823.44,,It's just a little drink.
1823.52,1824.95,,He shouldn't even
1823.52,1824.95,,be the boss.
1825.02,1826.45,,The bottle's almost empty
1825.02,1826.45,,anyway.
1826.52,1828.46,,I should've had a promotion
1826.52,1828.46,,a long time ago.
1828.52,1831.19,,Wait till next time
1828.52,1831.19,,he comes home smelling like that.
1831.26,1834.96,OZ,
1838.4,1841.34,WESLEY,"Well, seems to be"
1838.4,1841.34,WESLEY,coming along all right.
1841.4,1842.8,GILES,Yes. Buffy's being driven mad...
1842.87,1844.5,GILES,we have no proof
1842.87,1844.5,GILES,that this is gonna work...
1844.57,1846.34,GILES,and it still requires the heart
1844.57,1846.34,GILES,of the second demon...
1846.41,1849.07,GILES,which we have no idea
1846.41,1849.07,GILES,how to get without the slayer.
1849.15,1852.34,WESLEY,Negative thinking
1849.15,1852.34,WESLEY,doesn't solve problems.
1852.42,1855.32,GILES,Who is going to get
1852.42,1855.32,GILES,the demon heart?
1855.39,1856.85,GILES,Berk.
1902.9,1906.84,NANCY,Do I often imagine
1902.9,1906.84,NANCY,classmates are spying on me
1906.9,1908.84,NANCY,or otherwise
1906.9,1908.84,NANCY,acting suspiciously?
1908.91,1910.3,WILLOW,Right.
1910.37,1912.81,NANCY,Not till just now.

1919.05,1921.98,XANDER,I'm just saying it's
1919.05,1921.98,XANDER,gotta be frustrating...
1922.05,1923.38,XANDER,having this secret.
1923.45,1926.79,XANDER,You gotta be kind of filling up
1923.45,1926.79,XANDER,with resentment...
1926.86,1929.79,XANDER,unexpressed rage
1926.86,1929.79,XANDER,just waiting to burst out...
1929.86,1931.38,XANDER,today at lunch.
1931.46,1933.45,LARRY,What secret? Being gay?
1933.53,1935.86,LARRY,"Man, I'm out."
1935.93,1939.06,LARRY,I'm so out I've got my grandma
1935.93,1939.06,LARRY,fixing me up with guys.
1939.14,1942.83,XANDER,"That's, uh... nice."
1942.91,1944.81,LARRY,"But it sounds like, uh..."
1944.87,1946.4,LARRY,you're having
1944.87,1946.4,LARRY,a rough time with it?

1947.94,1948.88,LARRY,Look...
1948.95,1951.31,LARRY,just do it.
1951.38,1955.32,LARRY,That weird Freddy Iverson guy
1951.38,1955.32,LARRY,that does the school paper?
1955.39,1956.72,XANDER,He's gay?
1956.79,1959.31,LARRY,"No, dude, but I bet"
1956.79,1959.31,LARRY,he'd put in like a...
1959.39,1961.82,LARRY,comingout announcement
1959.39,1961.82,LARRY,for you.
1961.89,1963.32,LARRY,Something tasteful.
1969.4,1970.83,LARRY,
1970.9,1971.83,OZ,Freddy?
1973.8,1975.83,WILLOW,He's the only one

1975.91,1977.34,OZ,Yeah. Freddy Iverson.
1977.41,1978.84,CORDELIA,The newspaper guy?
1978.91,1981.34,CORDELIA,But we can't figure out it's him
1978.91,1981.34,CORDELIA,"without the work sheet, right?"
1981.41,1982.88,XANDER,"We do have this, people."
1982.95,1986.78,XANDER,Today's editorial titled "Big Game
1982.95,1986.78,XANDER,Draws Mindless Braindead Mob."
1986.85,1988.28,CORDELIA,Does he mention
1986.85,1988.28,CORDELIA,the cheerleaders?
1988.35,1990.22,CORDELIA,Because we were on.
1992.86,1994.79,JOYCE,Joyce: I can't stand this.
1994.86,1999.3,JOYCE,I keep wondering if I'm
1994.86,1999.3,JOYCE,hurting her with my thoughts.
1999.36,2000.8,GILES,You're not.
1999.36,2000.8,GILES,Not anymore.
2000.86,2004.32,GILES,She can't pick one thought
2000.86,2004.32,GILES,out of the...

2088.22,2090.85,JOYCE,Do you hear thoughts?
2090.92,2092.35,BUFFY,No.
2092.42,2094.79,BUFFY,Did you find the killer?
2098.36,2101.52,FREDDY,"OK, Oz, you got me."
2101.6,2103.53,FREDDY,What are your friends
2101.6,2103.53,FREDDY,"gonna do, hold me down?"
2103.6,2105.09,WILLOW,"You better believe it,"
2103.6,2105.09,WILLOW,buster.
2105.17,2107.3,WILLOW,You can't threaten
2105.17,2107.3,WILLOW,a big murder
2107.37,2109.17,WILLOW,without getting us
2107.37,2109.17,WILLOW,pretty darn ticked.
2109.24,2114.02,FREDDY,Murder? What murder?
2112.08,2113.74,FREDDY,You're not here

2123.49,2128.25,OZ,as if they had plump Polish sausages
2123.49,2128.25,OZ,taped to their fingers."
2128.32,2129.76,FREDDY,"Sorry, man."
2131.39,2132.83,OZ,No. It's fair.
2132.9,2134.83,FREDDY,I just get
2132.9,2134.83,FREDDY,a lot of hate mail...
2134.9,2137.33,FREDDY,and I thought you were gonna come
2134.9,2137.33,FREDDY,and deliver some personally.
2137.4,2139.83,XANDER,"Hey, if you find any tasteful"
2137.4,2139.83,XANDER,announcement about me from Larry...
2139.9,2141.84,WILLOW,"Xander, we have"

2141.91,2143.34,CORDELIA,We have no shot.
2143.41,2145.24,CORDELIA,The killer could be anyone.
2145.31,2146.24,CORDELIA,We lose.
2146.31,2147.58,WILLOW,Buffy: We still have
2147.58,2148.47,BUFFY,a few minutes.
2148.55,2149.29,WILLOW,Buffy!
2149.29,2150.51,XANDER,You're OK!
2150.58,2152.74,XANDER,Can you hear thoughts?
2152.82,2154.78,XANDER,Just when I wasn't
2152.82,2154.78,XANDER,thinking about sex.
2154.85,2156.79,XANDER,OK. Here's the new plan.
2156.85,2158.79,BUFFY,We're gonna get Snyder
2156.85,2158.79,BUFFY,to evacuate the school...
2158.86,2160.29,BUFFY,and just hope the killer's
2158.86,2160.29,BUFFY,not waiting outside.
2160.36,2162.22,CORDELIA,By this time tomorrow
2160.36,2162.22,CORDELIA,you'll all know what I've done.
2162.29,2164.78,CORDELIA,I'm sure you understand
2162.29,2164.78,CORDELIA,that I had to do it...
2164.86,2167.3,CORDELIA,and that although
2164.86,2167.3,CORDELIA,death is never easy...
2167.36,2169.3,CORDELIA,it's the only way."
2169.37,2173.43,CORDELIA,God! Doesn't anyone write in

2173.5,2174.9,CORDELIA,We are so unsung.
2174.97,2176.8,WILLOW,Jonathan. Ohh!
2176.87,2179.81,WILLOW,I had him in my grasp!
2176.87,2179.81,WILLOW,Slippery weasel!
2179.88,2182.44,BUFFY,Split up. Find him.
2199.9,2200.83,WILLOW,Jonathan!

2206.4,2207.84,WILLOW,Jonathan!
2207.9,2208.84,WILLOW,Jonathan!
2210.41,2211.34,XANDER,Ooh.
2211.41,2212.34,XANDER,JellO.
2262.06,2265.19,NANCY,Huh. I could've done that.
2274.82,2276.65,JONATHAN,Get away from me.
2278.26,2280.92,BUFFY,"OK, Jonathan, you wanna"
2278.26,2280.92,BUFFY,point that somewhere else?
2280.99,2284.23,JONATHAN,Don't you
2280.99,2284.23,JONATHAN,try and stop me.
2284.3,2288.13,BUFFY,"No. No, no stopping."
2288.2,2290.14,BUFFY,Just here for the view.
2290.2,2292.3,BUFFY,"Hey, look. City Hall."
2292.37,2294.47,JONATHAN,Go away.
2295.71,2297.34,BUFFY,Never gonna happen.
2297.41,2299.07,JONATHAN,You think
2297.41,2299.07,JONATHAN,I won't use this?
2299.15,2302.05,JONATHAN,"I don't know, Jonathan."
2299.15,2302.05,JONATHAN,I just...
2302.12,2304.52,JONATHAN,Stop... doing that!
2306.22,2307.48,BUFFY,Doing what?
2307.55,2311.65,ONATHAN,Stop saying my name
2307.55,2311.65,ONATHAN,like we're friends.
2311.73,2313.66,ONATHAN,We're not friends.
2313.73,2316.16,ONATHAN,You all think
2313.73,2316.16,ONATHAN,I'm an idiot.
2316.23,2318.16,ONATHAN,A short idiot.
2320.23,2321.6,BUFFY,I don't.
2323.34,2327.17,BUFFY,I don't think about you
2323.34,2327.17,BUFFY,much at all.
2327.24,2330.11,BUFFY,Nobody here really does.
2331.75,2333.68,BUFFY,"Bugs you, doesn't it?"
2333.75,2337.68,BUFFY,"You have all this pain,"
2333.75,2337.68,BUFFY,all these feelings...
2337.75,2340.52,BUFFY,and nobody's really
2337.75,2340.52,BUFFY,paying attention.
2340.59,2342.95,JONATHAN,You think
2340.59,2342.95,JONATHAN,I just want attention?
2343.02,2345.18,BUFFY,No. I think you're up in the clock
2343.02,2345.18,BUFFY,tower with a highpowered rifle
2345.26,2346.82,BUFFY,because
2345.26,2346.82,BUFFY,you wanna blend in.
2346.89,2349.36,BUFFY,"Believe it or not,"
2346.89,2349.36,BUFFY,Jonathan...
2349.43,2352.46,BUFFY,I understand
2349.43,2352.46,BUFFY,about the pain.
2352.53,2353.73,JONATHAN,"Oh, right..."
2353.8,2356.2,JONATHAN,cause the burden
2353.8,2356.2,JONATHAN,of being beautiful and athletic...
2356.27,2357.64,JONATHAN,that's a crippler.
2359.27,2361.21,BUFFY,You know what?
2359.27,2361.21,BUFFY,I was wrong.
2361.28,2362.57,BUFFY,You are an idiot.
2364.11,2367.71,BUFFY,"My life happens to,"
2364.11,2367.71,BUFFY,on occasion...
2367.78,2370.22,BUFFY,suck beyond
2367.78,2370.22,BUFFY,the telling of it...
2370.28,2372.68,BUFFY,sometimes more
2370.28,2372.68,BUFFY,than I can handle.
2372.75,2375.19,BUFFY,And it's not just mine.
2375.26,2378.71,BUFFY,Every single person down there
2375.26,2378.71,BUFFY,is ignoring your pain
2378.79,2381.28,BUFFY,because they're too busy
2378.79,2381.28,BUFFY,with their own.
2383.3,2385.16,BUFFY,The beautiful ones...
2385.23,2387.06,BUFFY,the popular ones...
2387.13,2390.23,BUFFY,the guys that pick on you.
2391.81,2393.24,BUFFY,Everyone.
2397.74,2401.18,BUFFY,If you could hear
2397.74,2401.18,BUFFY,what they were feeling...
2401.25,2405.55,BUFFY,"the loneliness,"
2401.25,2405.55,BUFFY,the confusion...
2405.62,2409.56,BUFFY,It looks quiet down there.
2409.62,2411.68,BUFFY,It's not.
2411.76,2413.19,BUFFY,It's deafening.
2418.77,2421.7,BUFFY,"You know, I could've"
2418.77,2421.7,BUFFY,taken that by now.
2423.77,2425.6,JONATHAN,I know.
2429.78,2432.27,BUFFY,I'd rather do it this way.
2444.79,2447.52,JONATHAN,I just wanted it to stop.
2447.59,2448.75,BUFFY,"Yeah, well, mass murder?"
2448.83,2451.26,BUFFY,Not really doctor recommended
2448.83,2451.26,BUFFY,for that kind of pain.
2451.33,2453.73,BUFFY,"Besides, prison,"
2451.33,2453.73,BUFFY,it's a lot like high school...
2453.8,2454.66,BUFFY,only instead of noogies...
2454.74,2456.1,BUFFY,What are you
2454.74,2456.1,BUFFY,talking about?
2456.17,2459.4,BUFFY,Actions having consequences.
2456.17,2459.4,BUFFY,"You know, stuff like that."
2459.47,2461.17,JONATHAN,"Well, I..."
2461.24,2463.4,JONATHAN,I wouldn't ever
2461.24,2463.4,JONATHAN,hurt anybody.
2464.78,2468.54,JONATHAN,I came up here
2464.78,2468.54,JONATHAN,to kill myself.
2491.77,2493.21,XANDER,Rat poison!
2493.27,2494.71,XANDER,Rat poison!
2494.78,2496.07,XANDER,Drop your spoons!
2496.14,2497.47,XANDER,Step away from the spoons!
2504.48,2506.18,BUFFY,"OK, let's calm down."
2506.25,2507.72,LUNCHLADY,Vermin.
2507.79,2509.48,LUNCHLADY,You're all vermin.
2509.56,2514.96,LUNCHLADY,"You come in here,"
2509.56,2514.96,LUNCHLADY,and you eat filth!
2515.03,2517.55,BUFFY,I don't see this being
2515.03,2517.55,BUFFY,settled with logic.
2537.12,2539.55,WILLOW,So you're feeling better
2537.12,2539.55,WILLOW,about Angel?
2539.62,2541.05,BUFFY,"Well, we talked..."
2541.12,2544.18,BUFFY,then he ripped out the heart
2541.12,2544.18,BUFFY,of a demon and fed it to me...
2544.26,2545.69,BUFFY,and then we
2544.26,2545.69,BUFFY,talked some more.
2545.76,2547.69,WILLOW,See? That's how
2545.76,2547.69,WILLOW,it should work.
2547.76,2548.69,GILES,Morning.
2548.76,2549.73,WILLOW,"Hi, Giles."
2549.8,2551.7,LL,"Oh, I should get"
2549.8,2551.7,LL,to the yearbook office.
2551.77,2553.7,LL,I'm gonna give 'em
2551.77,2553.7,LL,the murderer profiles.
2553.77,2555.7,LL,They're really
2553.77,2555.7,LL,a good read.
2555.77,2556.29,GILES,Bye.
2556.29,2557.2,WILLOW,See ya.
2557.27,2558.7,WILLOW,How are you?
2558.77,2561.71,BUFFY,Nothing but quiet.
2558.77,2561.71,BUFFY,Nobody in here but me.
2561.78,2563.14,GILES,Jonathan. How's he?
2563.21,2564.23,,Pretty crappy.
2564.31,2566.71,,His parents are freaking.
2564.31,2566.71,,He got suspended.
2566.78,2568.71,,And toting
2566.78,2568.71,,a piece to school...
2568.78,2570.72,,not exactly winning him
2568.78,2570.72,,a place with the incrowd.
2570.78,2573.22,,But I think he's dealing.
2573.29,2575.65,,"Well, it's good of you"
2573.29,2575.65,,to check on him.
2575.72,2577.66,,It's nice to be able
2575.72,2577.66,,to help someone
2577.72,2579.66,,in a nonslaying capacity...
2579.73,2581.66,,except he's starting
2579.73,2581.66,,to get that look.
2581.73,2584.66,,"You know, like he's"
2581.73,2584.66,,gonna ask me to prom.
2584.73,2587.17,,It'd probably be good
2584.73,2587.17,,for his selfesteem if you...
2587.23,2589.17,,"Oh, come on!"
2587.23,2589.17,,"What am I, Saint Buffy?"
2589.24,2591.17,,He's like 3 feet tall.
2591.24,2594.17,,I'm glad to see you've recovered
2591.24,2594.17,,from your psychic encounter
2594.24,2595.67,,more or less intact.
2595.74,2597.18,,Feel up to some
2595.74,2597.18,,training?
2597.24,2599.08,,Sure. We can work out
2597.24,2599.08,,after school.
2599.15,2603.7,,"You know, if you're not too busy"
2599.15,2603.7,,having sex with my mother.
