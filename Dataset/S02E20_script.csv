30.78,33.83,,to have a victory party at the beach.
33.91,36.94,,It's officially nippy. So say my nips.
37.04,39.82,,I think it's festive.
37.04,39.82,,A party with nature.
39.82,42.64,,"Well, it's the team's choice."
39.82,42.64,,It was their victory.
42.67,45.58,,Team? Swim team.
45.8,48.27,,Hardly what I call a team.
45.8,48.27,,"The Yankees,"
48.3,52.6,,Abbott and Costello. The A.
48.3,52.6,,Now those were teams.
52.68,53.32,,Jealous?
53.32,56.05,Xander,"No! Yes, but ""no"" more than ""yes""."
57.06,60.92,Xander,"I mean, look at that! Dodd McAlvy, last"
57.06,60.92,Xander,month he's the freak with Jicama breath
60.97,64.66,Xander,who waxes his back. He wins a few meets
60.97,64.66,Xander,and suddenly inherits the cool gene?
64.76,68.31,Cordelia,"Well, all I know is, my cheerleading squad"
64.76,68.31,Cordelia,wasted a lot of pep on losers.
68.32,70.91,Cordelia,It's about time
68.32,70.91,Cordelia,our school excelled at something.
70.92,73.37,Willow,You're forgetting our high mortality rate.
73.4,75.7,Xander,We're number one! Huh?
73.4,75.7,Xander,Yeah!
75.8,78.08,Xander,One!
75.8,78.08,Xander,One!
90.44,92.28,Cameron,Beautiful!
97.62,100.09,Cameron,Isn't it?
100.13,103.21,Buffy,Yeah. It's just so...
103.21,104.39,Cameron,Eternal.
105.23,109.95,Cameron,"A true mother, giving birth to new life"
105.23,109.95,Cameron,and devouring old.
110.24,115.05,Cameron,"Always adaptable and nurturing, yet..."
115.24,117.66,Buffy,constant... and merciless.
117.74,121.43,Buffy,Boy! I was just gonna go with big and wet.
121.43,123.39,Cameron,Me and some of the other guys
121.43,123.39,Cameron,"on the team,"
123.4,125.12,Cameron,we come out here once a week
123.4,125.12,Cameron,to train in it.
125.15,127.32,Cameron,"See, we swim against the current."
127.75,130.81,Buffy,Funny. That's how I feel most of the time.
133.38,136.45,Cameron,"So, Cameron Walker,"
133.38,136.45,Cameron,you just won the state semifinals.
136.49,138.35,Cameron,What are you going to do next?
138.39,142.28,Cameron,I'm going to hang out with Buffy Summers.
138.39,142.28,Cameron,Get to know her.
142.77,145.14,Buffy,"Hey, pause that tape for a second."
145.14,146.32,Cameron,"Hey, no pressure."
146.52,149.66,Cameron,I just like being around you. That's all.
152.78,155.08,Jonathon,Somebody help me!
152.78,155.08,Jonathon,Yeah!
157.81,160.48,Dodd,"Come on, Jonny, you gotta"
157.81,160.48,Dodd,hold your breath longer than that
160.52,162.1,Dodd,if you ever wanna make the team!
162.16,164.16,Dodd,"Hey, somebody time him!"
165.92,167.76,Dodd,Hey!
167.79,172.18,Buffy,"Nice tat. What,"
167.79,172.18,Buffy,they ran out of Tweety Bird?
172.8,174.06,Dodd,"Hey, what's your problem?"
174.06,175.38,Cameron,"Had it coming to you, bro."
175.47,178.53,Gage,"Chill, dude. A bunch of us are gonna take"
175.47,178.53,Gage,a little night dip down on the beach.
178.55,179.27,Gage,You in?
179.27,180.2,Dodd,Whatever.
180.24,182.02,Buffy,"Hey, let's, let's get you a towel."
182.02,182.18,Jonathon,No!
182.18,187.57,Jonathon,Why didn't you mind your own business?
182.18,187.57,Jonathon,I can handle this without your help.
188.44,191.97,Buffy,See? It's fun to hang out with me.
192.62,195.64,Dodd,"Man, I can't believe Buffy."
195.65,199.09,Dodd,"Man, that girl gives me the creeps."
220.97,225.98,Gage,"Oh, dude! What is that foulness?"
226.6,229.48,Gage,"Hey, Dodd!"
231.93,234.33,Gage,Dude!
320.38,325.3,Gage,b>"Go Fish"</b>
329.08,332.38,Willow,"OK! Good pie charts, everyone."
332.85,334.68,Willow,Good.
335.91,337.06,Willow,All good.
337.06,337.96,Girl,Thanks!
339.28,341.12,Willow,Nice.
342.91,344.75,Willow,Good.
345.35,348.46,Willow,Gage. Your pie chart is...
348.49,351.19,Willow,looking a lot like solitaire.
351.19,353.77,Willow,With naked ladies on the cards?
353.77,355.27,Gage,What's your point?
355.9,358.32,Willow,No point.
363.68,367.19,Snyder,"Nice work in yesterday's meet, son."
363.68,367.19,Snyder,"Now, let's go for it!"
368.42,370.24,Willow,"Uh, hi there, sir."
370.24,371.25,Snyder,Rosenberg.
371.29,373.52,Snyder,How's the class? Everything in order?
373.52,374.55,Willow,"Well, actually..."
374.56,379.02,Snyder,Great. I've been talking to the board.
377.04,380.5,Snyder,We've been having trouble finding
377.04,380.5,Snyder,a competent teacher this late in the term.
380.59,383.63,Snyder,Do you think you can continue
380.59,383.63,Snyder,subbing through finals?
383.73,386.49,Willow,Oh! Sure! I like teaching.
386.61,390.04,Snyder,Isn't that nice?
386.61,390.04,Snyder,You're a team player and I like that.
390.14,394.95,Snyder,A team player wants everyone on the team
390.14,394.95,Snyder,"to succeed, wants everyone to pass."
395.05,397.35,Willow,"Well, yeah. Sure."
397.78,401.58,Snyder,I understand there's a problem
397.78,401.58,Snyder,with Gage Petronzi.
401.64,407.02,Willow,"Oh, good. Then you know. Well, yeah."
405.09,410.58,Willow,"Besides the behavior problem, he won't"
405.09,410.58,Willow,do homework and his test scores are...
410.59,412.74,Willow,"Well, actually he"
410.59,412.74,Willow,"doesn't have any test scores,"
412.74,414.74,Willow,because he never shows up when we...
414.81,417.04,Snyder,I'm not interested in any of that.
417.06,419.47,Snyder,"I'm interested in why,"
417.06,419.47,Snyder,when this school is on the brink
419.51,421.88,Snyder,of winning its first state championship
419.51,421.88,Snyder,"in fifteen years,"
422.28,424.96,Snyder,you slap a crucial member of that team
422.28,424.96,Snyder,with a failing mark
424.99,427.07,Snyder,that would force his removal.
427.17,430.43,Snyder,Is that how you show your school spirit?
430.43,432.39,Willow,"Yes. Well, I mean... no."
433.25,435.51,Willow,I'm just trying to grade fairly.
435.51,436.85,Snyder,Gage is a champion.
436.88,439.45,Snyder,He's under more pressure
436.88,439.45,Snyder,than the other students.
439.47,443.26,Snyder,And I think
439.47,443.26,Snyder,we need to cut him some slack.
445.5,448.34,Willow,You're asking me to change his grade?
450,452.92,Snyder,I never said any such thing.
452.95,458.32,Snyder,All I'm suggesting is...
452.95,458.32,Snyder,that you recheck your figures.
458.34,462.97,Xander,And I think we'll find a grade more
458.34,462.97,Xander,fitting to an athlete of Gage's stature.
463.05,466.42,Xander,Perhaps something in a D?
470.25,473.71,Xander,Just like that?
470.25,473.71,Xander,He actually told you to alter his grade?
473.75,476.28,Willow,Exactly. Except for actually telling me to.
476.31,480.15,Willow,But he made it perfectly clear
476.31,480.15,Willow,of what he wasn't telling me.
480.25,482.53,Xander,That is wrong. A big fat spankin' wrong.
482.57,485.58,Xander,It's a slap in the face to
482.57,485.58,Xander,everyone of us who studied hard
485.58,487.78,Xander,and worked long hours to earn our D's.
487.82,491.32,Cordelia,"Xander, I know you take pride"
487.82,491.32,Cordelia,"in being the voice of the common wuss,"
491.42,494.45,Cordelia,"but the truth is, certain people"
491.42,494.45,Cordelia,are entitled to special privileges.
494.48,496.55,Cordelia,They're called winners.
494.48,496.55,Cordelia,That's the way the world works.
496.58,498.92,Xander,And what about that nutty
496.58,498.92,Xander,all men are created equal" thing?
498.96,502.08,Cordelia,Propaganda spouted out
498.96,502.08,Cordelia,by the ugly and less deserving.
502.15,503.79,Xander,I think that was Lincoln.
503.84,506.14,Cordelia,Disgusting mole and stupid hat.
506.14,508.14,Willow,"Actually, it was Jefferson."
508.17,509.38,Cordelia,Kept slaves. Remember?
509.38,511.48,Xander,You know what really grates my cheese?
511.51,515.15,Xander,That Buffy's not here to share
511.51,515.15,Xander,my moral outrage about swimteam perks.
515.18,518.93,Xander,She's too busy being one of them.
519.09,521.36,Cameron,"I don't know, a dolphin."
519.09,521.36,Cameron,A dolphin in the ocean.
521.4,525.91,Cameron,"Because, you know, when"
521.4,525.91,Cameron,"I'm in the vastness of the ocean,"
525.91,529.21,Cameron,it's... it's like I'm never alone.
529.3,531.91,Cameron,You ever hear of a woman
529.3,531.91,Cameron,named Gertrude Ederle?
532.66,537.21,Buffy,"No. No, I can't say that I have, Cam."
537.27,540.32,Cameron,First woman to swim
537.27,540.32,Cameron,the English Channel. Same thing.
540.38,544.7,Cameron,"I mean, she would talk to it. I mean, she'd"
540.38,544.7,Cameron,carry on entire conversations with it.
544.75,547.45,Cameron,Sometimes I do that.
544.75,547.45,Cameron,"I mean, once I was..."
547.45,549.85,Buffy,"You know what, Cam? Thanks."
549.95,553.32,Buffy,I'd... forgotten how nice it is
549.95,553.32,Buffy,"to just talk,"
553.35,556.94,Buffy,"or, in my case, listen,"
553.35,556.94,Buffy,without any romantic pressure.
556.97,561.52,Cameron,"Hey, I'm not about pressure."
556.97,561.52,Cameron,I just want you to be comfortable.
562.39,566.31,Buffy,"I'm comfy! I'm so comfy,"
562.39,566.31,Buffy,"I'm nodding off, actually, which is why..."
566.34,568.59,Cameron,Are you wearing a bra?
569.09,570.62,Buffy,What?
571.06,575.49,Cameron,"Come on. I mean, tell me you haven't been"
571.06,575.49,Cameron,thinking about this ever since last night.
575.52,578.67,Buffy,What I'm thinking about is that
575.52,578.67,Buffy,I should probably get out of this car...
579.58,582.37,Cameron,Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
582.4,585.15,Buffy,"Oh, it's not me I'm worried about."
585.21,587.72,Cameron,You like it rough!
589.25,592.32,Cameron,Ow! Oh!
592.72,597.79,Cameron,"Oh, you broke my nose! Ah!"
606.02,608.82,Buffy,"I wasn't the attacker, Principal Snyder."
606.02,608.82,Buffy,I was the attacked.
608.98,610.95,Snyder,That's not how it looked
608.98,610.95,Snyder,from where I was standing.
611.05,613.6,Cameron,I don't know what happened.
611.05,613.6,Cameron,"I mean, first, she leads me on,"
613.64,616.07,Cameron,then she goes schizo on me.
616.13,618.82,Buffy,Lead you on? When did I lead you on?
618.86,621.96,Cameron,"Oh, come on. I mean,"
618.86,621.96,Cameron,look at the way she dresses.
622,622.54,Snyder,Coach.
622.54,624.53,Coach Marin,"How we doing, Cameron?"
624.63,626.82,Snyder,"Coach Marin, how bad does it look?"
626.92,630.94,Coach Marin,"Well, luckily, it's not broken, but sure"
626.92,630.94,Coach Marin,as hell it's gonna sting for a few days.
630.96,633.69,Snyder,I mean our chances of winning
630.96,633.69,Snyder,the state championship.
633.73,633.94,Coach Marin,Oh.
633.94,635.24,Snyder,Can we still do it?
635.34,641.04,Coach Marin,I'm gonna need Cameron back at 110%.
635.34,641.04,Coach Marin,"He's my best swimmer now, with Dodd..."
641.14,642.61,Buffy,What happened to Dodd?
642.61,644.69,Snyder,That's... none of your concern.
644.72,647.6,Snyder,You'd better hope that boy's nose heals
644.72,647.6,Snyder,before the meet this Friday.
647.94,649.96,Coach Marin,"Walker, I want you to"
647.94,649.96,Coach Marin,"hit the steam room, uh,"
650.19,652.89,Coach Marin,as soon as you're done here
650.19,652.89,Coach Marin,and try to keep those sinuses clear.
653.09,654.95,Coach Marin,"Take care of my boy, Ruthie."
654.95,655.75,Nurse Greenleigh,I always do.
655.87,659.18,Coach Marin,"And you, try to dress"
655.87,659.18,Coach Marin,more appropriately from now on.
659.22,662.54,Coach Marin,This isn't a dance club.
667.24,669.17,Buffy,So I'm treated like the baddie
669.2,672.94,Buffy,just because he has
669.2,672.94,Buffy,a sprained wrist and a bloody nose.
673.03,675.33,Buffy,"And... I don't have a scratch on me,"
673.03,675.33,Buffy,"which, granted,"
675.36,677.59,Buffy,"hurts my case a little on the surface,"
675.36,677.59,Buffy,"but, meanwhile,"
677.62,680.17,Buffy,he gets away with it because he's on
677.62,680.17,Buffy,the "aren't we the most" swim team
680.27,684.21,Buffy,"who, by the way, if no one's noticed,"
680.27,684.21,Buffy,have been acting like real jerks lately...
687.86,691.07,Buffy,"So, anything new with you guys?"
692.8,695.26,Giles,Thank you for taking an interest.
695.3,697.79,Giles,"Apparently, some remains were found"
695.3,697.79,Giles,on the beach this morning.
697.83,699.47,Willow,Some human remains.
699.5,701.57,Willow,Dodd McAlvy's remains.
701.57,702.32,Buffy,Vampire?
702.42,705.65,Giles,"No. No, he was eviscerated."
702.42,705.65,Giles,Nothing left but skin and cartilage.
705.7,708.65,Xander,"In other words,"
705.7,708.65,Xander,this was no boating accident.
708.68,711.62,Buffy,"So, something ripped him open"
708.68,711.62,Buffy,and ate out his insides?
711.68,714.18,Willow,Like an Oreo cookie.
715.28,720.92,Willow,"Well, except for, you know,"
715.28,720.92,Willow,without the chocolaty cookie goodness.
720.92,724.75,Giles,"Yeah, um, Principal Snyder"
720.92,724.75,Giles,has asked the faculty
724.78,726.78,Giles,"to keep the news quiet for now, um,"
726.82,729.08,Giles,so as not to unduly upset students.
729.08,731.22,Xander,"For ""students"", read ""swim team""."
731.31,733.78,Willow,"So, we're looking for a beastie."
733.78,735.94,Giles,"That, uh, eats humans whole."
736.04,737.31,Giles,Except for the skin.
737.31,739.09,Buffy,This doesn't make any sense.
739.13,742.47,Xander,"Yeah, the skin's the best part."
742.47,746.02,Buffy,Any demons with high cholesterol?
744.65,747.94,Buffy,"You're gonna think about that later,"
744.65,747.94,Buffy,"mister, and you're gonna laugh."
796.3,799.4,Coach Marin,"OK, son. I think you've had enough."
799.44,802.77,Coach Marin,Time to hit the shower.
807.19,810.98,Xander,Too much research. Need beverage.
812.52,814.9,Cameron,Hey! Watch it!
814.93,818.26,Xander,"Oh, forgive me, your swim teamliness."
819.38,820.13,Cameron,Loser!
820.13,822.76,Xander,"Liking the nose, Cam."
822.8,824.58,Xander,Good look for you.
824.58,825.87,Cameron,Meaning what?
826.45,831.63,Xander,Meaning Buffy must not be
826.45,831.63,Xander,on your list of privileges after all.
832.04,834.89,Xander,"Man, I love it"
832.04,834.89,Xander,when you guys mess with her.
834.92,837.45,Cameron,You're lucky I'm hungry.
837.49,839.98,Xander,"Oh, the cafeteria's closed."
840.55,843.47,Cameron,Not to me.
859.81,862.27,Cameron,God! What is that?
865.32,867.89,Xander,Grape. Orange.
867.93,870.46,Xander,Orange. Grape.
898.74,903.02,Xander,"Oh, my God!"
901.66,904.33,Xander,"Oh, God!"
917.02,917.91,Xander,"No, no, no! The mouth's a lot bigger!"
917.92,920.87,Xander,And downward. Like this!
920.94,923.61,Xander,With more teeth!
923.65,925.31,Cordelia,I'm doing the best I can.
925.34,926.97,Giles,"Is that what you saw, Xander?"
929.44,933.45,Xander,Yeah! I think so.
935.18,941.02,Giles,Pretty much.
935.18,941.02,Giles,Are you sure?
939.09,941.22,Xander,"Well, it was dark and the thing"
939.09,941.22,Xander,went through the window so quick.
941.47,944.34,Xander,"And I was, uh, a little shocked"
941.47,944.34,Xander,"when I saw it, and..."
944.37,948.14,Cordelia,Go ahead. Say it.
944.37,948.14,Cordelia,You ran like a woman.
948.14,950.97,Xander,"Hey, if you saw this thing,"
948.14,950.97,Xander,"you'd run like a woman, too!"
953.02,953.82,Willow,Buffy was right.
953.02,953.82,Willow,"According to the statistics,"
953.86,956.65,Willow,Dodd and Cameron
953.86,956.65,Willow,were the best swimmers on the team.
956.68,959.66,Buffy,"First and second, actually."
956.68,959.66,Buffy,"Which means if my theory's correct,"
959.69,960.75,Cordelia,"Gage Petronzi, the third"
960.75,961.86,Buffy,"best swimmer on the team,"
961.9,963.93,Buffy,would be the next item on the menu.
963.96,969.36,Cordelia,God! This is so sad. We're never
963.96,969.36,Cordelia,gonna win the state championship!
969.69,971.97,Cordelia,I think I have lost
969.69,971.97,Cordelia,all will to cheerlead.
971.99,974.8,Xander,Raise your hand if you feel her pain.
974.82,976.35,Giles,If you're saying
974.82,976.35,Giles,"these killings aren't random,"
976.37,978.32,Giles,it would suggest
976.37,978.32,Giles,someone's out for revenge.
978.33,981.28,Buffy,And raise the possibility that
978.33,981.28,Buffy,someone brought forth this sea monster
981.31,983.16,Buffy,from whence it came
981.31,983.16,Buffy,to exact that revenge.
983.95,985.88,Buffy,From whence it came?
985.91,988.53,Xander,I'm spending way too much time
985.91,988.53,Xander,around you.
988.57,990.93,Xander,Who would hate the swim team
988.57,990.93,Xander,"that much, though?"
991.54,993.61,Xander,"Besides me, I mean."
994.54,995.42,Buffy,Willow?
995.42,996.54,Willow,Jonathan!
996.57,999.62,Willow,He was bullied by Dodd
996.57,999.62,Willow,"the other day on the beach, remember?"
999.73,1002.26,Buffy,He did say he could
999.73,1002.26,Buffy,take care of things himself.
1002.29,1003.89,Buffy,It's a good call.
1002.29,1003.89,Buffy,You should question him.
1003.91,1008.47,Willow,Really? Me?
1003.91,1008.47,Willow,I'll crack him like an egg.
1008.57,1012.02,Giles,"Meanwhile, I think swimmer number three"
1008.57,1012.02,Giles,might benefit from your...
1012.05,1015.11,Giles,watchful eye and protection 
1012.05,1015.11,Giles,"discreetly, of course."
1015.13,1016.19,Buffy,I'm on it.
1016.19,1019.28,Xander,What about me? What can I do?
1019.38,1022.82,Cordelia,"Well, you could go out to the parking lot"
1019.38,1022.82,Cordelia,and practice running like a man.
1046.87,1049.72,Willow,"So, Jonathan."
1049.96,1053.49,Willow,You tried out for the swim team twice
1049.96,1053.49,Willow,and never made it?
1053.53,1056.95,Jonathon,I'm asthmatic. I couldn't keep up.
1056.99,1059.58,Willow,"You resented it, didn't you?"
1059.58,1060.14,Jonathon,Maybe.
1060.17,1063.93,Willow,You hated being pushed around
1060.17,1063.93,Willow,by Dodd and the others.
1063.97,1064.34,Jonathon,So?
1064.34,1068.68,Willow,"So, you wanted revenge, didn't you?"
1069.61,1071.75,Willow,Didn't you?
1073.08,1075.39,Jonathon,Yeah! OK? I did!
1077.18,1080.97,Willow,So... you delved into
1077.18,1080.97,Willow,the black arts...
1083.02,1086.04,Willow,and conjured up a hell beast from the
1083.02,1086.04,Willow,ocean's depths to wreak your vengeance.
1087.45,1089.38,Willow,Didn't you?
1089.38,1090.96,Jonathon,What? No!
1091.84,1094.05,Jonathon,I snuck in yesterday and...
1095.02,1096.7,Jonathon,peed in the pool.
1096.72,1098.24,Willow,Oh.
1098.24,1100.33,Willow,Eww!
1102.38,1104.9,Coach Marin,This is such a blow.
1104.92,1107.59,Coach Marin,"Sooner or later, the rest"
1104.92,1107.59,Coach Marin,of my boys are gonna find out.
1107.59,1109.21,Coach Marin,How can I ask them to swim?
1109.25,1112.07,Snyder,"It's a terrible, terrible tragedy."
1109.25,1112.07,Snyder,"We all feel your pain, Coach."
1112.1,1117.46,Snyder,I don't know two finer boys
1112.1,1117.46,Snyder,than Cameron and... that other one.
1117.49,1122.27,Snyder,But I know they'd want their friends
1117.49,1122.27,Snyder,to go on and win that state championship.
1122.31,1124.72,Snyder,It's time to think about the team.
1124.72,1126.89,Coach Marin,"Hell, I don't have"
1124.72,1126.89,Coach Marin,a complete team as it is.
1127.09,1129.85,Coach Marin,If we don't find someone
1127.09,1129.85,Coach Marin,"by this afternoon's tryouts,"
1129.91,1131.89,Coach Marin,we won't be eligible to compete.
1131.92,1133.83,Snyder,You'll find someone. All he has to do
1133.86,1136.46,Snyder,"is wear a bathing suit, right?"

1183.47,1188.02,Gage,This "me and my shadow" act?
1186.04,1189.43,Gage,It's getting old.
1186.04,1189.43,Gage,What do you want from me?
1190.2,1192.32,Buffy,"Well, um..."
1192.36,1195.06,Buffy,It's a little embarrassing.
1192.36,1195.06,Buffy,You see...
1195.09,1197.03,Buffy,I'm a swim groupie.
1197.03,1197.64,Gage,Uhhuh!
1197.72,1199.37,Buffy,Oh... yeah!
1199.4,1201.5,Buffy,"You know,"
1199.4,1201.5,Buffy,there's just something about the...
1201.52,1204.08,Buffy,"smell of chlorine on a guy. Oh, baby!"
1205.21,1207.12,Gage,OK! OK! OK!
1207.16,1209.44,Buffy,"Obviously, my... sex appeal"
1207.16,1209.44,Buffy,"is on the fritz today,"
1209.47,1211.89,Buffy,so I'll just give it to you straight.
1211.93,1217.02,Buffy,"There's something lurking out there,"
1211.93,1217.02,Buffy,"and it's making fillets of the populace,"
1215.03,1216.86,Buffy,and I think you might be next.
1216.89,1219.35,Gage,Uhhuh. And you think that because...?
1219.39,1222.48,Buffy,"Well, it's already attacked."
1219.39,1222.48,Buffy,It's already killed some people.
1222.52,1224.93,Gage,"You're one twisted sister,"
1222.52,1224.93,Gage,you know that?
1224.93,1230.38,Gage,Cam told me about your games.
1230.42,1232.93,Gage,Go find someone else to harass.
1235.87,1238.82,Gage,What a psycho bitch! Man!
1238.85,1241.77,Angelus,Gotta be talking about Buffy.
1243.07,1244.73,Gage,How'd you know?
1244.73,1246.5,Angelus,"Uh, she and I..."
1246.54,1249.67,Angelus,had this thing once.
1246.54,1249.67,Angelus,Biggest mistake of my life.
1249.71,1251.9,Gage,"Yeah, my condolences, dude."
1251.9,1253.93,Angelus,She's a real headtripper.
1253.97,1256.9,Gage,Tell me about it. Girl acts
1253.97,1256.9,Gage,like she's God's gift or something.
1256.94,1260.09,Angelus,Who is she? The Chosen One?
1260.09,1261.02,Gage,Exactly.
1259.04,1260.57,Angelus,"You know, what she really needs"
1259.04,1260.57,Angelus,is for someone
1260.59,1262.8,Angelus,to really knock her down
1260.59,1262.8,Angelus,off her notches.
1262.89,1265.91,Gage,"Yeah, that'd be sweet. Anyone in mind?"
1265.91,1267.98,Angelus,"You're in luck, my friend."
1268.38,1271.65,Angelus,"Just so happens, I'm recruiting."
1271.65,1271.96,Gage,No!
1273.41,1275.84,Gage,Ah! Somebody! Help!
1275.87,1279.43,Gage,Ah! Help! Ah! Ah!
1279.48,1281.1,Gage,Get him off me! Help!
1281.13,1283.48,Gage,Ah!
1291.42,1295.81,Angelus,"Why, Miss Summers! You're beautiful!"
1312.83,1315.48,Gage,Was that the thing that killed Cameron?
1315.51,1318.18,Buffy,No. That was something else.
1318.21,1320.29,Gage,Ssomething else?!
1321.08,1326.29,Buffy,"Yeah. Unfortunately, we have"
1321.08,1326.29,Buffy,a lot of something elses in this town.
1326.32,1328.83,Buffy,Good night.
1328.87,1330.62,Gage,Hey!
1333.83,1336.39,Gage,Walk me home?
1340.79,1343.7,Coach Marin,Swimmers! Take position!
1352.62,1355.28,Coach Marin,Keep the stroking up.
1352.62,1355.28,Coach Marin,"Alright. Keep it going,"
1355.28,1357.23,Coach Marin,keep it going all the way to the end.
1357.26,1359.18,Coach Marin,All the way to the end. Breathe deep.
1362.49,1366.65,Coach Marin,Gage! You with us or not?
1362.49,1366.65,Coach Marin,"Come on, let's go!"
1367.27,1368.83,Cordelia,So he spit it out?
1368.86,1370.6,Cordelia,I thought Angel liked blood.
1370.6,1371.29,Buffy,He used to.
1371.33,1373.17,Willow,Maybe his eyes
1371.33,1373.17,Willow,were too big for his stomach.
1373.58,1376.5,Buffy,Or maybe there was something
1373.58,1376.5,Buffy,in Gage's blood Angel didn't like.
1376.53,1379.1,Buffy,"Say, for example, steroids."
1379.14,1381.77,Willow,That would explain
1379.14,1381.77,Willow,all their behavioral changes.
1381.77,1383.39,Cordelia,And their winning streak.
1383.42,1385.19,Willow,So maybe whatever's in their blood
1385.21,1387.68,Willow,is what's attracting
1385.21,1387.68,Willow,this creature to them.
1387.72,1389.77,Buffy,Any luck researching our fish monster?
1389.77,1391.5,Cordelia,Zippo. We couldn't find any sea demon
1391.54,1394.17,Cordelia,that matched the description
1391.54,1394.17,Cordelia,that Xander gave us.
1394.2,1396.8,Cordelia,Not that Chicken Little's
1394.2,1396.8,Cordelia,"much of a witness, but..."
1397.19,1400.51,Cordelia,Oh!
1400.51,1402.8,Cordelia,"Oh! Oh, my!"
1402.83,1405.67,Cordelia,"Now that, girls, is my kind of..."
1407.38,1409.85,Willow,Xander?
1410.03,1412.02,Willow,Xander?!
1415.27,1417.23,Cordelia,What the hell are you doing here?
1418.66,1420.2,Xander,I'm undercover.
1420.2,1422.46,Buffy,You're not under much.
1422.49,1425.85,Cordelia,"Get out of here, before someone sees you"
1422.49,1425.85,Cordelia,impersonating a member of the swim team!
1425.85,1428.02,Xander,I don't do impersonations.
1425.85,1428.02,Xander,I tried out for the team last night.
1428.05,1428.95,Xander,I made it.
1428.95,1429.58,Cordelia,Really?
1429.58,1432.37,Xander,Yeah. I figured I can keep an eye
1429.58,1432.37,Xander,on Gage and the others when Buffy can't.
1432.58,1433.87,Willow,When you're nude?
1433.87,1435.68,Coach Marin,I meant to say changing.
1435.72,1438.78,Coach Marin,Harris! You can flirt on your own time.
1439.17,1441.59,Xander,"Okeydokey, coachie!"
1451.7,1454.62,Cordelia,I'm dating a swimmer
1451.7,1454.62,Cordelia,from the Sunnydale swim team!
1454.66,1456.86,Buffy,You can die happy.
1461.02,1461.35,Buffy,What about Jonathan? Is he involved?
1461.37,1464.84,Willow,"Oh, no. He just... sort of..."
1461.37,1464.84,Willow,peed in the pool.
1464.86,1466.55,Buffy,Oh.
1469.33,1471.82,Buffy,Oh!
1475.79,1478.18,Xander,"Don't you, guys,"
1475.79,1478.18,Xander,get claustrophobic in here?
1478.2,1479.85,Xander,"I mean, what's the deal?"
1479.88,1483.68,Xander,You perspire a lot. You can't breathe.
1484.16,1486.9,Xander,"Or read. I mean, I guess you could,"
1486.92,1489.46,Xander,but the pages would probably
1486.92,1489.46,Xander,get all wet.
1504.8,1506.64,Xander,You gotta love this undercover deal.
1506.66,1509.14,Xander,minutes in a hot room
1506.66,1509.14,Xander,with a bunch of sweaty guys...
1509.18,1509.84,Buffy,Where's Gage?
1509.84,1511.71,Xander,"I don't know. He was right behind me,"
1511.74,1514.24,Xander,putting his sneakers on.
1511.74,1514.24,Xander,"But it's not the Velcro kind,"
1514.27,1516.39,Xander,so give him a couple of extra minutes.
1516.42,1518.47,Xander,Tag. You're it.
1561.05,1563.11,Gage,"Oh, my God!"
1567.27,1571.28,Gage,Help! Help me! Help me!
1571.5,1573.71,Gage,Ah! Help me!
1580.45,1582.12,Buffy,Gage?
1644.11,1648.15,Nurse Greenleigh,I don't think that this
1644.11,1648.15,Nurse Greenleigh,"is going to need stitches,"
1648.18,1652.38,Nurse Greenleigh,but you might wanna have
1648.18,1652.38,Nurse Greenleigh,your family physician take a look at it.
1655.24,1656.16,Giles,How are you?
1656.16,1658.62,Buffy,I'm definitely feeling the burn.
1659.02,1660.99,Giles,"Well, the, uh, good news is that"
1660.99,1663.49,Giles,it would appear that
1660.99,1663.49,Giles,none of your team actually died.
1663.53,1666.43,Buffy,But the bad news is...
1663.53,1666.43,Buffy,they're monsters.
1666.47,1667.83,Coach Marin,How could this happen?
1667.83,1669.69,Giles,Are you saying you don't know?
1669.73,1672.82,Coach Marin,"Well, you work so hard,"
1669.73,1672.82,Coach Marin,you start to win suddenly.
1672.84,1675.03,Coach Marin,You think it's just you.
1675.06,1678.18,Coach Marin,You're inspiring the boys
1675.06,1678.18,Coach Marin,to greatness.
1678.21,1681.32,Coach Marin,But in the back of your mind...
1678.21,1681.32,Coach Marin,you start to wonder.
1681.35,1684.81,Giles,You never asked any of the boys
1681.35,1684.81,Giles,if they were taking anything?
1685.05,1688.14,Coach Marin,Maybe I was afraid to.
1691.81,1692.55,Buffy,There.
1692.55,1695.61,Willow,Dodd McAlvy: torn tendon.
1695.7,1699.27,Willow,"Gage Petronzi: fractured wrist,"
1695.7,1699.27,Willow,"depression, headaches."
1699.3,1700.89,Buffy,It's all there
1699.3,1700.89,Buffy,in the school medical records.
1700.89,1703.58,Willow,All symptomatic of steroid abuse.
1703.61,1706.61,Xander,But is steroid abuse usually
1703.61,1706.61,Xander,"linked with, 'hey, I'm a fish'?"
1706.65,1709.13,Willow,There must be something else
1706.65,1709.13,Willow,in the mix.
1709.13,1712.7,Willow,"But the point is, these boys"
1709.13,1712.7,Willow,were obviously drugged.
1712.73,1714.78,Buffy,Nurse Greenliegh
1712.73,1714.78,Buffy,treated every one of them.
1714.81,1716.31,Buffy,She must have known.
1716.34,1720.58,Willow,"If steroids are that dangerous,"
1716.34,1720.58,Willow,why would they do that to themselves?
1720.62,1722.14,Buffy,They needed to win.
1722.15,1725.82,Buffy,"Winning equals trophies,"
1722.15,1725.82,Buffy,which equals prestige for the school.
1725.86,1728.17,Buffy,You see how they're treated.
1725.86,1728.17,Buffy,It's been like that forever.
1728.19,1731.46,Xander,Sure. The discus throwers got the best
1728.19,1731.46,Xander,seats at all the crucifixions.
1731.5,1734.74,Buffy,"Meanwhile, I'm breaking my nails"
1731.5,1734.74,Buffy,"every day battling the forces of evil,"
1734.77,1736.97,Buffy,and my French teacher
1734.77,1736.97,Buffy,can't even remember my name.
1736.98,1739.11,Xander,"So, what's the drill?"
1736.98,1739.11,Xander,Get Nurse Greenliegh?
1739.15,1740.85,Willow,Let's throw the book at her!
1740.85,1743.67,Buffy,She probably went home for the day.
1740.85,1743.67,Buffy,I think it can wait.
1743.71,1746.36,Buffy,"Xander, why don't you see if you can"
1743.71,1746.36,Buffy,"find out what these boys are taking,"
1746.36,1748.65,Buffy,or at least how they're taking it?
1748.68,1750.09,Buffy,"Powders, pills, syringe?"
1750.09,1751.56,Xander,I'm "looking around guy".
1751.59,1752.39,Willow,What about you?
1752.39,1754.43,Buffy,Giles loaded up the tranquillizer gun.
1754.49,1756.89,Buffy,We're going fishing.
1827.63,1829.8,Xander,I feel good!
1830.07,1832.58,Xander,Lovin' the swimmin'.
1832.71,1836.81,Xander,Had some carrot juice this morning.
1832.71,1836.81,Xander,A little wheat germ mixed in with it.
1836.81,1839.88,Xander,Woke me right up.
1836.81,1839.88,Xander,"Nothing like it, huh?"
1839.9,1843.54,Xander,Breakfast of state champions. You betcha.
1845.53,1848.6,Xander,"OK. So, when do we get our next dose?"
1849.31,1851.03,Sean,What do you mean?
1851.03,1852.55,Xander,Who's carrying?
1853.2,1855.36,Xander,I need a little something
1853.2,1855.36,Xander,to improve my performance.
1855.39,1857.83,Xander,Give me an edge. Rrr!
1860.14,1863.95,Xander,The steroids. Where are they?
1865.41,1868.79,Sean,"You're soakin' in it, bud."
1868.79,1869.31,Xander,Huh?
1871.72,1876.15,Sean,Aromatherapy. It's in the steam.
1877.23,1880.95,Nurse Greenleigh,"This has got to stop, Carl."
1877.23,1880.95,Nurse Greenleigh,Those poor children!
1880.98,1883.71,Coach Marin,"What, are you a quitter? We have"
1880.98,1883.71,Coach Marin,no room for quitters on this team.
1883.74,1885.57,Nurse Greenleigh,Do you even understand
1883.74,1885.57,Nurse Greenleigh,what's happening?
1885.59,1886.54,Nurse Greenleigh,Listen to yourself.
1886.54,1888.23,Coach Marin,I'm very close to perfecting this.
1888.27,1890.2,Coach Marin,We just need to adjust the mix.
1890.23,1895.5,Nurse Greenleigh,Carl. You can't be thinking
1890.23,1895.5,Nurse Greenleigh,of continuing to expose these boys.
1895.7,1899.58,Coach Marin,They're gonna be the best.
1895.7,1899.58,Coach Marin,I don't accept anything less.
1899.66,1901.59,Nurse Greenleigh,They're gonna be monsters.
1901.63,1906.06,Nurse Greenleigh,"Carl, please. Don't make it any worse."
1901.63,1906.06,Nurse Greenleigh,You've already lost three.
1906.11,1908.71,Coach Marin,"Lost? Why, they're not lost."
1915.5,1917.46,Nurse Greenleigh,Carl! What are you doing?!
1917.46,1919.8,Coach Marin,I'm just looking after my boys.
1922.02,1924.72,Coach Marin,"They may be out of the game right now,"
1922.02,1924.72,Coach Marin,but they're still a team.
1925.63,1929.12,Coach Marin,And a team's gotta eat.
1932.29,1933.35,Nurse Greenleigh,Carl!
1933.35,1935.9,Coach Marin,You quitter.
1969.54,1972.85,Giles,They're absorbing the steroid mixture
1969.54,1972.85,Giles,through the steam.
1972.89,1976.27,Xander,Not they. We!
1976.37,1978.07,Xander,Me!
1978.64,1981.07,Xander,"We need to find an antidote,"
1978.64,1981.07,Xander,don't you think?
1981.1,1982.83,Xander,"The clock is ticking, people!"
1982.87,1985.04,Buffy,I wouldn't break out
1982.87,1985.04,Buffy,the tartar sauce just yet.
1985.15,1988.23,Buffy,It's not like you were exposed
1985.15,1988.23,Buffy,more than once.
1989.21,1993.29,Xander,Twice?
1989.21,1993.29,Xander,Three times a fish guy.
1993.32,1993.92,Buffy and Willow,Oh.
1993.92,1994.93,Cordelia,Whoa.
1994.97,1996.97,Xander,What am I gonna do?
1996.97,1998.45,Cordelia,"You, you, you!"
1998.49,2001.91,Cordelia,What about me? It's one thing
1998.49,2001.91,Cordelia,"to be dating the lame unpopular guy,"
2001.95,2003.38,Cordelia,but it's another to be dating
2003.38,2005.05,Xander,the creature from the Blue Lagoon.
2005.09,2008.16,Xander,Black Lagoon. The creature from
2005.09,2008.16,Xander,the Blue Lagoon was Brooke Shields.
2008.19,2013.02,Xander,And thank you so much
2008.19,2013.02,Xander,for your support!
2012.62,2015.65,Buffy,I think we'd better find the rest
2012.62,2015.65,Buffy,of the swim team and lock them up
2015.68,2018.08,Buffy,before they get in touch
2015.68,2018.08,Buffy,with their inner halibut.
2018.11,2020.48,Giles,"Yes. Yes, good. Uh..."
2020.51,2024.11,Giles,We also need to know exactly
2020.51,2024.11,Giles,"what's in this, this steroid gas,"
2024.14,2027.7,Giles,so that the hospital's toxicology lab
2024.14,2027.7,Giles,can develop an antidote.
2027.74,2029.7,Willow,"Well, I'll talk to Nurse Greenliegh."
2029.72,2032.17,Buffy,You're really getting into
2029.72,2032.17,Buffy,this interrogation thing.
2032.21,2035.68,Willow,The trick is not to leave any marks.
2035.72,2039.7,Buffy,"On that note, I think I'm gonna go"
2035.72,2039.7,Buffy,have a little talk with our coach.
2039.74,2045.66,Buffy,"Somehow, I doubt all he's been"
2039.74,2045.66,Buffy,giving these boys is inspiration.
2046.76,2049.29,Coach Marin,"You got some imagination, missy."
2049.31,2051.32,Buffy,"Oh, well right now,"
2049.31,2051.32,Buffy,I'm imagining you in jail.
2051.36,2054.69,Buffy,"You're wearing a big, orange suit, and,"
2051.36,2054.69,Buffy,"oh, look, the guards are beating you up."
2054.72,2056.01,Coach Marin,You don't have any proof.
2056.01,2057.45,Buffy,Tell me what's in the steam.
2063.86,2066.47,Coach Marin,"After the fall of the Soviet Union,"
2066.51,2068.96,Coach Marin,documents came into light
2069.08,2073.47,Coach Marin,detailing experiments with fish DNA
2069.08,2073.47,Coach Marin,on their Olympic swimmers.
2073.55,2075.72,Coach Marin,Tarpon... mako shark...
2075.76,2077.89,Coach Marin,But they couldn't crack it.
2077.89,2078.99,Buffy,And you did...
2079.03,2080.64,Buffy,Sort of.
2080.87,2082.86,Buffy,Why?
2083.62,2085.76,Coach Marin,What kind of question is that?
2085.78,2087.7,Coach Marin,For the win!
2087.8,2090.52,Coach Marin,To make my team the best they could be!
2090.56,2094.61,Coach Marin,Do you understand we have a shot
2090.56,2094.61,Coach Marin,at the state championship?
2094.65,2097.07,Buffy,Do you understand that I don't care?
2094.65,2097.07,Buffy,It's over!
2097.1,2098.7,Buffy,There's not gonna be any swim team.
2098.79,2101.37,Coach Marin,"Boy, when they were"
2098.79,2101.37,Coach Marin,"handing out school spirit,"
2101.39,2103.39,Coach Marin,"you didn't even stand in line,"
2101.39,2103.39,Coach Marin,did you?
2103.49,2107.41,Buffy,No. I was in the line
2103.49,2107.41,Buffy,for shred of sanity.
2110.36,2113.21,Buffy,Which you obviously skipped.
2113.25,2115.05,Coach Marin,Get in the hole!
2115.92,2118.55,Coach Marin,In! Now!
2122.22,2125.07,Buffy,This isn't over.
2125.07,2125.6,Coach Marin,In!
2131.3,2134.08,Coach Marin,You think I don't care about my boys.
2134.1,2136.97,Coach Marin,But I do. They count on me.
2145.18,2147.69,Buffy,"So, what, you're just"
2145.18,2147.69,Buffy,gonna feed me to 'em?
2147.73,2150.09,Coach Marin,"Oh, they've already had their dinner."
2150.13,2153.06,Coach Marin,But boys have other needs.
2154.27,2158.36,Cordelia,No one. Willow and Giles
2154.27,2158.36,Cordelia,must've rounded up the swim team.
2158.37,2159.85,Xander,Does my neck look scaly to you?
2159.85,2161.33,Cordelia,"Well, of course it looks scaly,"
2161.37,2163.32,Cordelia,the way you've been rubbing it dry
2161.37,2163.32,Cordelia,like an idiot!
2163.34,2165.43,Xander,I need to look in a mirror. Wait here.
2165.5,2168.17,Xander,But feel free to come in
2165.5,2168.17,Xander,if you hear me scream.
2181.87,2184.18,Cordelia,Any gills yet?
2184.71,2188.34,Cordelia,"Xander, what are you doing? Xander?"
2188.87,2191.37,Cordelia,"Oh, my God! Xander!"
2193.12,2194.96,Cordelia,It's me  Cordelia.
2195.23,2197.66,Cordelia,"I know you can't answer me, but..."
2197.74,2200.33,Cordelia,"God, this is all my fault."
2200.37,2203.25,Cordelia,You joined the swim team
2200.37,2203.25,Cordelia,to impress me.
2203.95,2206.13,Cordelia,You were so courageous.
2206.15,2209.33,Cordelia,And you looked really hot
2206.15,2209.33,Cordelia,in those Speedos.
2209.93,2211.83,Cordelia,And I want you to know that...
2211.86,2217.02,Cordelia,"I still care about you,"
2211.86,2217.02,Cordelia,no matter what you look like.
2215.31,2218.71,Cordelia,And... and we can still date!
2219.36,2221.13,Cordelia,"Or, or not. I mean..."
2221.16,2224.92,Cordelia,I understand
2221.16,2224.92,Cordelia,if you wanna see other fish.
2225.41,2229.1,Cordelia,I'll do everything I can
2225.41,2229.1,Cordelia,to make your quality of life better.
2229.14,2232.08,Cordelia,Whether that means
2229.14,2232.08,Cordelia,little bath toys or whatever.
2232.12,2235.44,Xander,"Uh, Cordy? That's not me."
2236.87,2239.3,Cordelia,"Oh, my God!"
2239.49,2241.67,Giles,In you go.
2243.91,2248.02,Giles,"Stay calm, chaps."
2246.36,2249.91,Giles,Either we'll find
2246.36,2249.91,Giles,"an effective antidote, or, or, uh..."
2250.88,2254.11,Giles,Just stay calm.
2254.27,2256.58,Willow,Everyone's accounted for except Sean.
2256.61,2258.87,Cordelia,I think we can safely say
2256.61,2258.87,Cordelia,we found Sean.
2258.9,2261.18,Cordelia,He was in the pool skinlessdipping.
2262.05,2263.48,Xander,Where's Buffy?
2263.48,2266.03,Willow,She hasn't come back yet.
2274.8,2278.41,Buffy,Great. This is just
2274.8,2278.41,Buffy,what my reputation needs:
2278.43,2282.23,Buffy,that I did it
2278.43,2282.23,Buffy,with the entire swim team.
2305.03,2306.86,Xander,"What's up, Coach?"
2306.86,2308.68,Coach Marin,"Oh, Harris. Uh..."
2309.48,2310.52,Coach Marin,How you feeling?
2310.52,2311.37,Xander,A little dry.
2311.41,2314.04,Xander,Nothing a lemon butter sauce
2311.41,2314.04,Xander,won't cure.
2316.21,2318.95,Xander,Where's Buffy?
2362.14,2364.16,Xander,"Buffy, hurry! Your hand!"
2368.97,2370.66,Xander,Hold on!
2381.02,2381.24,Buffy,Pull!
2381.24,2381.59,Xander,Hold on!
2398.87,2399.46,Buffy,Thanks.
2399.46,2402.16,Xander,Just doing my part for our team.
2407.75,2412.1,Coach Marin,Don't let go! Don't let go of me!
2407.75,2412.1,Coach Marin,Hold me!
2412.13,2414.36,Buffy,Hold me! Ah!
2420.25,2422.08,Buffy,Grab my hand!
2422.14,2426.43,Coach Marin,"Boys... Boys, uh, now... Now, boys..."
2426.47,2429.28,Coach Marin,"No. I... No, boys!"
2437.06,2440.71,Buffy,Those boys really love their coach.
2442.49,2445.52,Xander,Let's see. I gotta take
2442.49,2445.52,Xander,a makeup chem test at three.
2445.55,2449.18,Xander,And then I'm meeting some of the guys
2445.55,2449.18,Xander,for plasma transfusions at five.
2449.22,2451.38,Xander,It's turned into quite the busy afternoon.
2451.47,2453.39,Buffy,"The fun never stops with you,"
2451.47,2453.39,Buffy,does it?
2453.47,2456.64,Willow,Giles seems pretty confident
2453.47,2456.64,Willow,that the treatments are gonna work.
2456.78,2458.59,Xander,"Well, turning into"
2456.78,2458.59,Xander,a creepycrawly wasn't on
2458.62,2461.79,Xander,my top ten list of things to do
2458.62,2461.79,Xander,before I turn 20.
2461.98,2465.23,Cordelia,I want you to know that
2461.98,2465.23,Cordelia,you've really proven yourself to me.
2465.58,2468.86,Cordelia,And you don't have to join the
2465.58,2468.86,Cordelia,new team next year if you don't want.
2468.89,2471.59,Cordelia,I'd be just as happy
2468.89,2471.59,Cordelia,if you played football.
2475.14,2478.37,Giles,The... people from Animal Control
2475.14,2478.37,Giles,have just left.
2478.4,2482.06,Giles,Our creatures have
2478.4,2482.06,Giles,"apparently made a, a dash for it. Um..."
2482.08,2483.61,Giles,So to speak.
2483.65,2485.67,Willow,Does that mean
2483.65,2485.67,Willow,we're gonna have to hunt them again?
2485.73,2489.47,Buffy,"No, I don't think so. I don't think"
2485.73,2489.47,Buffy,we'll be seeing them any more.
2489.5,2492.31,Giles,Where do you think they'll go?
2492.31,2492.78,,Home.
